gov cecil andrus on tuesday signed into law 
a compromise bill making idaho the nations 47th state with an 
official holiday honoring civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
the law establishes martin luther king jridaho human rights 
day on the third monday in january corresponding with the federal 
holiday first observed in 1986 
idahos action leaves arizona montana and new hampshire the 
only holdouts not recognizing the federal holiday for king who was 
assassinated on april 4 1968 at the age of 39 
this historic legislation firmly demonstrates that idahoans 
have that broader concern for all humanity andrus said at a 
statehouse ceremony we stand against racism and for 
brotherhood 
kings widow coretta scott king issued a statement from 
atlanta commending andrus and the idaho legislature 
governor andrus has provided courageous leadeship in securing 
enactment of the holiday bill as well as some of the strongest 
antibias legislation in the nation mrs king said 
idahos 10th state holiday was approved by the legislature last 
month after lengthy sometimes bitter debate 
opponents focused on the cost of another paid day off for state 
employees which some put as high as 26 million and whether king 
should be singled out for the honor 
supporters cited the impact of kings nonviolent philosophy and 
his symbolic importance they also said the action was needed to 
help eliminate idahos stigma as a haven for racists such as the 
panhandlebased aryan nations critics dismissed that problem as 
exaggerated and the fault of irresponsible media coverage 
it took the addition of idaho human rights day to win over 
enough lawmakers for passage of the bill in the sessions closing 
hours 
idahos black population is estimated at 3200 or just over 
threetenths of 1 percent of the states approximately 1 million 
people 
new hampshire legislators have consistently voted down holiday 
proposals since 1979 after losing in 1989 supporters said they 
would try again in 1991 the next time legislative rules allow it 
lawmakers in montana with an even smaller black population than 
idaho made jan 15 a day of observance in 1987 and created 
heritage day a floating holiday to be designated by the governor 
the legislature in arizona the most populous state without an 
official king holiday approved a paid holiday for state employees 
last year but opponents petitioned to prevent the law from taking 
effect unless it is approved in a november referendum 
besides states without a king day north dakotas holiday is 
unpaid louisianas is by proclamation rather than legislation and 
is jan 19 marylands is on jan 15 whether or not that is a 
weekday and some states give employees other holiday options to 
substitute 
the legislative victory for idaho supporters of a king holiday 
was overshadowed somewhat by its timing while the bill was being 
adopted idaho also was embroiled in a national controversy over 
legislation that would have created the nations most restrictive 
antiabortion law 
andrus vetoed that measure only minutes after the legislature 
adjourned for the year march 30 then waited more than a week to 
make the king holiday bill law to ensure it would have center stage 
to itself

charles chick trainor has what he thinks 
is the ideal job for an alaskan in the age of glasnost 
since february when he became the nations northernmost 
immigration and naturalization service officer trainor has enjoyed 
what he sees as his dual role of federal agent and oneman welcome 
wagon for soviets coming to alaska 
my intention out there at the airport is to let them know 
were happy to have them here none of this let me see your 
papers trainor said 
with cultural educational and scientific exchanges between 
alaska and the soviet far east burgeoning in the last year nome 
has become a principal contact point for citizens of both countries 
whenever a plane load of soviet young pioneers roughly 
equivalent to boy scouts artists educators or others visit nome 
its trainors job to examine their papers and stamp their 
passports he also occasionally goes to nearby wales on the western 
tip of seward peninsula or to barrow about 550 miles to the north 
on the arctic ocean 
although trainor works for the ins his duties also include 
those of a customs inspector he must watch for the illegal 
importation of whale ivory animal furs and soviet reindeer or any 
other meat products possibly carrying diseases 
the 45yearold former marine has a background different from 
that of most federal agents 
since coming to alaska in 1966 he has owned a saloon scratched 
for gold driven a truck run a local housing agency and worked on 
the transalaska pipeline he also has been a guard at a local 
mental hospital 
flights between nome and the soviet far east are strictly 
charter so trainor drives over to the nome airport only when 
summoned most of the calls come from jim rowe whose bering air 
service has pioneered flights between northwest alaska and the 
soviet far east 
soviets who visit nome a community of 3600 with boomtown 
roots dating to turnofthecentury goldrush days arrive 
wideeyed and often gawk at the stacks of consumer goods in local 
stores trainor said 
they think we stock the shelves just to impress them he 
said many return home carrying computers stereos and other items 
hard to find in the soviet union especially in the far east some 
stores in nome accept rubles as a goodwill gesture although the 
soviet currency is virtually worthless on the world market 
trainor thinks ussoviet exchanges will help break down 
barriers to international understanding 
i see no reason why we should be fighting them he said 
we dont even know them 
one barrier between trainor and visiting soviets is created 
however by the ins uniform he wears 
they are extremely suspicious of me because im a police 
official and i guess over there they dont hobnob with police 
officials said trainor whos studying russian to help break 
down the barriers 
whatever happens with superpower relations between moscow and 
washington trainor and others in this coastal community think 
peopletopeople contact between nome and the soviet far east will 
have some lasting effects 
theyve had a taste of it now trainor said they like 
this town

a small plane plunged nosefirst into a 
freshly plowed field during heavy rain tuesday sinking so deep in 
mud and water that neither the wreckage nor its occupants could be 
found authorities said 
it hit and didnt bounce jump or anything dr wesley dyer 
the rapides parish coroner said after walking from the muddy field 
where the wreckage was found i think a thunderhead twisted it up 
and spit out the pieces 
the crash happened sometime tuesday afternoon and the plane 
could seat four people but authorities still hadnt found any 
bodies by tuesday night because the plane was so deeply submerged 
in the waterfilled hole 
small pieces of the plane were visible over about a 100yard 
area in the field located between us 71 and a rural road just 
northwest of this small central louisiana community 
firemen city police and parish sheriffs deputies were still 
trying tuesday night to drain the hole containing the plane so the 
wreckage could be pulled out 
authorities said it probably would be morning before they would 
learn whether anyone had been killed 
dyer said a small piece of wing with a serial number on it was 
found in the field and the number was given to the federal aviation 
administration for tracing

pledging there will be no turning back 
from parliamentary democracy king hussein is entrusting a 
committee with drafting guidelines for legalizing political parties 
outlawed 33 years ago 
hussein gathered the 60 members of the national charter 
committee on tuesday and pleaded on television for a pact that will 
guarantee tolerance for conflicting viewpoints 
the new phase with we are about to begin will pave the way for 
the resumption of political pluralism which is another cornerstone 
of democracy the 54yearold king said 
the constitutional parliamentary life is our common choice 
and the path from which there will be no turning back 
his speech had historic importance for this country of 31 
million people 
in november hussein oversaw jordans first national election 
since 1967 one of the freest ever held in the arab world 
he said the charter would form a broad and flexible framework 
for national action and would regulate the states various 
activities in politics economy security social affairs and 
culture 
he cautioned that without good will and agreement on basic 
concepts democracy turns into anarchy and develops fangs and 
talons that tear at the fabric of national unity and destroy the 
achievements and gains of the state 
hussein who has ruled since 1953 is relinquishing many powers 
but retains firm control and is personally popular 
the king said his july 1988 decision to renounce claims to the 
israelioccupied west bank in favor of the palestine liberation 
organization led to last novembers parliamentary election 
the west bank captured in the 1967 middle east war held half 
the seats in jordans old parliament it is not represented in the 
new body 
hussein said four days of widespread rioting over economic 
problems and government policies one year ago led him to seek the 
national charter 
he said the riots showed that elections alone would be an 
insufficient remedy because jordanians held varying convictions 
on some of the fundamental tenets and precepts upon which the 
kingdom is founded 
the king banned political parties in 1957 following an 
unsuccessful leftist coup attempt 
a nonparty parliament continued intermittently until 1974 
after a 10year hiatus it was revived in 1984 despite the lack of 
elections since 1967 
anyone who thinks that i was comfortable with the situation 
which prevailed in the absence of an elected parliament or that i 
was happy bearing most of the burden of government is 
mistaken said hussein 
he said the parties of the 1950s when panarab forces tried to 
spread their influence across national borders were governed by 
the positions and dictates of their leaders from abroad 
he accused them of seeking power at the expense of democracy 
and of violating another tenet of political pluralism which is 
to refrain from violence 
the king repeated that jordans commitment to help the 
palestinian people and their just cause is a historic and fateful 
part of its national commitment 
jordan will continue to exert all available resources to 
support the struggle of the palestinian people under its national 
leadership represented by the palestine liberation organization 
roughly half of jordans people come from palestinian families 
who fled or were driven from their homes by israels creation or 
its capture of the west bank

president bush said tuesday theres an awful 
lot to be done before next months superpower summit he added 
that he doesnt want to suggest that complete agreement is possible 
in advance on a new arms control treaty 
bush on a brief visit to canada also issued a fresh warning to 
mikhail gorbachev to refrain from using force in the breakaway 
republic of lithuania but he coupled his words with praise for the 
soviet presidents commitment to peaceful change and the 
evolution of democracy in europe and the soviet union 
bush said the presence of soviet tanks in lithuania make it 
even more important to have goodfaith negotiations over the 
fate of the republic 
i would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence 
to encourage dialogue and discussion he said 
bush and gorbachev are scheduled to meet in the united states 
beginning may 30 
bush also said he didnt know enough about the release of three 
european hostages in beirut earlier in the day to say whether 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi deserved any of the credit for their 
release 
if indeed a person deserves credit for facilitating the 
release of people held against their will i would say fine 
give the person credit he said 
as for gadhafi bush said weve got some major differences 
with libya that continue to exist but look who am i to argue in 
this case if someone can help free one hostage give that 
person credit 
bush spoke first with reporters aboard air force one en route 
from washington he and brian mulroney the canadian prime 
minister fielded reporters questions after their private meeting 
on the upcoming summit and other topics and before attending a 
baseball game between the toronto blue jays and the texas rangers 
in torontos domed stadium 
bush flew back to washington later in the evening 
before the game bush said he was looking forward to throwing 
out the first ball 
im going to go with a slider this time he said ive had 
such good luck in the last couple of years the catcher let me down 
one time when he couldnt get into the dirt and grab it properly 
for his part the canadian leader said he looked forward to 
negotiations with the united states on an acid rain treaty with 
the talks to begin after congress approves clean air legislation 
both leaders said they were hoping gorbachev would avoid the use 
of force in lithuania and bush renewed his earlier statements that 
the future of superpower relations could be affected by what the 
soviets do in their attempt to deal with the secession crisis at 
home 
he said the united states hopes they will conduct themselves 
in a way that can move the dramatic progress thats taken place in 
the last year or so even further forward 
asked whether he was basing his foreign policy on the fate of a 
single man bush said that wasnt the case he then added in 
this case mr gorbachev the president has a record of encouraging 
or certainly acquiescing in the peaceful evolution in eastern 
europe he has demonstrated that he is committed to peaceful 
change and the evolution of democracy 
mulroney said he agreed with bush that gorbachev represents a 
new kind of soviet leader more attractive and more realistic 
and appears to be much more in keeping with some if not all of 
the values that we in the west defend 
he said the soviet leader had displayed reasonableness that we 
had not come to know in earlier soviet leaders 
earlier on his plane bush said there was an awful lot to be 
done on arms control in advance of his meeting with gorbachev 
and said i cant predict how much will be done by the time the 
summit rolls around 
he said it was a good thing to have a date set and obviously 
this will serve as a bit of a catalyst or goal for getting things 
done 
he said he didnt want to suggest were going to have all the 
details worked out by the time of the summit 
you deal with whats on the table bush said 
the superpowers are negotiating agreements on longrange nuclear 
weapons chemical arms and troop and tank levels in europe 
bush said combining the baseball game between the toronto blue 
jays and the texas rangers with the mulroney meeting just seemed 
like a wonderful way to do it the presidents son george walker 
bush is part owner of the rangers 
the meeting with mulroney is the first in a series of talks bush 
plans this month with western leaders before the summit in 
washington 
bush will fly to bermuda on friday to meet with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and will hold talks with french 
president francois mitterrand in key largo fla on april 19 
the president enjoys a strong friendship with mulroney the 
prime minister and his family were guests last year at the bush 
seaside vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
canadian ambassador derek h burney said monday that canada was 
in a unique position these days in washington in terms of 
access and influence 
the fact that we are able to get attention to canadian 
concerns when we want to speaks well for continued economic 
growth in canada as well as providing us with an opportunity of 
influence in helping address some of the more pressing 
international issues burney said

sculptor jim gary looks at the rusting oil pan 
from a junked automobile and he sees the gaping jaw of a dinosaur 
under his welding torch the metallic bones and joints of 
extinct automotive behemoths from detroit are reincarnated as 
garys artistic vision of the prehistoric giants that crawled from 
the ooze to roam our planet millions of years ago 
gary a selftaught sculptor from farmingdale nj has built 
more than 200 of his 20th century dinosaurs from the brake 
shoes universal joints leaf springs drive shafts hoods front 
ends and other parts of scrapped cars and trucks 
some of his larger creatures he says required more than 500 
parts from as many as a dozen automobiles and took a year to 
complete he prefers the parts from older cars dating back to 
1960 because they have more character 
one of his biggest dinosaurs the 57footlong diplodocus 
contains more than 5000 worth of junk parts 
the plates along the arched back of the evillooking stegosaurus 
were a challenge gary finally took them from the inner walls of a 
wrecked garbage compactor 
eighteen of garys skeletal dinosaur sculptures in rich yellows 
greens purples and blues or natural rust plus four brightly 
colored dragon flies are making their washington debut thursday at 
the smithsonian institutions national museum of natural history 
the works will be on display through aug 10 as part of a new 
museum show titled dinamations dinosaurs alive and in color 
which features a collection of computercontrolled robotic 
dinosaurs that roar and squeal rip meat from carcasses tend their 
offspring and crane their necks toward spectators 
the main show now touring the united states was created by 
dinamation international corp of california and will be on view at 
the museum through sept 3 for an admission fee of 4 for adults 
and 2 for children garys exhibit will be free 
his dinosaurs have toured museums in the united states japan 
and australia since 1979 they have been pictured in school 
textbooks magazines and an encyclopedia and made an appearance in 
the george lucas movie howard the duck 
gary learned about cars as a kid growing up in colts neck nj 
where he picked up enough junkyard parts to build and license two 
homemade jalopies years later as a sculptor searching for unusual 
art supplies he returned to his old childhood haunts 
when i saw those heaps of junked cars he said it 
reminded me of an elephant graveyard just as elephants went to the 
graveyard to die those old cars went to the junkyard to die 
gary saw a parallel between old cars and dinosaurs the 
chromefinned gas guzzlers and the prehistoric plant eaters both 
died out and were replaced by smaller more fuelefficient species 
the car really is an animal it has its own metabolism and 
needs fuel air and water to exist he said to survive it had 
to change just like the dinosaurs the evolution of the two is 
obvious 
gary envisions the junkyard as a burial ground for the discarded 
artifacts of 20th century technology where future scientists might 
study the remains of scrapped cars just as paleontologists examine 
fossils for clues about how dinosaurs lived and died 
its not my intention to suggest that the auto industry is 
going the way of the dinosaur gary said hastily im just 
doing my work as a sculptor

union officials accused by greyhound officials 
of organizing strike violence contend a 30 million civil suit 
filed by the company is merely an excuse not to return to the 
bargaining table 
we have consistently asked this company to present its 
evidence we know that there is no evidence theyve simply pointed 
the finger of blame at employees and used the issue as a smoke 
screen for not resuming negotiations union spokesman nick 
nichols said monday after greyhound filed suit in us district 
court in jacksonville fla 
the suit claimed that unlawful actions by the amalgamated 
transit union and 20 union officers have cost the company at least 
10 million it accused the union of violating provisions of the 
federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act which 
allows triple damages to be assessed 
nichols noted that no government agency has filed criminal 
charges against union officers anyone can hire a lawyer and 
submit some documents to the court he said 
the strike called on march 2 has been marked by shootings 
bomb threats and other incidents the company has said it wont 
resume negotiations until a week goes by without an act of violence 
greyhound vice president anthony p lannie who announced the 
suit in washington maintained that several specific offenses 
showed a pattern of racketeering activity including extortion 
attempted murder obstruction of justice interference with 
interstate commerce and arson 
he charged that through violent activities union officials 
were attempting to win an inflated financial settlement they 
could never achieve through lawful collective bargaining there is 
a word for that extortion 
union officers allegedly assigned rankandfile members violent 
tasks and then paid them from the unions strike defense fund the 
suit contended 
thats false and ridiculous said fred ingram president of 
atu local 1493 in charlotte nc and one of two local presidents 
the company has asked the court to replace with a receiver we 
have never ordered anybody to do anything i dont know where 
thats coming from 
strikers are paid 50 a week in strike benefits for manning 
picket lines he said 
ingram contended that the company filed the lawsuit to divert 
attention from its refusal to resume contract negotiations their 
whole plan from the beginning has been to get rid of the union 
he said 
last month a replacement driver in fayetteville nc swore an 
assault charge against ingram following a picket line altercation 
besides ingram the suit seeks to have rafael rivera president 
of local 1600 in atlanta removed from office 
about 6300 greyhound drivers and 3000 maintenance and other 
workers walked out over wages and job security greyhound the 
nations only nationwide bus system has been operating on a 
reduced schedule with replacement drivers it hired and union 
members who crossed the picket line

dragged a patrol car 33 feet and smashed into the police guard 
house when officers tried to stop the attack

several cars by repeatedly ramming into the building police said 
authorities often station police officers outside gang offices 
when violence is expected to protect the neighborhood and hopefully 
prevent confrontations 
one policeman was stabbed when he stopped one of several people 
who came out of the takenakagumi office and tried to attack 
okamoto who was protected by the backhoes bulletproof cab the 
official said 
okamoto and the man who stabbed the officer were both arrested

reduced to about 20 members 
police estimate japan has 90000 mob members nearly half 
associated with the three largest gangs the yamaguchigumi and 
the tokyobased inagawakai and sumiyoshi rengo

some lawmakers are readying legislation to 
halt all us aid to iraq as tensions mount over a series of 
incidents including a threat by president saddam hussein to use 
chemical weapons against israel 
we should be ashamed of the us trading relationship with 
iraq said rep howard berman dcalif 
berman has drafted proposed sanctions that would end all us 
assistance to iraq including agricultural credits and investment 
guarantees under the exportimport bank 
several others in congress including sens william cohen 
rmaine and john mccain rariz said they support some kind of 
sanctions against the baghdad government 
i think we ought to take action cohen said recently adding 
it was not an acceptable situation for the united states to be 
doing business with a country seeking to add nuclear weapons to an 
arsenal that already includes chemical weapons 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said he will push for legislation to impose 
sanctions against any nation that uses chemical weapons illegally 
but not everyone in congress favors immediate sanctions 
sen arlen specter rpa said it would be premature to do 
anything without first talking with hussein specter who visited 
iraq in january with sen richard shelby dala urged hussein to 
exercise restraint 
we believe discussions and negotiations can go far to resolve 
current tensions specter and shelby said in a letter to hussein 
the outrage among some in congress comes amid growing tension 
over iraqs actions hussein has been criticized for threatening to 
use chemical weapons against israel and for executing an 
iranianborn british journalist accused of spying 
last month us and british intelligence agents broke up an 
iraqi smuggling ring allegedly trying to obtain nuclear triggers 
for atomic weapons iraq denied the charge 
on monday iraq expelled an american diplomat in retaliation for 
the expulsion of an iraqi diplomat posted at the united nations 
the state department said the iraqi was suspected of being involved 
in a plot to kill two political opponents 
margaret tutwiler the department spokeswoman said iraqs 
decision to expel the american was totally inappropriate 
the sour climate prompted the commerce department to cancel the 
iraqi leg of a trade mission scheduled to visit iraq saudi arabia 
and egypt in may 
we thought it was inappropriate to take a group of us 
companies to iraq at this time said elizabeth dugan a commerce 
department spokeswoman 
nine aerospace companies signed up to travel to the mideast on a 
mission to help us companies enhance their market position 
overseas and gain market exposure the department said 
iraq has ambitious plans for upgrading its civil aviation 
system including new airports air traffic control and related 
equipment the statement said 
berman has criticized the bush and reagan administrations for 
allegedly having a soft spot for iraq ms tutwiler said us 
relations with iraq have been complex and sometimes disturbing 
since the restoration of diplomatic ties in 1985 
berman said iraq has received about 1 billion a year in 
agricultural credits from the united states since 1984 
the united states imported about 15 billion worth of goods 
mainly oil from iraq in 1988 the commerce department said it 
exported about 11 billion in goods to iraq mostly agriculture 
products

telecommunications industry analysts say mcis 
merger with telecom usa inc will give the nations secondlargest 
longdistance company a chance for greater inroads into a market 
still dominated by american telephone amp telegraph co 
that could mean good news for consumers they say and even atampt 
is saying it hopes to benefit from the tougher competition 
mci communications corp and telecom usa the fourth largest 
company in the long distance market said monday that mci would 
acquire all outstanding shares of telecom usas stock for 42 a 
share for a total price of 125 billion 
the transaction is subject to approval by telecoms 
stockholders the federal communications commission also would have 
to grant approval and the justice department would review whether 
the deal would violate antitrust laws 
its a strategically important move bert c roberts jr 
mcis president and chief operating officer said in an interview 
it immediately brings us additional market share of about 1 
percent and against atampt as dominant a competitor as they are 
that efficiency is very important 
industry analysts agreed the acquisition should give mci a 
strong boost despite the cost because of telecoms active moves 
in advanced technology 
this shows the industry is consolidating at a very fast pace 
atampt is a very aggressive competitor and you have to move rapidly 
to grow this gives mci a further boost said charles nichols a 
telecommunications industry analyst for prudentialbache securities 
nichols and other analysts played down the stock market reaction 
to the mondays announcement which sent telecom usa soaring 1625 
to 3812 a share trading on the new york stock exchange mci 
dipped 112 to 3575 a share on the overthecounter market 
we think this puts mci and telecom in a favorable position 
said cathy clarke senior analyst for the yankee group a 
bostonbased consulting and marketing firm 
mci is growing and this will increase their potential to 
gain more of the market and provide more services she said 
the cost will have no effect on our ability to fund growth 
said roberts were in a very cashstrong position youre going 
to see that debt paid off very quickly within a couple of years 
mci revenues increased more than 20 percent in 1989 to 65 
billion while telecom had revenues of 713 million in sales last 
year atlantabased telecom was formed in 1988 with the merger of 
southernet of atlanta and teleconnect of cedar rapids iowa and 
serves customers primarily in the southeast and midwest 
atampt holds 64 percent of the long distance market down from 
about 90 percent before the courtordered breakup of the old bell 
system in 1984 mci has 12 percent and us sprint is third with 9 
percent according to the most recent fcc figures 
mci will gain the digital network and the fiber optic systems 
telecom has in place theyre going to gain a lot of network 
miles said the yankee groups clarke 
in this type of merger we expect to see cost savings 
improved quality of service improvements for customers such as

japan isnt getting a lot of support from the 
united states and other major economic powers in its effort to 
check the steep decline of the yen many economists say 
after a weekend meeting of financial ministers in paris the 
group of seven industrial nations warned that the yens recent 
decline has undesirable consequences 
the group consisting of the united states japan west germany 
great britain france canada and italy pledged to keep these 
developments under review and reaffirmed its commitment to 
cooperation in exchange markets 
however on monday the central banks of the group followed the 
statement with only weak and uncoordinated intervention traders 
said central banks intervene by buying yen in an attempt to push 
up its price 
also there was no indication that the united states and west 
germany were inclined to cut their interest rates to bolster the 
yen 
theyre basically leaving japan twisting in the wind said 
economist michael k evans a washingtonbased consultant there 
was just enough intervention so the japanese wouldnt have egg all 
over their face 
economists said although the group of sevens statement was 
slightly stronger in tone than expected it will not halt the yens 
slide unless japan does more to shore up its economy 
turmoil in the japanese stock market and political instability 
have helped push the yen down 11 percent in value compared with the 
dollar this year it hit a threeyear low of 160 yen to the dollar 
early last week before recovering somewhat before the meeting 
in tokyo the dollar fell 102 yen to 15645 yen monday but 
later in new york the dollar traded at 158335 yen up from 
fridays 15770 yen 
the market is just not really sure of the g7s resolve 
theyre going to have to come in collectively and so far they 
havent the intervention has seemed more of a gesture than a real 
movement said kevin lawrie a currency trader in new york with 
the bank of boston 
in order to stabilize its currency long term japan will have to 
further increase its interest rates said economist david wyss of 
drimcgraw hill a lexington mass forecasting firm 
an increase in japanese rates relative to us rates makes the 
yen a more attractive investment and raises its value the bank of 
japan raised its discount rate from 425 percent to 525 percent on 
march 20 but it was not enough to stem the yens slide 
since a march 23 meeting in los angeles between japanese finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto and treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady japan had been asking for interest rate cuts in the united 
states and west germany 
but other countries are not inclined to help the japanese at the 
expense of their own economic objectives analysts said 
the west germans fear that lower rates will increase 
inflationary pressures in their country where the economy already 
is being stimulated by the prospect for investment in eastern 
europe and monetary union with east germany 
in the united states the federal reserve has been reluctant to 
cut rates until clearer evidence emerges that inflation is 
moderating 
for the fed to lower interest rates in the current inflation 
environment is not in the cards said economist allen sinai of 
the boston co 
in contrast with the fed the bush administration favors lower 
us interest rates both to stimulate economic growth and to help 
the us trade deficit economists said 
a weak yen pushes up the trade deficit by making japanese goods 
less expensive in the united states and raising the price of us 
goods in japan 
the group of seven officials will get a chance to reevaluate 
their stance at their next meeting in early may in washington

extra extra read all about it 
woman gives birth to fish 
if thats too tame how about randy spooks impregnating maidens 
or perhaps a routine appearance by the virgin mary 
such reports are a staple of manilas lively tabloids among the 
most widely read of the citys more than 20 dailies 
in a country where the truth is often bizarre enough english 
and tagalog language tabloids dish out fantasy and flamboyance for 
those who find the broadsheet dailies too tame 
the latest titillation was the saga of goldfish flores 
pascua a sixinchlong mudfish supposedly born to lilian 
pascua 22 of paniqui in tarlac province 
several manila tabloids reported that mrs pascua gave birth to 
the fish march 31 and named it goldfish tabloids splashed 
pictures of goldfish swimming in a water basin and its 
parents on their front pages 
for several days tabloids regaled their readers with details of 
the couples plans to baptize the fish on palm sunday despite 
healthy skepticism by local officials 
i think a fish should not be baptized and registered because 
it doesnt even have the resemblance of a man said paniqui mayor 
cesar cuchapin 
the baptism controversy was resolved when tabloids reported last 
week that goldfishs short but celebrated life had come to an 
end it was eaten by the family dog 
with goldfish history the tabloid ang pilipino ngayon or 
filipino today reported today that an 8yearold boy had given 
birth by caesarian section in a hospital in pampanga province the 
baby a boy was stillborn the tabloid reported 
not to be scooped manila radio station dzxl telephoned the 
hospital and spoke with an official who confirmed that something 
resembling a fetus had been extracted from the boy 
how could he give birth when he is only 8 years old the 
reporter asked apparently more curious over age than the sex 
peculiarity the official was at a loss for a response 
many of the farfetched reports play on traditions of mysticism 
and superstition which run deep in this predominately roman 
catholic country 
goldfish attracted almost as much attention as a teenaged 
girl in laguna province who the tabloids reported two years ago 
became pregnant by the spirit of a 19th century cleric 
apparitions by the virgin mary are frequently reported although 
the church hierarchy tends to give them little credence the most 
recent was reported last year when the virgin supposedly appeared 
in a coconut grove southeast of manila 
last month the former governor of cagayan province rudolfo 
aquinaldo eluded troops seeking to arrest him for trying to 
overthrow the government and fled into the mountains with armed 
followers 
one tabloid quoted cagayan residents as saying aguinaldo was 
protected by an amulet which gives him the characteristics of a 
dog not always a blessing in an area where puppies are prized as 
food 
but the tabloid explained that with the amulet aquinaldo can 
smell his enemies coming

makers of cosmetics and toiletries say there 
is no need to increase regulation of their industry because their 
voluntary efforts already are ensuring the safety of their products 
but rep ron wyden dore says a general accounting office 
report to congress shows that this selfregulation approach isnt 
working and may be allowing unsafe products on the market 
the report by the investigating arm of congress found that most 
manufacturers of personal care products which include everything 
from toothpaste to bubble bath are not signing up for voluntary 
federal oversight 
the food and drug administration has no authority to require 
these manufacturers to let the agency know they exist to provide 
safetytesting data on their products or reports on adverse 
reactions 
without at least a registration requirement anyone could make 
cosmetics in their bathtub and not have to tell the fda their 
location or any information about the product thats absurd 
said wyden who requested the report 
of the 2000 to 2500 companies that fda estimates are making 
cosmetics products 778 were registered with the agency as of july 
1989 about 31 to 39 percent 
the cosmetics toiletry and fragrance association estimates 
there are at most 2000 manufacturers and that 60 percent of them 
are registered 
there isnt a serious safety problem if there was the 
agency would know about it and the public would know about it 
said michael petrina the groups vice president for legislative 
relations 
the association the main trade organization for the cosmetics 
industry has been encouraging manufacturers to register 
voluntarily with the fda he said 
it also has been collecting and reviewing safety data on 
chemicals used in cosmetics petrina said noting that registration 
grew by 94 companies from 1988 to 1989 
the fda has plenty of information now to make any judgments to 
deal with any safety concerns he said we dont think the fda 
needs any more authority to regulate we dont think it makes 
any sense to divert their scarce resources to an industry that has 
a demonstrated safety record 
petrina noted that government regulations do require that 
ingredients of personalcare products be listed on the labels of 
retail products sold to consumers noncommercial products sold for 
professional use in business establishments such as beauty salons 
are exempt from that requirement 
wyden said the food drug and cosmetic act on the books since 
1938 should be rewritten to require cosmetics manufacturers to 
register with the fda and provide data on safety tests and injury 
reports he said he expects to introduce such legislation later 
this year 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency is doing what it 
can to regulate the industry under the authority congress gave 
it asked if the fda needs more authority nesbit said its 
congress responsibility to write the laws

the gold lettering on the plateglass 
window reads simply law office inside works rhode islands 
busiest criminal lawyer a man who has built a career by 
representing reputed organized crime figures 
ive never discouraged people from referring to me as a mob 
lawyer john f jack cicilline said between drags on his 
cigarette i suppose to some people its a sinister connotation 
but its done me well someone has to represent these people 
but cicilline does more than defend people such as reputed mob 
boss raymond j junior patriarca he befriends them 
pictures of patriarca and his late father legendary organized 
crime leader raymond ls patriarca hang in cicillines office on 
the opposite wall is a framed copy of a 1983 indictment against 
cicilline charges he eventually beat 
cicilline rents his office from patriarca in the citys italian 
section not far from where he grew up 
his father wanted him to become a lawyer although he originally 
planned on entering the foreign service hes glad he followed his 
fathers advice i love doing this work he said 
cicilline put himself through law school commuting 60 miles to 
bostons suffolk university while working days to support the wife 
with whom hed eloped as a teenager 
the balding 51yearold sees himself as on the front line 
defending civil rights he said his small firm which includes two 
of his five children takes more than our fair share of cases 
from poor people 
i see myself as one of the last survivors of the battle 
against the system taking over he said 
two of cicillines clients were arrested last month in an fbi 
sweep patriarca and matthew guglielmetti jr are charged with 
racketeering 
partriarca 45 has been identified in testimony before the us 
senate as head of the new england cosa nostra guglielmetti 
cicillines golf partner is named in last months indictment as a 
lieutenant in charge of the patriarca familys connecticut 
operation 
that doesnt faze cicilline who said his commonality with 
some of his clients has forged friendships that have survived even 
though a lot of them are in jail 
ive never heard anyone say his reputation has been impaired 
or sullied in any way because of the company he keeps said 
presiding superior court judge anthony a giannini 
jack is a very sensitive warm guy said dick casparian 
chief public defender 
but when asked about cicillines personal relationship with some 
clients casparian said he had never developed such a friendship in 
16 years as a criminal lawyer 
cicilline said he knows nothing about organized crime as to the 
guilt or innocence of his clients and friends cicilline said 
ive heard whats said about a lot of my clients i dont know 
if its true and it doesnt bother me even if it is true 
cicilline said he got involved in representing reputed mobsters 
as a young lawyer trying to build a practice 
youve got to take little risks said cicilline risking 
my reputation is a risk i was willing to take 
i cant say i didnt enjoy seeing my name in the paper with 
people who were expected to be seen with the best lawyer money 
could buy 
that strategy with a healthy dose of talent made cicilline 
into the states busiest criminal lawyer he takes on about 25 
percent of the criminal cases that dont go to the public 
defenders office according to giannini that doesnt include the 
many cases he handles in federal court 
although cicilline has the respect of his colleagues many 
refuse to talk about his private life a halfdozen law enforcement 
officials also refused to comment on cicilline 
in 1980 the fbi bugged cicillines office in 1983 an 
informant wore a wire during a meeting with the lawyer and mobster 
frank l bobo marrapese jr after a mistrial and a hung jury 
cicilline cleared himself of charges he conspired to persuade a 
witness to lie 
hes aware of the tightrope that he chooses to walk one 
police officer said demanding anonymity

a historian has emerged as hungarys 
most powerful political figure after leading to electoral victory a 
conservative party that appeals to the hungarian pride long stifled 
under the communists 
jozsef antall 58 dominates the hungarian democratic forum 
which has been vilified by critics as nationalistic and 
antisemitic 
he and other senior party officials deny such charges 
they say the partys emphasis on traditional hungarian values 
including a strong sense of the hungarian nation that extends to 
minorities outside the countrys frontiers has been misunderstood 
nevertheless the forum may be courting trouble with its 
militant championing of hungarian minority rights in neighboring 
countries 
with victory assured after sundays second round of 
parliamentary elections antall told a cheering crowd on monday 
that his government will be the spokesman of 15 million hungarians 
he was referring not only to hungarys 11 million people but to 
those in neighboring countries mainly romania who became 
foreign citizens after the 1920 trianon peace treaty 
last month romania was the site of the most violent 
antihungarian riots in recent memory its leaders are already 
worried about hungarian interference and may not be keen on the 
idea of more intense scrutiny of the fate of hungarians within its 
borders 
yugoslavia the soviet union and czechoslovakia also home to 
hungarian minorities could object as well 
once in office the forum may have no choice but to change its 
priorities and deal with specter of economic collapse 
a foreign debt of more than 20 billion growing unemployment 
and doubledigit inflation are some of the most worrisome legacies 
of centralized economic planning that must be dealt with as 
hungarys new leaders embrace free market reforms 
from its inception in september 1987 at the outset of the 
democratization process that led to the elections the centerright 
democratic forum incorporated three major trends a strong 
national consciousness christian democracy and economic liberalism 
in the elections the forum captured 165 of the 386 
parliamentary seats at stake and is expected to forge a governing 
coalition with the smallholders party and christian democrats that 
would control nearly 60 percent of the legislature 
as little as a year ago jozsef antall was a virtual unknown 
a man of patrician bearing antall was born april 8 1932 a 
scion of the landed gentry his father was a widely respected 
leader of the independent smallholders party and the democratic 
forum embraces many of the prewar smallholder ideas 
the young antall studied law economics and history and was 
teaching high school when the antistalinist revolt broke out in 
1956 only to be crushed by soviet tanks 
active on the side of the revolutionaries he took part in the 
brief revival of the the smallholders party in a january magazine 
interview he called the revolution a pivotal event in his life 
after the revolution he was arrested and barred from teaching 
he later gained employment as a librarian and in 1964 joined the 
semmelweis medical history museum to be made its director 10 years 
later 
although invited antall did not attend the founding meeting of 
the democratic forum because he was outside the country but he 
became intensely involved soon after the partys creation refusing 
leadership posts with both the revived smallholders and the 
christian democrats 
he was elected forum leader in october 
antall the politician seeks to project the image of a 
thoughtful benign wise surrogate father the forums main 
campaign slogan was calm force 
even his political rivals gave him top marks for his performance 
in the talks last year between a coalition of leading opposition 
groups and the thenruling communist party 
but other leaders have marred the image of the party some of 
whom have vilified the liberal league of free democrats the party 
with the highest percentage of former anticommunist dissidents 
as latterday bolsheviks 
forum deputy chairman istvan csurka even used radio time to make 
comments deemed antisemitic by his critics 
the party emphatically disavows any antijewish sentiments it 
attributes much of the antisemitism in hungary to the knowledge 
that many of the countrys discredited former communist leaders 
were jewish

the ice is breaking on northern wisconsin 
lakes signaling the start of another tense spring when protesters 
head to boat landings to confront indians who use spears to catch 
spawning fish 
the first boats of chippewa indian spearfishers are expected to 
venture onto offreservation waters tonight to exercise a right 
guaranteed by 19th century federal treaties 
despite pleas for peace this springs spearfishing season is 
expected to renew confrontations between the chippewa and sport 
anglers who claim spearfishing is an unfair outdated practice 
that thins game fish populations 
observers are unsure whether tensions will escalate from a year 
ago when more than 200 protesters were arrested and the state and 
local sheriffs departments spent nearly 2 million to patrol the 
lakes 
nick hockings of the waswagon treaty association a group on 
the lac du flambeau chippewa reservation that organizes 
spearfishing outings thinks the crowds of antispearfishing 
protesters could be smaller weeded out to your racists 
as many as 1000 members of the american indian movement planned 
to travel from minnesota to northern wisconsin lakes to support the 
chippewa 
courts have ruled the chippewa are entitled to take up to 100 
percent of the safe harvest the number of fish that can be taken 
without harming future reproduction from each northern wisconsin 
lake 
but the chippewa have agreed to limit their catch this year to 
54 percent of the safe harvest or about 41410 walleyed pike on 
178 lakes the season usually lasts about three weeks in 1989 271 
spearfishers caught 16054 walleye 
in comparison wisconsins sport anglers take more than 10 times 
as many fish about 600000 last year according to the state 
department of natural resources 
the st croix chippewa band plans to start the spearfishing 
season tonight in northwestern wisconsins polk county sending 
about 20 fishermen out tribal vice chairman ed bearheart said 
the most active spearfishing band the lac du flambeau is 
planning its first excursion perhaps saturday 
groups opposed to indian spearfishing stop treaty 
abusewisconsin and protect americans rights and resources have 
said they would not begin antispearfishing protests before sunday 
dean crist a spokesman for stop treaty abusewisconsin said 
monday that unless the lac du flambeau band agrees to spear only 10 
percent of its allowable catch his group will urge largescale 
demonstrations at the lakes 
it is no different than a soldier going to war crist said 
nobody in their right mind would like to stand out on a landing 
all night but it is the only thing that works 
putting protesters in boats to patrol the lakes where the 
indians spearfished caused waves last year that made it difficult 
to see walleye preventing tens of thousands of fish from being 
caught he said 
the spearfishing dispute is rooted in treaties the chippewa 
signed when the tribe ceded millions of acres of northern wisconsin 
to the us government in the 1800s 
since 1983 federal courts have said the chippewa retained the 
right to hunt spearfish cut timber and gather foods on 
offreservation land in the ceded territory 
the rulings are being appealed but state officials including 
gov tommy g thompson said it could take nearly a decade for 
lawsuits to move through the courts 
unlike their ancestors who used torches modernday spearfishers 
wear hats with batteryoperated lights a walleye sluggish in the 
cold shallow water is stunned when it sees the light using iron 
spears the indians stab the fish from boats 
each spearfishing season has seen a gradual increase of tension 
and confrontations but state officials predicted 1990 might bring 
a downturn 
i think this will be a more peaceful season than in the 
past said george meyer chief of enforcement for the state 
department of natural resources while i dont believe tribal 
spearfishermen will be lonely on boat landings i believe there 
will be reduced tensions and levels of antitreaty rights 
demonstrations many people understand the issue cannot be 
resolved at boat landings

sen edward kennedy faces an uphill battle in 
his goal of turning the entire peace dividend over to domestic 
programs instead of the deficit the house democratic leader says 
kennedy in a speech at georgetown university on monday said 
billions of dollars cut from the defense budget should go not to 
reducing the federal deficit but to longneglected programs such as 
education and health care 
it is time to insist on what the american people and virtually 
everyone in congress already know kennedy said there really 
is a peace dividend and we must not throw it away 
but house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said congress 
will almost certainly want to put some of the money saved by cuts 
in the defense budget toward deficit reduction and some toward 
reviving domestic programs 
the likelihood is that well do both gephardt said in a 
telephone interview theyre both high priorities each is a part 
of rebuilding economic strength 
gephardt agreed with kennedy that the peace dividend should be 
much larger than the bush administration has proposed 
according to kennedy as much as 170 billion in five years 
should be placed in a national needs trust fund and spent only 
on critical domestic programs such as head start for preschool 
children national health insurance for the roughly 37 million 
americans with no coverage and aid to communities and people 
dislocated by military plant closures 
kennedy chided his democratic colleagues for letting president 
bush control the national agenda and warned that unless the party 
became more active in its opposition the party would retain its 
secondary status 
there has been a kind of unnatural quiet coming from our 
party a sense of yielding ground to the president of kowtowing to 
his veto threats of confining our own democratic efforts to merely 
marginal improvements in republican proposals of almost conceding 
a second term to president bush or hoping against hope that he 
stumbles somewhere along the way kennedy said 
hardline republican views on defense spending helped bring 
about the easing of ussoviet tensions and the spread of 
democracy in eastern europe kennedy conceded but he said the turn 
of world events created an opportunity tailormade for the 
democratic party 
seldom have a period and a party been so well matched he 
said

the flag flew at halfstaff outside of a 
high school where aids victim ryan white was remembered as a model 
student and those who once fought to keep him out of school 
mourned his absence 
students and administrators at hamilton heights high school wore 
orange ribbons mementoes of school pride and began the day with a 
10minute convocation in memory of white who found friendship and 
acceptance here after a long legal battle to attend public school 
ive said many times as a teenager his age i probably would 
have stayed home instead of coming to school every day principal 
steve dillon said during an inpromptu news conference he very 
much wanted to be at school he was very much a fighter 
and i think every one of our lives is going to be a lot better 
for knowing ryan and participating in his last three years 
white a junior attended classes as recently as two weeks 
before his death sunday 10 days after he was admitted to an 
indianapolis hospital with an aidsrelated respiratory infection 
he was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 5 years 
ago having contracted the disease from blood products to treat his 
hemophilia 
the teenager attracted national attention during his successful 
fight to attend school in his hometown of kokomo and emerged as an 
international spokesman for children suffering from aids he is 
credited with furthering understanding of the disease its 
devastating effects and the rights of its sufferers 
after white won his court battle to attend school in kokomo he 
and his family still felt uncomfortable there and moved to cicero 
about 20 miles away in 1987 his death elicited sympathy in his 
former hometown 
its a terrible thing id hoped from the beginning he could 
have been the first to whip it said dan carter who was board 
president at western school corp when ryan was banned from classes 
there 
he was a real educator for all of us and he showed a lot of 
class said kokomo mayor robert sargent 
his contribution to aids awareness was remembered monday night 
with a candlelight vigil in downtown indianapolis attended by about 
50 people 
he was brave he brought peoples awareness alive said 
kevin johnson an aids organization volunteer who attended the 
vigil and whose best friend has the disease i think ryan made a 
big difference 
a funeral was planned for wednesday 
dillon said he expected half of his schools 550 students and 
several staff members would attend the funeral 
some of whites closest friends sought consolation monday from 
school counselors dillon said 
im very pleased with the student body today theyre handling 
it very well we wanted to make sure they felt good about 
themselves dillon said 
he said the whites classmates should be proud that he could 
attend school and have friends and go to dances and go to the 
ballgames and not worry about any problems he was very much a part 
of our school body 
whites death was particularly hard to take for three young 
florida brothers suffering from aids who also fought to attend 
school their mother said 
louise ray said her hemophiliac sons ricky 13 robert 12 and 
randy 10 had met white and his death reminded them of the 
gravity of their own illnesses 
its a senseless death in a way she said the boys are 
going to miss him and at this age its hard for them to understand 
why a young person has to die 
the brothers won a federal court order to attend school in 
arcadia fla in 1987 but fire destroyed their home soon 
afterward and the family fled to sarasota where they enrolled in 
school without incident

a soviet official is comparing moscows 
opposition to lithuanian independence to abraham lincolns fight to 
prevent the south from seceding 
yuri a reshteov head of the soviet foreign ministrys 
department for international humanitarian cooperation and human 
rights told a news conference he visited washingtons lincoln 
memorial on sunday 
the civil war president in his second inaugural address in 
1865 said that he is fighting against the forces which are seeking 
to dissolve the union abraham lincoln saved the american union 
reshteov said monday 
we have been together with lithuania with estonia and with 
latvia for many many years he said i still hope that what 
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to 
dissolution of our union 
reshteov said lithuanias fate should be decided by a popular 
vote rather than by the march 11 declaration by the parliament in 
vilnius rejecting the 1940 soviet annexation 
stasys lozoraitis jr charge daffaires of the lithuanian 
legation in washington responded at a separate news conference 
that since the western powers have never recognized the soviet 
annexation of lithuania the international law that should be 
applied is that the soviets should withdraw 
a majority of lithuanians favor independence lozoraitis said 
but a referendum would be a trap for neighboring estonia and 
latvia where sizable minorities oppose independence

the trade association representing the 
nations major oil companies has adopted a set of guiding 
environmental principles but an environmentalist says they sound 
like hollow promises 
the american petroleum institutes board of directors which 
includes all of the nations major petroleum companies adopted the 
environmental principles friday in dallas 
the principles unveiled monday include pledges that the 
industry would promote the safe use transportation and disposal of 
raw materials address problems created by the handling and 
disposal of hazardous substances from oil operations and operate 
plants and facilities in a way that protects the environment and 
the safety and health of employees and the public 
the commitments are so vague as to be practically 
meaningless said bob adler senior attorney for the natural 
resources defense council said monday it sounds like hollow 
promises especially coming from an industry that has violated not 
only government regulations but its own promises time and time 
again 
adler said the industry appears to be seeking to replace badly 
needed enforceable government regulations with more unenforceable 
industry promises

effectively ended blacklisting in the entertainment industry died 
monday at his austin home said his niece anne mcaffee 
faulk was a popular cbs radio and television personality when 
in 1957 he mounted a sixyear legal battle in a new york court 
against an organization that tried to brand him a subversive 
he recounted the struggle in a bestselling book fear on 
trial the book was made into a madefortv movie that was 
broadcast on cbs in 1975 
faulk often said he never expected the first amendment to become 
pivotal in his life 
i never had the slightest inkling that i would ever be 
embattled in invoking its protections he said its the main 
nerve center of our entire selfgoverning democratic society 
faulk studied and taught at the university of texas before 
joining the merchant marine during world war ii he also worked for 
the american red cross in the middle east despite eye trouble he 
was able to join the army in 1944 
while on christmas leave in 1945 faulk was approached by 
executives from cbs who had heard him perform and were impressed 
with his character sketches and interpretations of folk humor 
the network signed him in 1946 to do a weekly onehour radio 
show he worked for cbs until 1957 when he was fired after aware 
inc a group that blacklisted entertainment personalities accused 
him the year before of having subversive associations 
faulk sued aware in 1956 charging the group had libeled him and 
destroyed his career he won the lawsuit and was awarded 35 
million but the judgment was later reduced to 725000 on appeal

austin where as a lecturer and writer he earned a reputation as a 
champion of individual rights 
he got very strong support from his whole family ms 
mcaffee said of the trial days we all understood how important 
it was to put an end to the blacklisting the family has always 
been very political 
journalist eric sevareid has said john henry faulk will 
occupy a niche in the permanent history of american journalism and 
in the life and times of the first amendment his story illustrates 
the first amendment 
faulk wrote a second book the uncensored john henry faulk 
which was published in 1985 
in 1988 faulk received the james madison first amendment award 
from the freedom of information foundation of texas and was

a lawyer for exxon said the nations 
worst oil spill was a tragic accident after the corporation and 
a subsidiary pleaded innocent to a fivecount federal criminal 
indictment 
attorneys for exxon corp and exxon shipping co entered the 
pleas monday in two separate arraignments before us district 
judge john d roberts each company has been charged with two 
felonies and three misdemeanors 
the two feb 27 indictments stem from the march 24 1989 spill 
of nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil from the 
tanker exxon valdez which ran aground and ripped its bottom open 
on a charted reef outside shipping lanes in prince william sound 
the oil coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed 
countless fish birds and other marine life 
we view this as a tragic accident but an accident jim 
neal chief lawyer for exxon shipping said after the arraignment 
we certainly didnt intend to spill oil 
but exxon is not contending it is being unjustly prosecuted he 
said 
were not going to say were being unfairly treated said 
neal were big boys were going to defend ourselves 
federal prosecutors have said exxon and exxon shipping face up 
to 700 million in fines and other criminal penalties if convicted 
exxon reportedly had been negotiating a plea bargain with the 
federal government but neal said monday such talks no longer are 
under way 
the charges include violating the federal clean water act by 
discharging oil without a permit killing migratory birds and 
willfully employing crew members who were not physically or 
mentally competent to operate the huge oil tanker 
the governments attorney charles a demonaco would not 
discuss the case monday 
neal said exxon hopes the charges do not obscure the fact the 
corporation has spent about 2 billion trying to clean up the 
spilled oil we stepped up and we took responsibility for it 
he said 
the nashville tenn attorney served as chief counsel to the 
watergate special prosecutor and as a special assistant to former 
attorney general robert kennedy 
roberts said a jury trial will be automatic and that the case 
probably will be complex and extended the case has been assigned 
to another federal judge in anchorage no date was set for the 
trial 
roberts also said the governments intention to seek fines equal 
to double the gross losses from the spill would generate litigation 
neal said exxon would contest such fines 
more than 160 civil lawsuits are pending against exxon by the 
state of alaska environmentalists and private individuals for 
unspecified damages 
the company has said it intends to return to the beaches of 
prince william sound next month to continue mopping up 
the criminal case is the second one relating to the exxon valdez 
spill to go before a judge in anchorage this year 
on march 22 a superior court jury convicted exxon valdez 
skipper joseph hazelwood of negligent discharge of oil but he was 
acquitted of three other charges including a felony charge he was 
reckless and drunk when the tanker went aground 
judge karl johnstone sentenced the former skipper to help clean 
up prince william sound and pay the state 50000 in restitution 
hazelwoods lawyers said they will appeal 
neal said monday that hazelwoods acquittal on most counts would 
probably help exxons case but the attorney added that was his 
case this is ours

the dollar ended sharply higher against the 
japanese yen despite dollarselling intervention by japans central 
bank and resulted in a sharp plunge on the tokyo stock exchange 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 77325 points or 254 
percent ending the day at 2962468 on monday the nikkei index 
gained 111915 points its fourth largest singleday advance ever 
the dollar closed at 15815 yen unchanged from its opening but 
170 yen higher than mondays close of 15645 yen the currency 
ranged between 15790 yen and 15840 yen during the days trading 
currency dealers said the dollars rise followed its overnight 
strength in new york despite concerted dollarselling intervention 
by central banks from the group of seven g7 industrial countries 
the amount of their intervention was too small to push up the 
yen said toru kanai a currency analyst with new japan 
securities co he said intervention by foreign central banks was 
only a token action to show they were fulfilling their pledges at 
the g7 meeting 
last weekend the g7 industrial nations comprising japan 
canada the united states britain france italy and west 
germany agreed to joint intervention to support the falling yen 
none of the banks sold their own currencies only the dollar 
against the yen kanai added 
the bank of japan on tuesday was seen selling the dollar 
actively the amount was not immediately known japans central 
bank does not usually announce its market intervention activities 
on the stock exchange traders said the index fell further in 
the afternoon as institutional investors who picked up issues that 
had fallen in the recent crash stepped off to the sidelines 
because of uncertainties in the currency and stock markets 
they said indexlinked sellings also accelerated the nikkeis 
afternoon plunge 
masayoshi yano a trader with nikko securities co said market 
players were largely discouraged by the yens weakness despite the 
coordinated intervention 
because of the yens quick plunge investors were discouraged 
and sold back what they had bought the previous day he said 
yano blamed the yens quick downturn on insufficient 
dollarselling by foreign central banks 
japans finance minister ryutaro hashimoto welcomed the 
coordinated intervention monday by the g7 nations in overseas 
markets 
speaking at a tuesday morning news conference hashimoto said 
mondays intervention dismissed pessimistic predictions in the 
market and news reports that had said coordinated intervention 
would not be forthcoming 
he said however exchange rate levels will have to be watched 
with concern

the head of the internal revenue service is 
wishing both taxpayers and his 120000 employees many happy 
returns but he said he shares the frustrations many people 
encounter when filing their taxes 
our job and i think the biggest challenge of the 90s in the 
agency is to make filing easier irs commissioner fred goldberg 
jr told reporters monday before addressing the economic club of 
detroit grab any irs employee and theyll tell you the same 
thing 
goldberg 41 head of the agency since july 1989 said current 
irs forms and regulations are more than even he can handle and he 
has an economics degree from yale university worked with a 
washington dc law firm and for nine years with the irs 
the law is terribly complicated it is too complicated for 
the american public they deserve an easier system and i deserve 
an easier system too said goldberg who estimated he spent 
three hours gathering information for his 1990 return to present to 
a tax preparer 
with the tax filing deadline less than a week away goldberg 
said the irs is receiving more returns earlier and processing them 
faster he gave much of the credit to electronic filing in which 
tax information is forwarded to the irs by computer 
a return filed electronically this week will be processed within 
two to three weeks compared with six to eight weeks for a standard 
return done on paper and mailed to the irs goldberg said 
errors appear in fewer than 4 percent of electronic returns 
compared with about 15 percent of paper returns he said 
the irs also is doing its part to cut the error rate by giving 
more accurate information to taxpayers goldberg said the agency 
is giving correct answers to 78 percent of the inquiries it has 
received this year compared with 62 percent last year he said 
president bushs proposed 1991 budget includes additional money 
for the irs to upgrade service and employee training goldberg said 
he said he hoped new training would help employees try and 
keep a lighter touch by doing that you collect more revenue 
but goldberg said the light touch he envisions must mesh with a 
tough but respectful attitude toward collecting delinquent taxes 
we are held accountable for collecting revenues and i think 
we do a good job of it he said there are more than 100 
million people out there who do pay their taxes and i do think 
those folks are looking to us to go after those who dont

communist party leader gombogavin 
ochirbat today declared an end to seven decades of party control 
over trade unions artists and scientists but said the police and 
army should stay in party hands 
he spoke at the opening of an extraordinary party congress 
called to reconsider the partys most basic goals and policies in 
the face of the challenge from new reformist opposition parties 
we need new theoretical concepts starting with what 
socialism is and how it should be applied on mongolian soil 
ochirbat said in an hourlong televised speech to the congress 926 
delegates 
the communist party has indicated it is determined to stay in 
power despite the ouster of communists elsewhere in what had been 
the soviet bloc 
the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe inspired 
mongolias new opposition to hold demonstrations that forced the 
ruling party last month to hastily call this weeks special 
congress 
the delegates were elected directly by the partys 90000 
members for the first time and include just 41 members of the 
current 146member party central committee one of the congress 
chief tasks will be to elect a new central committee which in turn 
may oust ochirbat and the four other members of the party politburo 
ochirbat and the politburo were appointed only last month when 
an opposition hunger strike forced the old party leadership to 
resign their chances for surviving are not yet clear 
sluggish reaction to the new situation will amount to 
suicide ochirbat warned the deputies 
he said the party must end dictatorial control of trade unions 
journalists artists scientists and mass organizations such as the 
youth league many people in these groups already have rebelled 
against the party leadership 
he said the party also will cease making administrative 
decisions that should be handled by the government 
but ochirbat said the party will keep its cells in the army and 
police force ensuring control of them he said these cells would 
be reformed but did not give details 
the new opposition groups had demanded that the army serve the 
government not the ruling party 
ochirbat also warned against growing disorder in factories since 
the prodemocracy demonstrations began in december the government 
announced last week that industrial production for the first 
quarter had fallen from last year due to absenteeism and slacking 
off at factories and blamed it on the new spirit of challenging 
authority in all areas 
however in an interview with the japanese television network 
nhk that was published in todays party newspaper unen ochirbat 
said he had not lost confidence in the party 
asked if he thought it could win legislative elections 
tentatively planned for july he said we think people have 
confidence in the party that has led the country to progress over 
the past 70 years 
the party which receives 66 million from the government each 
year has pledged to become selffinancing but its assets still far 
exceed those of opposition groups who fear there cannot be an 
equal contest some of them lack even offices and telephones 
in his speech to the congress ochirbat reaffirmed the 
importance of mongolias ties to the soviet union which some 
opposition groups say has ruled mongolia like a colony since it won 
independence from china in 1921 
no opposition protests were expected during the threeday party 
congress the government decreed over the weekend that application 
for any demonstration must be submitted a week in advance and 
demonstrations that might disrupt public life will not be permitted 
the last opposition rally was held sunday and marked the second 
congress of the new mongolian democratic party witnesses said 
variously that 4000 to 10000 people gathered peacefully in 
central ulan bators sukhbator square while the party leadership 
met in a nearby hall 
communist party congresses normally are held every five years 
the last one was in 1986

nurses technicians and maintenance workers 
at the nations largest health maintenance organization began 
returning to the job today ending an eightday walkout 
they will be phased in over a threeday period kaiser 
permanente spokeswoman janice seib said late monday by the end 
of the week we should be operating in a very routine way 
service workers international union local 399 voted 4118 to 
2595 in favor of the latest contract offer said union vice 
president david stilwell an additional 334 ballots were contested 
for various reasons he said 
the offer called for 5 percent to 6 percent increases in the 
first year and 3 percent to 7 percent increases in the second and 
third years to 11000 union members 
a good number of people felt that it was a victory that they 
had actually stuck together and achieved a better offer stilwell 
said 
the strike affected seven kaiser permanente of southern 
california hospitals and more than 40 clinics operated by the huge 
health maintenance organization 
the workers walked out april 2 after rejecting a contract their 
own negotiating team had recommended 
union spokesman tom ramsay said the negotiators had misread the 
depth of the resentment from workers who accepted a threeyear wage 
freeze in the previous contract 
ramsay said the workers frustrations stemmed in large part from 
the wage freeze in place during a period when they believed kaiser 
was prospering relative to other health care providers workloads 
for nurses and other workers also increased ramsay said 
both sides said the latest contract had clarified the exact 
raises to be given to certain categories of workers but would cost 
kaiser about the same 44 million over three years 
ramsay and ms seib said the new contract specifies exactly 
which categories of workers will get bigger raises up to 6 
percent in the first year and 7 percent in subsequent years the 
earlier contract had left kaiser more leeway in how to implement 
those raises 
the contract also guarantees martin luther king jr day off for 
employees who reserve it as one of their two floating holidays each 
year ms seib said 
top pay for a licensed vocational nurse under the old contract 
was 1301 per hour 
kaiser permanente of southern california has more than 2 million 
members about 15 million of whom live in los angeles orange and 
ventura counties the areas affected by the strike 
the pasadenabased hmo cut back some services and reduced 
patient populations as managers and workers from nonaffected 
facilities filled in

atlantas designation as the nations bigcity 
crime capital for the second consecutive year is a public relations 
disaster that could affect the citys bid to host the 1996 
olympics a pollster said 
this did for the reputation of atlanta what the titanic did 
for the reputation of ocean liners claibourne darden president 
of darden research said monday 
according to the atlanta constitution which analyzed fbi 
statistics for 1989 that were released sunday atlanta had the 
highest number of serious crimes reported per 1000 population of 
any big city those with at least 300000 residents during 1989 
the atlanta figure was 210 per 1000 miami ranked second with 
189 per 1000 dallas was third with 168 per 1000 
the crimes counted include murder rape robbery aggravated 
assault burglary larceny and auto theft 
similar crimes counted in 1988 also ranked atlanta first 
followed by fort worth texas and dallas 
the new report also showed atlanta with a 13 percent increase in 
its murder rate as killings rose from 217 to 246 outdistancing an 
increase of 7 percent in the south and 4 percent nationwide 
neighborhood activists and elected officials said that in spite 
of the statistical findings atlanta is no more dangerous than any 
other metropolitan area 
ive been to new york and dc you just have to be careful 
and cautious anywhere you go i dont think theres any 
difference said louise watley chairwoman of the citywide 
advisory council on public housing 
tracey turner who organized a neighborhood watch program for 
her predominantly white neighborhood on the citys east side said 
people will see the latest statistics and say oh my god this 
is detroit but i dont feel that way i would never dream of 
not living in town 
but us rep john lewis a democrat whose district covers most 
of the city said atlantas high rate of crime is not anything 
to be proud of we absolutely must do better 
a spokesman for atlanta mayor maynard jackson said jackson has 
moved aggressively to fight crime since he took office in january 
the mayor made fighting drugs and crime the no 1 issue of his 
campaign and it certainly has been the central issue of his first 
three months said angelo fuster jacksons communications 
director 
the efforts have included temporarily assigning a special detail 
to the citys public housing projects moving some officers from 
desk jobs to the street and allowing shotguns to be returned to 
some patrol cars 
he also has called for the addition of at least 500 officers to 
the 1600officer force over the next three years 
atlanta is being considered to host the 1996 summer olympics 
along with toronto belgrade yugoslavia melbourne australia 
manchester england and athens greece a decision is expected in 
september 
the crime report will not be helpful darden said 
you can put on a tremendous effort and then you get 
something like this thats totally out of your control and it 
gives the decisionmakers an undeniable factor on which to hang 
their hats decisionmakers have to justify their decisions and 
this is a real hathanger he said

american airlines flight attendants should 
not have to fit a coffee tea or me image according to a suit 
challenging the companys weight policy 
the classaction federal lawsuit was filed in us district 
court monday by the equal employment opportunity commission 
american still wants their flight attendants to appeal to a 
male sexist notion of what is sexy commission lawyer ralph dh 
fertig said and thats thin 
the lawsuit also alleges the policy discriminates against 
attendants who take leaves of absences to give birth or work as 
union officers because they are not given time to bring their 
weight down after they return 
fertig said the policy harks back to the days when airlines used 
the image of a coffee tea or me stewardess as a marketing tool 
americans policy for instance reads that a firm trim 
silhouette free of bulges rolls or paunches is necessary for an 
alert efficient image 
patt gibbs a flight attendant for 28 years and a plaintiff in 
the suit was weighed when she returned to work in 1988 after a 
fouryear leave to serve as president of the association of 
professional flight attendants union 
the 5foot3 ms gibbs was 154 pounds 29 pounds over the 
maximum allowed for her height ms gibbs got her weight down and 
returned to work but she said the experience was humiliating 
they said thats that youre too heavy lose the weight or 
you wont have a job she said 
the federal lawsuit follows the filing in texas of a similar 
discrimination lawsuit by the union for americans 16000 flight 
attendants 
last year pan american world airways ended six years of similar 
litigation by raising its weight requirements pan am also agreed 
to pay 23 million in lost wages to 115 employees unable to work 
under its old weight rule 
americans policy is one of the strictest in the airline 
industry 
the policy is based on a chart that assigns maximum body weights 
to the size of the attendant with more weight allowed for men a 
5foot5 man for instance can weigh 16 pounds more than a woman 
of the same height 
the policy applies only to male and female flight attendants and 
ticket agents pilots and baggage handlers are not covered 
american attorney maureen f moore said the policy is intended 
to make flight attendants presentable to the public but is not 
discriminatory because weight requirements apply to both male and 
female attendants 
she said the fort worth texasbased airline has attempted to 
work out a new agreement with the union that included higher 
weights but that the union was uncooperative 
we have been trying to settle this said ms moore 
union officials said that it was the airline not the union 
that was unwilling to make reasonable changes in the weight policy

chinese troops were sent late last week to three 
cities near the far western border with the soviet union and 
pakistan to quell moslem riots a source said today 
the disturbances occurred in kashgar hotan and one other city 
in the remote southwest section of xinjiang uygur autonomous 
region said the source a western traveler who had been in the 
xinjiang provincial capital of urumqi 
he said the troops were sent to the region on friday there were 
no details on how many people were involved in the disturbances 
whether the troops were soldiers or security troops or whether 
there were any deaths or injuries 
a western diplomat who met a xinjiang official on monday also 
confirmed that rioting had occurred but chinese officials refused 
to confirm or deny the reports 
an official of the state minorities commission in beijing would 
say only that he had heard no reports of trouble the foreign 
affairs office in urumqi refused to answer questions 
efforts to reach kashgar by phone were not successful 
the traveler said he was told by people in urumqi that the 
rioting near kashgar an ancient bazaar and silk road oasis west of 
the taklimakan desert apparently was caused by a controversy over 
the building of a mosque 
chinese authorities have recently ordered a clampdown on 
religious functions in xinjiang claiming people are using religion 
for separatist antigovernment activities 
the traveler speaking on condition of anonymity said he and 
other foreigners were not allowed to board a plane saturday for the 
700mile trip from urumqi to kashgar 
the government of pakistan was also notified monday that the 
13120foot khunjerab pass through the karakorum mountains south of 
kashgar had been closed due to a landslide the pass the main 
route between xinjiang and pakistan was to have opened for the 
season later this month 
there must be some kind of trouble if theyve closed the 
pass said one asian diplomat 
more than half the 14 million people of the arid desolate 
province are moslems including uygurs kazakhs tadzhikis tartars 
and kirkghiz with ties to the moslems of soviet central asia 
ethnic tensions have risen under communist rule as the beijing 
government moves han chinese the dominant ethnic group of china 
into xinjiang threatening to make the moslems a minority 
last may there were violent moslem riots in urumqi over a 
chineselanguage book the moslems said blasphemed their religion 
since the outbreak of ethnic unrest in the soviet union chinese 
officials have repeatedly warned of separatist threats in xinjiang 
foreign journalists and diplomats have been barred from the 
province 
xinjiang also borders tibet another province where resentment 
against chinese rule has erupted into violence in recent years

prices on the tokyo stock exchange dived today and 
the dollar surged against the japanese yen amid speculation an 
agreement on market intervention by leading currency nations was 
falling apart 
the 225share nikkei stock average fell 77325 points or 254 
percent ending the day at 2962468 on monday the nikkei index 
gained 111915 points in its fourthlargest singleday advance 
volume on the first section was estimated at 550 million shares 
today down from 800 million on monday more than 600 issues fell 
while 255 advanced and 80 remained unchanged 
nomura securities analyst masahiro umemori attributed the 
nikkeis drop to the yens downturn which he said resulted from 
insufficient intervention overnight by central banks from the group 
of seven leading industrialized nations 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno said after returning from a 
meeting of finance ministers of the g7 nations in paris last 
weekend they had pledged to intervene in currency markets to 
support the falling yen 
the g7 is comprised of japan canada the united states 
britain france italy and west germany 
the dollar closed in tokyo at 15815 yen unchanged from its 
opening but 170 yen higher than mondays close of 15645 yen the 
dollar ranged between 15790 yen and 15840 yen during the day 
toru kanai a currency analyst with new japan securities co 
said the overnight intervention was only a token action by the 
central banks to show they were fulfilling their pledge at the g7 
meeting 
the bank of japan was seen selling about 200 million this 
morning in support of the yen 
on the stock market traders said the japanese currencys fall 
prompted investors to sell what they had bought the previous day 
nomuras umemori also attributed the nikkeis plunge which 
worsened in the afternoon to a report that participants in the g7 
meeting had warned japan the yens weakness could not be corrected 
unless tokyo takes measures other than market intervention 
in a report from washington the washington post said japan 
was bluntly warned by its major financial and economic partners at 
the group of seven meeting in paris to stabilize its own currency 
and stock markets by raising interest rates 
it quoted an important official as saying intervention alone 
to prop up the yen will not work without other actions on the 
japanese side 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto however welcomed 
the intervention monday by the g7 nations and said it had 
disproved speculation that coordinated intervention would not be 
forthcoming 
umemori said foreign exchange and interest rate movements would 
be key to a stock market recovery 
yoshitsugu hanada a senior dealer with the mitsui taiyo kobe 
bank said the dollar was not likely to continue to rise 
indefinitely 
the markets demand for the dollar seems to be gradually 
decreasing following corporate account settlements at the end of 
fiscal 1989 on march 31 he said 
hanada said the stock markets instability had also contributed 
to the yens weakness 
meanwhile the price of benchmark no 119 japanese government 
bonds closed at 8654 points down from mondays 8673 their yield 
rose to 7245 percent from the previous days 7205 percent

an opposition leader said today that king 
birendra having bowed to a popular prodemocracy movement and 
promised a multiparty system has invited his party to take part in 
an interim government 
the nepali congress partys acting president krishna prasad 
bhattarai said the party also was invited to participate in a 
constitution reforms commission and in an inquiry into last weeks 
government crackdown on prodemocracy protesters the bloodiest 
clash this century in nepal 
witnesses said 200 people were killed friday when police opened 
fire on about 200000 nepalese who were marching on the royal 
palace in central katmandu the government said 10 people died and 
107 were injured 
on sunday the harvardeducated birendra yielded to opposition 
demands and said he was lifting a 29yearold ban on political 
parties 
today i talked to a minister about the kings proposals but i 
told him we need time before making a decision bhattarai said 
after all we have been out of politics for three decades and need 
time to reorganize ourselves he refused to identify the cabinet 
minister 
the nepali congress formed nepals only government under a 
westernstyle democracy before it was dismissed by birendras 
father king mahendra in december 1960 on grounds of corruption 
and mismanagement 
the king has wielded power since ruling through a largely 
rubberstamp government and a partyless national assembly the 
rashtriya panchayat dominated by his nominees 
prime minister lokendra chand told reporters monday that his 
government could be considered an interim government until 
elections are held which would follow the formation of the 
constitution reforms commission and its issuance of a report chand 
gave no dates for either elections or the commission 
bhattarai said chands claim on the interim government was his 
view we dont subscribe to it bhattarai also said the king did 
not elaborate on the new interim government 
he said he will convey the partys decision to the palace on 
wednesay 
but he said the partys stand remained that the existence of 
the national assembly is an anachronism 
on monday a radical leftwing group which supported the 
7weekold democracy movement said that unless the assembly was 
dissolved immediately and the constitution changed to take away the 
kings absolute powers a multiparty system was meaningless 
the group the united national peoples movement called the 
agreement between the king and the nepali congress a betrayal to 
the people and a conspiracy hatched in connivance with the 
opportunist and compromising elements in the movement 
the nascent prodemocracy movement was led by the nepali 
congress party and the united left front a coalition of leftwing 
parties it was not immediately known if the king invited the 
leftist coalition to form part of the government leaders of the 
front were not immediately available for comment 
life returned to normal in katmandu and its two suburbs of patan 
and bhaktapur today after daylong celebrations monday over the 
opposition victory 
shops opened and streets were full of tourists and residents 
shopkeepers removed shattered glass from windows broken during 
fridays demonstration 
birenda 44 is heir of the shaha dynasty that has held the 
throne since the mid18th century many nepalese especially 
illiterate farmers who comprise the bulk of this countrys 17 
million people view him as the reincarnation of the hindu god 
vishnu

a judge says his refusal to allow a 
woman to use her maiden name without her husbands consent is an 
effort to maintain the integrity of the family 
the american civil liberties union on monday said it would 
challenge the march 8 ruling by probate judge anthony b 
sciarretta who denied lucille anne riccitellis namechange 
petition 
the states continuing hangup with a womans right to use her 
birth name is nothing short of mindboggling said steve brown 
executive director of the aclus rhode island affiliate 
riccitelli 41 said she decided to resume using maiden name 
after her father died without any sons 
when he died very suddenly i thought it would be a nice thing 
for me to do for him she said she said her sister uses a 
hyphenated name 
when sciarretta learned riccitelli was married he told her to 
get her husbands consent she said that left her feeling like a 
little girl and she refused sciarretta then denied the 
namechange petition 
just because im married to someone doesnt mean i dont have 
any rights as a person she said 
her husband edward martin called it patently 
discriminatory the couples two sons age 20 and 16 use his 
surname 
sciarretta said he did not recall the particular case but said 
ive taken a firm policy when there are family situations 
the judge said he feels spousal consent is needed if there is 
to be any integrity in the family unit he said he requires a 
wifes consent in cases where a husband wants to change his name 
are you sure this isnt a time warp youve just put me in 
asked leslie wolfe executive director of the center for women 
policy studies in washington this is very 19th century it is 
old common law where when a man and woman married they became one 
the man 
the state supreme court ruled in 1979 that a person may use any 
name as long as it is consistent and not to evade creditors or 
police said aclu attorney a gregorie frazier 
brown said the aclu receives similar complaints from other women 
but most give up or get their husbands permission 
it is really an insult to women in the state brown said 
riccitelli said that she would pursue the suit even though 
sciarretta spoiled what i wanted to do in honoring her father

moslem secessionists shot and killed one 
of three hostages they had been holding for four days and dumped 
his body outside the citys main fire station police said 
the body of lm khera an industrialist was found with five 
bullet wounds said tataji ganju a police superintendent 
khera was the first civilian killed by the militants who was not 
accused of being a poice informer 
his death raises to 256 the number of people killed in the 
kashmir valley in the crackdown the government began jan 20 on a 
moslem movement for secession from hindumajority india 
the body was found about 1 hours before a deadline set by the 
kidnappers who had threatened to kill all three hostages if three 
jailed militants were not freed 
ganju said he did not know why khera a hindu was killed before 
the deadline he said government troops threw a cordon around the 
narrow alleys surrounding the fire station and were conducted 
housetohouse searches for the abductors 
the superintendent said nothing was known about the fate of two 
other hostages the vice chancellor of kashmir university and his 
personal secretary both of whom are moslems 
all three were kidnapped friday and the government responded by 
imposing an aroundtheclock curfew and arresting between 300 to 
400 people official sources said 
seven people were wounded by soldiers and paramilitary troops 
monday when the militants supporters defied curfew in two places 
in srinagar witnesses said 
curfews ordering people to stay indoors have been the rule since 
the government crackdown began in response to an escalation of 
bombings and assassinations by militant moslem separatists 
the curfews are periodically lifted for a few hours to allow 
people to buy food conduct business or observe islamic holidays 
the unresolved fate of kashmir dates back to 1947 when indian 
and moslem pakistan were partitioned along religious lines the old 
princely state of kashmir was predominantly moslem but its hindu 
ruler opted to join india 
today the kashmir region is divided between india and pakistan 
along a disputed frontier and has twice been the cause of war 
between the two countries 
the indian part of jammukashmir is the only state in india with 
a moslem majority moslems centered in the northern kashmir

the denver zoo has decided to stop offering 
elephant and camel rides for zoo visitors 
it had all the elements of a freak show and we did not like 
it were delighted that its gone said rocky mountain humane 
society executive director robin duxbury 
those stupid little rides with the animals have no kind of 
educational value for children at all duxbury said monday if 
anything it gives children the wrong message about wild animals 
directors of the denver zoo foundation decided recently not to 
renew a contract with a concessionaire who provided the rides 
our discussions with the rocky mountain humane society might 
have accelerated the decision said zoo spokesman tom peterson 
but he said directors already were concerned about the situation 
before the society complained 
i dont want the impression that we knuckled under to the 
rocky mountain humane society he said 
he said the rides gave the zoo only a very small profit caused 
liability concerns and pushed the boundaries of the zoo philosophy

on the ferry scandinavian star today looking for more victims and 
for the origin of the weekend fire that killed up to 200 people on 
a trip from norway to denmark 
investigators working on the theory of arson said they found 
no evidence yet of the spark that ignited the 20yearold danish 
ship carrying more than 500 passengers and crew in the north sea 
early saturday

painstakingly moving through the hulk searching for clues said 
roar onso district police chief in lysekil on swedens southwest 
coast 
we are not going over the whole ship to count bodies he 
said by telephone the work is slow we are going over one part 
at a time and finishing that before we move on to the next 
norwegian police today took charge of the investigation of the 
fire which occurred midway through the overnight voyage from oslo 
to frederikshavn denmark 
the ships owner has said the blaze was deliberately set because 
it was one of two fires that broke out on separate decks 
two other ferry fires occurred monday off the european coast

killed one man and injured 32 and the ships irish owner suspected

while off britains isle of wight and one of 675 aboard died of a 
heart attack the cause was under investigation

to oslo norway for identification

who died in their cabins with their arms around each other and 
parents who threw themselves over their children in a desperate 
effort to protect them from the poisonous smoke and unendurable 
heat 
news photographers allowed into lounge areas of the 10500ton 
vessel recorded a devastated scene of black twisted metal in which 
nothing combustible remained 
a commission of highlevel officials from norway sweden and 
denmark was due to start work in oslo today and a maritime inquiry 
was to open wednesday in copenhagen denmark

what they called the proliferation of ships flying flags of 
convenience in nordic waters which come under less strict safety 
controls 
the scandinavian star bought last month by the danishbased 
dano line from seaescape of miami was registered in the bahamas 
it had been working the norwaydenmark line for one week 
portuguese trade unions representing sailors on the scandinavian

conservative leader constantine mitsotakis 
received a mandate to form a government today after working out a 
deal with a small party to clinch a onevote parliamentary majority 
mitsotakis head of the new democracy party that won half of 
parliaments seats in an election sunday said his government would 
be sworn in on wednesday 
the party wants to liberalize the inflationplagued economy 
slash the government deficit and attract foreign investment 
after a onehour meeting with president christos sartzetakis 
the 71yearold mitsotakis told reporters i dont have much to 
say as you know i met with mr sartzetakis who gave me a mandate 
to form a government 
miksotakis received the mandate after he assured sartzetakis 
that he controlled 151 of the 300 seats in parliament after 
sundays elections new democracy won 150 seats in the balloting 
then received the support of rightist costis stephanopoulos whose 
renewal party won one seat 
stephanopoulos said monday he offered the vote of his lone 
victorious candidate without preconditions and that he would 
not be a member of the government which will be an allnew 
democracy cabinet 
his support broke an impasse that had gripped greek politics 
since inconclusive elections last june and november 
temporary governments since the socialists were voted out in 
june have been largely ineffective in dealing with the economy 
saddled with 17 percent inflation and a 156 billion government 
deficit 
a new democracy victory could also mean greece will make 
longpostponed decisions on a us extradition request for a 
palestinian wanted for the 1982 bombing of an airliner over hawaii 
and on a new military bases agreement with the united states 
mitsotakis has said greeces defense depends heavily on the four 
us military bases which are to close by november unless a new 
agreement is reached he has also said that he would extradite 
mohammed rashid the palestinian wanted by the united states 
the athens stock exchange reacted favorably to the conservative 
victory new democracy has promised to cut government spending 
streamline the public sector and reduce government intervention in 
the economy 
the exchange posted a 148 percent overall gain in hectic 
trading on monday and a 66 percent gain at the close on tuesday 
according to the general index 
the first task of the newly elected lawmakers who convene april 
23 wil be to elect a president to replace sartzetakis whose term 
has expired 
mitsotakis said he would support veteran statesman constantine 
caramanlis for president but the 83yearold caramanlis president 
from 1980 to 1985 has not said whether he would agree to the 
candidacy 
it was the fourth time mitsotakis had led new democracy into 
elections after losing to the panhellenic socialist movement or 
pasok in 1985 and falling short of an absolute majority in last 
years june and november vote 
socialist leader andreas papandreou whose pasok finished second 
with 123 seats in parliament failed in his bid to become premier 
for the third time he led greece from 1981 to june 1989 until a 
conservativeleftist alliance unseated and indicted him for alleged 
corruption while in office no date has been set for papandreous 
trial 
the communistdominated coalition of the left and progress 
finished third with 19 seats losing two seats and the power 
brokers role it had hoped to play in an alliance with the 
socialists 
the remaining eight seats went to four independents two 
greekmoslems one environmentalist and the democratic renewal 
party

president mikhail s gorbachev has promised 
radical marketoriented reforms but his top economic adviser says 
public resistance must be overcome to push any drastic measures 
through parliament this year 
a promised economic package is still being drafted and 
discussed deputy prime minister leonid abalkin said monday 
offering no specifics on the shape it will take 
gorbachev said today he will meet with top advisers saturday to 
agree on the shape of the economic reform the soviet news agency 
tass reported 
the news agency quoted gorbachev as saying the meeting of his 
presidential council and the federation council should make 
difficult but essential decisions on the economy 
the 16member presidential council advises gorbachev under the 
presidential form of government instituted last month and is seen 
as a mechanism to transfer power from the communist party to the 
government the federation council is an advisory group focusing on 
issues relating between moscow and the soviet unions 15 republics 
gorbachev said the economic steps initially planned for 1992 and 
1993 should be taken this year and early next year tass reported 
without further elaboration 
on monday abalkin said the measures would accelerate a program 
for remolding the economy over five years approved in december by 
the congress of peoples deputies the full national legislature 
abalkin a top adviser to gorbachev said he expected a quick 
transition to a market economy would come up against powerful 
opposition but we must do it whether we like it or not 
the soviet people must understand that without painful economic 
reform the country has no future as a highly developed great 
power he said 
unless we go over to the new methods we will deprive 
ourselves and our children of a highly developed and efficient 
economy and a powerful country where people will want to live and 
which the people will not be ashamed of abalkin said 
in speaking of the measures under consideration abalkin 
repeatedly dodged specifics implying key decisions had not yet 
been made 
he said the state must lift controls on prices but would not 
specify which prices would be freed or when 
he also denied reports that some form of convertible ruble would 
be introduced by this summer he said experts believe the soviet 
market must have something to sell first and it will take years 
before the countrys currency will be convertible 
several officials have said the soviet union was considering a 
plan to provide a polishstyle shock therapy for the soviet 
economy which would boost prices drastically cut the value of the 
ruble and raise unemployment 
with the economy stalled part way between central planning and a 
market system industrial production fell 12 percent in the first 
quarter of 1990 compared with the last quarter of 1989 
the country is beset by serious consumer shortages 
in november gorbachev called for strict and unpopular measures 
to revive the faltering economy he reiterated that pledge last 
month when he was given sweeping new executive powers as president 
approved reforms to introduce a regulated market economy before 
1995 are being speeded up due to destabilization of the political 
system development of ethnic and regional conflicts and deficits 
in the consumer goods market abalkin said 
but any economic measures must be adopted by the supreme soviet 
the standing legislature before they can take effect 
a speedy transition to a market economy will come up against 
powerful opposition abalkin said we will have to make 
sacrifices but there must be a social consensus for that 
state price committee chief vyacheslav senchagov told lawmakers 
last week that among the three reform variants under consideration 
was the polish example of a crash transformation to a market 
economy 
poland hopes to keep the painful adjustment period short and 
its inflation rate has already fallen drastically from the 
tripledigit level of january

two federal agencies have agreed to a 1 
billion cleanup of the fernald uranium processing plant but a 
citizens watchdog group says it will monitor the progress with 
skepticism 
now what id like to see is it enforced and adhered to lisa 
crawford spokeswoman for fernald residents for environmental 
safety and health said monday i want them accountable to not 
violating the law and to not violating any deadlines 
the environmental protection agency and the department of energy 
signed an agreement monday to clean up the former uranium 
processing plant the agreement subject to justice department 
review replaces a 1986 pact between the epa and energy department 
that was based on outdated information 
valdas adamkus the epas regional administrator in chicago 
signed the agreement monday he said the epa will use it to ensure 
that the energy department properly handles the radioactive 
contamination at the feed materials production center 18 miles 
northwest of cincinnati the plant processed uranium for the 
governments production of nuclear weapons 
us epa will make sure us doe cleans up the fernald 
facility in an efficient complete and timely manner to protect 
human health and the environment adamkus said 
todays proposed agreement requires us doe to clean up the 
most contaminated areas on an accelerated schedule it also allows 
us doe the necessary time to investigate all environmental 
threats thoroughly and sets a realistically ambitious schedule for 
overall cleanup 
the agreement makes the epa administrator the final arbiter of 
disputes the epa added the fernald plant in november 1989 to the 
agencys national priority list of hazardouswaste sites 
investigations for the cleanup will cost at least 80 million 
the energy department projects the cleanup costs at 950 million 
during the next 12 years 
we dont have a lot of faith and a lot of trust ms 
crawford said fresh is still going to be here were going to 
hold them accountable 
the agreement would require the energy department to finish 
removing radioactively contaminated ground water from under plant 
buildings collect contaminated storm water runoff from ground 
waste pits contain contaminated water in the offsite paddys run 
creek and stabilize tanks containing radioactive residues from the 
governments world war ii manhattan project which helped develop 
the atomic bomb 
radioactive and nonradioactive wastes are stored on the site 
even though the plants private contractor westinghouse materials 
co of ohio stopped production in spring 1989 to concentrate on 
cleanup work 
federal investigators have found a variety of safety and 
management problems at the 16 major facilities in 12 states 
involved in making nuclear weapons and some have led to production 
shutdowns and interruptions 
the problems include poor training of safety inspectors at the 
hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash and the savannah 
river site near aiken sc inadequate fire protection at 
savannah river and alleged illegal dumping at the rocky flats 
plant located 16 miles northwest of denver

when a group of hasidic jews set fire to bread 
in a passover eve ritual on a brooklyn street firefighters rode up 
and doused the flames 
the satmar sect hasidim prayer books in hand protested but to 
no avail 
john mulligan a fire department spokesman said the 
firefighters were right to hose down the burning loaves 
generally our custom is to permit small fires but when they 
become dangerous we must put them out the new york post quoted 
mulligan as saying 
observant jews burn bread before passover to symbolize that 
their homes are free of prohibited food during the the eightday 
holiday

friends and relatives of britons held in lebanon 
welcomed todays release in beirut of a french woman her belgian 
boyfriend and their daughter but doubted it meant their loved ones 
will soon be freed 
four britons are believed held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
journalist john mccarthy retired pilot jack mann and terry 
waite the envoy of the archbishop of canterbury missing teacher 
brian keenan has irish and british citizenship 
the release of hostages of any nationality by any group is 
always very welcome news said a spokesman for archbishop robert 
runcie 
but the captors in this case are quite different to those 
holding the british hostages in lebanon so their release brings 
little direct comfort to the families of the british hostages 
beyond the hope that it might loosen up the situation of hostages 
in lebanon generally 
the three hostages set free today had been held by abu nidals 
radical palestinian group fatahrevolutionary council the britons 
are believed to be held by islamic jihad an umbrella organization 
for proiranian shiite moslems in lebanon 
john waite cousin of terry waite said its great and we 
are delighted that these three have been freed its wonderful and 
we send them our love its also a great boost that somebody has 
been released 
he said that because the britons were held by a different group 
i dont think it means we are going to see the release of any of 
our loved ones as a result of this 
but i hope that it shows things are cooling down a little and 
that people are realizing that hostages have got to be released 
because they get nobody anywhere he said 
chris pearson president of the group friends of john mccarthy 
said given the nature of their kidnapping that they were taken 
by the abu nidal group it probably has little effect on the 
british hostages in beirut 
i dont think it means the western hostages in beirut are any 
nearer release but if the suggestion is that there is a more 
hopeful mood in the lebanon then we would be a little bit 
encouraged 
waite was captured while negotiating the release of hostages 
with islamic jihad in january 1987 mccarthy a journalist with 
londonbased worldwide television news and keenan were seized in 
april 1986 mann was taken hostage last may

the soviet union today welcomed a new 
international accord committing it to freemarket oriented economic 
reforms but pressed the west to loosen its restrictions on 
hightechnology exports 
stepan sitarian a deputy premier praised a document that was 
endorsed monday by the soviet union and 34 other nations attending 
a major economic conference in the west german capital 
many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the 
bonn document are in line with our philosophy of perestroika and 
have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the soviet 
union sitarian said as the 35nation conference on economic 
cooperation in europe winded down 
on monday the 35 nations participating at the bonn conference 
all the european countries except albania plus the united states 
and canada informally endorsed a document committing them to back 
private property free enterprise and multiparty democracy 
such a move would have been unthinkable only months ago but it 
was made possible by the wave of democratic and economic reforms 
sweeping across eastern europe 
sitarian also pressed for eastwest talks on loosening up the 
socalled cocom restrictions on sales of western technology to the 
east bloc 
cocom should no longer remain a sacred cow he said 
we propose that eastwest consultations begin on rules to 
govern the transfer of dualpurpose technology said sitarian 
referring to technology that can be used for both military and 
civilian purposes 
cocom stands for the 17nation coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls 
the cocom nations are working on proposals for loosening 
restrictions on technology sales to reforming eastern european 
countries however the united states has indicated it will take a 
tougher stand on technology sales to the soviet union 
sitarian said moscow considered the bonn meeting a major 
milestone in the process of intensified eastwest cooperation 
that began with the helsinki conference on security and cooperation 
in europe in 1975 
he said we seek to integrate ourselves into the world economy 
in a dynamic fashion and on a large scale and added the soviets 
want an open type of economy 
he also said changes at home and abroad bring us closer to a 
key objective namely the convertibility of the ruble but he did 
not elaborate 
economic experts from the 35 nations have been meeting in bonn 
since march 19 to examine ways of improving eastwest cooperation 
and helping with the reconstruction of eastern europe 
the bonn conference ends on wednesday

two editors active in antiabortion 
groups were fired for violating a small daily newspapers policy 
against employees serving as officers of politically active groups 
that receive news coverage 
thats two out of a staff of four reporters thats half my 
staff the fairfield ledgers editor jan nierling said today 
the two were fired monday after refusing to resign their 
positions as secretary and president of the recently formed 
southeast iowa prolifers nierling said

a federal appeals court has upheld the 
legality of an fbi agents getting a photo shop to sell him copies 
of snapshots taken by american indian movement leader vernon 
bellecourt 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
refused monday to overturn a lower federal courts ruling that 
dismissed the suit 
c peter erlinder bellecourts attorney said he plans to ask 
the us supreme court to review the case or request that the 
entire court in the 8th circuit rehear it 
the appeals panel ruled that bellecourt had given up his right 
to privacy when he dropped his film off at a shop in minneapolis 
that had a processing machine located next to a glass wall the 
transparent wall allowed anyone to observe the photos briefly as 
they were being printed at the fstop one hour photo store 
a clerk at the store agreed to sell a duplicate set of pictures 
to an fbi agent who had been trailing bellecourt the clerk later 
told the indian leader about the duplicate photos and bellecourt 
sued the fbi 
the appeals panel ruled that bellecourts use of the fstop for 
photo processing exposed his photographs to the public sufficiently 
to defeat his claim to fourth amendment privacy protection 
with this ruling it appears there are a lot of places that 
people go to in their everyday lives that now are potential 
government information pickup points erlinder said 
bellecourt has charged that the fbis action was harassment 
aimed at him because of his involvement in central american 
politics 
the photos bellecourt said included pictures taken when he 
attended the first congress of indian organizations in panama city 
panama in march 1989 bellecourt said he feared that the fbi or 
cia would circulate pictures of congress participants who could 
later become targets of death squads in central america 
bellecourt said he will appeal the decision he said he believes 
the ruling is a threat to everyones privacy and may open the way 
for federal agents to seize written material such as copies being 
made at a photocopying shop 
i think its very dangerous and must be seen as an erosion of 
our fourth amendment rights he said 
the judges on the appeals panel were john r gibson george g 
fagg and pasco m bowman

city police dogs may land in kennels because of a 
lawsuit by officers who claim providing free afterhours care for 
their fourlegged coworkers is a dogs life 
were looking at other ways to cut costs police spokeswoman 
tina vicini said monday theres nothing definite yet 
about 70 officers are suing the city for more than 1 million in 
back pay they claim they are owed for three years under the fair 
labor standards act for taking care of dogs in their department 
federal laws are passed for everybody and the city of chicago 
is not immune said john dineen president of the fraternal order 
of police which filed the lawsuit in us district court 
since the police dog unit started 29 years ago the city has 
saved money by having the canine officers take their partners home 
after a days work 
the city provides small backyard kennels and pays for dog food 
and the use of police station wagons but the city does not pay the 
officers for the time they spend taking care of the dogs 
i have to walk rocky give him baths brush him and a lot 
more said patrol officer walter tamberlin it comes to about 
an hour and a half beyond my regular shifts we even take care of 
them after theyve retired 
the city maintains the officers have the perquisite of having a 
pet without the costs 
the vet bills are paid plus they have a watch dog on the 
premises now they want to get paid for feeding the dog miss 
vicini said 
a similar lawsuit in detroit was settled by awarding officers 45 
minutes of overtime a day totaling about 4000 a year said a 
detroit police spokesman 
stephen feinberg an attorney for the chicago officers said the 
citys policy clearly violates the dictates of the fair labor 
standards act which has applied to municipal employees since 1986 
they are providing a service for the city said feinberg 
the city would not be able to kennel the dogs for free 
miss vicini would not comment about how much the city saves by 
having the dogs stay with their handlers

angry farmers blocked highways in four 
towns for a second day today to stop officials from destroying 
150000 pigs to combat an outbreak of swine plague 
the farmers complain that the preventive killing of healthy pigs 
will bankrupt them officials said the government was considering 
suspending enforcement of the order in the four towns to prevent 
the removal of the pigs 
over the weekend the government ordered all pigs destroyed 
within a halfmile radius around farms that have been hit by the 
contagious disease since march 15 
it promised to refund farmers the full price of the destroyed 
pigs but the offer was termed insufficient by farmers who say the 
cost to restart from scratch is much higher 
the measure affects some 200 pig farms in the provinces of west 
and east flanders in belgiums dutchspeaking northern half 
the governments action has sparked farmer protests from the 
beginning the mayors of farming towns have barred the 
transportation of pigs to slaughterhouses arguing it disturbed 
the public peace 
the belgian measure affects 150000 pigs the european community 
has offered to refund farmers for the voluntary killing of another 
380000 animals in areas beyond those of the belgian program 
if fully carried out the ec eradication program due to start 
on thursday will cost an estimated 169 million 
the swine plague started in midjanuary and is still running out 
of control officials said

growing congestion could bring air travel in 
western europe to a near standstill within the next 10 years 
unless air space management is radically reorganized a report 
released today warned 
the congestion has already caused serious problems said the 
report which was prepared for the international air transport 
association or iata one out of every four flights was delayed by 
more than 15 minutes last year costing the industry about 5 
billion for additional fuel and other expenses it said 
with european air traffic expected to double to 500 million 
passengers by the year 2000 and to triple by 2010 present capacity 
of the transport system will be unable to cope with increases in 
air travel past 1995 it said 
the report which has been sent to all governments concerned is 
based on a oneyear study conducted by iata and compiled by sri 
international the us based consulting firm 
of the three major airport areas london frankfurt and 
paris only paris has excess capacity it said no solution is 
seen for frankfurts capacity shortfall passenger growth at the 
three london area airports will exceed terminal capacity by the 
mid1990s and aircraft movement will exceed runway capacity by 
the year 2004 
without enhancement 16 west european airports will be unable 
to accommodate air traffic demand in the year 2000 according to a 
summary of runway capacities included in the report 
in the order of seriousness those airports include madrid 
frankfurt londongatwick londonheathrow barcelona 
milanlinate duesseldorf dublin stockholm athens palma de 
mallorca geneva manchester marseille copenhagen and hamburg 
the report said by implementing potential improvements most 
airports could meet the demand forecast but it stressed that this 
would require overcoming political environmental and financial 
obstacles 
iata director general guenter eser who presented the report 
agreed at a news conference that fighting environmental concerns 
will be an uphill battle commenting on the airspace situation the 
report said one of the most serious problems is the increasing 
complexity of an air traffic control system that has to cope with a 
steadily increasing number of aircraft 
it also pointed to the fast growing numer of airway 
intersections and called for the creation of new routes to minimize 
such crossing traffic 
the necessary drastic restructuring should include sectors 
reserved up top now for military use the report stressed 
a radical reorganization of the way in which west european 
airspace is urgent and essential if the regions air transport 
system is not to be brought to a near standstill in the late 1990s 
because of congestion it summed up 
it called for an early international conference of all 
governments airlines and international aviation organizations 
including iata which groups 190 airlines including all of the 
worlds major carriers 
such a conference the report said should discuss ways and 
means of tackling the problem before it is too late 
eser said the recent political changes in eastern europe and the 
resulting improved eastwest relations would make the carriers gain 
a lot of additiona airspace he noted that almost the entire 
area along the border between east and west germany is closed to 
commercial traffic 
norman jackson head of iatas technical division said that in 
contacts with military air control authorities during the past 18 
months we have seen quite an effort on their part to help us 
we have had access to military air space to which we had no access 
before

lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis today 
appealed to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev not to carry out 
threatened political and economic measures against his 
independenceminded baltic republic 
gorbachev seemed to soften his stance today saying he would 
impose direct presidential rule in lithuania only as an extreme 
measure and that a political solution was still being sought 
the statements came on the eve of the onemonth anniversary of 
lithuanias declaration of independence and one day after gorbachev 
and his presidential council warned of unspecified political and 
economic measures if the declaration was not rescinded 
lithuania said last week it would not repeal the march 11 
declaration as a condition for negotiations with the kremlin which 
so far has taken limited steps to maintain control over the 
republic 
landsbergis sent a telegram today to gorbachev addressing him 
as esteemed president 
we are very concerned that ultrarightist imperial forces are 
compelling you to take a wrong step to continue the wrongs of the 
1940s in the baltics the telegram continued do not further 
this please in the name of peace justice and concord on earth 
do not do this 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 along 
with the other baltic republics estonia and latvia which have 
declared their intention to seek independence but are proceeding 
more cautiously than lithuania 
at a meeting today with delegates to a conference of young 
communists gorbachev described the lithuanian parliaments march 
11 action as an adventure but also said he did not regard the 
situation as irreversible the official tass news agency reported 
while he did not rule out the possibility of introducing 
presidential rule in the republic he said he would do so only as 
an extreme measure if the situation develops into civil conflict 
tass reported he also said moscow was trying to find a political 
solution to the problem 
gorbachev has ordered lithuanians to surrender their firearms 
and warned the republic not to form border patrols soviet troops 
have arrested some lithuanians who deserted the red army and they 
have also occupied several public buildings in the republic 
after a meeting last week between lithuanian representatives and 
a major gorbachev adviser politburo member alexander n yakovlev 
however both sides made conciliatory statements 
but on sunday lithuanians prevented hundreds of soviet soldiers 
from entering a plant that prints proindependence newspapers 
promoscow communists had ordered the plant closed 
the republic also told its young men who will be called up in 
the soviet draft this spring that it is up to them whether they 
want to serve 
in moscow lawmakers opposing lithuanias independence drive 
asked gorbachev to dissolve the lithuanian legislature and 
reiterated its demand for direct presidential rule over the 
republic 
in estonia on monday leaders said they send draft responses to 
gorbachevs criticism of their bid for independence to legislative 
committees for debate a local journalist said on condition of 
anonymity 
estonia has said soviet rule in the republic constitutes 
occupation of an independent country the baltic stte voted to 
reestablish independence after a stillundefined transition 
period gorbachev has demanded estonia back down 
and in latvia the new communist party chief alfreds rubiks 
asked members not to follow lithuanians and estonians by 
establishing an independent party 
at a party congress over the weekend most delegates voted to 
keep party ties with moscow the minority wants an independent 
communist party and moved to establish it this month 
anatolijs gorbunovs president of latvias parliament said 
monday that he is certain latvian legislators will vote to secede 
from the soviet union when they meet next month

do you remember what it was like 
when you were 5 years old and it was christmas eve asked 
astronomer phillippe crane jr explaining why he was so excited to 
be at kennedy space center 
today was the day when the hubble space telescope was to ride 
into space aboard space shuttle discovery and crane of the 
european southern observatory in munich germany was one of 
hundreds of astronomers who wanted to be here for the big event 
they were left disappointed however when the launch was 
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a problem with an 
auxiliary power unit 
once the telescope goes into orbit it is expected to 
revolutionize astronomy 
its a mixture of all the emotions excitement nervousness 
belief and disbelief princeton professor edward l groth iii 
said monday 
both astronomers who have been involved with the hubble project 
since 1977 study galaxies 
how did galaxies form how did we all get here groth asked 
there are many competing theories but no solid observations 
hubble will put another piece in the puzzle 
when you get the answer to a question youve been asking you 
push back the frontier he said it is going to be very 
exciting for us all 
although astronomers expect unexpected discoveries by hubble 
crane said i dont think it is going to be as dramatic as 
voyager 
astronomers were astonished by voyagers pictures of saturn 
neptune jupiter and uranus 
the telescope named for the late american astronomer edwin p 
hubble will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and 
with 10 times greater clarity than groundbased observatories 
this is one of those incredible milestones this is something 
that literally hundreds of astronomers have been working on and 
hundreds are waiting for the chance to work on it said nasa 
scientist stephen p maran 
the hubble is receiving considerable attention from amateurs 
too 
the only thing that compares in public interest that i have 
seen in 30 years as an astronomer is halleys comet maran said

parties working to form east germanys first 
noncommunist government haggled today over unfilled cabinet 
positions including economic minister a key role in how fast the 
country shifts to capitalism 
the dominant conservative alliance favors quickly scrapping the 
communist system and unifying with west germany as soon as 
possible while the social democrats want moregradual 
privatization and cuts in subsidies 
we made a good bit of headway prime ministerdesignate 
lothar de maiziere told reporters after this mornings negotiating 
session 
the christian democratic leader said there were still some 
issues to be ironed out but stressed he will present a complete 
cabinet list to parliament at its next session thursday 
on monday the talks produced a 24member cabinet list that would 
give 14 seats to de maizieres threeparty alliance the leftist 
social democrats would get seven posts and a smaller liberal 
alliance three 
but only 11 of the seats actually were filled on monday among 
those not named was the economics minister who is to be a 
christian democrat 
the division of cabinet seats came after five days of talks with 
the social democrats who finished second to the christian 
democrats in east germanys first free elections on march 18 
the proposed cabinet brings together the major political parties 
and includes a wellknown peace activist as defense minister and a 
lutheran pastor as foreign minister 
hanswilhem ebeling the designated minister for economic 
cooperation from the german social union a party in de maizieres 
alliance said negotiators had another night or two of work ahead 
before the list was complete 
the christian and social democrats still must harmonize their 
differing views on unification with west germany the top priority 
of the new government at stake for east germans is how much of the 
socialist welfare state will remain once the two countries merge 
accustomed to generous food and housing subsidies east germans 
are unsettled by the probable loss of many state benefits as their 
country makes the transition to a marketoriented economy 
the tough job of hammering out agreement on union of the east 
and west german currencies falls to the finance minister social 
democrat walter romberg nominated for the job pledged monday to 
fight for a 1to1 conversion of east german marks to west german 
marks 
a west german central bank proposal last month that most 
exchanges be made at a 2to1 conversion drew angry protests in 
east germany 
agreement on the cabinet is a major hurdle that could finally 
put in place a democratic government to replace the communist 
caretaker administration that has been running the country since 
last octobers prodemocracy revolt 
social democrat leader markus meckel was nominated to the

nelson mandela will lead an 
11member african national congress delegation in groundbreaking 
talks next month with the government on ending whiteminority rule 
the organization said tuesday 
following the may 24 talks mandela will embark on a series of 
foreign trips to at least nine countries including the united 
states the soviet union and several african and european nations 
the anc said 
next months discussions are designed to clear the way for 
formal negotiations on a new constitution that will give the 
28million black majority a share of power in the country 
it is vital that this meeting achieve the necessary results in 
terms of removing the obstacles that continue to stand in the way 
of negotiations the anc said in a statement from its exile 
headquarters in lusaka zambia 
the anc has said those obstacles include lifting the state of 
emergency allowing exiles to return to south africa and releasing 
antiapartheid activists convicted of politically motivated crimes 
the government which had previously announced the dates for the 
talks has made clear that several black opposition groups in 
addition to the anc will be invited to take part in the formal 
negotiations on a new constitution 
the anc founded in 1912 has never held formal negotiations 
with the whiteminority government although mandela has met with 
president fw de klerk and his predecessor pw botha 
the talks originally were set for april 11 but the anc called 
off that meeting to protest a march 26 police shooting that left at 
least 11 protesters dead in sebokeng a township south of 
johannesburg 
the anc delegation will include leaders from inside the country 
such as walter sisulu and ahmed kathrada they were released last 
year after more than 26 years in prison 
exile leaders named to take part in the talks include anc 
secretarygeneral alfred nzo the commander of the ancs military 
wing joe modise and the director of international affairs thabo 
mbeki 
the anc did not release the exact dates of mandelas trips 
however they will begin after the discussions with the government 
and last until early july 
in addition to the united states and the soviet union mandela 
is scheduled to visit france west germany canada egypt angola 
nigeria and algeria 
de klerk released mandela in february after the black 
nationalist leader spent 27 years in prison for sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the government mandela was named deputy 
president of the anc after his release 
also in february de klerk legalized the anc and more than 60 
other black opposition groups as part of his effort to launch 
negotiations 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups want a oneperson 
onevote democracy de klerk has opposed this saying it will 
replace white domination with black domination 
de klerk envisions a mechanism that would allow whites to 
maintain veto power on major policy decisions

trailer about a quartermile north of the border and seven miles 
west of the crossing at naco chief patrol agent ronald j dowdy 
said

loading them into the trailer they staked out the trailer for two 
hours before moving in for the arrests according to gerald b 
murphy who is in charge of the drug enforcement adminstrations 
tucson operations 
its very common for them to stash the drugs somewhere on this 
side of the border in a pickup or a camper or just burying it 
and come back to pick it up later dowdy said 
the agents confiscated 3192 pounds of cocaine officials said 
ms parker said investigators did not know where the cocaine

voters cast ballots today in a runoff 
election for the democratic gubernatorial nomination after a 
bruising campaign of namecalling and charges of drug use 
but in their final campaign stops attorney general jim mattox 
and state treasurer ann richards on monday talked about party unity 
we are all going to be unified in november and we are going 
to seize the governors mansion back ms richards said in san 
antonio on monday 
mattox told backers in dallas that he would consider including 
ms richards in his administration i think that theres a place 
for all of us within this democratic party each of our talents 
he said 
morning voter turnout was heavy at some southern texas precincts 
and light to moderate in a few larger counties that lacked hot 
local races mark toohey of the secretary of states office said 
state election officials predicted a turnout tuesday of 1 
million to 11 million voters for both parties 
statewide we had 23 million voting in the primary march 
13 said toohey usually the dropoff or fall off the primary to 
the runoff is 50 percent or more and the figures now are tracking 
that 
the winner of the runoff between mattox and ms richards will 
face republican oilmanrancher clayton williams in the general 
election williams won the gop nomination outright last month 
capturing more than 61 percent of the vote 
gov bill clements a republican is retiring 
the bitter democratic campaign raged over the last month after 
mattox 46 and ms richards 56 bested a sevenperson primary 
field 
mattox has accused ms richards of using illegal drugs im 
saying that she used cocaine at the age of 46 and marijuana and 
she used other drugs he said while refusing to offer evidence 
ms richards underwent treatment for alcoholism in 1980 and said 
she has not had a moodaltering chemical since she denied 
seeking treatment for cocaine use adding mr mattox is telling 
lies in this campaign 
but much of mondays campaigning whirlwind tours of the state 
by both candidates lacked the nastiness that permeated both 
campaigns in recent days 
ms richards in midland called for improvements in education 
criticizing clements for failing to provide leadership to change 
the current system for financing public schools the system was 
declared unconstitutional by the texas supreme court 
mattox meanwhile told members of dallas progressive voters 
league that a state lottery is the only way to raise needed state 
revenue without an additional tax increase

as many as 500 people starved to 
death last month in northwestern afghanistan because of famine 
caused by war weather and locusts western diplomats said tuesday 
humanitarian aid workers based in the border city of peshawar 
pakistan began issuing famine warnings late last year one 
agricultural expert tom morrison said the situation is so bad it 
might not be possible to save those who remain in the stricken 
areas of herat badghis and faryab provinces 
the infestation of locusts and other pests is very very 
severe indeed said morrison director of agrisystems nordic ab 
sweden a swedish agricultural research firm 
it is so serious that i think the only way to cure it is for 
everyone to leave and starve it out he said 
a western diplomat who refused to be identified quoted refugee 
sources as saying as many as 500 people may have died of hunger in 
faryab province and that hundreds of families have fled because of 
a shortage of food 
about 35 million afghans have gone to pakistan to escape the 
civil war since 1979 when soviet soldiers intervened in 
afghanistan to help the government fight moslem insurgents another 
2 million fled to iran 
aid workers expect most people in search of food will go to 
iran because pakistan is several weeks walks away from the 
northern provinces 
the famine has been blamed on several things 
the 11yearold civil war farmers either joined the 
usbacked rebel fighters or were conscripted into the army 
pesticide spraying which has been suspended because most of 
the countryside is controlled by rebel fighters according to 
morrisons firm the government has 800 tons of pesticides but has 
released only 300 tons 
inadequately prepared humanitarian aid groups 
late spring frost 
government which has used nomad tribesman to buy up grain from 
the upper herat valley and horde it in kabul in addition hundreds 
of thousands of tons of donated grain have either been siphoned by 
the government for distribution in kabul or taken by rebel 
fighters 
a big problem is that aid workers will not venture into the 
isolated towns where residents are starving said bruce wannell a 
british national and researcher who is employed by a variety of 
groups on a contract basis 
he said a 12 billion un relief program to aid afghans can 
boast only paper successes 
they have no people on the ground who know the area who have 
real linguistic skilles he said they take blind assurances 
that everything is working well and being distributed but even the 
people in the cities are going hungry 
a un worker who asked not to be identified agreed saying the 
united nations is incapable of dealing with the rawness of 
afghanistan where there are no organizations to implement its 
programs 
wannell who speaks the local persian language returned to 
pakistan in early march after several months interviewing peasants 
farmers moslem rebel fighters and progovernment militia 
the people hit hardest by the famine are in villages surrounded 
by jagged rocks and accessible only by horse or mule said wannell 
aid groups are reluctant to venture into areas where they cannot 
drive he said 
a farmer in a small village in herat recalled an afternoon in 
the spring of 1972 when he had to bury 70 people who had died of 
hunger and he said things are worse now said wannell

men are catching up at least in numbers the 
census bureau said tuesday that the number of men grew faster than 
the number of women in the 80s something that hasnt happened 
since the first decade of this century 
death rates for men declined more rapidly than for women 
extending male lifespans and allowing their population to increase 
more rapidly than women the new study disclosed 
cancer deaths increased among women while dropping for men 
pointing to increased smoking by women beginning in the 1960s as a 
likely factor in the change a census expert said 
the male population outgrew the female population in every age 
group under age 85 frederick w hollmann of the census bureau 
reported 
from 1980 to 1989 the number of men in the nation increased by 
10557000 while the female population grew 10448000 the bureau 
reported 
even so women continue to outnumber men in america 127 million 
to 121 million the report showed 
the last decade in which the number of men increased faster than 
women was 19001910 the census bureau noted 
the balance of population is determined not only by the number 
of people born but by the number of years they remain alive 
explained hollmann in a telephone interview 
more male babies are born than females he pointed out but 
generally a sort of equilibrium is reached since males dont live 
as long as females 
the higher death rate for men means that although they outnumber 
women at birth women surpass men in total numbers later on 
one consequence of males increasing faster than females in the 
1980s was that in 1989 there were more men than women at each age 
group below 34 in 1980 men had been more numerous only through age 
26 hollmann reported 
hollmann said a major contributor to the males outpacing females 
in the 1980s was the change in death rates 
male life expectency has continued to improve gradually during 
the decade female life expectency has improved very little since 
1982 
life expectency for men increased from 709 in 1982 to 715 
years in 1987 an improvement of sixtenths of a year he noted 
during the same time period life expectency for women went up only 
onetenth of a year from 782 to 783 
the reason seems to be changing patterns of disease as more and 
more women took up smoking and moved into traditionally 
maledominated jobs and lifestyles hollmann commented 
you could suggest that a lot of women took up smoking back in 
the 1960s so the difference between men and women in smoking 
behavior tended to converge somewhat said hollmann if behavior 
between the sexes is converging then you have to expect 
mortality rates to converge also 
there is a time lag between the time someone takes up smoking 
and the time they come to highest risk of death he said 
accounting for the change in comparative death rates in the 1980s 
between 1982 and 1986 for example the cancer death rate for 
males declined from 1648 deaths per 100000 men to 1636 for 
women the rate increased from 1095 to 1114 
for heart disease the death rate for men declined from 2644 
per 100000 to 2382 women had a smaller decline from 1325 to 
1246 
and deaths from cerebrovascular disease fell from 392 to 335 
per 100000 men from 1982 to 1986 while for women the drop was 
from 332 to 290 also a smaller decline than for men 
the census study used mortality data from the national center 
for health statistics a division of the department of health and 
human services 
while the study did not include a breakdown by sex for 
immigration hollmann said that was also a contributing factor to 
the increase in males refugees coming into the country tended to 
include more males than females during the 1980s he said

the problem was the environmental protection agency had listed 
extracted teeth as medical waste to be pulverized and sterilized 
not stuck under a pillow so the tooth fairy could replace it with 
money 
but the michigan dental association and dentists successfully 
argued that teeth should be excluded from the states own hazardous 
medical waste list and the epa went along 
a plainwell dentist dr robert tisch brought the problem to 
the attention of state sen jack welborn 
i said do you guys realize youre outlawing the tooth 
fairy tisch said 
dentists across the state joined the protest 
the dentists had more than the potential disappointment of their 
young patients to back them up though 
william burke assistant executive director of the dental 
association explained that dental schools need teeth for study 
because fluoride has cut the number of cavities youngsters get 
schools have a hard time obtaining decayed teeth he explained 
michigan opted out of a twoyear epa pilot program to track 
medical wastes and adopted its own package which does not include 
teeth 
the epa before adopting its final rules as to what constitutes 
hazardous medical waste also decided to drop teeth from the list 
there arent too many things we can save in the legislature 
but thank god we can save the tooth fairy welborn said

there is no indication how dogs will 
react but albertville plans to place a nickelplated fire hydrant 
on a granite slab in front of the chamber of commerce office 
wednesday 
its the millionth hydrant to come off the mueller cos 
assembly line since the plant opened in the northern alabama city 
15 years ago 
city council has proclaimed albertville the fire hydrant 
capital of the world 
when you consider how many fire hydrants there are the fact 
that more than 40 percent of all the hydrants being installed today 
come from this small alabama city is quite remarkable said lloyd 
darnell the plant manager 
albertville has about 20000 people 
muellers annual payroll is 115 million it turns out more 
than 400 hydrants a day destined for points in much of the world 
darnell reckons he knows just about everything there is to know 
about fire hydrants except one thing i never figured out why 
dogs like them

some of the governments promises to make the 
economy more accessible to american companies face an uphill fight 
and officials say it is hard to estimate how much the reform will 
help trim a huge us trade deficit 
in the long term it will definitely positively affect our 
trade imbalance but we are not sure of the amount of 
improvement said hidehiko nishiyama deputy director of the 
americaoceania division of the ministry of international trade and 
industry 
in a report last week on usjapanese negotiations japan 
promised to spend more money on public works reform business 
practices that limit competition and change tax laws to make more 
commercial land available at lower prices a final and more 
detailed report is due in july 
the government could run into resistance from the opposition 
socialists owners of small businesses and corporate groups that 
have cozy relationships 
i dont know how long it will take before the effects begin to 
show up said noriko hama of mitsubishi research institute 
a lot of political and administrative problems have to be 
cleared up we are just standing at the front door she added 
in recent years japans sales in the united states have 
exceeded us sales in japan by about 50 billion a year 
immediate promises include increased public works spending in 
the budget for the fiscal year that began april 1 under japanese 
law the governing liberal democratic partys majority in the lower 
house of parliament is enough to ensure it has its way in deciding 
the budget 
they also include an easing of restrictions on opening new 
largescale retail stores tighter enforcement of antimonopoly 
laws and a close inspection of preferential supply arrangements 
among groups of companies 
some of the provisions on stores however would require 
approval by parliament even within the governing party there is 
concern about alienating traditional party supporters among japans 
16 million small retailers 
the largescale retail stores law and so on involve very 
difficult domestic political elements so i am not so optimistic as 
to the prospect of gaining consensus or endorsement from the 
congress as far as the administration is concerned we are 
determined to do whatever we made public said taizo watanabe 
the foreign ministrys spokesman 
local governments also could maintain regulations to protect 
smaller retailers from competition by big stores us officials 
say the present law is a barrier to foreign stores and that larger 
japanese stores are more likely to carry foreign products 
large retailers have welcomed the proposed changes but have 
noted that high land prices a labor shortage and rising 
construction costs could frustrate expansion plans 
over the longer term japan pledged efforts to solve tax laws 
and other regulations that keep some land underutilized and drive 
up prices increase fines for antimonopoly law violations look 
into simplifying merger and acquisition procedures and formulate a 
10year plan of increased spending on such things as housing 
sewers parks airports and port facilities 
it also said however that yearbyyear public works spending 
would be decided flexibly to avoid inflation and overheating the 
economy 
the leading opposition party the socialist party has supported 
bigger public works spending but added that it must be 
concentrated on improving the peoples livelihood it also has 
favored a greater role for local governments in retail store 
regulations 
enforcement of the antimonopoly laws and the new task of 
regular checks on japans keiretsu or corporate groups would 
depend on the fair trade commission an agency that so far has not 
enjoyed high status and has not rushed to prosecute offenders 
agency figures for the fiscal years 19841988 show no criminal 
charges filed in fiscal 1988 the commission looked into 180 
cases and in only five told companies that they were violating the 
law and had to stop 
japan pledged that the commission would more actively press 
criminal charges and said its fiscal 1990 budget calls for 
expanding the number of investigators to 154 from the present 129 
meanwhile it said the commission would take steps against 
exclusionary practices uncovered in analyses to be conducted of 
keiretsu activities 
some japanese say these groups of companies that hold each 
others stock and supply each other with goods and services 
actually are like a major us corporation such as general motors 
composed of many divisions 
us officials and businessmen complain that transactions within 
such groups freeze out foreign suppliers and the groups structure 
makes it hard for foreigners to invest in japan 
on the question of dealings based on personal ties masahiko 
ishizuka an editorial writer for the economic newspaper nihon 
keizai shimbun quoted one japanese executive as saying of his 
customers as long as facetoface relations remain intact 
prices are irrelevant they will continue to buy from us 
irrespective of prices virtually shutting out newcomers

the palestinian terrorist group led by 
abu nidal today freed a french woman a belgian man and the 
daughter born to them in captivity the couple had been seized from 
a french yacht nearly 2 years ago 
jacqueline valente 32 fernand houtekins 43 and 2yearold 
sophieliberte were released by masked gunmen who sped up to the 
main gate of the french embassy in three cars with drawn curtains 
police said 
i embrace all my family i am well and the little one also 
ms valente told french reporters who were given exclusive access 
to the three the family later took off for france in a chartered 
executive jet 
because the hostages released today were believed to have been 
held in libya the case is considered unrelated to the 18 
westerners held hostage in lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem 
factions 
todays release came about a month after france sent to libya 
three mirage f1 warplanes that libya purchased in 1986 the sale 
had been blocked by the french government as part of an arms 
embargo imposed when france aided chad in fighting against libya 
there was no public explanation by france for its decision to 
release the planes 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said abu nidals group was 
distancing itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing 
the hostages libyas official news agency jana reported today 
last week gadhafi urged the release of hostages in the middle 
east as a humanitarian gesture for ramadan the islamic holy month 
he singled out ms valente 
gadhafi has supported abu nidal who along with some of his 
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad the 
libyan leader is believed to have allowed him to live near the 
libyan capital tripoli 
houtekins said today that the four members of his family still 
held by the terrorist group were also well 
they have morale they are holding firm he said adding 
we expected our freedom we knew it was coming one day the day 
of our freedom has arrived for those who stay behind we keep 
hoping 
the two accompanied by their daughter refused to discuss 
certain other subjects including the death of their second child 
in captivity or their living conditions while they were hostages 
a police spokesman said french ambassader rene ala apparently 
had advance notice of the release ala was waiting at a cement 
outpost manned by french marine guards near the main gate of the 
west beirut compound 
french embassy spokesman francois abi saab said the three were 
ok he said houtekins was clean shaven and looked relaxed 
hours after the release walid khaled spokesman for the 
terrorist group the fatahrevolutionary council drove to the 
french embassy and said he would release a statement after my 
talks with french diplomats 
the abu nidal group announced on nov 8 1987 it had seized 
hostages from the french yacht silco in the mediterranean off the 
gaza strip it accused them of collaborating with israels mossad 
intelligence agency friends said the group was on a holiday cruise 
the group acknowledged holding valente 32 sophie and five 
belgians houtekins his brother emmanuel and emmanuels wife and 
teenage daughter and son a boy born to ms valente in captivity 
in march 1989 died shortly after birth french government sources 
said 
khaled had said monday three european hostages would be freed by 
the end of ramadan about april 26 depending on when the new moon 
is sighted jan hollants van loocke a belgian official said at 
the same news conference he was in lebanon to negotiate the 
belgians release 
he said the abu nidal group had linked freedom for the four 
other belgians to the release of nasser saeed a palestinian 
jailed in belgium for a june 1980 grenade attack on jewish youths 
in antwerp a 15yearold was killed in the attack and 20 people 
injured the belgian government has not yet responded to the offer 
saeed is serving a life term 
two other daughters of ms valente were freed after libyan 
intervention on dec 29 1988 daughter marielaure was 6 at the 
time and virginie was 5 they were returned to their father pascal 
betille divorced from ms valente 
the two girls surfaced in libya where the others were believed 
held 
early today masked gunmen stood guard in two cars at a nearby 
traffic circle as the three cars carrying the hostages approached 
the french embassy 
the gunmen did not disembark the doors were opened and 
ferdinand houtekins emerged first wearing a gray suit and carrying 
the baby daughter the police spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
ms valente was next they walked into the embassy 
handinhand as about 10 embassy guards armed with automatic 
rifles watched he said 
ms valente was wearing a black leather jacket and beige skirt 
while the child was all in white 
ala came out of the guard post shook hands with houtekins and 
ms valente and they walked across the embassy garden to the 
offices the spokesman said 
a french guard said on condition of anonymity the three were 
served breakfast of instant coffee jam and croissants 
in france jacquelines mother brigitte valente said the 
nightmare is over and im trembling with joy i cant even talk 
its too beautiful 
the mother and daughter had a brief conversation broadcast on 
french radio 
frances foreign minister credited gadhafi with the freeing of 
the hostages and expressed satisfaction with the libyan leader for 
this noble and humanitarian gesture 
its real value will be appreciated in the future of relations 
between france and libya roland dumas said he expressed hope 
the remaining four belgians would be released without delay 
in brussels today foreign minister mark eyskens said he hoped 
the release can be considered as a testimony of good faith 
concerning the release of the other hostages 
the fatahrevolutionary council has been blamed for scores of 
terrorist acts including the december 1985 attacks on rome and 
vienna airports that killed more than 20 people and the september 
1986 attack on an istanbul synagogue in which 21 worshipers died 
the westerners missing in lebanon are eight americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped in west 
beirut on march 16 1985

the communist party opened a hastily 
called congress tuesday with a call for reform to maintain its 
70yearold grip on power in the face of a growing prodemocracy 
movement 
it means a radical transformation of party structure of its 
internal relations its principles of activity and methods of 
work general secretary gombojavyn ochirbat told the 926 
delegates 
sluggish reaction to the new situation will amount to 
suicide he said in an hourlong televised speech 
the congress is expected to last three days during which 
delegates are charged with meeting the challenge from new 
opposition groups who have organized massive protests 
the organizations were inspired by the collapse of communist 
parties in eastern europe and reform in the soviet union mongolia 
which lies between china and the soviet union has long been a 
satellite of moscow 
the mongolian parliament on march 23 abolished the communist 
partys monopoly on power and approved of elections with more than 
one candidate elections are tentatively scheduled for july 
the move followed the soviet communist partys move to give up 
its monopoly on power 
ochirbat told the congress the time has come to end dictatorial 
party control over trade unions religion art science and mass 
organizations 
but he said the police force and army should remain in party 
hands 
opposition groups have demanded the army serve the government 
not the ruling party 
ochirbat also said the party does not want to adopt capitalism 
even though it favors introducing marketstyle economic reform 
the renovated party will uphold marxistleninist ideas 
end apply marxistleninist methodology he said 
he also reaffirmed the importance of mongolias ties to the 
soviet union which some opposition groups say has ruled their 
country like a colony since mongolia won independence from china in 
1921 
the party formally called the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party responded last month to opposition demonstrations by ousting 
general secretary jambyn batmon and four fellow members of the 
partys ruling poliburo 
the current congress will elect a new central committee which 
may again change the politburo and general secretary however 
several congress delegates expressed support tuesday for keeping 
the 61yearold ochirbat he has been wellreceived by the public 
because he was out of favor under mongolias former dictator 
yumjaagiyn tsedenbal 
some delegates also suggested that most of the current 146 
central committee members be replaced by younger bettereducated 
people 
ochirbat said in an interview published tuesday that he thinks 
his party can win legislative elections in july 
we think people have confidence in a party that has led the 
country to progress over the past 70 years he said in an 
interview with the japanese television network nhk it was 
published in the communist party newpaper unen the party which 
receives about 66 million from the government each year has 
pledged to become selffinancing but its assets still far exceed 
those of the opposition parties most of which lack even offices 
and telephones 
the government effectively banned opposition protests during the 
congress it decreed over the weekend that applications for any 
demonstrations must be submitted a week in advance and that 
demonstrations that might disrupt public life will not be permitted 
two newly formed opposition parties the mongolian democratic 
party and the social democratic party blame the communists for 
the nations economic stagnation and its heavy dependence on moscow 
about 50000 soviet advisers and 60000 troops are in mongolia 
they say the soviet union doesnt pay enough for mongolias 
natural resources and has saddled the nation of 2 million people 
with a debt estimated by western economists at 6 billion 
 
the developments in mongolia have brought the wave of political 
reform to the doorstep of china which crushed its own democracy 
movement last spring with the army attack on protesters in beijing 
the 35 million ethnic mongols in chinas inner mongolia are a 
potentially receptive audience they already are exposed to a 
potent mix of democratic ideas and mongol pride via newspapers 
radio broadcasts and even pop music from mongolia

nasa scrubbed the launch of 
discovery with the 15 billion hubble space telescope today when a 
problem developed four minutes before liftoff in a unit that 
supplies power to the shuttles wing and tail surfaces 
the launch will be attempted again in one to two weeks said 
launch director bob sieck a more precise time was to be determined 
wednesday 
sieck said a preliminary review indicated a valve on the 
auxiliary power unit did not respond properly allowing too much 
fuel to go through the power system 
were not sure of the impact yet sieck said its going 
to take time to sort that out 
engineers were working to determine the extent of the problem 
even before the five astronauts emerged from the cockpit where they 
had lain on their backs for more than three hours 
nasa said at an early afternoon briefing that the apu will have 
to be removed from the launch vehicle 
the scrub was a disappointment to the hundreds of astronomers 
who had gathered at the kennedy space center to watch the launch of 
discovery and the telescope that it carries in its cargo bay 
its a real downer you could see it couldnt be a more 
beautiful day said nasa scientist stephen p maran 
about 150 relatives of edwin p hubble the astronomer for whom 
the telescope is named headed for a pool party following the scrub 
these things have happened its part of the game said 
harvey hubbell iv a 60yearold retired businessman from north 
palm beach who organized the family gathering we would much 
rather you stop the count than do something foolish 
the hubble space telescope the most expensive unmanned 
spacecraft ever built has been waiting to take its place in space 
since 1983 delayed by technical problems and the 1986 challenger 
explosion 
nasa spokesman george diller said the space agency was 
disappointed at the latest delay but the stars will be here 
tomorrow 
the space telescopes batteries would have held their charge 
through friday but after that would have had to undergo an 
eightday recharge on the ground once hubble is in orbit its 
solars panels will keep its batteries supplied with power 
two other shuttle launches have been delayed because of 
auxiliary power units 
all the other worries about weather at the launch site and at 
emergency landing sites overseas had been swept away and the 
countdown proceeded without a hitch to the four minute mark 
pointing toward a launch at 847 am edt 
but then commander loren j shriver noticed that one of the apus 
was running erratically and reported the fact to launch control 
the three apus steer the ships three engines control the 
movements of flaps on the wings and the rudder lower the main and 
nose landing gears and provide the hydraulics for the main landing 
gear breakes 
they are partly but not totally redundant that is each 
movable part is governed by two apus the pumps are considered so 
critical that mission rules require landing as soon as possible if 
any one of the three fails 
the 35th shuttle mission is to take discovery to an altitude of 
380 miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so that the 
telescope can operate safely above earths obscuring atmosphere 
hubble will be capable during its 15year working lifetime of 
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best groundbased observatory 
it will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant 
their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years it 
may shed light on how and when the universe was formed solve the 
mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes even find stars with 
planets that could conceivably support life 
the national aeronautics and space administration said it might 
release its first telescope image of an open star cluster in the 
constellation carina as early as four days after hubble is 
deployed 
never before have we had a telescope an observatory with this 
capability said nasas chief scientist lennard fisk and it 
will not be surpassed perhaps until we start to establish 
observatories on the moon some day 
so we have an opportunity now to really unlock the secrets of 
the universe in ways that have not been available to us before 
shrivers crewmates are marine col charles f bolden jr the 
pilot and mission specialists steven a hawley bruce mccandless 
ii and kathryn sullivan 
about 24 hours after launch hawley will lift the 24250pound 
telescope from the payload bay with the shuttles 50footlong 
mechanical arm the procedure will take more than five hours 
mccandless and sullivan both veteran spacewalkers will be 
dressed in space suits ready to leave the shuttle cabin in case a 
problem arises during deployment 
discovery will follow hubble for its first few days in orbit 
until nasa is confident the telescope is functioning properly the 
astronauts then will prepare to end the fiveday flight with a 
landing at edwards air force base calif 
the telescope is expected to start providing scientific data by 
satellite in a month or two 
the excitement attending the launch lured hundreds of 
astronomers to kennedy space center as well as many hubble family 
members 
the missouriborn hubble discovered during the 1920s that the 
universe is expanding his findings gave rise to the theory that 
the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous 
explosion known as the big bang he died in 1953 
the space telescope may prove that his theory was correct it 
also may put prevailing theories in doubt 
its the history of science that every time major advances are 
made it raises new questions said charles pellerin jr nasas 
director of astrophysics the most exciting things hubble will 
see are the things i cant predict thats the fun stuff

former us sen lawton chiles has 
begun voicing interest in running for governor and that concerns 
his fellow democrat us rep bill nelson who so far is the 
frontrunner on their partys side 
nelson who hoped to unify the party behind himself talked to 
chiles by telephone and was working out details for a meeting here 
wednesday in hopes of heading off chiles potential entry an aide 
said 
but regardless of chiles decision nelson will continue his 
campaign spokesman don pride said 
hes had his eye on this goal for a couple of years now hes 
not going to take his eyes off of it pride said we know the 
rest would be more difficult but hed run the vigorous campaign 
thats needed to win the nomination and beat republican gov bob 
martinez 
martinez said that if chiles enters the race thats a problem 
for the democrats not him 
it doesnt impact our campaign it impacts the democratic 
campaign martinez said monday they must sense something wrong 
with the party but i cant say what it is 
while martinez acknowledged that the retired senator is 
wellknown and respected he said he would not fear him in a 
general election 
i can handle anybody who wants to get on the ballot he said 
most polls show nelson with a slight lead over state sen george 
stuart of orlando in the sept 4 democratic primary and nelson has 
built a 41 advantage in fund raising 
chiles said he has talked about getting into the race with 
former us rep kenneth buddy mackay as his running mate 
i dont feel i have to do this to save the party or because of 
the failure of someone else to do something chiles told the st 
petersburg times its more an inner thing i normally try to 
listen to the inner voice 
chiles 60 retired from the us senate in january 1989 after 
18 years saying he had become frustrated with the slow grind of 
federal government he also underwent heart surgery during his 
final term 
chiles now is director of the leroy collins center for public 
policy at florida state university 
mackay who narrowly lost to connie mack in the 1988 race for 
chiles seat confirmed he was considering running with chiles

the soviet union made a strong pitch 
tuesday for western help in making freemarket reforms by asking 
for talks to ease restrictions on the sale of high technology 
stepan sitarian a deputy soviet premier said such western 
limits should no longer remain a sacred cow 
the premier also hailed a new international accord reached 
monday in bonn that committed the soviets to backing freemarket 
economic reform he said the pact conformed to president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform program known as perestroika 
many of the decisions and recommendations contained in the 
bonn document are in line with our philosophy of perestroika and 
have a direct bearing on the economic renewal in the soviet 
union sitarian said in a speech to the 35nation conference on 
economic cooperation in europe the conference ends wednesday 
sitarian also made it clear the soviets hope for western help in 
carrying out economic change he said success in implementing the 
bonn accord will depend on countries meeting each other half 
way 
sitarian said the wests socalled cocom restrictions on 
hightechnology sales to the east bloc present certain 
complications to restructuring the soviet economy 
cocom stands for the 17nation coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls the western cocom restrictions were 
adopted during the cold war to prevent the soviet bloc from gaining 
sensitive technology 
we believe that few businessmen would be willing to cooperate 
in an outdated technical basis sitarian told reporters after his 
speech 
we propose that eastwest consultations begin on rules to 
govern the transfer of dualpurpose technology he said 
referring to products and equipment that can be used for civilian 
or military purposes 
he said the soviet union is willing to agree to inspection 
procedures so the west can verify that hightechnology equipment is 
not being used for military purposes 
the cocom nations are already working on proposals for loosening 
restrictions on technology sales to reforming east bloc countries 
however the united states has indicated it will take a tougher 
stand toward the soviet union 
sitarian said the soviet union is committed to carrying out 
price reforms as soon as possible he said it is also eager to make 
its currency the ruble convertible 
in mondays pact the 35 nations at the conference the united 
states canada and all european countries except albania 
informally endorsed a document committing them to support private 
property free enterprise and multiparty democracy 
such a move would have been unthinkable months ago before the 
wave of democratic and economic reform in the east bloc

the internal revenue service may have lost 
65 billion in taxes by taking senior auditors off cases to train 
new workers congressional analysts say 
a report by the general accounting office an investigative arm 
of congress estimated that in cases it had checked the government 
lost more than 1 million in taxes for each new worker who 
completed a 26month training course under the tutelage of senior 
auditors 
it is clear that the use of experienced revenue agents to 
train new agents carries a significant cost in terms of unrealized 
audit revenues the general accounting office said in its report 
it is essential that irs explore alternatives to its present 
training program 
the irs had reached much the same conclusion in its own survey 
of training procedures although the agency found a lower revenue 
loss than did the gao however the irs is concerned enough about 
the loss that is planning to hire private contractors to conduct 
some training in the budget year that will begin oct 1 
ellen murphy irs director of public affairs said tuesday that 
the gao finding has no relevance over the last two years because 
the irs has been under a hiring freeze 
when we resume hiring new people we will be doing a lot more 
of online training reserving intensive classroom training for 
contractors and having trainees go with experienced auditors 
to see how the job should be done she said 
the 61 billion irs budget that president bush has proposed for 
1991 would allow the agency to hire 2400 auditors it now has 
about 16000 
in the late 1980s congress twice voted additional 
appropriations to reduce the budget deficit by increasing the 
number of auditors those appropriations ended oct 1 1988 
the gao report projected that it will take up to four years 
before tax collections will rise enough to offset the costs of 
hiring new agents and make up for the revenue lost by having them 
trained by senior auditors 
the gao study was made at the request of sen james sasser 
dtenn and chairman of the senate budget committee the 
investigation was aimed at determining how revenue collections are 
affected by hiring more irs auditors 
the percentage of individual tax returns that are audited has 
been declining steadily for several years from about 100 per 
10000 last year to an expected 92 per 10000 this year 
from july 1 1986 to sept 30 1988 the hiring period studied 
by the gao the irs hired 7300 people as revenue agents whose 
chief task is to audit complicated returns including those filed 
by large corporations 
the gao surveyed five of irss 63 district offices atlanta 
chicago dallas los angeles and san francisco where 1103 of the 
7300 or 15 percent were hired the gao found that 
most of the burden of training the new employees fell on the 
most experienced and highestpaid revenue agents 
sixtynine percent of the training assignments were carried out 
by agents who had been auditing returns at the time they were 
selected 
as of last june 30 the use of auditors for training the 1103 
new workers had deprived the government of about 840 million in 
revenues that the interrupted audits would have produced the gao 
said that total could rise to 980 million by the time all the new 
employees complete their training 
if costs were similar in the other 58 districts the revenue 
loss could be in the neighborhood of 65 billion 
through june 30 only 179 of the 1103 new employees had 
completed all four phases of training and the revenue loss was 
estimated at more than 104 million for each trainee who completed 
the course 
the gao found that as of june 30 only 848 of the 1103 new 
employees were still with the irs 
the irs conducted its own survey last november and concluded 
that it would cost about 527 million in unrealized audit revenue 
to train 1000 new agents

president bush said today that while theres 
an awful lot to be done to resolve ussoviet differences on 
arms control he hopes his summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will be a catalyst for progress 
its important that we continue to talk to mr gorbachev 
bush told reporters during a flight to toronto where he was to meet 
with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
asked about an apparent stiffening of soviet positions on arms 
control issues bush said im not disappointed but i mean 
look you deal with whats on the table 
weve got a time frame now he said in which theres an 
awful lot to be done so i cannot even predict how much will be done 
by the time the summit rolls around 
he said the meeting now set for may 30 through june 3 will 
serve as a bit of a catalyst or goal for getting things done 
bushs trip to toronto marked the start of a 10day round of 
consultations with western leaders about changes in eastern europe 
and the summit 
diplomacy aside a major intrigue has been over who will throw 
out the first pitch tonight at the toronto skydome bush the avid 
baseball fan or mulroney the presidents host 
wait and see said derek h burney the canadian ambassador 
in washington 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said both leaders 
will make the first pitch 
how is that possible 
its one of the modern miracles of our unique uscanadian 
relationship that well be able to do this fitzwater said with a 
smile 
bushs son george w bush is a part owner of the rangers 
which finished fourth in the seventeam american league west last 
year the blue jays are the defending american league east 
champions 
after meeting with mulroney bush will see british prime 
minister margaret thatcher in bermuda on friday and french 
president francois mitterrand in key largo fla on april 19 
fitzwater said all of the discussions would focus on eastwest 
issues the future of nato the unification of germany and bushs 
fiveday summit with gorbachev beginning may 30 
fitzwater said plans for the summit would not be spoiled by 
snags that cropped up last week in negotiations to cut longrange 
nuclear weapons 
we have a lot of things to talk about in our relationship 
besides arms control fitzwater said we are prepared to go 
ahead with the summit regardless of what happens on the arms 
control part of it 
he acknowledged that there is certainly a great question of 
whether an arms agreement will be ready by the time bush and 
gorbachev meet 
in accordance with todays emphasis on baseball all of the 
bushmulroney meetings as well as a dinner were to take place at 
the skydome complex which includes a hotel and shops as well as 
the ballpark 
the trip represents the fifth meeting between bush and mulroney 
in north america 
in the past canada has complained it was being taken for 
granted by the united states but now appears delighted with the 
attention its receiving from bush 
burney the canadian ambassador said he did not think there 
ever has been such substantive engagement between the united 
states and canada 
the frequency of meetings speaks for itself obviously we 
think it helps the tone of the relationship as a whole burney 
said 
he said smooth ties with washington are important because 
canadas economic health is so closely linked with the united 
states 
proclaiming uscanadian relations on a very positive 
footing burney said it is a question of access and influence 
and in terms of access and influence i think canada is in the 
unique position these days in washington and whether it is to 
preserve and promote our own interest or whether it is with a 
broader objective in mind i think we can turn that and we are 
turning that to a good end he said

prime minister vp singh said tuesday 
the indian people should be psychologically prepared for an 
armed conflict with pakistan over the disputed kashmir valley 
singh made the comment in parliament hours after moslem 
secessionists in the picturesque valley shot and killed a hindu 
industrialist they had held since friday 
singh told the lok sabha or house of the people that pakistan 
was fomenting the insurgency in the northern state of jammukashmir 
and could make a limited intervention with or without uniforms to 
achieve its territorial goal 
you pakistan will not get away with it the prime minister 
warned the neighboring country you will have to pay a very heavy 
price and we have the capability to inflict this cost 
people should be psychologically prepared for any 
eventuality he said we cannot remain soft a soft people and 
a hard army are incongruous 
the comments were the most aggressive the indian leader has made 
since he took office in december india and pakistan have fought 
three wars including two over kashmir since both were born out of 
the 1947 division of the britishruled subcontinent 
they have been exchanging sharp words since the beginning of the 
year when the moslem movement for secession of indian kashmir 
escalated india charges pakistan with arming and training the 
militants pakistan denies it 
stateowned television said pakistan had raised its civil 
defense to an advanced state of preparedness and made plans for 
evacuation of civilians from near the border with india 
it said pakistani radar installations were moved closer to the 
border and camouflage coverings placed over important buildings 
in srinagar the largest city in the kashmir valley police said 
they found the body of a hindu industrialist who was kidnapped four 
days ago along with two moslems 
the body of lm khera was found near the citys fire brigade 
headquarters with five bullet wounds said tataji ganju a police 
superintendent 
his death raises to 257 the number of people killed in the 
valley since jan 20 when the government crackdown on the moslem 
secessionist movement began 
the body was found about 1 hours before the kidnappers 3 pm 
deadline to release three of their colleagues 
ganju said he had no idea why khera was killed before the 
deadline expired he said he did not know the fate of the other two 
captives 
at least one person was killed and 12 others injured tuesday 
when government troops opened fire on curfew violators in srinagar 
witnesses said the city has been under a continuous curfew since 
the three hostages were kidnapped friday 
in new delhi bombs exploded at two police stations tuesday 
injuring at least nine policemen officials said responsibility 
for the explosions was claimed in srinagar by a previously unknown 
militant group called the mujahedeen kashmir or warriors of 
kashmir 
moslemdominated kashmir is a former princely state whose hindu 
ruler opted for union with india at the time of the 1947 division 
of the subcontinent 
moslem resentment at the move was muted at the time but the 
discontent has flared into an active campaign for secession in 
recent months 
india and pakistan fought wars over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 a 
unmonitored ceasefire line separates the valley into indian and 
pakistani sectors 
the two countries also fought a war in 1971 that led to the 
independence of bangladesh

us participation in an international 
development bank for the soviet union and eastern europe is now 
assured because of limits put on soviet borrowing the treasury 
said tuesday 
the agreement among 42 countries involved was announced monday 
in paris where officials said an accord creating the european bank 
for reconstruction and development will be signed may 30 
for three years the soviet union will be allowed to borrow only 
as much as it pays in or about 216 million treasury spokesman 
robert levine said 
the soviets will contribute 6 percent of the banks 12 billion 
capital but participating countries will pay in less than a third 
of their capital share with the rest on call the united states 
will have the largest share 10 percent the member countries of 
the european economic community will have 51 percent among them 
similar intergovernment banks like the world bank have larger 
proportions of their capital on call but never actually call it 
because they get most of their money for loans by borrowing 
themselves on financial markets 
jacques attali an adviser to french president francois 
mitterrand said monday in paris that a twoday meeting agreed on 
58 articles of the banks statutes settling such outstanding 
issues as the type of currency to be used in the bank and the 
amount and form of capital contributions of each member 
the delegates agreed that the us dollar japanese yen and 
european currency unit all can be used to contribute capital to the 
bank the ecu is worth about 120 
a president for the bank still has to be chosen and several 
european cities are competing to have the headquarters officials 
hope it can start making loans by the end of this year 
at the first session to set terms for the bank in january the 
united states objected to full participation by the soviet union 
unless moscow initiated major market reforms 
in addition to the united states and virtually every european 
country participants in the bank include japan morocco israel 
egypt and south korea 
levine said the banks charter will also require borrowers to be 
moving toward democracy a requirement the united states wanted and 
the soviets opposed 
he added that an additional curb on loans to the soviets will be 
a requirement that their borrowings be either for private 
enterprises or for enterprises operating competitively and moving 
toward a market orientation that could include some stateowned 
enterprises 
for all borrowers 60 percent of the loans must go to the 
private sector levine said the other 40 percent can be used for 
government infrastructure projects roads bridges water supply 
transport or to improve the environment 
the limit on loans to the soviets can be changed in three years 
but only by an 85 percent vote of the participating countries

participants in an international media conference 
said tuesday that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and 
new communications technology have combined to open up the east 
bloc to the rest of the world 
but at least one western journalist taking part in the 11th 
world media conference expressed concern over the closing of 
lithuania and other restive soviet republics to foreign reporters 
the world media conference meeting for the first time in 
moscow began a threeday symposium tuesday to discuss the impact 
of political changes in the soviet union on international 
communications 
about 500 delegates from 60 countries including many former 
heads of state attended the meeting of the association which was 
founded by the rev sun myung moon to encourage eastwest 
communications 
allen h neuharth founder of the newspaper usa today told an 
afternoon panel discussion that advanced satellite communications 
and publishing technology have opened a new window on the world 
he said people around the world were able to watch the events 
unfolding in the soviet union and eastern europe on television and 
read about them almost immediately in newspapers 
there are no more secrets in the world neuharth said 
he said the media now and in the future would play a key role 
in the shaping of global events it is the glue that will hold 
the globe together or tear it apart he said 
andrei grachev deputy director of the communist party central 
committees international affairs department agreed 
the 20th century began as an age of electronics and is ending 
as the age of communications grachev said 
we are living in an age where secrets cannot be kept he 
said citing the example of foreign scientists who detected the 
1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster and satellite intelligence on the 
location of nuclear missile sites 
most panelists agreed that gorbachevs policies of perestroika 
and glasnost helped create the conditions for radical change in the 
east bloc and the speedy reporting of events in east bloc nations 
however jim laurie moscow bureau chief for abc news noted 
that in cases of unrest several republics had been closed to 
foreign reporters recently western journalists were ordered out 
of lithuania after the republic declared its independence 
the absence of foreign journalists could lead to partisan 
manipulation of the media by means of circulating stories that 
could not be independently checked laurie said 
arthur hartman the us ambassador to moscow from 19811987 
concurred that glasnost and perestroika were praiseworthy 
he urged a substantial increase in the exchange of experts in 
all fields to improve relations between the east and west 
particularly in the economics area 
moon said in opening remarks that perestroika made it possible 
for the conference to be held in moscow 
i feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for these 
discussions than right here in the soviet union moon said 
among the foreign delegates attending the conference were former 
nato secretarygeneral joseph luns former argentinian president 
raul alfonsin former colombian president alfonso lopez michelsen 
and jihan sadat widow of the slain egyptian president anwar sadat 
media representatives included arnaud de borchgrave editor in 
chief of the washington times newspaper and bo hi pak publisher 
of the washington times and president of the world media 
association 
soviet participants included vadim zagladin an adviser to 
gorbachev economist abel aganbegyan and nikolai shishlin a

prosecutors of the charles stuart shooting case 
may face a stalemate if they cannot persuade an appeals court judge 
to force stuarts attorney to testify about his client 
at issue is whether the attorneyclient privilege should be 
overridden in the interests of justice for prosecutors who appear 
to have run out of leads it could mean their last chance to crack 
the tangled case 
stuart apparently committed suicide on jan 4 after being 
implicated in the shooting death of his pregnant wife her killing 
on oct 23 shocked bostonians and raised racial tensions in the 
city when stuart who was white said his wifes attacker was black 
a superior court judge in suffolk county which includes boston 
declined to rule on the attorneyclient issue monday he asked the 
state appeals court to decide 
suffolk county prosecutors had asked judge james p donohue at a 
closed hearing last week to override the clientattorney privilege 
between charles stuart and his former lawyer john dawley they 
asked that he order dawley to tell the grand jury what stuart told 
him during a twohour conversation a day before stuarts apparent 
suicide 
although donohue did not immediately act on the request he did 
shed light on previously secret grand jury evidence about the case 
in a report to the appeals court donohue described some grand 
jury testimony including that of stuarts brother matthew 
according to the judge matthew stuart said he was an unwilling 
participant in the shooting and thought he was taking part in an 
insurance scam for which he would be paid 10000 
the report confirmed many elements of the case that previously 
had been reported in the news media 
the stuart case began with a dramatic telephon call to an 
emergency dispatcher from charles stuart who reported on his car 
telephone that his wife had been shot in the head and he had been 
shot in the stomach 
carol stuart died hours later their prematurely delivered son 
died 17 days later 
stuart told police he and his wife had been shot by a robber who 
jumped into their car after they left a prenatal class at brigham 
and womens hospital 
but matthew stuart went to authorities jan 3 and implicated 
charles in the shooting charles stuart apparently jumped to his 
death from a bridge the next day 
in his memorandum donohue said the grand jury was told that 
matthew was to meet his brother at a predetermined location oct 23 
to get items that later would be claimed to have been stolen and 
an insurance claim would be filed 
the grand jury according to the report was told matthew pulled 
alongside his brothers car and talked to him but was not aware 
his brother was wounded or that carol was in the car 
matthew stuart told witnesses that he thought there was a bag 
of laundry or a duffle bag in the front seat of the car matthew 
said that charles passed him several items including a handgun 
donohue said the grand jury was told 
matthew stuart told police he and a friend dropped the gun and a 
handbag into the pines river in revere the items were recovered

a reporter who refused to reveal a source was 
fined 8200 on tuesday by a high court judge who ruled out prison 
for an otherwise perfectly honorable man 
bill goodwin faced a possible jail sentence because he refused 
to hand over notes identifying a person who telephoned him at the 
engineer trade magazine with confidential information on a 
companys financial details 
by court order the name of the company involved cannot be 
published 
justice leonard hoffmann said the journalists refusal to reveal 
the source had no legal or moral basis but added the prisons 
have enough problems without having to take an otherwise perfectly 
honorable man like yourself 
britain has faced growing prison unrest since rioting inmates 
took over strangeways prison in manchester on april 1 
the 24yearold reporter said he hoped parliament would change 
the law that allows journalists to be held in contempt of court for 
protecting confidential sources 
it has been a difficult and nervewracking time he said 
im very relieved at the outcome but i regret that as the law 
stands journalists who come after me will be in danger of prison 
sentences demanded by anonymous companies 
the information goodwin received in the nov 2 1989 telephone 
call was believed to have come from a document marked strictly 
confidential and stolen from the company 
goodwin unaware of the theft wrote a draft article and 
telephoned the company for its reaction 
the article was never published because of the court action 
hoffmann ruled that goodwins notes should be disclosed since 
the company needed to know whom to sue for the return of the stolen 
document 
the judge awarded the unnamed company legal costs 
goodwin has not said who paid for his defense press 
association britains domestic news agency said the defense is 
believed to have cost more than 164000 
the national union of journalists said it was launching an 
appeal to assist goodwin pay the fine he told the court his salary 
is 17200 a year and his savings are 2500

twentieth century fox has lifted its ban against 
critics roger ebert and gene siskel who gave harsh reviews of a 
recent fox film 
the studio said three weeks ago that ebert and siskel would be 
barred indefinitely from preview screenings after both critics said 
on a television talk show that the comedy nuns on the run 
wasnt funny 
but siskel called fox shortly before a monday screening of 
another fox film and asked if he was still unwelcome 
it was the first fox screening here since nuns on the run 
the ban was over a company spokesman said and siskel went to 
the show ebert didnt know about the lifting of the ban and was 
out of town 
im happy the ban is lifted ebert said i feel 
vindicated in the future i will continue to review fox films in 
the same evenhanded way i have in the past 
the only thing im disappointed about is that i had predicted 
the ban would last only one film and roger had predicted it would 
last none siskel said roger was right and hes going to be 
hard to deal with when he gets home

its important to stay in each moment as much as you possibly 
can the actress says in the may issue of redbook

it was so wonderful to see mama and papa and all my aunts and 
uncles again we were running and having a picnic on a green hill 
and there was white light all around us 
this was the oddest thing for her to tell me especially since 
all those people have been dead for years said harper but mom 
was up and beaming i knew she was ready to go

president bush said tuesday that the soviet 
union has a clear understanding that the use of force against the 
independence movement in lithuania would sour relations with the 
united states 
i think they know that loud and clear by now very clear 
bush said 
commenting to reporters on board air force one as he flew to 
toronto for meetings with candian prime minister mulroney bush was 
asked about gorbachevs decision monday to take measures to protect 
soviet interests in lithuania 
ive made our position very clear peaceful resolution of 
this question because we do not recognize that the use of force 
would accomplish anything other than to set back relations bush 
said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also 
renewed the us call for the opening of a process on lithuania 
leading to peaceful dialogue 
what is not needed is a further escalation of tensions she 
said 
what is needed is a process a dialogue that can meet the 
hopes and aspirations of the lithuanian people she added 
that point was driven home repeatedly to soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in lengthy meetings here last week by both 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii she said 
there is no doubt in his mind she said it was made 
perfectly clear and there is no doubt that this can have an impact 
on ussoviet relations that there is a risk to relations 
for his part she said shevardnadze emphasized in both private 
and public statements that dialogue was the only answer and that 
a peaceful way would be found to respond to both soviet and 
lithuanian needs 
at a news conference friday night shevardnadze said soviet 
leaders have no other intentions than to solve the independence 
crisis in lithuania through peaceful means in line with our 
constitution our main law 
he was reminded that he had said earlier that certain 
administrative measures might have to be taken and was asked if 
he could elaborate 
no i cannot shevardnadze replied and added because when 
i spoke about the administrative measures i was referring to the 
actions of militia which you describe here as police and other 
authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring normal conditions 
of life in any city or in any village

a year ago the smell of death clung to 
the rancho santa elena where police dug up 13 mutilated corpses 
victims of a cult of drug smugglers who sacrificed humans for 
magical protection 
two more bodies were found at a nearby farm 
more a farm than a ranch rancho santa elena is returning to the 
rural obscurity it enjoyed before it was a human slaughterhouse 
that sickened even experienced lawmen 
the land is still pockmarked with shallow grave excavations and 
people have been seen digging recently perhaps in search of 
missing relatives 
but nature has started to reclaim the land grass and bright 
yellow wildflowers are doing their best to fill them in the 
pungent odor of decomposing human flesh that hung for days after 
the exhumations on april 11 1989 has long blown away in the 
prevailing gulf coast breeze 
even a shack where the cult reportedly sacrificed 21yearold 
university of texas student mark kilroy a 14yearold mexican boy 
and others has burned to the ground mexican federal judicial 
police brought a curandero or witch doctor to perform a 
purification ceremony on the grounds before they torched the 
building last spring 
all that remains is a concrete slab piles of trash rusting 
farm machinery sheets of corrugated metal from the roof 
residents of the farming area 13 miles west of matamoros across 
the border from brownsville texas say they dont think much about 
the horrifying events that took place there but others remind them 
from time to time 
when you mention you live near rancho santa elena people get 
nervous said fidel trevino villarreal who has lived at an 
adjacent farm since birth in 1926 
he said he never heard or saw anything unusual at the santa 
elena before the grisly discovery even on the many nights he spent 
irrigating his fields 
cameron county sheriff alex perez in brownsville who described 
the scene as a human slaughterhouse said he also lost sleep 
for a while after observing the bodies some with their hearts and 
lungs removed 
the case broke mexican police said when helio hernandez 
believing he was invisible ran his pickup through a checkpoint 
police then searched the rancho owned by his family expecting to 
make a marijuana seizure 
what they found instead were the bodies and signs of human 
torture and bizarre rituals 
hernandez and three other suspects led police to the graves and 
to the matamoros apartment of sara aldrete villarreal an honor 
student at texas southmost college in brownsville in her 
apartment police found an occult altar 
she was not arrested until a month later at a mexico city 
apartment adolfo de jesus constanzo the alleged godfather of 
the cult ordered himself and a male companion killed as police 
closed in on the apartment 
experts concluded that they practiced a variation of the 
afrocuban religion of palo mayombe in which believers use human 
bones but do not normally kill to obtain them 
seven people including aldrete remain jailed in mexico 
awaiting verdicts on charges including homicide illegal burial and 
weapons and drug violations one defendant ranch caretaker domingo 
bustamante reyes has been charged only with coverup 
some holes at the rancho appear recently dug police speculate 
that mexicans desperate to find missing loved ones go there seeking 
graves 
trevino said he sees people digging from time to time at the 
ranch but i dont go over there i dont want anybody to think 
im helping them

the fbi on tuesday awarded its first medal of 
valor to agent edmundo mireles jr who was severely wounded in a 
miami shootout and later joined a classaction lawsuit accusing the 
bureau of discrimination against hispanics 
mireles and fellow agents were involved in a shootout outside 
miami on april 11 1986 when they tried to follow a car carrying 
two men they suspected were involved in a series of violent bank 
robberies 
special agent mireles found himself face to face with his 
moment of truth fbi director william sessions said at the award 
ceremony his fellow agents were down he himself was severely 
wounded 
yet in the face of appalling gunfire he found the courage and 
the stamina to return fire and fatally wounded both michael lee 
platt and william russell matix sessions said 
the medal of valor is given for exceptional acts of heroism in 
the face of ifethreatening situations 
mireles accepted the award in part in the memory of the two 
agents slain that day benjamin grogan and jerry dove and gave 
special recognition to two other agents who helped him survive 
gilbert orantia and ron riesner saved my life on that 
day 
officials later learned that platt and matix were not involved 
in the bank robberies but were suspects in a series of attempted 
killings 
mireles 36 took a year to recover from his wounds which 
shattered one arm he still works on bank robbery cases in the 
miami office said fbi spokesman greg jones 
a federal judge in texas ruling last year on the 1988 
classaction lawsuit filed by 311 hispanic agents found there was 
pervasive discrimination against hispanic fbi agents and ordered 
the bureau to take steps to promote hispanics 
james perez the bureaus new equal opportunity chief told 
congress last month that the fbi had been illequipped until 
recently to investigate complaints of race and sex discrimination 
he said the staffing of his office has been beefed up to handle 
such cases 
mireles gave mixed answers when asked whether the fbi was trying 
to send a message to hispanic agents by giving him its first medal 
of valor 
i dont think this award is being given to a hispanic or a 
black or a white fbi agent or a male or a female he said my 
understanding of why i got the medal is for action rather than for 
ethnic background or gender 
but when asked several minutes later whether the fbi was making 
a statement he said im sure they are 
fbi spokesman carlos fernandez said the fact that mireles is 
hispanic was not a consideration at all as far as i know he 
deserved the medal of valor and thats why he was given it 
mireles said discrimination at the fbi is done by individuals 
not by the organization as a whole its difficult to control what 
an individual thinks were all human 
the fbi he said is making a good effort to try to correct 
some perceived wrongs and its trying to make the working 
environment for all agents better but you cant change an 
organization overnight

the soviet military is playing its most 
visible role in kremlin politics in three years us government 
analysts said tuesday 
the sources cite last weeks setback in superpower armscontrol 
talks and moscows hardline response to the lithuanian 
independence movement 
the two developments appear to be related said one 
administration source who like others spoke on the condition he 
not be further identified 
while offering several possible explanations for why military 
officers are playing a more prominent role than at any time since 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reshuffled the military 
command in june 1987 analysts said they did not think that the 
military had increased its power at gorbachevs expense 
but military officers do seem to be flexing their muscles a 
little more said one source noting that soviet officers have 
played a key role in the response to lithuanias attempts to become 
an independent nation 
analysts offered these scenarios 
one possibility is that the military is increasing its 
prominence on instructions from gorbachev 
there is no doubt in my mind that although the military is 
playing a more visible role the decisions are being made by 
political authorities said one administration armscontrol 
expert 
a second theory is that gorbachev is allowing the military to 
play a heavyhanded role in lithuania if the approach fails he 
can simply walk away from it and say that it was not his policy 
after all said another source 
a third possibility is that gorbachev and other civilian 
leaders are preoccupied and that military officers are filling the 
vacuum where they see their interests threatened one analyst said 
the more visible military role became clear shortly after 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 
the commander of all soviet ground forces gen valentin i 
varennikov was present in lithuania as soviet forces seized 
government party and publishing offices arresting deserters from 
the soviet army and rumbling through vilnius in tanks 
as for arms control a setback became apparent last week during 
talks in washington between secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
us negotiators were working on the assumption that we would 
make progress at the same rate we have since last year what we had 
to hoped to accomplish at the meeting did not get done said one 
administration source 
over the last year the soviets made concessions on three major 
start issues their objection to the strategic defense initiative 
their insistence that the treaty cover submarinelaunched cruise 
missiles slcms and rules for counting airlaunched cruise 
missiles alcms 
last week the soviets revived their demand that the treaty 
require the two sides to issue a separate declaration setting 
limits on slcms administration sources said 
the soviets also revived their insistence that the treaty cover 
all alcms with ranges above 360 miles the americans want to count 
only missiles above 900 miles thus excluding alcms aboard tactical 
warplanes such as the f15 and the f111b the sources said 
one source interpreted the tougher soviet arms position as a 
retrenchment by the soviet military 
they were apparently angry over the concessions made by 
civilian negotiators and wanted to regain some lost ground one 
administration source said 
however another source attributed the change to kremlin tactics 
designed to increase pressure on the americans as negotiators 
struggle to complete a start deal before the summit 
president bush meeting with reporters as he flew to toronto to 
attend a baseball game and meet with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney commented on both developments 
on lithuania he said he had warned the kremlin that a crackdown 
could damage superpower relations 
ive made our position very clear peaceful resolution of 
this question because we do not recognize that the use of force 
would accomplish anything other than to set back relations and i 
think they know that loud and clear by now very clear bush said 
on the slowdown on armscontrol progress bush said he still 
hopes the two sides can complete a proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty to cut longrange nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 
percent 
despite the latest glitch the president said he was directing 
us negotiators to go back and work hard 
we got a time frame now in which theres an awful lot to be 
done so i cant predict how much will be done by the time the 
summit rolls around on may 30 bush said

one of the longest streaks in the history of 
atlanta braves baseball has come to an end pearl sandow is on the 
disabled list 
until tuesday ms sandow had seen very one of the 1899 home 
games the team has played since it moved to atlanta from milwaukee 
in 1966 
a statue of her is in the fans section at the baseball hall of 
fame at cooperstown ny 
but she broke both shoulders in a traffic accident and had to 
stay home tuesday and miss the opening of the braves 25th season 
at atlantafulton county stadium 
i hate that im going to miss them she said but im 
excited about the season opening 
i dont think im going to make it back to a game until 
june said the retiree who declines to give her age 
as soon as she is able ms sandow says she will once again be 
in seat one row nine section 105 the same seat she has occupied 
while watching each of the braves 947 home victories and 952 
home defeats 
she purchased a season ticket for the seat which is down the 
first base line after looking at a chart before the stadium was 
even built in 1965 while the braves were still in milwaukee she 
was a devoted fan of the atlanta crackers a southern association 
team which played a season in the new stadium she saw all their 
home games too 
in 1975 in recognition of her loyalty the braves gave ms 
sandow a lifetime pass but she still buys a season ticket for the 
seat next to her the seat she calls her junk seat because when 
its not occupied by a friend it holds her purse and other junk 
despite the braves average of 96 losses per season over the 
past five years ms sandow says as long as they try i can take 
it we cant win all the time but i cant stand sloppy baseball

us officials told european nations tuesday that 
the american market for illegal drugs is nearly saturated and 
dealers will soon be bombarding this side of the atlantic with huge 
amounts of cocaine 
however british and dutch officials said its too early to 
predict such a cocaine epidemic in europe 
the comments were exchanged during the world ministerial drugs 
summit sponsored by britain and the united nations more than 800 
delegates from 112 countries have focused on ways to reduce the 
demand for drugs and to combat cocaine the threeday conference 
ends wednesday 
dr herbert d kleber an official with the us office of 
national drug control policy said he expects cocaine use to 
increase sharply in europe because there is little room for growth 
in american sales and the drug cartels are thus looking across the 
ocean 
i think that cocaine is really beginning to hit europe and 
england he said adding that my fear is that there basically 
is a tidal wave of cocaine coming your way 
douglas tweddle chief investigator for britains customs and 
excise department acknowledged that more cocaine will undoubtedly 
come to europe because we have the ability to pay for it 
however he added that to talk of a tidal wave seems somewhat 
emotive 
we are trying our best to contain the cocaine problem before 
it gets to american proportions he told a news conference i 
dont think it will be as bad as it has been in the united states 
dr eddy l engelsman an official of the ministry of welfare 
public health and cultural affairs in the netherlands said an 
explosion in cocaine use should not be predicted in europe 
we can talk about threats but thats what weve done over 10 
years now and the level of cannabis use for instance in america 
has reached much higher peaks than it ever has done in europe he 
said 
us secretary of health dr louis sullivan said the united 
states has alerted european nations to take action to reduce the 
demand for cocaine and to block shipments 
the major source of wealth beyond the united states is europe 
and japan and data from our sources say the european market is 
looked on by the cartels as a growth market he said 
italys interior minister antonio gava quoting figures from the 
international police agency interpol said monday that cocaine 
seizures in europe have increased from 3300 pounds in 1986 to 
13860 pounds in 1989 in the first three months of 1990 he said 
authorities seized 8800 pounds 
in his comments kleber said stripping drugs of glamour and 
holding users accountable for their actions had helped cut casual 
use of cocaine by 37 percent over the last three years in the 
united states 
he said drug users know the consequences of indulging range from 
suspending a pilots license to expulsion from school or 
imprisonment 
however engelsman of the netherlands said treating drug users 
like smokers or alcoholics has worked in his country 
even though marijuana is sold in coffee bars he said dutch 
youngsters understand the message that drugs are unhealthy he said 
only 2 percent of those up to 19 years old used marijuana during 
the last month and less than 05 percent used heroin and cocaine

the things written about her husband would make her angry if she 
read them so the simplest thing is not to read them

reporters before a speech winding up a johnson administration 
reunion came to commenting on the furor over robert caros means 
of ascent 
the book the second volume of a projected multivolume 
biography of lyndon b johnson has been sharply criticized by 
johnson associates and some reviewers who say it is unduly harsh on 
the 36th president 
caro defends his research and says a more positive picture of 
johnsons achievements will emerge in later volumes 
mrs johnson asked simply whether negative books and other 
writings about her late husband made her angry replied im sure 
they would if i read them so the simplest thing is not to read 
them 
the former first lady was interviewed in the front parlor of the 
womans national democratic club with pictures of herself and 
other presidential wives on the wall visible through a window was

the environment both while in the white house and since leaving it 
mrs johnson told reporters the reunion has been fun although 
neither my eyes nor my legs are as strong as they once were 
she said she wouldnt want to be back in the white house though 
its too much of a crescendo of activity and when you are 77 
you want to lie in the hammock and savor the world

an accident that sucked nine united passengers 
out of a boeing jumbo jet over the pacific ocean resulted from 
failures by the airline manufacturer and faa to correct problems 
in cargo doors on 747 airliners federal investigators said tuesday 
the national transportation safety board voted 30 to accept the 
results of a more than 13month investigation despite the fact a 
key piece of evidence in the feb 24 1989 incident remains three 
miles under water flight 811s cargo door 
the ntsb said united failed to properly inspect the door after 
its electrical system failed in december 1988 and mechanics had to 
operate it manually the door had been operated electrically since 
then however 
boeing and the federal aviation administration were cited for 
failing to order timely corrective measures after another cargo 
door partially popped open on a 1987 pan american jet flying from 
london to new york that plane returned safely to london 
on flight 811 the door ripped off at 22000 feet a piece of 
the fuselage was ripped off and the passengers and their seats were 
sucked out through the hole in the plane 
the plane en route to new zealand returned to honolulu five 
other passengers were seriously hurt and 33 had minor injuries the 
plane carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers 
united spokesman robert dowdy said the airline had complied with 
all faa requirements except in one instance that occurred after 
six words mandating an inspection were left out of an faa 
regulation when it was copied into the companys system he said 
dowdy said that despite the oversight the door had undergone 
three inspections since the december 1988 problem was corrected 
we think the board has done a good job with the evidence and 
data available dowdy said adding that a better investigation 
and probable cause could be determined if the door is recovered 
boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable 
cause of the incident could not be determined 
in seattle boeing spokesman jack gamble said the company had no 
comment on the ntsb finding except to say we feel no 1 those 
cargo doors are safe 
there were subsequent changes made as a result of the 
accident changes and inspection processes all of the necessary 
actions have been taken to ensure integrity of that doors 
operation in flight gamble said 
the board said the current cargo door system on 747s can 
indicate to the pilot that the door is locked when it is not 
thats expected to be changed with an imminent faa order that would 
require detectors on the locks said ron schleed investigator in 
charge for the accident 
the faa already has issued orders to ensure that boeing 747 
cargo doors are secure and more thoroughly inspected after each 
closing 
schleed said efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from 
the ocean would continue he said a navy vessel and sophisticated 
probe device would be available in june to conduct a search that 
would be limited to about two weeks 
radar was able to track the door as it fell but it was lost 
about 3000 feet before it hit the water schleed said 
investigators hope the door will show whether parts were damaged 
before the failure they have evidence of damage in the mechanism 
which they speculate may have been caused by a faulty electrical 
device or by turning a wrench the wrong way when the door was 
closed manually schleed said

patients with spinal cord injuries may not be 
getting a new treatment that reduces paralysis because federal 
health officials have not sent research data to physicians a 
consumer advocacy group said tuesday 
the public citizen health research group called it a colossal 
failure of communication and said that any further delay in 
notifying all emergency rooms about this is recklessly 
irresponsible 
the group called on health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan to send information about the therapy to emergency room 
and trauma care physicians to alert those who may not have heard 
about it through the media and to allow them to evaluate data 
documenting the effectiveness of the drug 
on march 30 federal health officials announced the results of a 
government study showing that high doses of the drug 
methylprednisolone given within eight hours of a spinal cord injury 
was able to restore some feeling and movement in virtually all 
spinal cord injury patients 
the drug has been used for years for other purposes but its use 
in massive doses marked the first time an effective treatment for 
such paralyzing injuries had been found since about 95 percent of 
all spinal cord patients are admitted to hospitals within eight 
hours most could benefit from the treatment researchers said 
officials at the national institutes of health said they 
deviated from usual practice and released the results before 
publication in a medical journal in hopes that patients could 
benefit immediately study results are to be published in may in 
the new england journal of medicine 
they said doctors could obtain information about treatment with 
the drug by calling 301 4965751 during working hours also for 
the first weekend after the news conference a tollfree number was 
set up with a recorded message giving information about treatment 
more than 1000 inquiries were received that weekend and 500 
have been received on the daytime number said jim brown an hhs 
spokesman 
but dr sidney wolfe director of the ralph naderfounded public 
citizen health research group noted that a newsday survey last 
week found that six of the nine major trauma centers in the new 
york area had not started to use the treatment because they had not 
seen the study data 
brown said wolfes letter is being reviewed 
wolfe said a breakthrough such as researchers found with high 
doses of methylprednisolone occurs only once or twice a year but 
the public health officials should establish a way for word of 
these findings to get to physicians quickly 
the stakes are too high he said in the case of 
methylprednisolone this drug makes a difference between being on 
crutches and being in a wheelchair

defense secretary dick cheney has asked the 
air force to find out why he was not told for months that a f117a 
stealth fighterbomber dropped its bomb far offtarget in the 
panama invasion an aide said tuesday 
the secretary has asked the air force for an explanation 
pentagon spokesman pete williams told reporters he said cheney was 
eager to know what the chain of information was 
air force officials said there was no intention of misleading 
cheney but that miscommunication took place within the chain of 
command 
williams confirmed friday that neither he nor cheney were told 
the full story about the f117as performance during the dec 20 
operation until april 3 
in the days following the us invasion pentagon officials said 
two of the hightech planes were used for the first time in combat 
each supposedly dropping one 2000pound bomb on a field near a 
panamanian defense forces barracks to create confusion while us 
paratroopers prepared to drop onto a nearby airfield 
one of the planes actually dropped its bomb some distance away 
due to an apparent pilot error williams said 
defense department sources have described cheney as livid 
over the lack of information since it left him touting the 
supersophisticated jets pinpoint accuracy in the aftermath of 
the panama invasion 
the pentagon held a highly publicized briefing on april 3 to 
make public its view that the f117a stealth program had been a 
success and describe the merits of the plane at the briefing 
williams disclosed considerable information that until then had 
been classified 
he said later he was told about the offtarget bomb following 
that briefing and after he had repeatedly passed on questions about 
the planes peformance to air force officials at the urging of a 
new york times reporter who had photos of the offtarget bomb 
crater 
williams explained that the two planes were told to drop their 
bombs no closer than 50 meters away from two separate pdf barracks 
buildings 
but due to a lastminute misunderstanding between the pilots 
the second f117a pilot dropped his bomb on a hillside several 
hundred yards away williams has confirmed 
despite that problem williams said tuesday cheney and other 
pentagon officials believe that the jets accomplished their 
mission which was to stun the pdf forces 
the bombs including the offtarget one weigh 2000 pounds and 
shook the ground considerably he said 
the spokesman said that military officials believe no lives were 
lost by the offtarget delivery but that the air force is looking 
into exactly where the bombs landed 
now were asking people to go down there and measure where the 
bombs landed he said 
williams said that cheney does not believe that he was purposely 
misled and is interested in knowing when the subsequent 
information came to light and why it wasnt passed up the chain 
of command

orange harvest prospects are virtually 
unchanged from last month the agriculture department said tuesday 
production as of april 1 was forecast at 172 million boxes down 
18 percent from 209 boxes last season primarily because of a 
freeze in december 
most of the reduction was attributed to a 30 percent decline in 
the florida crop estimated at 1031 million boxes against 1466 
million in 198889 
the texas crop was indicated at 12 million boxes down from 
185 million in 198889 california production estimated at 66 
million boxes is up from 588 million last season while the 
arizona harvest was indicated at 19 million boxes up from 17 
million last season 
total grapefruit production was forecast at 486 million boxes 
down 30 percent from last year reflecting the freeze in florida 
and texas

two editors complained tuesday that 
their first amendment rights of free speech and religion were 
violated when they were fired from a small iowa newspaper for 
organizing an antiabortion group 
the newspaper defended its actions and a lawyer for the iowa 
civil liberties union said the editors didnt have a first 
amendment case 
i guess my religious convictions are what brought it about 
terri lambertsen former people page editor of the fairfield 
ledger said in a telephone interview i have to believe that 
serving the lord is more important than my job 
the ledger is a 5000circulation sixdayaweek afternoon 
newspaper published about 90 miles southeast of des moines 
ms lambertsen and news editor john kennedy were discharged 
monday when they refused to quit as leaders of the southeast iowa 
prolifers a newlyformed antiabortion group ms lambertsen is 
president and kennedy is secretary of the group 
ledger editor jan nierling said the newspaper was forced to fire 
the two to protect its credibility even though that left the paper 
with only a managing editor a reporter and sports editor 
we take our business seriously we just think it endangers 
incredibly our perception of credibility and objectivity a 
newspapers credibility is its most valuable asset ms nierling 
said 
the firings prompted a protest sponsored by refocus ministries 
a nondenominational ministerial group about 40 protestors walked 
in a circle in front of the ledger office tuesday afternoon 
i have to agree with what john kennedy said said larry 
rail codirector of the group he joined a group that is 
prolife it doesnt mean his views as a newspaper reporter and 
editor are going to change so its a blatant violation of his 
rights 
the ledgers policy is similar to many other news organizations 
according to william hirschman president of the kansas chapter of 
the society of professional journalists and the groups freedom of 
information representative for the region that includes iowa 
a common compromise he said is to permit reporters to 
participate in some groups but not as spokesmen or leaders and to 
prevent writers from covering events in which they are personally 
involved 
i would have hoped that the two sides would have sat down and 
discussed it he said 
last october the milwaukee journal fired a receptionist diane 
dew for her antiabortion activities in december the paper said 
it made a mistake and agreed to pay her a settlement the journal 
said it had decided that its code of ethics for newsroom employees 
did not apply to ms dew 
last spring reporters for the new york times and the washington 
post were criticized by their newspapers for participating in an 
abortion rights march in washington no punitive action was taken 
at either paper 
kennedy an eightyear employee of the ledger said his 
involvement with the antiabortion group did not interfere with his 
newspaper duties he said the newspaper could send another reporter 
to cover an abortionrelated story if it felt his objectivity was 
compromised 
neither kennedy nor ms lambertsen would say if they planned to 
pursue legal remedies 
ive got three kids aged 4 6 and 7 my wife works parttime 
as a church secretary for 37 a week im not sure yet what well 
do but the lord will take care of us kennedy said 
ms nierling said the newspaper has a longstanding policy of 
prohibiting reporters from being officers of politically active 
groups that receive news coverage 
im disappointed that they didnt have a better attitude 
toward their professional responsibilities she said 
mark bennett general counsel for the iowa civil liberties 
union said the first amendment was not at issue in the case the 
first amendment he said applies only to governments that try to 
infringe religious and speech rights not to private enterprises 
such as a newspaper 
an untested theory he said would be whether the paper violated 
iowas civil rights laws which prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of creed

better education plus improved career 
counseling is necessary to add to the pool of mathematically 
skilled workers who will be needed in the united states by 2000 
the government said tuesday 
the national research council said the demand for scientists 
engineers and technicians by the turn of the century will exceed 
the 1986 level by 36 percent nearly double the growth in overall 
employment demand 
meanwhile the council said the collegeage population is 
expected to decrease 22 percent from 1981 to 1995 the number of 
white male students the traditional pool for scientists and 
engineers will shrink 34 percent 
a challenge of numbers the second council report on 
mathematics describes the gap between the projected supply and 
demand and the challenge facing the nations education system 
the first report everybody counts studied trends and needs 
in math education 
other reports later this year will evaluate post secondary math 
curriculum discuss resources available for math instruction and 
make recommendations on how to ensure a healthy flow of 
mathematical talent into an increasingly technological work force 
among the statistics reported tuesday by the council an arm of 
the national academy of sciences were that 
by 1995 eight of the 10 fastest growing professions will be 
based on science 
skills in mathematics and a post secondary education will be 
needed for a majority of the 21 million new jobs created by the 
us economy by 2000 
math enrollments have doubled in the past 20 years but 
twothirds of the enrollees have been in courses lower than 
calculus 
the number of students receiving mathematics degrees those who 
could teach was lower in 1986 than in 1966 
the percentage of college students studying math may drop as 
the proportion of blacks and hispanics who have traditionally 
studied math at a lower rate than the general population 
increases the two groups comprised 22 percent of college students 
in 1985 they are expected to account for 30 percent by 2010 
womens interest in advanced mathematics has been low white 
women earn 17 percent of math doctorates compared with 70 percent 
by their male counterparts 
noncitizens comprise nearly half the graduate mathematics 
population even as the total number of doctorates awarded has 
continued to fall 
threequarters of math graduates work outside academia but no 
one knows much about what they do the lack of information dulls 
the appeal of mathematics as a major and as a profession the 
study said

a fire feeding on thousands of gallons of 
oil at a suburban milwaukee oilpacking company destroyed the plant 
tuesday and raged out of control for seven hours until a foam spray 
cut the flames 
the fire broke out shortly after 4 am at harrison oil corp no 
workers were inside at the time and no injuries were reported one 
firefighter was overcome by fumes and heat and another gashed his 
face when he fell 
plant manager gil dombek said nearly all of the 50000 to 
100000 gallons of outboard motor oil and 2000 to 3000 gallons of 
kerosene were engulfed in the blaze he also said 150 gallons of a 
cattle insecticide were believed to have burned and could have 
produced toxic fumes earlier in the morning 
but beyond that really there shouldnt be that much toxic in 
there dombek said 
firefighters were unable to control the fire until a specialized 
truck from milwaukees mitchell international airport was 
dispatched and sprayed thousands of gallons of foam on the flames 
said glendale fire chief norman wichman 
the foam did a fabulous job it really cut the fire wichman 
said 
a huge plume of smoke that billowed from the plant closed a 
manufacturer two schools and a portion of interstate 43 
state department of natural resources officials said an unknown 
quantity of oil antiflame foam and insecticides seeped into the 
milwaukee river and might kill fish and waterfowl there

demand for corn and soybeans has picked up a 
bit indicating smaller yearend stockpiles than had been forecast 
previously an agriculture department report said tuesday 
the new supplyanddemand analysis said the revisions were in 
line with recent figures showing that march 1 corn and soybean 
inventories were lower than expected 
thus with greater use in the 198990 marketing year sept 1 
corn inventories are expected to be about 133 billion bushels 
down from 148 billion forecast a month ago 
last sept 1 the us corn stockpile was 193 billion bushels 
reduced sharply by low yields caused by the 1988 drought on sept 
1 1988 the corn inventory was 426 billion bushels 
corn prices nationally are expected to average 230 to 240 
per bushel this marketing year up five cents from the march 
forecast but still well below the 254 average of the 198889 
marketing year 
in 198788 before the effects of the drought corn prices 
averaged 194 per bushel the report said 
on the international level the report said global trade in corn 
and other coarse grains is expected to be down slightly from 
the march forecast while world production is largely unchanged 
the prospective corn crop in south africa is up 500000 tons 
but lower sorghum crops are indicated for australia and 
argentina the report said 
global stockpiles of coarse grain which include corn sorghum 
barley oats rye millet and mixed grains are expected to be 
down from last months forcast to their lowest level since 198384 
because of the reduced us inventory 
soybean inventories going into the new marketing year on sept 1 
were put at 305 million bushels down from the march forecast of 
330 million however that would be up from 182 million bushels of 
soybeans on hand last sept 1 
the sept 1 1988 soybean stockpile was 302 million bushels 
marketing year prices averaged 588 per bushel in 198788 before 
soaring to 742 in 198889 
with larger production and smaller demand soybean prices are 
expected to average in the range of 555 to 565 this marketing 
year unchanged from the march forecast 
global production of oilseeds which includes soybeans was 
forecast at a record 2132 million metric tons down slightly from 
last month but 5 percent more than last year 
the report showed little change in the wheat supply and demand 
for the 198990 marketing year that began last june 1 
wheat stockpiles are expected to be about 442 million bushels 
this june 1 virtually the same as forecast last month that would 
compare with 702 million bushels on hand last june 1 and 126 
billion bushels on june 1 1988 
nationally wheat prices were forecast at 370 to 375 per 
bushel this marketing year down a nickel at the upper end of the 
range compared with 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788

the government declared tuesday that its often 
bitter relations with libya will improve as a result of the release 
from captivity of a french woman her daughter and the girls 
father 
the three were freed tuesday by the libyanbacked palestinian 
guerrilla group led by abu nidal 
previous releases of french hostages prompted complaints from 
critics that france barters with terrorists france has denied such 
charges 
there has been no confirmation of any deals or even direct talks 
for the latest releases but some conservative opposition leaders 
view the governments effusive mood toward libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi as suspicious 
president francois mitterrand thanked gadhafi for the 
determining role he played in the happy ending of this affair 
foreign minister roland dumas praised gadhafis noble and 
humanitarian gesture in pressuring abu nidals group to free the 
three 
in return for the releases dumas indicated in a statement that 
tripoli could expect to benefit from improved ties with france 
its real value will be appreciated in the future of relations 
between france and libya dumas said he did not elaborate 
a spokesman for frances conservative republican party said it 
was not useful for mr dumas to send flowers to gadhafi 
ladislav poniatowski said libya remains in effect a way station 
for international terrorism 
on april 4 gadhafi called for the release of hostages held in 
the middle east and specifically mentioned the french woman 
jacqueline valente 
she her daughter sophieliberte and the girls father fernand 
houtekins were held for 2 years by abu nidal and his 
fatahrevolutionary council four other belgians remain captive 
it was the second time gadhafi interceded for the french he 
pressured abu nidals group to free two other daughters of ms 
valente in 1988 
fatah spokesman walid khaled on tuesday denied assertions the 
hostages had been held in libya speaking at a news conference in 
beirut he said the hostages had been kept in lebanon where they 
were freed 
french relations with gadhafi have seesawed 
the latest thaw comes one month after france returned to libya 
three frenchmade mirage jet fighters here for repairs since 1986 
their return was blocked by an embargo imposed when libya and 
france backed opposing sides during a civil war in chad 
relations sunk to a new low in december when libya pressing 
for delivery of the aircraft closed its ports to french ships 
at the time tripoli lambasted paris on an array of issues 
accusing france of involvement in the terrorist plot being 
hatched against lebanon by the imperialist west in a letter to 
mitterrand gadhafi accused france of oppressing moslems and 
claimed the government was allowing jews to use france in a new 
war of religion against islam 
however while railing last month against the united states and 
west germany after a fire at a libyan plant alleged to produce 
chemical weapons libya praised france saying that all 
misunderstandings have dissipated 
gadhafi expressed hope tuesday that middle easterners detained 
in european and american jails would also be freed

an experiment conducted by the strategic 
defense initiative program successfully used laser radar to track a 
mock decoy warhead last month officials said on tuesday 
pentagon spokesman pete williams called the march 29 test a 
significant milestone in the effort to tell real warheads from 
decoys in midcourse 
the need to tell the difference between warheads and decoys is a 
key goal of the strategic defense initiative the spacebased 
strategic missile defense system popularly known as star wars 
missiles with decoys could be launched along with nucleartipped 
missiles to confuse a possible star wars system 
program officials who briefed reporters tuesday at the pentagon 
about the experiment said they launched a suborbital rocket last 
month from the national aeronautics and space administrations 
wallops island va facility tracked it to a 300mile highpoint 
and observed a payload that was ejected 
the program officials used a laser radar which is faster than 
conventional microwave radar to track the payload 
the test made use of the massachusetts institute of technology 
lincoln laboratory firepond laser radar located near westford 
mass officials said 
weve added another tool to help distinguish between warheads 
and decoys in a space environment said col raymond ross the 
director of the sensors and interceptor technology office of sdi

a federal judge said tuesday that regulators 
should explain why they slashed the estimated value of financier 
charles keatings lincoln savings and loan association and other 
investments 
the government says its 2 billion in the red and the former 
operator says its 600 million in the black us district judge 
stanley sporkin said im in a quandary lets get the receiver 
in here 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sporkins suggestion came after keating testified that lincoln 
was worth 500 million to 700 million when the government seized 
it a year ago the financier is trying to regain control of the 
irvine calif thrift which was seized by the government along 
with its large real estate holdings a year ago 
james murphy an attorney representing the government in its 
defense to keatings suit challenging the takeover tried to 
dissuade the judge 
he said fdic reports on lincolns status are already court 
record 
sporkins suggestion brought broad smiles from keating and 
several associates 
for months keating has claimed that sampl regulators undervalued 
lincolns investments and were grossly mismangaging them since 
taking over the thrift 
now it looks like we may start cutting through the bull and 
start talking real turkey said robert wurzelbacher keatings 
soninlaw and the manager of lincolns vast real estate holdings 
last week the general accounting office an arm of congress 
raised its estimate of the 30year cost of bailing out bankrupt 
thrifts from 257 billion to 300 billion and comptroller general 
charles bowsher said the figure could climb to 400 billion or 500 
billion if interest rates rise or there is a recession 
i dont think that that the us taxpayer need take that hit 
whatever the number is 300 billion 500 billion under a 
proper structure for the industry keating testified tuesday 
that structure according to keating would return sampls to the 
deregulated status they enjoyed from 1982 until 1985 when federal 
regulators began reimposing restricitions on thrift investments 
keating recounted how the federal home loan bank board 
criticized his 1984 purchase using federally insured deposits in 
lincoln of stock in gulf broadcasting co he said the regulators 
objected even though the thrift realized a 50 million profit on 
the deal 15 months later 
their criticism was that we might not have made it the 
profit he said we felt we had no downside there was a 
feeding frenzy for media properties at that time i thought we 
could have ended up with a 400 million gain that was later proven 
out by the subsequent liquidation of gulfs assets 
keating said lincoln settled for the 50 million profit because 
of regulators resistance to its participation in what was viewed 
by some as a hostile takeover attempt against gulf 
as an example of the government undervaluing lincoln assets 
keating pointed to the luxurious phoenician resort that using the 
thrifts funds he built outside phoenix at a price tag of 275 
million lincoln later sold a 45 percent interest in the phoenician 
and another hotel in phoenix to kuwait for 170 million 
keating estimated that lincolns interest in hotel is now worth 
190 million almost double 99 million asset value listed by 
government regulators on their books 
its a complete misunderstanding of value to write that hotel 
down he said resorts are a highly salable commodity in the 
world today it just hurts me i think theyre going to give it 
away

state officials on tuesday unveiled a 
multimilliondollar ad campaign financed by a cigarette tax that 
they hope will get 75 percent of californias smokers to quit by 
the year 2000 
smokers are footing the bill for the 286 million propaganda 
blitz with tobacco taxes levied under proposition 99 passed by 
california voters last year 
beginning wednesday antismoking ads will waft across 
television and radio airwaves and pop up in newspapers and on 
billboards throughout the state said dr kenneth kizer head of 
the state department of health services 
the television ads will offer such vignettes as a rap singer 
rapping about the dangers of smoking and a group of actors playing 
sleazy tobacco executives plotting to addict people to their 
product 
kizer said the 15month ad campaign represents by far the 
biggest volley ever fired by the antismoking camp in its war 
against the powerful tobacco industry 
the average state spends about 100000 a year on antitobacco 
messages and education he said there is nothing out there 
that even comes close to this 
but he also cautioned against raising expectations too high 
saying the 286 million figure is only a fraction of what the 
tobacco industry spends each year on its prosmoking campaigns 
the 1988 preliminary figures indicate they spent 32 billion 
for advertising and promotion of tobacco he said 
still kizer said he hopes the ad campaign coupled with 
educational efforts will result in a 20 percent decrease in 
smoking by june 1991 and a 75 percent reduction by 2000 
he said about 24 percent of californias 29 million residents 
are smokers 
later plans call for dividing 140 million in proposition 99 
funds between public schools and health agencies that would develop 
educational programs about the hazards of smoking 
kizer acknowledged however that the massive antismoking 
effort could prompt a massive backlash from the wellheeled tobacco 
industry 
i think well have to just wait and see how they respond he 
said if were successful if we do what we hope i think theyre 
definitely going to respond but im not sure how 
brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute in 
washington dc said the industry group is also taking a 
waitandsee attitude 
we have not seen the advertisements we were not shown them in 
advance she said but in terms of a counter effort no we 
have no intentions at this time of interfering with the process 
no matter how the industry reacts kizer said its time people 
got the truth about tobacco and what it does to ones health 
smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease 
stroke high blood pressure emphysema and several types of cancer 
not only is smoking deadly kizer said but the tobacco 
industrys ad campaigns deliberately exploit young people and 
immigrant groups who have little information about its hazards 
ms dawson denied that the industry tries to lure teenagers 
but said it believes adults should have the right to smoke

president bush named former assistant defense 
secretary richard l armitage on tuesday to represent the united 
states in longdelayed talks on the uncertain future of us bases 
in the philippines 
the selection of armitage a specialist on asian affairs will 
enable negotiations to begin on may 14 us officials said 
us leases expire next year on clark air base and on subic 
naval base the two largest us military bases overseas and on 
four smaller bases 
the talks will be conducted amid rising rising antiamerican 
sentiment in the philippines 
american officials have said they would like to retain the

los angeles ap the second trial of raymond buckey in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case began tuesday after the 
defendant received an extra lawyer and nearly 300 prospective 
jurors were summoned 
superior court judge stanley weisberg convened court in the jury 
assembly room rather than the courtroom because of the large number 
of prospects 
after he told the 287 panelists that buckeys trial would last 
at least through the year all but 90 indicated it would be a 
hardship to serve so long 
the 90 who did not claim a hardship were given questionnaires to 
determine how much they knew about the case and whether they had 
opinions about buckeys guilt or innocence the others were given 
questionnaires to determine whether they should be dismissed 
because of hardship 
jury selection began after a court session to resolve a dispute 
over delays caused by a back problem suffered by buckeys longtime 
attorney danny davis 
davis says he suffers from a herniated spinal disk and had 
previously sought a delay in the case to have back surgery on 
monday he agreed to try proceeding but jury selection never got 
under way 
he hobbled into court tuesday leaning heavily on a cane he said 
he reinjured a chronic back problem last weekend and is undergoing 
physical therapy 
attorney john wagner who represented buckeys sister in a 
successful fight to win back her teaching credentials was named 
cocounsel to help davis through the trial 
the 31yearold buckey has been a defendant for nearly seven 
years he was acquitted of 40 molestation charges jan 18 and his 
mother was acquitted of 12 charges but prosecutors decided to 
retry buckey on eight counts unresolved by the jury 
the first trial of buckey and his mother lasted nearly three 
years and cost 13 million the longest costliest criminal trial 
in us history

seventeen senators are asking health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan to overturn a new rule that could 
deny medicaid benefits to some of the disabled poor 
in a letter to sullivan the senators said the rule that took 
effect in january nullifies due process rights of these 
americans 
the regulation would require most states to adopt the decision 
of the social security administration as to whether an individual 
is disabled and it would give social security 90 days rather than 
60 days to decide 
hhs estimated the rule would save 5 million annually but the 
department said the purpose of the regulation is not to save money 
since the savings are a small part of the 80 billionayear 
program rather hhs says the changes will make the medicaid 
program more efficient and effective 
previously states could grant medicaid coverage to lowincome 
disabled people even if the social security administration 
determined that they were not disabled some states are more 
flexible than ssa in determining disability 
under the new rule an individual who is determined by ssa not 
to be disabled may not apply to the state for medicaid on the 
ground of disability for one year after that decision except in 
certain circumstances 
the senators led by sen patrick leahy dvt noted in their 
march 15 letter that a recent report by the general accounting 
office congress investigatory arm concluded more than half of 
the applicants denied disability benefits by ssa should have been 
granted those benefits

period according to cpl jose orlando roldan of san cristobal 
police 
he said national guardsmen had surrounded the prison

the prospect of improved relations between 
france and libya after the release of three european hostages drew 
expressions of concern and dismay from us officials tuesday 
france is being nicer to libya than we think they should be 
said one us official we think people should be keeping the 
pressure on libya 
the officials stopped short of accusing france of making a deal 
with libya for the release of the hostages one of whom is a french 
citizen 
jacqueline valente 32 her belgian husband and their 2yearold 
daughter were released tuesday after 2 years of captivity 
in paris there was no confirmation of any deal 
the officials who spoke on the condition they not be named 
said the united states would prefer that france and other countries 
insist that libya expel palestinian leader abu nidal and his 
followers and stop its alleged efforts to make chemical weapons 
abu nidals group the fatah revolutionary council arranged for 
the transfer of the hostages to french officials in beirut 
the release came a month after france returned three frenchmade 
mirage jet fighters to libya the planes had been in france for 
repairs since 1986 the return of the planes was blocked by an 
embargo imposed when libya and france backed opposing sides during 
the civil war in chad 
the french government thanked libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
for his role in the release and said relations with libya would 
improve gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a 
humanitarian gesture 
the us officials said american diplomats have told the french 
they have strong opposition to negotiating with terrorists 
libya continues to host the abu nidal organization and provide 
it with support we have repeatedly called on libya to expel this 
group and end libyan support for terrorism said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
as for gadhafi ms tutwiler said people everywhere should do 
what they can to end the barbaric practice of hostage taking basic 
civilized behavior requires nothing less 
ms tutwiler noted that the 18 american and other western 
hostages in lebanon are being held by proiranian groups and 
reaffirmed us opposition to negotiating with hostagetakers

solidarity leader lech walesa was quoted 
tuesday as saying he will run for president in the next election 
the report by the government news agency pap could not 
immediately be confirmed with walesa or his spokesman aides and 
colleagues of the solidarity leader have long been saying he is 
considering a presidential bid 
jaroslaw kaczynski a close associate of walesas and editor of 
the solidarity weekly newspaper said the leaders comments to pap 
should only be understood as a general declaration not connected 
with present events 
i confirm pap quoted walesa as saying when asked if he 
would run for president we have many wise and valuable people in 
government holding various posts however one must speed up the 
pace of reforms and destroy the old arrangements 
president wojciech jaruzelski the general and former communist 
party leader elected by parliament in july officially is to serve 
a sixyear term until 1995 
however there is widespread belief that the next presidential 
election will be moved up as part of an overhaul of the polish 
constitution 
the most likely time for elections appears to be spring 1991 
when poland would be marking the 200th anniversary of its first 
written constitution 
nothing in his remarks on pap indicated when walesa thought the 
election might be and kaczynski suggested the leader was not 
talking about an immediate presidential campaign 
nobody is talking about the date for elections or about 
starting any procedures he said he just states the certain 
fact that he will run when jaruzelski leaves offices 
this should be understood as a general declaration not 
connected with current events kaczynski added 
kaczynski said walesa is committed to winning reelection as 
solidaritys chairman next week when the union holds its first 
national congress in nine years 
i will run in the election and you know that when i run i want 
to win walesa told the solidarity executive commission on 
tuesday in gdansk and i count on your support 
walesa is expected to be challenged by union members who feel 
solidarity has strayed from its ideals of 1980 putting politics 
ahead of tradeunion goals like defending workers interests a 
longtime walesa critic marian jurczyk of szczecin has formed a 
rival faction called solidarity 80 
jaruzelski was elected president at a time when poland was the 
only east bloc country to have a legal opposition and to be making 
such bold moves toward democracy 
jaruzelski was to serve as a guarantee to the soviet union and 
polands warsaw pact allies that poland would do nothing to upset 
the east bloc alliance 
however that purpose has changed with the fall of communists 
from power in all six warsaw pact countries except the soviet 
union more radical reformers in poland feel it is time to oust 
jaruzelski in order to speed up changes in the country 
jaruzelski also has his advocates in the solidarityled 
government and parliament they feel that as president he has 
behaved with restraint and shown good cooperation with solidarity 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
elections now would be a divisive distraction from coping with 
the countrys pressing economic problems they say

international pilots will be warned that 
safety in the skies over seven us cities is critically deficient 
due to a change in air traffic control rules the air line pilots 
association announced tuesday 
the federal aviation administration which changed the rules two 
years ago defended the procedures saying they have brought no 
accidents and no close calls 
airspace over charlotte nc cleveland dallasfort worth los 
angeles memphis philadelphia and phoenix was added to the 
international black star list of airports and airspace that 
could pose problems for pilots 
only one other us site is among 23 other locations on the list 
the cyril e king international airport in st thomas us 
virgin islands surrounding terrain requires special training and 
no night flights according to pilot groups 
alpa announced the new list after the international federation 
of air line pilots associations added the seven us airspaces to 
its list 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the pilots complaints arise from 
a test that has been going on since 1987 in terminal control areas 
over the seven airports 
in 20 other sectors over major us airports controllers must 
maintain a separation of three miles between all aircraft at the 
seven cities farrar said controllers under limited circumstances 
need not comply with any set separation between aircraft as long as 
they are kept safely apart 
the new standard called conflict resolution has been used 
in the vast airspaces between airports for six years farrar said 
also without any accidents or close calls 
the conflict resolution procedure is only allowed during 
clear weather when one plane is flying by instruments and the pilot 
of the second plane is relying on what he sees out the window 
farrar said 
alpa said the black star designation formally known as the 
critically deficient list does not indicate unsafe conditions but 
is viewed as a serious deficiency in our nations aviation safety 
structure about which unfamiliar pilots should be warned 
the added risks coupled with the inability to measure any 
gains in efficiency make this a highly questionable exercise by 
the faa said alpa president henry duffy 
he said the faa benefits from the new system because it reduces 
the number of reportable operational errors making the skies 
appear to be safer no longer do all violations of the threemile 
separation have to be reported he said

half of america has already stood up to be 
counted 
the census bureau reported tuesday that the response rate for 
its 1990 national head count has reached 50 percent 
we expect the number to grow said spokeswoman paulette 
lichtmanpanzer noting that the halfway mark was reached last 
friday 
and that response rate counted only forms that have been 
logged in by census offices across the nation she said many 
places have a backlog of returns waiting to be checked in 
the bureau mailed out 88 million forms on march 23 and hand 
delivered an additional 11 million to homes where proper mailing 
addresses could not be obtained 
in addition census takers are working with postal officials to 
correct problems in several communities where forms could not be 
delivered for one reason or another officials said 
if anyone has put off answering the census nows the time to 
do so said lichtmanpanzer stressing the need to increase the 
mail response rate 
census officials have told congress that they hope for a 70 
percent response rate sending workers out to count those who do 
not answer the mailed request costs an estimated 10 million for 
every percentage point officials have estimated 
census offices will begin sending out workers april 26 to homes 
where no form has been sent back said lichtmanpanzer 
they will try to interview the residents to get the necessary 
information in some cases she pointed out homes are vacant or 
may have been torn down resulting in no form being returned 
while half the census forms are now back tabulating the 
information they contain will take months 
the first results of the census population totals for each 
state will be reported on dec 31 and more detailed information 
will follow after the first of the year 
the total cost of the census is expected to reach 25 billion 
the national head count is conducted every 10 years it is 
required by the constitution to produce population totals used in 
reapportioning seats in the house of representatives in addition 
census population totals are used in dividing up billions of 
dollars in federal funds for state and local governments

the ruling sandinistas said tuesday 
new fighting could break out because an agreement between the newly 
elected government and contra rebels failed to set a deadline for 
the rebels to disarm 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada and the prosandinista 
daily el nuevo diario ran editorials and stories dismissing the 
accord as a rebel ploy to gain time and influence before the april 
25 change of government the accord was reached monday 
they also accused the rebels and the united national opposition 
of presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro of trying to take 
over the sandinista peoples army 
the people ask that the eps act said el nuevo diario in 
a frontpage headline referring to the sandinista army by its 
spanish initials it added in a subhead either the contra is 
wiped out or theyll wipe out everything 
outgoing leftist president daniel ortega defeated by mrs 
chamorro in elections feb 25 was quoted by el nuevo diario as 
saying that the contras in collusion with extremist sectors of 
the prous united national opposition were adopting a hard line 
about demobilizing 
this ortega was quoted as saying is a point that worries us 
and obliges us to maintain ourselves alert 
in an editorial titled the first test of the new government 
barricada said there is nothing to discuss with the contras 
save their demobilization by april 25 that is when mrs chamorro 
takes office for a sixyear term 
the intransigent attitude assumed by some contra ringleaders 
and extremist uno politicians is placing the nation in a very 
dangerous situation the editorial said 
unless this situation is resolved in the briefest term all 
the efforts for peace and reconciliation could revert into a 
fresh outbreak of the war the editorial added 
barricadas editorials are considered the official sandinista 
party line 
the war between the contras and the sandinistas has killed an 
estimated 30000 people since it began in 1981 two years after the 
sandinistas came to power in a revolution that toppled rightist 
dictator anastasio somoza 
an estimated 9000 contras based in honduras have moved back to 
nicaragua 
on monday negotiators for the contras and uno said rebels in 
camps at yamales in the honduran jungle near the nicaraguan 
border would be the first to turn in their weapons they said the 
surrender of weapons would begin april 18 
a contingent of 170 venezuelan troops arrived tuesday in 
honduras to strengthen a united nations force of observers who are 
to supervise the disbandment in honduras and nicaragua 
gen agustin quesada gomez their spanish commander said 
venezuela will send a total of 700 soldiers they will be joined by 
troops from several other countries 
the observers will supervise the disarmament of the rebels at 
yamales and the concentration of contras in predetermined safety 
zones inside nicaragua once the un peacekeeping force can 
ensure a ceasefire 
mondays accord in tegucigalpa honduras also calls for a 
contra commission to go to managua before april 18 to speed up 
the demobilization but it did not set a deadline for completion 
contra leaders have been issuing conflicting signals saying 
they would demobilize in support of mrs chamorros new government 
but also saying they do not trust the sandinistas 
forcing the contras to demobilize by april 25 would amount to a 
moral victory for the sandinistas but none of the accords the 
rebels signed requires them to disband by that date

out of town

vindicated in the future i will continue to review fox films in 
the same evenhanded way i have in the past

the ban would last only one film and roger had predicted it would 
last none siskel said roger was right and hes going to be 
hard to deal with when he gets home 
the two appear on siskel amp ebert amp the movies a syndicated

drill bit business to avoid a justice department antitrust suit 
over its proposed 550 million purchase of a salt lake city 
company according to court papers filed tuesday

challenging the proposed acquisition of eastman christensen co of 
salt lake city by baker hughes inc of houston along with a 
consent decree settling the suit

diamond drill bits natural diamond bits synthetic diamond bits 
called polycrystalline diamond compact bits and thermally stable 
synthetic polycrystalline diamond bits 
in the united states last year sales of the three types of 
diamond drill bits totaled more than 30 million baker hughes

the libyanbacked palestinian group headed by abu 
nidal freed a french woman a belgian man and their young daughter 
tuesday after holding them for nearly 2 years 
the three arrived to the cheers of a crowd of relatives and 
french officials at a military airport outside paris late tuesday 
after a fivehour flight from beirut they had been dropped off at 
the french embassy in the morning by masked gunmen who arrived in 
cars with drawn curtains 
jacqueline valente 32 fernand houtekins 43 and their 
2yearold daughter sophieliberte born in captivity made no 
public statements though the couple smiled as they got off the 
plane they were taken to a military hospital to spend their first 
night in freedom after 882 days captivity 
abu nidals group announced nov 8 1987 it had seized the 
hostages from the french yacht silco in the mediterranean off the 
gaza strip it accused them of collaborating with israels mossad 
intelligence agency friends said the group was on a holiday cruise 
the french government thanked libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
for his role in the release and said relations with libya would 
improve gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a 
humanitarian gesture 
president bush in toronto said he didnt know enough about the 
release to say whether gadhafi deserves any credit 
weve got some major differences with libya that continue to 
exist but look who am i to argue in this case if someone can help 
free one hostage give that person credit bush said 
the hostages released by the fatahrevolutionary council used 
an executive jet in beirut provided by the french government to fly 
to villacoublay near paris ms valente was the first to disembark 
followed by houtekins holding their daughter in his arms all 
appeared healthy 
the fatahrevolutionary council has been blamed for scores of 
terrorist acts including the december 1985 attacks on rome and 
vienna airports that killed more than 20 people 
because the hostages were believed to have been held in libya 
the case is considered unrelated to the 18 westerners including 
eight americans held in lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem 
factions 
however fatah spokesman walid khaled denied assertions that the 
hostages had been held in libya speaking at a news conference in 
beirut he said the hostages had been kept in lebanon 
the state department welcomed the release and called for freeing 
of other captives 
however us officials in washington were critical of frances 
warm words for gadhafi the officials who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity said france and other countries should press libya to 
expel abu nidal and his group and stop alleged efforts to make 
chemical weapons 
france is being nicer to libya than we think they should be 
said one us official 
the release came a month after france returned to libya three 
frenchmade mirage jet fighters that had been in france for repairs 
since 1986 the return of the planes was blocked by an embargo 
imposed when libya and france backed opposing sides during the 
civil war in chad 
in december libya pressing for delivery of the aircraft 
closed its ports to french ships 
gadhafi said tuesday that abu nidals group was distancing 
itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing the hostages 
libyas official news agency jana reported 
last week gadhafi urged the release of hostages in the middle 
east as a gesture for ramadan the islamic holy month he singled 
out ms valente 
gadhafi has supported abu nidal who along with some of his 
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad the 
libyan leader is believed to have allowed him to live near the 
libyan capital tripoli 
houtekins said after his release that four members of his family 
still held by the terrorist group are well 
they have morale they are holding firm he said adding 
we expected our freedom we knew it was coming one day the day 
of our freedom has arrived for those who stay behind we keep 
hoping 
i embrace all my family i am well and the little one also 
ms valente told french reporters 
only two french news organizations were given access to the 
hostages 
the hostages refused to discuss conditions of their captivity or 
where they were held they did not mention a second child born in 
captivity in 1989 
french ambassador rene ala said ms valente told him the boy 
died recently of problems with his digestive system 
a police spokesman said french officials apparently had 
advance notice of the release ala was waiting at a cement outpost 
manned by french marine guards near the main gate of the west 
beirut compound 
in beirut the fatahrevolutionary spokesman said direct 
talks between our movement and the french side have resulted in an 
agreement on their release khaled did not elaborate 
there was no evidence of any deal but french president francois 
mitterrand personally thanked gadhafi for the determining role he 
played in the happy ending of this affair 
foreign minister roland dumas praised what he called gadhafis 
noble gesture 
the releases real value will be appreciated in the future 
of relations between france and libya dumas said without 
elaborating 
in brussels foreign minister mark eyskens said he hoped the 
release can be considered as a testimony of good faith concerning 
the release of the other hostages 
the abu nidal group still holds houtekins brother emmanuel and 
emmanuels wife and teenage daughter and son 
the group linked freedom for them to the release of nasser 
saeed a palestinian serving a life term in belgium for a june 
1980 grenade attack on jewish youths in antwerp 
the belgian government has not responded to the offer 
two other daughters of ms valente were freed as a result of 
libyan intervention on dec 29 1988 
in france jacquelines mother brigitte valente said tuesday 
the nightmare is over and im trembling with joy i cant even 
talk its too beautiful

president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday he and 
senior government advisers will agree before the end of the week on 
a muchanticipated program of radical economic reform 
he said he wants to quicken the pace for overhauling the economy 
his announcement came as senior soviet officials debate whether 
to initiate polishstyle economic shock therapy here that would 
free prices and sharply increase unemployment while slashing the 
value of the ruble 
the officials have cautioned however that the government will 
be able to go only as fast as angry and disillusioned consumers 
allow 
on tuesday gorbachev told a congress of the komsomol communist 
youth group analyzing the situation we came to the conclusion 
that it is necessary to speed up economic reform already this year 
and at the beginning of next year we will take the basic steps in 
this direction that were planned for 19921993 
gorbachev said the presidential council and the council of the 
federation two new advisory groups formed after he took office 
last month as the countrys first executive president will meet 
saturday to decide on proposals from government ministers to put 
reforms into effect 
soviet leaders want to boost industrial production and remedy 
perennial shortages of a range of consumer goods 
gorbachev said the proposals will be presented for public debate 
before they go into effect he did not go into particulars 
one day earlier deputy premier leonid abalkin dodged questions 
on the details of economic reform at a news conference creating 
the impression the government still had not decided many questions 
abalkin also said public worries about rising prices and 
unemployment were a key factor 
a speedy transition to a market economy will come up against 
powerful opposition he said 
what we must do first is to make all people understand and see 
clearly that without such a transition the country has no future as 
a highly developed great power abalkin said 
in bonn west germany on monday the soviets pledged in an 
international accord to support freemarket economic policies the 
soviet economy is now stalled somewhere between central planning 
and free markets 
on tuesday the soviets asked the western nations in bonn for 
the conference on economic cooperation in europe to ease limits on 
the sale of hightechnology goods to the soviet union

president bush on tuesday complimented libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi for an apparently positive role in the 
release of three european hostages but said major differences with 
libya remain 
bush said he didnt know if the release had implications for 
us hostages being held but called anew for their release as a 
manifestation of good will 
the president during a questionandanswer session with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney was asked about the action 
by a libyanbacked palestinian group in freeing a french woman a 
belgian man and their young daughter tuesday after holding them for 
nearly 2 years 
the three arrived in paris on tuesday after a fivehour flight 
from beirut where they had been dropped off at the french embassy 
by masked gunmen 
gadhafi last week called for the release of hostages as a 
humanitarian gesture 
look who am i to argue on this case if somebody can help 
free one hostage any person held against his or her will give 
that person credit bush said 
a person deserves credit for facilitating the release of 
people held against their will anywhere in the world i would 
certainly say fine give the person credit bush said while 
saying he didnt know enough about the facts of this release 
if this individual col gadhafi had a part in it i would 
say thats very positive but weve got some major diffences with 
libya that continue to exist bush said 
the president said said he did not know whether the release 
has any implications at all as it related to the eight us 
hostages in lebanon including terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who has been held more than 
five years 
a few weeks ago there was a flurry of understandable 
excitement about the release of these people bush said and i 
had difficulty understanding where was all this coming from whats 
driving this news flurry 
and i still dont know the answer to that 
but he added i would just repeat that good will begets good 
will and a manifestation of good will would be the rlease of these 
american hostages

police searched files of known 
arsonists tuesday and explored the black shell of the ferry 
scandinavian star for clues to the fire that killed about 200 
people two years after there was a blaze on board the same vessel 
investigators in swedens west coast port of lysekil said entire 
decks were burned of everything combustible and it may be 
impossible to pinpoint physical evidence on how the weekend fire 
began 
in oslo norwegian police who took charge of the case said they 
were looking for one or more arsonists but added that the firebug 
could have been among the victims of the flames that engulfed the 
10500ton ship en route from norway to denmark 
allan pollock spokesman for the us national transportation 
safety board said tuesday in washington that the vessels owners 
failed to respond to any of the boards recommendations after a 
nonfatal march 15 1988 engineroom fire on the scandinavian star 
off mexicos yucatan peninsula 
the chairman of the ntsb james kolstad said it is ironic 
that many of the problems the board cited in its investigation of a 
fire aboard the same vessel two years ago are being reported by 
survivors of the north sea fire 
kolstad in an interview tuesday said he was sending an 
investigator to act as an observer in the investigation 
an american entertainer on the ship ruth e rome of east 
lansing mich was among the presumed dead 
after the first fire the board recommended increased crew 
training more life vests on the deck smoke detectors 
modifications to prevent smoke from traveling through air 
ventilation systems and other steps to improve safety 
the danishbased dano line bought the 20yearold scandinavian 
star last month from seaescape of miami the ship was registered in 
the bahamas and had been working the norwaydenmark line for one 
week 
oslos assistant police chief magnar aukrust said tuesday i 
believe we will be able to discover whoever was behind the fire we 
have some detailed information 
aukrust said about a third of the rescued passengers and crew 
have been questioned so far 
his deputy arne huuse said we have no specific suspect 
but suspicions of arson were strengthened by the technical 
investigation on board 
oslo police will publish a list of 186 people considered missing 
of the estimated 534 people who boarded the ship figures changed 
as people considered missing reported in said oystein berger a 
senior police officer 
police opened the final cabins for inspection tuesday three 
days after the smoldering ship was towed into port officers said 
the devastation will make it hard to identify the victims or even 
count them accurately 
more than 120 bodies were recovered 
the bodies left on board are so badly burned you can put them 
in a teacup said police inspector leif skoglund i went on the 
ship this afternoon it was terrible 
about 20 bodies lay in corridors people who succumbed to the 
smoke as they tried to flee 
a lot of people hid in the shower or the toilet skoglund 
said in one toilet a policeman who tried to count the bodies 
couldnt tell if there was one or four 
skoglund said the temperature in midships cabins reached 572 
degrees it destroyed everything 
members of the royal family prime minister jan p syse and us 
ambassador loret miller ruppe led about 1000 people who attended a 
state memorial service in oslos main cathedral 
witnesses said one fire began some time after 2 am saturday 
but that the fire alarm sounded only at 230 am investigators 
said at least two fires were started independently supporting the 
theory that an arsonist was to blame 
marine experts from norway sweden and denmark gathered in 
copenhagen to discuss tightening safety regulations especially on 
board foreignregistered vessels 
danish industry minister anne lundholt said the commission also 
would consider requiring full passenger lists for the ferries and 
ways to improve emergency training 
a separate maritime inquiry was due to start in the danish 
capital on wednesday 
news reports in denmark said the scandinavian star received a 
clean bill of health from an inspection in january by lloyds 
register in miami where it was then owned by seaescape 
in 1988 a crew member discovered an engineroom fire aboard the 
scandinavian star as it was returning from cozumel mexico to its 
tampa home port with 439 passengers mostly americans 
smoke detectors apparently failed as did an automatic system to 
douse flames the emergency generators didnt work for an hour 
leaving the vessel without power in rough seas in the yucatan 
channel according to ntsb reports released as the agencys 
threeday hearing opened in miami in june 1988 
although there were no injuries or deaths the failure of the 
vessels safety systems highlights the potential for a catastrophic 
loss of life in this accident and future vessel fires jim 
burnett chairman of the ntsb said then

the communist partys policymaking central 
committee accused a radical faction on tuesday of trying to split 
the party and indicated its members could be expelled 
it said in its statement that the democratic platform a group 
that includes populist boris n yeltsin historian yuri afanasiev 
and economist gavriil popov was trying to turn the party into a 
formless association with full freedom for factions and groups 
that is to actually break it apart 
the democratic platform seeks faster and deeper political and 
economic reforms than president mikhail s gorbachev 
the time has come when it is necessary to work out what to 
do with those party members who are persistently and purposefully 
leading affairs to a break the statement said can these kinds 
of people really remain in the ranks of the communist party of the 
soviet union 
a party congress begins july 2 the party is trying to prevent 
more splits after party members in the baltic republics of 
lithuania and estonia decided to break away and form independent 
parties 
democratic platform has been debating since its formation in 
january whether to break with the national communist party to form 
a social democratic party 
such a split could be more serious than the break with the 
baltic parties some of the most progressive party members from 
across the soviet union would likely join the breakaway group 
thereby forming a nationwide opposition 
the statement of the 248member central committee a body that 
includes all major party leaders said party organizations must 
decide whether individual democratic platform members should remain 
in the party 
gorbachev who is both president and party leader has pushed 
the communists to accept a multiparty system but at the same time 
has tried to prevent a split among its 19 million members he says 
party unity is necessary to carry out his reform plan 
tuesdays central committee attack came days after the party in 
the byelorussian republic which is known for its conservatism 
gave local party organizations the power to expel members of the 
democratic platform 
in an interview with the national daily selskaya zhizn published 
last weekend politburo member yegor k ligachev attacked the 
radicals 
ligachev widely thought by reformers to be among the most 
conservative members of the party politburo said the democratic 
platform was reviving the social democratic parties that battled 
the bolsheviks for power as the russian empire crumbled

labor party leader shimon peres said tuesday he 
wants to serve as both prime minister and foreign minister in a 
proposed coalition government but his announcement was clouded by 
reports that two key supporters may defect 
the media reports if true jeopardize the laborled coalitions 
anticipated 6159 majority in wednesdays parliament vote on the 
government 
peres tried to quell the talk of defections in an impassioned 
speech to labors 1500member central committee which approved 
his party nominees for 11 cabinet posts in the new government 
we have the support of 61 legislators in parliament maybe 
more peres told members of his leftofcenter party 
peres said all 11 labor ministers who served in the collapsed 
coalition with the rightwing likud bloc would join the new 
cabinet he added that at least four more labor members would join 
at a later stage 
the announcement was met by boos from party activists who had 
demanded fresh faces in the new government 
other parties in the new coalition would be given other 
ministries peres said 
peres who was finance minister in the outgoing government said 
he would serve as foreign minister in addition to prime minister 
labors no 2 leader yitzhak rabin would be defense minister 
israel radio tuesday reported growing speculation that two 
legislators from the ultraorthodox agudat israel party would 
renege on their partys coalition agreement with labor and either 
abstain or vote against labor on wednesday 
if agudat israel legislators avraham verdiger and eliezer 
mizrahi abstain peres would still have a narrow majority if they 
vote against labor peres apparently would be unable to form a 
government 
agudat israel has five legislators it signed a coalition 
agreement with labor last month after the deal was approved by the 
partys spiritual leaders the council of torah greats 
rabbi menachem porush a legislator with the party denied the 
speculation about the defections saying verdiger and mizrahi are 
bound by the decision of their spiritual leaders 
there is no doubt that the decision of the council of the 
torah greats was accepted by all our members porush told israel 
radio late tuesday 
the 61 legislators peres has been counting on include 39 from 
labor five from agudat israel five from the leftwing citizens 
rights movement crm three from the socialist mapam party two 
from the leftwing shinui party three from the communist hadash 
party and three tiny parties with one legislator each 
the 61st is avraham sharir a former tourism minister who 
defected from the rightwing likud bloc last week and signed a 
coalition agreement with labor 
labor so far has failed to bring the citizens rights movement 
mapam and shinui into the government 
we are going to support the government tomorrow but we are 
not going to join it because of the nature of the coalition between 
the labor party and a defector citizens rights movement 
legislator yossi sarid said tuesday referring to sharir 
we would join the government at a later stage when and if 
other legitimate parties join sarid told the associated press 
agudat israel will receive the portfolios of housing and social 
welfare sharir will become minister of transportation and tourism 
in return for his defection from likud 
the outgoing cabinet had 25 members including several without 
portfolio it was not clear whether peres would keep the cabinet at 
the same size 
labor brought down the likudlabor coalition march 15 after 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of likud refused to accept us 
middle east peace proposals those proposals supported by peres 
were intended to clear the way for palestinianisraeli talks in

of complacency toward libya and said col moammar gadhafi was 
violating human rights in his own country while continuing 
aggression against chadian forces 
chads embassy in paris released a statement from foreign 
minister acheikh ibn oumar in which he accused libya of a military 
buildup in the aouzou region along the border of the two african 
countries 
he said members of breakaway palestinian guerrilla factions were 
being used by libya as mercenaries against chad he also claimed 
libya was holding thousands of citizens of chad mali nigeria and 
togo in desert concentration camps on the pretext that they were in 
libya illegally 
the foreign minister contended that sudan had signed an accord 
with libya to obtain weapons and money in return for allowing libya 
to mobilize dissident chadian forces on sudanese territory 
france sent 146 soldiers to chad as reinforcements in late march 
after a series of attacks on chadian troops by the libyanbacked 
rebels however the situation has calmed down since then and the 
reinforcements reportedly have been recalled

sen sam nunn said tuesday he has resigned 
from an allmale suburban golf club a resignation certain to fuel 
speculation about his presidential ambitions 
i have dropped out for personal reasons nunn said in a 
statement released by his office in response to questions about his 
membership in the burning tree club of bethesda md 
nunn who considered running for the democratic nomination for 
president in 1988 did not elaborate on his reasons for resigning 
from the club whose members include some of the nations most 
powerful political leaders 
my priority is to run for reelection to the us senate 
nunn said as i have said many times i have no plans or 
inclination to run for president at no time have i ever 
established a preset time frame for contemplating a decision on a 
future presidential campaign 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee was the 
favorite son of southern and conservative democrats during the 
early part of the 1988 campaign but he twice refused to jump into 
the race citing family pressures and his senate duties 
the burning tree club which has been an allmale bastion since 
its founding in 1922 last year lost a court battle to regain a tax 
break the maryland legislature had taken away from it in 1986 
because of the clubs refusal to admit women as members 
the club had a longstanding agreement with the state to 
preserve its open spaces in return for favorable property tax 
treatment but the legislature responding to pressure from womens 
groups canceled the agreement forcing the club to choose between 
admitting women or losing its tax break 
the supreme court last fall upheld a lower court ruling that the 
new law did not violate members rights and in january the club 
paid 12 million in back taxes resulting from the case 
robert zarnock a maryland assistant attorney general said 
tuesday the private club has not reapplied for the tax break 
which it could do if it changed its admissions policy

bucking heavy union opposition 
gov rafael hernandez colon on tuesday signed a bill authorizing 
the 2 billion sale of puerto ricos governmentowned telephone 
company 
never before have government officials of the executive and 
legislative branches been confronted with so much pressure and so 
much opposition as was unleashed against this bill the governor 
said during a signing ceremony at la fortaleza his official 
residence 
earlier in the day both legislative houses easily approved the 
measure the senate vote was 168 with 3 abstentions the house of 
representatives vote was 3417 with 1 abstention 
led by a coalition of about 60 unions opponents have fiercely 
opposed the sale of the puerto rico telephone co since hernandez 
colon proposed it in his annual state of the commonwealth message 
in february 
on march 28 thousands of unionized workers staged a oneday 
general strike and rally at the capitol to protest the sale which 
critics say will result in mass layoffs and higher phone bills 
at tuesdays signing hernandez colon accused labor leaders of 
only looking out for their own interests 
to try to stop this sale by threatening buyers is to go 
against the interests of the puerto rican people he said 
referring to threats of labor unrest among telephone workers 
against any private owner 
proceeds from the sale will be used to set up two 1 billion 
trust funds one for education and the other for improving public 
services such as highway maintenance sewerage water and power 
systems 
the government expects 85 million to 95 million in interest 
per year 
the us commonwealth bought the telephone company from itt 
corp in 1974 for 165 million it now earns 70 million a year and 
employs 8000 people 
hernandez colon said the sale should be completed by the end of 
this year or early 1991 
among us communications companies said to be interested in 
buying the telephone company are contel gte united 
telecommunications inc and the baby bells

the hundreds of millions of dollars 
in cash cars and other property seized from drug dealers is 
setting off disputes among police departments and other agencies 
law enforcement experts said tuesday 
police at a michigan state university conference on community 
policing said departments can become so addicted to the huge sums 
of money seized from dealers that raising money becomes more 
important than fighting drugs 
decisions start getting made based on whats this guy got 
if hes got a costly boat am i going to deal with him or put my 
resources on this little guy selling marijuana at the high 
school said robert k olson former police chief in corpus 
christi texas 
the us drug enforcement administration expects to seize more 
than 1 billion in assets from drug traffickers this year said 
david westrate assistant administrator for operations 
wayne county prosecutor john ohair who is involved in a court 
battle with the city of detroit over access to records of how it 
has spent seized assets warned that failure of departments to 
account for the money could undermine public confidence 
we have public support for forfeiture in dealing with the drug 
problem but when you have a city administration that shrouds these 
dollars in secrecy you erode public support he said 
corpus christi police routinely made big hauls from drug busts 
olson said 
controls over the money were lax initially with up to 250000 
in cash routinely kept in an old safe they were just going out 
and busting bad guys and stuffing money in the safe olson said 
the city used the money to start drug education programs in 
local schools and buy equipment as well as finance more undercover 
drug buys 
but olson said one unidentified city became so dependent on drug 
money to pay drug agents salaries that its chief pulled out of an 
interagency drug task force because he wanted to keep 100 percent 
of the forfeited assets rather than a 40 percent share 
agencies hungry for drug profits can also end up bidding for 
tips from informants olson said 
michael j leverenz assistant police chief in tucson ariz 
said early use of seizure laws in that community gave police access 
to fancy cars they could use for undercover work but he warned 
against letting those who seize the assets decide what should be 
done with them 
as much as possible you want to remove people from the 
mentality if i go out and seize that corvette im the one thats 
going to drive it he said 
bitter battles have been waged between police departments and 
city managers in some arizona cities over how seized assets should 
be spent he said 
in one small city that netted 12 million the police chief 
threatened to let the money go to the federal government if city 
officials refused to let him spend it the way he planned leverenz 
said 
michigan law requires seized assets to be used for enforcing 
drug laws and they may not replace existing funds ohair said

los angeles ap the second trial of raymond buckey in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case opened tuesday nearly seven 
years after his arrest triggered public hysteria and the nations 
longest criminal trial 
superior court judge stanley weisberg told 287 prospective 
jurors that the retrial could stretch into 1991 and all but 90 
said it would be a hardship to serve so long 
the judge convened court in the jury assembly room because of 
the large number of prospects more jury candidates will be 
summoned if the first group of 287 fails to survive questioning on 
hardship publicity and personal views on the widely publicized 
case 
buckey 31 has been a defendant for nearly seven years he was 
acquitted of 40 molestation charges jan 18 his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey was acquitted of 12 charges but prosecutors 
decided to retry buckey on eight counts unresolved by the jury 
jurors deadlocked on 13 charges but the prosecution dropped five 
the first trial of buckey and his mother lasted nearly three 
years and cost 13 million making it the longest costliest 
criminal trial in us history 
the eight remaining charges involve three children a 
dramatically diminished number compared to the hundreds once 
described as alleged victims at the mcmartin preschool in 
manhattan beach 
jury selection began a day late due to delays caused by back 
trouble plaguing buckeys longtime attorney danny davis who said 
he could proceed for four hours a day if another attorney could 
relieve him 
attorney john wagner who represented buckeys sister in a 
successful fight to win back her teaching credentials was named 
cocounsel 
peggy ann buckey was one of seven original defendants in the 
case charges against her and four others were dismissed before the 
first trial 
wagner primarily a civil attorney said one of his key 
qualifications is an adamant conviction that buckey is innocent 
this stuff never happened he told reporters this is the 
witch hunt of 1990 
buckey told reporters he is pleased with his new lawyer but was 
not looking forward to rehashing the mcmartin case again he 
said he was confident of acquittal because i know what they dont 
have 
davis said he considers the retrial a farce and absurd 
this is nothing but a primary election ploy he said 
referring to district attorney ira reiners campaign for state 
attorney general 
deputy district attorney joe martinez who recently took over 
the prosecution disagreed 
we are convinced that mr buckey is a child abuser and until 
its resolved we will continue to prosecute mr buckey he said

east german political leaders squabbled over 
the cabinet seats still open on tuesday as prime ministerdesignate 
lothar de maiziere struggled to form a broadbased coalition 
government 
christian democrat de maiziere who intends to lead the 
fledgling democracy to unity with west germany said he still 
sought a consensus on several issues 
he added however that negotiators made a good bit of 
headway in the drawnout bargaining and that he was determined to 
present the cabinet list to parliament for approval thursday 
hanswilhem ebeling of the german social union tapped as 
minister for economic cooperation said negotiators had a night or 
two of work ahead before the list was complete 
the christian democrats gerhard pohl appeared the likely choice 
for the economics ministry which will oversee melding a 
centralized system of stateowned companies with west germanys 
free market 
he will also be a key player in negotiations with west germany 
over replacing east germanys nearly worthless currency with the 
powerful deutsche mark 
apparent differences emerged tuesday between pohl and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl an important ally among the west 
german christian democrats 
weeks ago kohl suggested east german savers be given a 1to1 
exchange rate for up to 2000 east german marks 
but pohl told the cologne express newspaper a 1to1 swap should 
be allowed for up to 30000 marks a person 
an exchange amount of 2000 marks is no good its much to 
small the newspaper quoted him as saying 
a west german mark is worth just under 60 cents 
pohl also told the newspaper that at least 30 percent of 
stateowned operations in east germany are in danger of 
extinction 
the 52yearold conservative politician was a member of the 
previous communistdominated parliament and is his partys leading 
economics expert 
under an agreement reached monday 14 of the 24 cabinet seats 
will go to the winning threeparty conservative alliance led by de 
maiziere seven to the leftleaning social democrats and three to a 
smaller liberal alliance 
de maiziere announced the names of 11 designated ministers and 
was expected to announce the rest tuesday evening before 
differences among the prospective coalition partners made more 
talks necessary 
the freely elected government will replace the communist 
caretaker administration that has been running east germany since 
last octobers prodemocracy revolt 
differences remain between the christian democrats and the 
social democrats over the sticky problem of privatizing east 
germanys staterun companies 
the social democrats want employees to be allowed to take part 
in ownership christian democrats favor straight privatization of 
the companies 
social democrat leader markus meckel said during a breather in 
the talks that the atmosphere was tense 
the parties did agree the property of east german citizens 
should be protected for 10 years and that east germans should have 
preferences in buying land shares in companies and housing after 
the two german states are unified 
east germans own no land and some west germans have made claims 
on property their ancestors owned before germany was divided after 
world war ii 
although de maizieres alliance won the most seats in the 
400member parliament it wants a coalition with the social 
democrats to ensure the twothirds majority needed to enact 
constitutional changes to allow quick unification with west germany

chiles promoscow communist party split 
tuesday when a group of leading members resigned over demands for 
more democracy within the body 
the breakaway group is led by former sen alejandro toro and 
patricio hales who was one of the partys few spokesmen during the 
16 years it remained outlawed under the military regime of gen 
augusto pinochet pinochet yielded power to elected civilian 
president patricio aylwin on march 11 
the leaders of the party dissidents say they have a following of 
about 2000 members of the party which was legalized last week 
the party founded 60 years ago had never before split 
in a statement announcing their resignations the dissidents 
said they urged the party leadership to change policies for years 
but they were not heard because there has not been an internal 
democracy 
they also criticized the partys support of armed struggle 
against the pinochet regime saying the stand endangered efforts 
to restore democracy in chile 
the resigning party members are also known to enthusiastically 
support the recent changes in eastern europe 
the party leadership did not immediately comment on the 
resignations 
the chilean communist party was considered the second largest in 
the southern hemisphere after cubas before the 1973 military 
coup led by pinochet at that time it had around 16 percent of the 
national vote 
in decembers general election it failed to elect a single 
congressman

one day after issuing a harsh new warning to 
lithuanian separatists soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
backed off the tough line tuesday by declaring he does not yet see 
a need to impose presidential rule 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis responding to the 
severe tone of mondays declaration by the kremlin sent a telegram 
to gorbachev saying he feared that ultrarightist imperial forces 
are compelling you to take a wrong step to continue the wrongs of 
the 1940s in the baltics 
in the name of peace justice and concord on earth do not do 
this he wrote 
he was referring to the soviet occupation and forced annexation 
of the three baltic republics lithuania estonia and latvia in 
1940 
since march 11 when lithuania declared its independence 
restored the kremlin has repeatedly alternated between threatening 
and conciliatory tones on several occasions threatening military 
movements were followed by kinder words 
speaking tuesday at a young communist league congress in moscow 
gorbachev said presidential rule would be used only as an extreme 
measure during a civil conflict the tass news agency said he said 
soviet leaders are still trying to persuade lithuanians to rescind 
their declaration of independence 
presidential rule could include martial law and dissolving 
lithuanias parliament it was elected in march and is lithuanias 
first freely elected parliament in 50 years 
however in a meeting tuesday with british foreign secretary 
douglas hurd gorbachev said the adventurist actions of the 
current leadership can cost the lithuanian people themselves the 
soviet union and world peace dearly 
we display the maximum political goodwill although it is 
increasingly harder to do tass quoted the soviet leader as 
saying 
in the latest soviet show of strength several tanks rolled 
through gediminas square in the center of vilnius the lithuanian 
capital overnight monday according to eduardas potasinskas of 
lithuanian television 
at his own news conference tuesday gorbachev spokesman arkady 
maslennikov said the soviet union plans no economic blockade among 
the unspecified economic and political measures threatened 
monday by gorbachevs presidential council 
but maslennikov implied the soviet union might start demanding 
world market prices from lithuania for the subsidized oil gas and 
other raw materials that the small baltic state needs he said this 
would cost lithuania 6 billion 
he said some soviet enterprises have talked of refusing to 
extend existing contracts with lithuania and he warned that items 
in short supply might be sent elsewhere 
we are not saying please stop thinking about 
independence maslennikov said after several tougher statements 
but dont do it overnight dont tear wellestablished economic 
political and other links including defense 
he suggested lithuanian leaders consider a moratorium on all 
decisions since they declared independence he also suggested that 
lithuania not insist on statetostate negotiations with the 
soviet union 
lithuania has offered to discuss gorbachevs claim that its 
action violates the soviet constitution but gorbachev has demanded 
lithuania rescind its declaration of independence before discussing 
anything 
also tuesday the lithuanianappointed public prosecutor 
arturas paulauskas was barred from entering his office which he 
has shared for the past week with a competing prosecutor appointed 
by moscow soviet troops occupied the building march 30 but until 
tuesday had allowed paulauskas to enter 
paulauskas secretary henrika pocei said by telephone that 
paulauskas would work elsewhere in the city virtually the entire 
staff in the main building is continuing to report to him and 
ignoring the new prosecutor from moscow she said 
maslennikov said the soviet union is not worried that its 
actions in lithuania might upset plans for a ussoviet summit at 
the end of may 
in washington president bush was to meet wednesday with 
american baltic organizations supporting the independence drives of 
lithuania as well as latvia and estonia the white house schedule 
listed the meeting for 10 am edt 
in our view a meeting between baltic groups and the president 
will send a clear signal to moscow regardless of what we discuss 
that the us is ready to step up pressure in support of baltic 
independence said olars kalnins head of the american latvian 
association kalnins in london for a meeting of the world 
federation of free latvians was to cut short his european visit 
and fly to washington for the meeting 
the united states has expressed support for lithuanias 
independence drive but it has been reluctant to say or do anything 
that might undermine gorbachev and his reform program 
bush in toronto for a meeting with canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney issued a fresh warning to gorbachev on tuesday to 
avoid using force in lithuania 
but he coupled his words with praise for the soviet presidents 
commitment to peaceful change and the evolution of democracy in 
europe and the soviet union 
i would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence 
to encourage dialogue and discussion he said

the board of supervisors declared the 
countys measles epidemic a public health hazard tuesday clearing 
the way for it to apply for 300000 in state funds to boost local 
immunization efforts 
officials say 1500 county residents mostly children have been 
afflicted with measles so far this year six have died 
we are having the worst measles epidemic said supervisor 
kenneth hahn who asked that all county health centers be kept open 
evenings and saturdays to get more people vaccinated 
county officials said several clinics in areas where the measles 
epidemic is the worst are already staying open nights and weekends 
to provide free measles vaccinations that service is expected to 
cost the county 370000 
robert gates the countys health services chief said he would 
look into hahns request to keep all clinics open 
a measles outbreak has been plaguing much of the state since 
1987 but worsened during the first few weeks of this year 
its out of control dr loring dales head of the 
immunization unit of the state department of health services said 
earlier in the year 
other afflicted areas include san bernardino riverside orange 
san diego and alameda counties and the san joaquin valley 
nationwide 16000 cases of measles were reported last year 45 
resulted in deaths 
health officials have blamed the epidemic in part on a large 
influx of poor people from foreign countries many of whom are not 
immunized and who dont know about the free health services 
available in the united states

a federal jury tuesday convicted a mohawk 
indian of leading armed resistance to a gambling raid at two 
reservation casinos last summer but found him innocent of a more 
serious felony charge 
the us district court jury acquitted kakwirakeron 47 of 
using a deadly or dangerous weapon to turn back fbi agents and did 
not consider another felony charge of using a firearm in commission 
of a crime 
kakwirakeron also known as arthur montour was convicted of 
conspiracy and forcibly impeding the execution of federal search 
warrants during the july 20 raid at the st regis reservation 
kakwirakeron faces up to three years in prison and a 5000 
fine sentencing was set for june 12 
the verdict came during the first full day of deliberations 
after jurors listened to nearly four hours of testimony by the 
defendant and four state police investigators 
in closing arguments monday assistant us attorney john duncan 
charged that kakwirakeron should not be excused because of the 
mohawks beliefs the 28000acre reservation on the uscanadian 
border is sovereign and therefore exempt from state and federal 
law 
duncan also disputed the contention that the mohawks mistook the 
casino raid as an assault on their land he said mohawk sovereignty 
was not at issue and charged that kakwirakeron wanted to force a 
conflict 
the confrontation led to a 12day standoff 
defense attorney seth shapiro had argued the government 
presented not one credible shred of evidence to prove his 
client ordered barricades be erected outside tonys vegas 
international and the bears den casinos during the raid 
kakwirakeron has said he was just one of many spokesmen for the 
warrior society a selfappointed security force 
although other casinos were searched and 13 people arrested a 
group of armed mohawks blocked a highway and refused to let 
authorities search the two casinos 
two undercover investigators testified that casino workers were 
removing slot machines from the gambling parlors in the hours 
before the predawn raid 
kakwirakeron testified during the sixday trial that he spent 
the entire day of the raid on a portable telephone trying to 
negotiate a peaceful settlement to the standoff 
witnesses for both sides testified kakwirakeron had helped 
negotiate settlements in past conflicts with the mohawks in 1974 
1977 and 1979

debtridden detroit one of five finalists to 
host the 1992 democratic national convention withdrew from 
consideration tuesday 
the city cant afford the convention and mayor coleman young is 
too busy working on finances to devote time to it said dorothy 
brodie executive mayoral assistant for federal affairs 
the democratic national committee has asked any city bidding for 
the convention to commit to spend 15 million brodie said detroit 
faces a deficit estimated at 50 million to 81 million 
a siteselection team from the national committee has inspected 
three of the finalists cleveland houston and new york city and 
had been scheduled to visit detroit next week said committee press 
secretary ginny terzano 
we still hadnt eliminated any of the finalists detroit was 
still very much in the process she said adding that the team 
will visit new orleans at the end of this month 
youngs staff told her the city was withdrawing its bid early 
tuesday 
we regret that terzano said its unfortunate but we 
understand that he young wants to look at his own back yard 
but she said the upfront costs of being host of the convention 
paid off 
the money you initially put in is returned three to fourfold 
and you have to look at all that free publicity terzano said 
brodie agreed that the costs can pay off 
the national attention directed to a city is good in terms of 
booking subsequent conventions she said theres a monetary 
spinoff with people spending in the city 
but there are issues the mayor feels need his attention and 
unfortunately this isnt one of them brodie said young is to 
present his budget to the city council on thursday 
youngs decision was generally supported 
i think in some ways its tragic because we could use it 
city councilman david eberhard said but you have to put things 
on a priority level

us education secretary lauro cavazos said 
tuesday that parents and teachers must lead the way to improve 
education for hispanics a group that suffers a 40 percent dropout 
rate before completing high school 
at the first of five hearings across the nation on hispanic 
education cavazos said he supports schoolbased management in 
which local educators and parents have more input in education 
reform 
president bush and i believe strongly that parents and 
teachers hold the key to successful educational reform cavazos 
said parental involvement is a responsibility and also a right 
cavazos said the hearings purpose was not to produce another 
study but to seek solutions for hispanic educationother hearings 
are scheduled in boston los angeles chicago and miami 
with your help we can identify and dismantle barriers to 
hispanic education said cavazos the former president of texas 
tech university weve been talking about this for years and 
years but weve done nothing about it 
during the 1980s about 40 percent of hispanics nationwide left 
school before high school graduation in texas the dropout rate was 
45 percent he said 
only 11 percent of hispanics complete four or more years of 
college by the time they are in their early 30s he said 
liz cuevas a 16yearold student testified that economics 
contribute to the hispanic dropout problem 
the students have to support their families and i dont think 
thats right ms cuevas said they say im getting money 
now i dont know if im going to be alive tomorrow 
more flexible school hours would help students who must work 
she said ms cuevas also suggested improving communication between 
young people and their parents and teachers 
what makes me different is that i care a lot of students 
dont care she said i want to make something out of myself i 
want to be a lawyer i want to help people 
gloria rodriguez director of the avance family support project 
in san antonio testified that one reason students drop out is that 
their parents dont expect them to finish high school 
parenting is not something that comes naturally it is a skill 
that you learn said ms rodriguez whose program helps parents 
learn about child care while furthering their education and job 
training 
louis j agnese jr president of incarnate word college in san 
antonio said lack of money lack of preparation and perceptions of 
failure cause hispanics to leave school 
agnese proposed a national marketing campaign showing 
achievement through hispanic role models he also said politicians 
must find equitable funding for all school districts

a runaway power plant on the space 
shuttle discovery forced nasa to scrub its launch tuesday with the 
hubble space telescope and officials said it will be a week or two 
before they try again 
the countdown was down to the fourminutestogo mark when 
sensors detected that one of three auxiliary power units was 
running too fast computers halted the launch process 
a valve which failed to respond let too much fuel go into the 
unit which caused an overspeed condition said bob sieck the 
kennedy space centers launch director 
the apus pressurize the shuttles hydraulic system which is 
used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ships braking and 
steering systems 
astronomers who had gathered for the big event were 
philosophical about the latest delay in getting the 15 billion 
telescope into orbit 
the universe has been around for a long time it will stay 
around for a couple more days said john holtzman of the lowell 
observatory at flagstaff ariz 
the countdown had gone without a hitch until shuttle commander 
loren shriver flipped a switch to start the three apus and one ran 
erratically 
nasa rules forbid a liftoff unless all three units operate 
perfectly 
we call it quits here sieck told the astronauts and his 
flight controllers 
the huge external fuel tank was drained of its halfmillion 
gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen each scrub costs 
377000 in lost fuel and each days delay means 247000 in labor 
and materials not including the other nasa centers supporting the 
mission 
the power unit will have to be removed from discovery while the 
shuttle is in upright launch position in addition technicians 
will either have to remove the telescopes batteries and recharge 
them elsewhere or run equipment out to the pad to charge them 
aboard the ship 
the batteries will hold their charge through friday but after 
that would have to undergo an eightday recharge on the ground in 
orbit the hubbles solar panels supply electricity to the 
batteries 
sieck said the auxiliary power unit weighs 100 pounds and will 
be difficult to remove he said nasa officials will have a better 
idea in the next few days when they can reschedule the launch 
replacing the entire apu would mean a delay of at least several 
days said keith l hudkins chief of nasas shuttle orbiter 
division replacing a part however could be done in a day or so 
shriver and his crew of four had lain on their backs in the 
shuttle cabin for three hours when the launch attempt was called 
off 
nasa said the crew would return to their training base the 
johnson space center in houston on wednesday 
most astronomers who had come to see the launch took the delay 
well 
giovanni fazio of the smithsonian astrophysics observatory said 
we waited this long and its better not to rush this thing 
whatever they do thats a 15 billion payload and theres no use 
taking any chances with it 
others were disappointed 
weve been waiting seven years for this thing to go up so 
its very depressing in a sense said francesco paresce of the 
european space agency a scientist who will work with observations 
from the telescopes faint object camera 
i was hoping that today would be the beginning of a new 
life he said in four minutes my life was going to be 
completely different with the thing up there with operations with 
the instrument pouring data out by the billions of bits 
about 150 relatives of edwin p hubble the astronomer for whom 
the telescope is named headed for a pool party after the scrub 
these things have happened its part of the game said 
harvey hubbell iv a 60yearold retired businessman who organized 
the family gathering we would much rather you stop the count 
than do something foolish 
two other shuttle launches have been delayed because of 
auxiliary power unit problems one in 1981 caused an eightday 
delay another in 1984 a fiveday wait

the soviet military is leaving behind 
polluted land streams and underground water supplies as it 
abandons longoccupied bases in czechoslovakia an alaska 
environmental services company said tuesday 
its just a mess said former alaska gov bill sheffield a 
director of martech usa an anchoragebased company that has 
negotiated a tentative agreement with the czech government to help 
it clean up bases and other sites 
the soviets just kind of covered up their tracks in some 
places they just left it all exposed and running into the river 
sheffield said 
underground fuel tanks have been ripped up and the craters 
covered over with dirt and gravel he said 
martech also said pipelines or storage tanks are leaching 
unidentified substances onto the ground or into streams 
sheffield and other company officials last week toured several 
areas including the frenstat military base with prime minister 
peter pithart and other czech officials 
the officials were shown one offlimits site at frenstat where 
they were told a soviet germ warfare stockpile was still being 
stored sheffield said 
martech and the czech government signed a letter of intent 
friday to form a joint venture to clean up the sites martech 
president bill tisdale said in a telephone interview from new york 
company officials visited highly polluted sites at frenstat 
where soviet forces apparently had been dumping materials onto the 
ground for decades tisdale said observers found fuel and other 
unidentified pollutants in rivers and drinking water supplies he 
said 
frenstat was the first base to be evacuated by soviet soldiers 
tisdale said soldiers began leaving the base in northern 
czechoslovakia on feb 26 
martech plans on april 25 to begin analyzing substances to be 
cleaned up 
tisdale would not say how much money the work involved 
two other bases at bruntal and krnov already have been turned 
over to the czechs and both will require extensive cleanup 
work the company said 
martech said it will act as managing partner in a joint venture 
with geo test a staterun hydrology and engineering company 
martech will open an office in prague and will provide 
professional expertise and equipment geo test will provide some 
skilled and all unskilled workers tisdale said 
no details have been worked out on how the alaskan company will 
be paid for its work sheffield said

the soviet union could accept a unified germany 
that belonged to both nato and the warsaw pact during a transition 
to a new european security system a top soviet adviser has told 
the new york times 
soviet and american troops stationed in germany should be 
reduced gradually during such a transition period which would last 
for five to seven years said valentin m falin chief of the 
international department of the soviet communist party central 
committee 
the times said in wednesday editions that it was not clear 
exactly how the transitional period or the new security system 
would work 
we need to arrive at an alleuropean security system in a few 
years through some transitional steps falin told the newspaper 
in an interview monday night in moscow 
the idea that for a certain time a unified germany could 
remain with its western part in nato and its eastern part in the 
warsaw pact as a modus vivendi for a few years would probably be 
acceptable to our side falin said 
he added that the most important thing would be that germany 
then becomes a motor to help to extract the best out of these two 
organizations and then meld them into an alleuropean security 
structure 
falin repeated the soviet unions position that it could not 
accept a united germany belonging only to the north atlantic treaty 
organization the soviet union dropped its previous insistence on a 
neutral germany during last weeks visit by foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze to washington 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the times 
report while traveling with president bush in toronto said he knew 
nothing about it 
shevardnadze suggested during his washington visit that a merged 
germany could be part of both nato and the warsaw pact but gave no 
specifics secretary of state james a baker iii said then that the 
idea was not attractive and that the united states remained 
firm in its position that a unified germany must remain in nato 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday that the 
reunification of germany should be synchronized with the formation 
of a new security structure for all of europe the tass news agency 
reported from moscow gorbachev told visiting british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd that a transitional stage is possible in the 
meantime tass reported

for ann richards who captured the 
democratic gubernatorial nomination tuesday a sense of humor is a 
necessary ingredient in the political mix just ask her about the 
dog 
ms richards who won celebrity status with a witty keynote 
speech to the democratic national convention in 1988 first won 
public office in 1976 when she was elected a travis county 
commissioner 
it was a truckdriving frontendloader kind of job she 
recalls so when she first met her county road crew she tried to 
break the ice by asking the men about the one thing she felt 
certain they would discuss with a woman their dog 
no one said a word there was some shuffling of feet she 
recalled in her 1989 autobiography straight from the heart 
trying to make them comfortable the new boss told the men she 
was accustomed to rough language and asked the dogs name 
an old hand in the back row with a big wide belt and a big 
wide belt buckle sat up and said in a gravel bass well youre 
gonna find out sooner or later her name is ann richards i 
laughed and when i laughed they roared she said from then 
on those guys and i were good friends 
her humor was one of the main reasons thendemocratic party boss 
paul kirk tapped ms richards to keynote the atlanta convention 
where she immediately charmed the crowd by saying after 
listening to george bush all these years i figured you needed to 
know what a real texas accent sounds like 
she sealed her sharptongued reputation with this line about 
bush poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver 
foot in his mouth 
that speech capped an involvement in politics that began in the 
late 1950s 
ms richards now 56 grew up near waco married civil rights 
lawyer david richards volunteered in campaigns and raised four 
children 
i was by no means a fulltime political activist i was 
involved in whatever political opportunities i could find with the 
constraints of raising a family she said 
in the 1960s she helped form the north dallas democratic women 
basically to allow us to have something substantive to do the 
regular democratic party and its organization was run by men who 
looked on women as little more than machine parts 
ms richards served on the travis county commission in austin 
for six years before jumping to a bigger arena in 1982 winning the 
texas treasurers office to become the first woman elected 
statewide in 50 years 
but politics took a toll it helped break up her marriage and 
public life has forced her to be remarkably candid about her 1980 
treatment for alcoholism 
i had seen the very bottom of life she recalled i was so 
afraid that i wouldnt be funny anymore i just knew that i would 
lose my zaniness and my sense of humor but i didnt recovery 
turned out to be a wonderful thing 
although the primary and runoff campaigns turned into a muddy 
brawl that included allegations of drug use against her ms 
richards entered the race hinting that she knew what lay ahead 
you know sam rayburn used to say that any jackass can kick 
down a barn but it takes a carpenter to build one she said last 
summer im against negative campaigning but im not a shy 
violet wholl take it across the head and not respond

engineers will let billions of hungry 
microbes loose on tarlike waste left by an old gas works in hopes 
of cleaning up the mess in three years not the 1000 nature would 
need if left to itself 
the stuff is on a site called blekholmstorget in the shadow of 
the goldtipped brick tower of stockholm city hall where an 
apartment and office complex is planned 
biotreatment of cardiff wales developed the use of microbes to 
break down ground pollution and the technique has been employed in 
britain and west germany this is the first use in a major cleanup 
that does not involve hauling away the contaminated soil 
chief engineer hans kronberg said the goal is to purge 
potentially cancercausing grit from about 12 acres on the bank of 
lake klara a channel in stockholms interlocking chain of lakes 
dozens of pleasure boats now dock there 
a gas and coke factory was built on the site in 1852 and 
operated for about 70 years most recently the site was a parking 
lot for the nearby central railway station 
kronberg said it took scientists nine months to identify 
specific microbes that attack the pollutants involved bacteria 
were taken from the site and fed oxygen and nutrients to help them 
multiply 
when the project begins in may the plan is to filter 
microbeenriched water through the soil which is soaked with 
creosote breaking down the tarlike waste 
grids of pipes spaced a few yards apart cover the site enriched 
water will seep from one set of pipes and be collected by another 
10 feet below the water will be pumped to a container for 
analysis treated with nutrients and recycled into the pipes 
as of this moment we cant say if it will work or not city 
inspector viveka ehdfalander said we have never done this in 
sweden before 
stockholm officials and federal environmental authorities see 
the biological cleanup as a pilot project for opening hundreds of 
polluted acres in the city to development 
kronberg who works for the skanska construction company said 
the creosote at blekholmstorget was not a problem while it was 
buried under the parking lot asphalt but would become a threat 
under a major housing development 
engineers fear the creosote would release harmful gases and 
construction work would allow some of it to seep into the lake 
water 
authorities are withholding some building permits until the area 
is safe kronberg said the cleanup project adds about 6 milllion 
to construction costs 
if we didnt clean it up the pollution would still be there 
in 100 or 200 years when they rebuild this area again the chief 
engineer said 
hot spots or small areas of highly concentrated creosote 
may contain up to 30000 micrograms per kilogram 22 pounds of 
pollutants the number must be reduced to 200 micrograms for the 
area to be declared safe 
land reclamation normally involves excavating polluted earth and 
taking it to a safe dump but that often endangers workers and 
merely relocates the problem 
about 26000 cubic yards of contaminated soil would have to be 
removed from blekholmstorget enough to bury a football field 
nearly 10 feet deep 
there are a lot of places in stockholm where wed like to 
build ms ehdfalander said this is not the only place with 
dirty soil its hard to dig everything up we dont have places to 
put it

manuel pereira stared at the floor and 
explained how his dream of owning a home was destroyed or at least 
postponed by new government rules that wont let him spend his own 
money 
for 27 years pereira tucked something away in a savings account 
each week so he could buy a home before retiring from his job as a 
doorman 
last month at 63 he had enough for the down payment on a

something else happened last month fernando collor de mello 
became president of brazil on march 15 and took drastic action to 
stop annual inflation of 4850 percent 
banks closed for five days new taxes were imposed utility 
rates increased by 30 percent to 80 percent up to 80 percent of 
the value of a savings or money market account was frozen for 18 
months 
all of a sudden everything i worked for was gone pereira 
said how can i believe in anything anymore 
brazilians are unable to get at their money and fear it will be 
worth less when and if it is returned private companies lay off 
workers in droves 
confidence is waning and optimism is turning to despair in a 
vast nation of 150 million people that is potentially among the 
worlds richest but polls show most brazilians still are willing 
to give collors ideas a chance 
miriam santos de lima partowner of a restaurant has lost her 
trust the government lied to us she said collor promised 
he wouldnt touch our savings and he swept them into the government 
safe this is a disasterous start for a government pretending to be 
honest and clean 
confidence in banks is at an alltime low people are turning to 
the black market stashing us dollars in cabinets and under their 
mattresses 
even under collors strict rules anyone with a savings account 
can withdraw the equivalent of 1200 for money market accounts 
and certificates of deposit the limit is 600 or 20 percent 
whichever is greater 
nearly everyone seems to be using the opportunity

next tuesday nbcs consumer and business news 
channel will celebrate its first birthday still in the red and 
expecting that for three more years but halfway officials say 
to its goals of profitability and 30 million subscribers 
but its growth along with that of other new cable networks is 
threatened by the reregulation of cable proposed in various bills 
now pending in congress says thomas s rogers the overall boss of 
cnbc 
there is no single thing that could happen that would more 
stunt the growth of cnbc than rate reregulation says rogers 
president of nbc cable and business development referring to 
regulation of the fees that cable operators charge consumers for 
cable service 
we might be stymied at some point unable to reach our 30 
million subscriber goal because of that he says 
the reason rogers says is that if cable operators arent 
allowed to continue setting their own rates they might hold off on 
adding new services or expanding their number of channels 
virtually all cities with cable tv have had essentially 
deregulated systems since 1985 because of a 1984 federal law that 
freed local cable systems of rate regulation in communities served 
by three or more broadcast stations 
but now with cables strongest critics charging that it has 
become an unregulated monopoly the reregulation proposals are in 
congress and the federal communications commission is studying the 
matter too 
the fcc study was required by the 1984 cable law which in an 
odd twist rogers helped draft when he was a senior attorney on a 
house telecommunications subcommittee he joined nbc in 1987 
cnbc one of his first major projects reportedly cost 65 
million to start although neither he nor nbc will comment on that 
when the 24hour channel began offering wall street and 
business news by day and talk shows of various sorts by night many 
reports described it as a rival to cables established financial 
news network which began in 1981 
but neither rogers nor fnn president michael wheeler consider 
their operations headtohead competitors 
what has probably been the most frustrating part of the first 
year has been the incessant comparison to fnn as if what we were 
about was launching a new financial service rogers says 
not so he adds its first and foremost a consumer news 
service 
wheeler whose service says it has 33 million subscribers 
considers cnbc primarily a rival of ted turners cable news 
network specifically in the area of talk shows and consumer 
programs 
in prime time when viewing levels are highest we focus on 
two subjects buusiness and money says wheeler 
describing cnbc and fnn as bitter rivals may make a livelier 
story but thats irrelevant to us rogers says we just want 
to get on the dial 
that has proved a headache in the concrete island of manhattan 
even though cnbc is based in nearby fort lee nj fnn is seen in 
manhattan but cnbc has yet to make its cable debut in that most 
influential of markets 
its influential rogers notes because it encompasses wall 
street and is the hub of the financial community the hub of the 
media community the hub of the advertising community and the 
opinionmaking community 
and if youre not visible there people have no basis for 
assessing you except by what they read and no basis for 
evaluating what we are and sure thats a frustration and an issue 
for us 
richard kostyra an executive vice president at the j walter 
thompson advertising agency agrees it hurts cnbc not to be seen in 
manhattan 
out of sight out of mind he says noting that as much as 
advertising agencies work with research and numbers it helps to be 
regularly seen to give ad executives a gut feel how the 
channel works 
manhattans two cable systems are controlled by time warner 
inc one of the nations cable giants the company also owns 
cables home box office whose the comedy channel debuted on cable 
last november 
rogers said time warner whose comedy channel isnt seen yet 
either in manhattan has been less than interested in 
supporting our service the excuse we were given originally was 
that they dont have channel capacity 
now he says their systems are being upgraded and channel 
capacity being increased by the end of this year so were 
hopeful that well get added

the poor performance of smallercompany stocks 
has been receiving a lot of attention these days and some of their 
supporters are ready to throw in the towel 
examining the record they might have good reason to do so 
because these socalled smaller stocks some in companies with 
sales under 50 million a year have trailed the gains made by the 
big brandname companies since 1983 
that performance casts much doubt on a thesis held dear by some 
stock market analysts that smaller stocks tend to produce stronger 
gains than the very largest stocks 
the belief received strong academic support in 1978 when rolf 
banz a university of chicago researcher traced the relative 
performances for 50 years and found that the idea wasnt just in 
the imagination but in the numbers too 
a variety of explanations were offered in subsequent years to 
justify the findings including the obvious one that smaller 
companies tend to grow faster than larger ones 
banz however found that even after accounting for the greater 
risk there was a smallstock premium 
the theorists then pointed out that the largest stocks were so 
closely examined by so many analysts that just about everything was 
known about them therefore the market was efficient in respect to 
such stocks 
smaller stocks are not closely followed and so tend to be less 
efficiently priced with smaller stocks there always are surprises 
a stunning bargain might be found simply because the word hasnt 
gotten around 
that sounded plausible also containing the ring of truth was 
the assertion that large institutional buyers the big pension and 
mutual funds and their kin who support the blue chips are too 
large to buy into smaller companies 
too large yes because it is inefficient for them to buy the 
small amounts of stock that smaller companies have available 
to illustrate they can buy a few million dollars in shares of 
general motors without greatly affecting the price but a smaller 
company probably wouldnt even have that many shares available 
moreover such purchases would distort the price the smaller 
company simply couldnt accommodate them 
many other possibilities also were offered but now there is a 
tendency to dismiss the entire thesis 
smaller stocks it is said have been so well discovered that 
their market is now efficient moreover while huge institutions 
still cannot invest in them mutual funds have been created just 
for that purpose 
but hold on says former professor gerald perritt now 
proprietor of investment information services a chicago research 
and investment advisory firm that is widely recognized as an 
authority on smallbusiness stocks 
perritt stakes his reputation on the idea that the smallstock 
premium still exists he contends that the poor performance since 
1983 is understandable in view of the earlier runup in prices for 
the smallstock sector 
from 1975 when the smallstock affect was attracting attention 
to about mid1983 when the premium was most noticeable the per 
share prices of smaller companies rose several times more than per 
share prices of blue chips 
by then the smaller company stocks were overpriced says 
perritt they had attracted so much attention that investors had 
bid them beyond their true value a lot of the earlier investors 
wanted to take their profits 
at the same time a different pattern developed among individual 
investors more and more during the 1980s they chose to invest 
through conventional mutual funds traditionally these funds 
invest in blue chips 
enormous sums flowed into these mutual funds and pension funds 
too and they and other institutional investors put the money into 
blue chips pushing up prices and making the small companies appear 
even more laggard 
meanwhile perritt found that the smallstock premium never was 
consistent the excess returns provided by these stocks tend to 
run in streaks the last of which began in 1975 and ended in 
1983 he says 
since then so many smaller stocks have been ignored that he 
believes they might be underpriced time for another streak he 
says adding 
given the stones being cast at smallfirm stocks this sector 
of the market is a contrarian investors dream

engineers will let billions of hungry 
microbes loose on tarlike waste left by an old gas works in hopes 
of cleaning up the mess in three years not the centuries nature 
would need if left to itself 
the stuff is on a site called blekholmstorget in the shadow of 
the goldtipped brick tower of stockholm city hall where an 
apartment and office complex is planned 
biotreatment of cardiff wales developed the use of microbes to 
break down ground pollution and the technique has been employed in 
britain and west germany this is the first use in a major cleanup 
that does not involve hauling away the contaminated soil 
chief engineer hans kronberg said the goal is to purge 
potentially cancercausing grit from about 12 acres on the bank of 
lake klara a channel in stockholms interlocking chain of lakes 
dozens of pleasure boats now dock there 
a gas and coke factory was built on the site in 1852 and 
operated for about 70 years most recently the site was a parking 
lot for the nearby central railway station 
kronberg said it took scientists nine months to identify 
specific microbes that attack the pollutants involved bacteria 
were taken from the site and fed oxygen and nutrients to help them 
multiply 
when the project begins in may the plan is to filter 
microbeenriched water through the soil which is soaked with 
creosote breaking down the tarlike waste 
grids of pipes spaced a few yards apart cover the site enriched 
water will seep from one set of pipes and be collected by another 
10 feet below the water will be pumped to a container for 
analysis treated with nutrients and recycled into the pipes 
as of this moment we cant say if it will work or not city 
inspector viveka ehdfalander said we have never done this in 
sweden before 
stockholm officials and federal environmental authorities see 
the biological cleanup as a pilot project for opening hundreds of 
polluted acres in the city to development 
kronberg who works for the skanska construction company said 
the creosote at blekholmstorget was not a problem while it was 
buried under the parking lot asphalt but would become a threat 
under a major housing development 
engineers fear the creosote would release harmful gases and 
construction work would allow some of it to seep into the lake 
water 
authorities are withholding some building permits until the area 
is safe kronberg said the cleanup project adds about 6 milllion 
to construction costs 
if we didnt clean it up the pollution would still be there 
in 100 or 200 years when they rebuild this area again the chief 
engineer said 
hot spots or small areas of highly concentrated creosote 
may contain up to 30000 micrograms per kilogram 22 pounds of 
pollutants the number must be reduced to 200 micrograms for the 
area to be declared safe 
land reclamation normally involves excavating polluted earth and 
taking it to a safe dump but that often endangers workers and 
merely relocates the problem 
about 26000 cubic yards of contaminated soil would have to be 
removed from blekholmstorget enough to bury a football field 
nearly 10 feet deep 
there are a lot of places in stockholm where wed like to 
build ms ehdfalander said this is not the only place with 
dirty soil its hard to dig everything up we dont have places to 
put it

it is a modern urban phenomenon kids robbing 
and sometimes killing other kids over the hottest designer 
sneakers sunglasses or athletic jackets 
in chicago alone four young men have died in little more a year 
over multicolored satiny jackets with splashy team logos across 
the back 
those not dying for their clothing might instead be robbed 
on an icy day this winter an 11yearold boy was forced to hand 
over his 61 gym shoes to four youths then walk the several blocks 
to his home barefoot one of scores of incidents that occur each 
month police say 
kids who try to keep their jackets are beaten or killed 
said sollie vincent commander of the gang crimes section of the 
chicago police its a very cold callous frame of mind 
to combat the problem schools from baltimore to miami to los 
angeles are falling back on an old idea dress codes 
some public schools even have instituted uniforms traditionally 
associated with parochial schools 
its a definite trend said tim callahan a spokesman for 
the national association of state boards of education kids are 
going to learn best in an environment free of undue inappropriate 
pressures and certainly one thats free of violence 
if clothing becomes a disruption to education then we 
certainly are supportive of removing that barrier he said 
starter jackets athletic jackets named for their 
manufacturer starter sportswear inc of new haven conn have 
sparked numerous crimes in chicago including four murders police 
say 
in a grim acknowledgement of the garments popularity the 
police department last year created a separate category for 
starter jacket murders in its citywide statistics 
we are hoping these are isolated situations that are not 
longterm said thomas mcauliffe human resources director for 
starter we have a responsible attitude towards the communities 
in which we have operations 
educators say dress codes that eliminate some popular items and 
in some cases gang colors not only help stem violence but allow 
students to concentrate on learning 
we try to discourage children from buying hot items says 
jim murray assistant principal at a middle school in chicagos 
troubled englewood neighborhood when they dont wear those items 
to school they dont have problems 
we have found that subtly it is changing attitudes 
alberta mitchell counselor at hendricks academy said of the 
chicago public elementary schools new uniform policy 
the children are not supposed to wear gym shoes so that 
eliminates the problem of buying brandname gym shoes symbolizing 
status miss mitchell said we are trying to eliminate the 
problem of children feeling like they have to have designertype 
clothes it seems to have a calming effect 
in chicago as in many of the nations largest school districts 
dress codes are the prerogative of individual schools 
in baltimore uniforms are recommended although not mandatory 
for elementary school students and a dress code is suggested for 
secondary schools educators say uniforms now are the norm at 74 of 
the citys 118 elementary schools 
school officials cant recall any crimes over clothing since the 
policy was instituted last fall and baltimore police say the 
problem virtually has disappeared 
it still happens but not with any frequency said police 
spokesman dennis hill 
next fall high schools in detroit will have the option of 
adopting a dress code the new policy by detroits board of 
education was prompted in part by the december shooting of a 
student over his 135 goosedown jacket 
detroit police say crimes over clothing are on the decline 
its not like the old days 10 years ago said sgt 
christopher buck 
in new yorks bedfordstuyvesant neighborhood a high school 
principal earlier this year barred students from wearing removable 
gold caps on their teeth saying the faddish caps were robberies 
waiting to happen 
but the new policies have not been cheered in all quarters 
in march high school students in palmdale calif enraged by a 
new antigang dress code boycotted classes and pelted a sheriffs 
patrol car with rocks 
and there is some support for student resistance to the 
dresscode trend 
laws allowing schools to require uniforms are a way of trying 
to see that all students look alike act alike and think alike 
said jane whicher an attorney for the american civil liberties 
union in illinois 
its important for children to have an appreciation of their 
own individuality as well as the constitutional values that protect 
that individuality she said orthodoxy in apparel is not 
something a school board should be involved in 
requiring uniforms might also pose a financial hurdle for the 
poor whicher said but some families are applauding the trend 
parents seem to really like the idea said shel erlich a 
spokesman for the los angeles unified school district the nations 
secondlargest public school system it certainly cuts down the 
amount of arguing in the morning over what the kids should wear to 
school 
and some parents are instituting their own dress codes when the 
schools are not 
i have two daughters one a senior in high school said 
charles hill who heads security for 40 chicago schools we dont 
entertain the thought of a starter jacket 
we want our kids to have everything he said but we dont 
want our kids to have something that endangers their lives 
law enforcement officials welcome the move toward dress codes 
any way that a kid can avoid the problem seems rational to 
me said vincent of the gang crime unit parents would be a 
little kinder to their kids if they deprived them of the things 
they beg for

here is a list of some school systems that are 
considering or have recently instituted policies restricting dress 
or requiring school uniforms 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
baltimore city public schools recommend that elementary students 
wear uniforms officials say 74 of 118 elementary schools and a 
handful of middle schools have taken the recommendation 
at high schools an exclusionary dress code is in effect 
barring furs and leathers clothing with vulgar and obscene 
printed material and gold chains and other preciousmetal jewelry 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
chicagos dress code is broad openended and deliberately 
so with students required to wear appropriate attire said 
spokesman bob saigh 
some elementary schools under the guidance of local school 
councils have introduced school uniforms and some high schools 
have banned certain items of apparel at one south side high 
school students recently were barred from wearing tshirts and 
sweaters printed with gang emblems 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no dallas independent school district schools require uniforms 
but board members in march discussed introducing a pilot uniform 
program at one of the districts 180 schools 
the board also is considering broadening the dress code in 
effect since the early 1970s basically students are on their own 
as long as their clothing isnt hazardous or disruptive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three elementary schools ask students to dress uniformly in 
white shirts and solidcolor skirts or pants all schools are 
working on new guidelines for student attire which are to be sent 
to the board later this month 
some schools already have updated their dress codes including 
mumford high which says it is working to avoid a materialistic 
society which ascribes higher status to monetary symbols than to 
intellectual prowess 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in los angeles where dress codes are handled on a 
schoolbyschool basis some have barred students from wearing 
colors associated with certain gangs said spokesman shel erlich 
a small number of elementary schools have instituted voluntary 
schooluniform policies because parents felt they wanted their 
kids not to be put down as not as affluent as other kids 
erlich said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fortytwo of about 170 elementary schools in the dade county 
public school system which includes miami have gone to uniforms 
in the past two years the idea being to encourage kids not to be 
so caught up in fashion said spokesman andy gollan 
high school students are subject to a minimal dress code that 
requires they look neat with no tshirts or sandals he said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there is no dress code period said frank sobrino a 
spokesman for new yorks school system but schools that wish to 
introduce uniforms may do so if parents are consulted and agree to 
the plan students at a handful of elementary and junior high 
schools now wear uniforms 
some high schools have taken other measures such as banning 
gold jewelry or the removable gold caps some students wore on their 
teeth

dont put your nest egg into rattan 
baskets and try to ship them out of the country you might be 
arrested for smuggling 
not only that when the problem first appeared attorney general 
sukarton marmosudjono said i may have to use the subversion law 
and threaten smugglers with the death penalty 
three shipping containers filled with loosely woven baskets were 
impounded recently their owners not identified were accused of 
trying to sneak raw rattan out of indonesia in the form of finished 
goods which can be exported legally 
officials said the baskets were to be dismantled in another 
country and the rattan crafted into more valuable products 
a government prosecutor demanded life in prison and a fine of 30 
million rupiahs 16593 for hw ng who was charged with 
illegally exporting almost 2000 tons of raw rattan to hong kong 
and taiwan 
ng fled indonesia before the court delivered the sentence 
demanded by the prosecution 
indonesian jungles produce more than 80 percent of the worlds 
rattan vines of the long flexible wood which grows wild once 
were exported in huge quantities to be made into wicker furniture 
baskets and other items 
wicker is a catchall term for items woven of rattan reed cane 
dried grasses and other flexible materials even twisted paper 
rattan willow and bamboo are the most popular natural fibers 
according to industry sources in jakarta 
after timber rattan is the most important forest product in 
southeast asia despite its nearmonopoly indonesia made 
relatively little money from rattan because it exported only the 
lowvalue raw material not such finished products as furniture 
foreign manufacturers most of them in taiwan hong kong and 
china made the real profits 
to change that the government imposed a ban in late 1986 on the 
export of raw rattan a later decree specified that semiprocessed 
vines and cane webbing could leave the country only in the form of 
furniture or other finished products 
the philippines banned raw rattan exports in 1977 thailand in 
march 1977 and peninsular malaysia last year 
indonesias purpose was to develop manufacturing industries that 
would make rattan furniture and create jobs 
similar methods were used to force the growth of a domestic 
plywood industry after a ban was imposed on the export of uncut 
hardwood logs in 1985 indonesia became the worlds leading source 
of plywood 
we are the worlds biggest exporter of plywood and in the 
near future it is hoped that this will be followed by the export of 
finished goods made of rattan which is a natural resource 
possessed by few other countries president suharto said 
criticism of the ban came from the european community united 
states and others they pointed out that indonesia was a member of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade which discourages 
nontariff barriers 
some critics said the ban was imposed before indonesia had 
established itself as a producer of quality finished products 
sophisticated marketing methods were neglected by a government that 
had viewed rattan goods as handicraft a cottage industry 
stockpiling of raw rattan before the ban and smuggling since 
gave foreign manufacturers a few years of breathing space new 
sources of supply are being developed in vietnam and papua new 
guinea but those who want to continue using indonesian rattan 
legally must invest in plants within the country 
officials say indonesia has 280 rattan processing companies 
compared with 33 in late 1986 more than 250 million has been 
invested in new factories and more than 80000 jobs provided they 
say 
indonesia exported about 70000 tons of raw rattan annually 
before the ban it brought in 63 million in 1985 and exports of 
semifinished rattan brought total earnings to 86 million 
last year rattan exports earned more than 330 million

trusting the earths problems to politicians industry and 
scientists is not enough 
environmentalists say everyone has the power to help protect 
resources and clean up the air water and land by shopping wisely 
and disposing of garbage carefully doing dozens of little things 
they say can make a big difference 
individuals can also keep pressuring government and industry to 
reduce pollution global warming ozone depletion the 
disappearance of resources and the rapid extinction of wildlife 
species 
you have the ability to affect your environment individually 
and you have the ability to do even more working collectively 
said tina hobson executive director of renew america a 
washington dc foundation that monitors and encourages 
environmental programs around the country 
stanford university biologist paul ehrlich an expert on 
ecology says the most important thing individuals can do is to 
become informed and become involved 
theres a lot you can do as an individual in things like 
recycling but none of that is going to work unless you get 
involved in political action that gets at the core problems gets 
at the basic diseases rather than the symptoms he said 
the basic problem is the scale of human activities relative to 
what can be supported by the natural systems of the planet 
ehrlich the author of 1968s the population bomb and most 
recently the population explosion warned that too many 
people too much consumption and too much damage by the technology 
that supplies the items consumed are creating a world out of whack 
and headed for disaster 
but disaster is not inevitable people have plenty of ways to 
make life safer and healthier some even save money 
the main guidelines are to reduce consumption be energy 
efficient at home work and while traveling dont waste water 
fuel or other resources avoid products or actions harmful to the 
environment and recycle anything that can be used again 
disposable is out reusable is in 
save paper start with this newspaper recycling it can help 
save a tree 
depending on what newspapers you read you could be using up 
one tree every 10 or 12 weeks according to marjorie lambs book 
two minutes a day for a greener planet 
she notes that canada which supplies almost all the worlds 
newsprint each year cuts down 247000 more acres of trees than it 
replants the united states loses an acre of forest every 5 
seconds nearly half what americans throw away is paper 
lamb suggests other ways to save trees such as reusing 
envelopes by sticking labels over old addresses reusing gift 
boxes using rags instead of paper towels and using permanent 
coffee filters instead of throwaway filters 
people can also ask for recycled paper at stationers and 
printers use cloth napkins instead of paper and cloth diapers 
instead of disposables 
its better however to use paper shopping bags than plastic 
better yet to avoid any bag when buying just a few items kids can 
do their part by wrapping school lunches in paper rather than 
plastic or aluminum foil and using lunch boxes instead of a new 
bag each day 
save water 
the united nations personal action guide for the earth urges 
people to install faucet aerators and waterefficient shower heads 
which use half to onefifth as much water each 10minute shower 
with such a device can use up to 50 gallons less water 
the un guide also suggests people turn off the water while 
shaving brushing teeth or scrubbing clothes fix leaky pipes 
valves or faucets promptly use lowflush toilets run washing 
machines and dishwashers only when full and cut down on 
carwashing and lawnwatering 
save the air 
many scientists believe the earths protective ozone layer is 
being depleted by chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerators air 
conditioners certain aerosols plastic foam insulation solvents 
and halon fire extinguishers ozone depletion increases the 
likelihood of skin cancer global climate change decreased crop 
yields and disruption of the marine food chain according to the 
un environmental program 
consumers should avoid aerosols and other products containing 
cfcs ask local governments to collect and recycle cfcs from old 
refrigerators and air conditioners and ask auto service stations 
to use equipment that captures cfcs during air conditioner repairs 
the un guide also suggests avoiding clothes that require dry 
cleaning which uses toxic chlorinated solvents 
save fuel 
earth day organizers advise people to walk or use public 
transportation carpools or bicycles and invest in ample 
insulation weatherstripping and caulking 
turning down thermostats a few degrees in winter and wearing 
warmer clothes also can save energy and money in summer set the 
air conditioner a few degrees higher than usual do not heat or 
cool unused rooms and use insulating shades and curtains on cold 
winter nights and hot summer days 
save food 
animals raised for food in the united states eat enough grain to 
feed more than five times the us population consider how such 
food production affects the environment and eat lower on the food 
chain vegetables fruits and grains advises the utne reader 
magazine of minneapolis 
if americans ate 10 percent less meat the 12 million tons of 
grain saved annually could feed all the people in the world who now 
starve to death each year according to the united nations 
learn vegetarian recipes and encourage restaurants to serve 
vegetarian foods organize potluck dinners and be creative with 
leftovers buy organic food but dont buy foods out of season 
grow a garden rather than a lawn and plant fruit and nut trees 
recycle 
people without local recycling programs should encourage 
neighbors and officials to start one says renew americas hobson 
the group provides information on the best programs in the country 
which can be used as models 
recycling is not limited to paper cans and glass and plastic 
bottles you can also recycle used oil tires scrap metal scrap 
wood car batteries mattresses corrugated cardboard aluminum and 
organic waste 
the united states produces more than 11 billion tons of 
nonhazardous solid waste each year according to the environmental 
protection agency if trucks carried away one ton each that annual 
accumulation of solid waste would fill 14000 lanes of trucks 
bumper to bumper from new york to los angeles 
industry generates the greatest current in the waste stream an 
estimated 76 billion tons much of that is disposed onsite with 
little scrutiny or regulation workers and nearby residents can 
urge companies to recycle 
more than 100 million pounds of plastic are discarded into 
oceans every year according to the world society for the 
protection of animals plastic sixpack rings strangle or fatally 
maim many birds and animals that become entangled in them 
as consumers and citizens we certainly make a lot of choices 
about the things we use the stores we shop in and the people we 
vote for said denise fort executive director of citizens for a 
better environment in san francisco 
we can make a huge difference there are some things we have 
to look to government to do we need to demand that government 
representatives act responsibly and clean up the environment but a 
lot can be done with individual action

cities states and companies often complain they dont have the 
money to solve environmental problems but theyve learned through 
painful experience that the alternative ignoring them is even 
more expensive 
after several environmental disasters over the last year and 
with the nations attention turned toward earth day on april 22 
scientists politicians and business leaders are looking at things 
local governments can do now to save money in the future 
we cant afford not to spend the money to clean up the 
environment said dianne feinstein former san francisco mayor 
and now a gubernatorial contender if we dont invest in waste 
water treatment solid waste treatment sewage systems recycling 
plants mass transit itll cost us billions or trillions in the 
future to clean up everything 
that message was driven home in places around the country faced 
with the cleanup of hazardous wastes in dumpsites and of pesticides 
and other toxic chemicals in groundwater 
disasters such as the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska and 
februarys spill off huntington beach in southern california have 
brought calls for stricter laws to prevent accidents and clean up 
messes quickly when they occur 
the oil industry and others that use toxic chemicals are 
starting to get the message 
our feeling is 1 of prevention is worth 10 or 100 years 
later said mac jeffery environmental spokesman for ibm were 
establishing manufacturing facilities that clean up problems at the 
source 
local governments learned not to count on the federal government 
during the reagan years and are taking a waitandsee attitude 
toward the bush administration which is supporting a new stronger 
clean air bill 
officials in new york california minnesota wisconsin 
massachusetts washington oregon and other environmentally 
progressive states are passing tough laws as well as seeking closer 
cooperation with industry 
most of the environmental work is being done at the local and 
state levels said tom jorling commissioner of the new york 
state department of environmental conservation theres been very 
little initiative coming from the federal government 
paul ehrlich stanford biologist and one of the nations best 
known ecologists has surprisingly kind words for industry 
industry has already done a lot he said a lot of the 
increase in our energy efficiency over the past 20 years has been a 
response of industry to the fact that energy is no longer to be 
viewed as a free good 
i have a lot more hope for industry than i have for the 
federal government weve had nine years of going backward there 
jorling said new york state officials rather than relying only 
on statutes are working with ibm based in armonk and eastman 
kodak co in rochester to develop agreements on their use of 
toxic chemicals 
and its not just those two jorling said i just sat down 
with 60 oil firms they know theyve got to perform better and 
were trying to figure out ways for them to do that 
no longer are companies sitting back waiting for public policy 
to develop he said now they realize they have to be involved 
the big difference between the original earth day in 1970 and earth 
day 1990 is that now industry recognizes the environmental issue is 
not a passing fad its here to stay and must be part of the way of 
doing business 
getting businesses involved in preventing environmental damage 
and shaping legislation doesnt mean states are letting industry 
dictate terms 
states must develop good high quality environmental 
programs jorling said without that lever and credibility 
theyre going to be whipsawed by industry industry doesnt respect 
weakness it respects strength 
san franciscobased chevron corp which promotes an image of 
environmental concern but has been cited for toxic spills into the 
bay and emissions into the air at its richmond calif refinery 
is wary of state officials 
we seem to have more mavericks at the state level than the 
federal level said lyn arscott chevrons general manager of 
health environment and loss prevention he complained about 
actions by the state attorney general and a legal system that 
allows some not very sensible initiatives to pop up in 
california 
arscott said chevron recognizes the oil industry does not 
enjoy a high level of credibility because of valdez and chevrons 
refinery explosion 
were trying hard to improve our performance he said we 
hope the public will meet us halfway wed like to encourage 
using market forces in the regulatory process historically 
government has wanted to command and control the law comes on 
from up high with big fines wed like to set up some general 
guidelines and then have a system of incentives 
jorling said the biggest recalcitrants in the corporate 
world are in the auto industry 
they say they cant meet requirements on emission standards 
cant build cars with better gas mileage but its crucial that 
they be turned around because of their huge effect on the 
environment energy use global warming air pollution jorling 
said theyre still back somewhere in the heyday of the robber 
barons 
top priorities for the 1990s jorling said are the production 
of durable fuelefficient cars and the eventual weaning from 
fossil fuels to alternatives such as solar energy 
ehrlich said the government ought to jack up gasoline taxes 
until were paying 3 a gallon like the europeans do 
youd have to compensate poor people to make sure they can 
still get to work he said but youd raise a lot of revenue 
youd help the global warming problem and other air pollution 
problems and save the roads and bridges by using fewer cars and 
more efficient latemodel cars

the ideals they seek are the bedrock of america 
freedom to worship without persecution the chance for a better 
life opportunities for their children in greater numbers than

run away its a very bad sign said emigre sophie spektor

ten years ago eugeny bragarnik gave up on 
soviet promises of a workers paradise to pursue the american dream 
bragarnik started out as a cab driver he now owns a restaurant 
and a threebedroom house drives an audi has a son in college 
jogs five miles a day on a seaside boardwalk and loves threes 
company reruns on cable 
he has little interest in soviet upheaval even if the communist 
monopoly of seven decades is ending lithuania leads restive 
republics seeking independence armenians war with azerbaijanis 
and eastern bloc tyrants have tumbled like the berlin wall 
i dont think about that government its past its gone 
said bragarnik everything i have is over here my soul is here 
most of the time i am thinking about this government 
at bragarniks odessa restaurant nestled among the delis and 
fast food joints typical of any american neighborhood an 
eightpiece band featuring two russian singers competes with the 
flat music of video games in the lobby 
supper tables are set with shot glasses for gulping down icy 
stolychnaya vodka and patrons are welcomed by a spread worthy of 
an old world wedding reception borscht shishkabob 
cabbagestuffed piroshki and pelmini a spicy raviolilike dish 
the linking of east and west occurs throughout brighton beach a 
25block pocket in brooklyn within commuting distance of the statue 
of liberty and adjacent to coney islands roller coaster and 
parachute jump 
the neighborhood the largest concentration of soviets in the 
united states is called little odessa for the black sea port in 
the ukraine where many of its residents once lived 
brighton beachs newsstands boast the cyrillic headlines of the 
only russianlanguage daily newspaper in the western hemisphere 
and newcomers tune in to russianlanguage tv and radio shows 
the black sea book store carries russian mysteries novels and 
science fiction but not mikhail gorbachevs perestroika the 
soviet presidents plan for overhauling the country 
the argot of odessa moscow leningrad and kiev can be heard 
among the clusters of people who visit the boardwalk wearing fur 
hats and head scarves called babushkas 
everything it seems has a russian flavor except politics 
these latterday pilgrims are too busy chasing capitalistic prizes 
like tvs and cars to worry about riots in tadzhikistan or long 
lines for toilet paper 
some people get homesick but there is a new medicine for 
people who suffer from nostalgia said sophie spektor who left 
odessa for brighton beach 15 years ago its the 3000 ticket 
you go back and you become well in a hurry you wont be nostalgic 
anymore 
since 1972 when richard nixons policies of detente thawed 
sovietamerican relations about 35000 mostly jewish refugees have 
come to brighton beach to flee hatred and bigotry most settle in 
plain brick tenements that look as if they were stamped out by the 
same cookie cutter 
this year more soviet jews than ever are coming to america 
gorbachevs reforms made it easier for them to leave but the open 
society is a doublededged sickle that made the jews who remain 
targets of hatred and bigotry by some russian nationalists 
this is the largest wave ever of soviet jewish refugees in 
modern times they are really running scared as a group they are 
a persecuted minority said mark handelman of the new york 
association for new americans a resettlement agency that helps pay 
housing and living expenses 
last year 36147 soviet jews were admitted to the united 
states and 40000 are expected this year according to the hebrew 
immigrant aid society thats up from 10576 in 1988 and only 570 
in 1985 gorbachevs first year in power 
about half the new arrivals stay in the new york area 
the 14 million jews living in the soviet union fear pogroms or 
organized racial attacks jews say biases prohibit them from 
holding government jobs getting promotions or gaining admission to 
universities for them lenins promise of a workers paradise is 
as empty as most soviet stores shelves 
theres an ancient history of antisemitism its in the 
mothers milk of every russian said pauline bilus director of 
action for russian immigrants a service agency based in brighton 
beach 
people are voting with their feet theyre breaking the doors 
down to get out of there theres a palpable fear you can touch 
it taste it she said 
svetlana uriadko who came here 13 years ago said things seemed 
worse when she visited the soviet union in 1988 
on the street you can hear people yelling jew jew go out 
from the country its intolerable mrs uriadko said there 
is nothing in the store no cheese no meat no bologna no wurst 
no eggs the people steal they hoard they have black markets 
america gave me a second birth here only here i started 
believing in god she said gorbachev is to be complimented for 
one thing in the heart of communism he pronounced communism 
doesnt work he tore off the false mask 
among the refugees gorbachev gets mixed reviews theyre 
grateful he allows more jews to leave but many believe the reforms 
may be too late even the most cynical though concede the changes 
have gone too far to turn back 
the oneparty rule dictated after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
has given way to multiparty elections in a nod toward capitalism 
factory ownership is allowed communist party cards have been 
burned in freedom marches 
nobody expected in our lives there would be such changes 
said barber abe rud 52 between 6 haircuts in his brighton beach 
shop 
its gone too far rud said it couldnt go back you 
would have to have a thousand thousand tanks to turn it back what 
are you going to do kill people in the streets 
once settled in these new americans tend to be conservative in 
their politics and lifestyles 
most of them are republicans said pat singer of the 
brighton neighborhood association they loved reagan they want 
toughness they want someone to stand up to the russians 
some traits die hard especially when it comes to asking for 
government assistance for housing and food stamps 
they know how to fight a bureaucracy they never give up they 
even bring crummy presents like russian perfume that smells like 
mothballs to cut through the red tape said ruth paris of the 
council of jewish organizations of flatbush none of them has any 
love for russia

many sound like american parents fretting about drugs crime and 
kids wearing wild clothes and too much makeup 
they cannot accept laxity and the lack of discipline in 
schools said rabbi yechezkel pikus of the council of jewish 
organizations they feel you can get away with murder because the 
penal system is so ineffective 
the new arrivals laugh about getting dizzy in american stores 
because their heads spin so fast trying to look at all the 
merchandise 
after chafing under a government that dictated everything they 
must learn to take the initiative for the first time in their lives 
people are not accustomed to making their own decisions 
said helen lomosova who has been in the united states for less 
than a year the system was arranged so that somebody always told 
you what to do 
mrs lomosova 60 once taught english to pupils in the ukraine 
now she teaches english to refugees who squeeze into elementary 
school chairs at ps 225 
she taps her toe to give rhythm and cadence to the strange words 
being mouthed by a nurse a violinist and a sheet metal worker 
struggling to say their names addresses and phone numbers in 
english 
only english is spoken here she tells them in a tone that 
suggests a teachers admonitions are the same in any language 
never say cannot always say ill try or i will 
other lessons are more subliminal mrs lomosova begins each 
class with the patriotic words of a cherished us verse 
as the students say words they may not yet fully appreciate she 
repeats the final line for emphasis god bless america my home 
sweet home

soviet emigre sarah rudman proudly speaks two 
words in english america good 
its quite a statement for someone starting life over both she 
and her husband unable to work because they are crippled living in 
a barren apartment an ocean and a continent away from their 
homeland 
the rudmans both 64 have a handmedown bed without sheets a 
folding table two chairs two lamps a 13inch portable tv and one 
curtain for two windows all the furnishings were either donated 
left over or scrounged 
i never had many things books and spiritual things are much 
more valuable than material things mrs rudman said through an 
interpreter we didnt think everything will fall from the sky 
im happy with what i have she gained something worth more than 
home furnishings so she doesnt mind using a corner of her bed as 
a sofa 
we wanted to be free and not be persecuted because we are 
jewish she said we wanted our kids to be free to get an 
education people here are really free they can express 
themselves they can observe any religion they want to everybody 
does what he wants 
mrs rudman who taught kindergarten in odessa hasnt left the 
apartment since her dec 20 arrival in brighton beach shes laid 
up with a bad back a condition stemming from typhoid fever 
contracted during world war ii when she was evacuated to siberia to 
escape invading nazis 
her husband lazar was a shoemaker until he suffered a 
disabling head injury in a 1983 streetcar accident he also was 
mugged before leaving the soviet union and walks with a cane 
the rudmans came to america with a daughter and her three 
children another daughter stayed behind because her child had 
meningitis and she hopes to emigrate later this year until then 
they are reluctant to talk about soviet life 
as refugees the rudmans are entitled to food stamps welfare 
and federal rent subsidies they also get money for rent and food 
from the new york association for new americans which gets the 
bulk of its support from united jewish appeal 
nevertheless they had to borrow money from relatives and other 
immigrants to pay their 525 monthly rent they were too proud at 
first to seek government help 
were a little embarrassed mrs rudman said 
the rudmans who first applied to leave the soviet union in 
1978 learn english through a paperback translation book or by 
watching cartoons and other tv shows 
i am afraid of nothing a person dies only once mrs rudman 
said defiantly 
then she clasped her hands in a gesture of prayer and said in 
broken english america good so very good

state regulators dealt a crippling blow to 
sir james goldsmiths attempted 21 billion buyout of britains bat 
industries plc by rejecting a proposed french takeover of the 
farmers insurance companies 
bat britains largest conglomerate owns farmers group inc 
goldsmith the anglofrench takeover specialist had proposed to 
sell farmers to axamidi assurances of france upon acquiring bat 
farmers the largest californiabased insurer and the third 
largest auto and homeowner insurer in the united states had 
maintained that axamidi was too small and too inexperienced in the 
us market to take farmers over axamidi has about 8 billion in 
premium revenues a bit more than farmers 
in order for goldsmith to proceed with his bid the british 
takeover panel has said he must gain clearance for his plans for 
farmers in each of the nine states in which farmers operates an 
insurance company 
on monday california regulators ruled strongly that 
policyholders interests would not be served by a takeover of bat 
by goldsmiths hoylake investments ltd or the sale of los 
angelesbased farmers to the french company 
chief among their objections was axamidis financing its 45 
billion offer for farmers entirely with borrowed funds axamidi 
chairman claude bebear replied that he would find a way to raise 
more cash although he did not say how 
the regulators also questioned how goldsmith could finance his 
bid for bat now that the junkbond market has collapsed they said 
he does not even have a formal proposal on the table for them to 
examine 
lorraine johnson the lead attorney for the insurance department 
on the matter suggested that axamidi will have to submit a nearly 
new proposal to have a chance of winning approval 
goldsmith and bebear issued statements saying they would push 
ahead with attempts to win over insurance commissioner roxani 
gillespie they noted that california regulators had initially 
turned thumbs down on bats buyout of farmers in 1988 
but farmers spokesman jeff beyer and insurance department 
officials said the departments objections to that deal were far 
less serious than those to the hoylakeaxamidi proposal 
bebear had agreed to give goldsmith 1 billion to help with the 
bat purchase 
to buy farmers axamidi was to borrow 225 billion from banks 
and 225 billion from goldsmith by giving him promissory notes 
goldsmith then was to sell the notes for cash 
while axamidi has an outstanding european record the 
leverage of this deal is such that it would endanger the farmers 
group of insurance companies ms gillespie said in a statement 
issued by her department 
the department said axamidi basically looked to the financial 
performance of the farmers companies to repay the acquisition debt 
however insurance companies cannot be relied upon to repay this 
type of sizeable debt as it would be dangerous to policyholders and 
claimants 
bebears statement did not say how axamidi intended to put more 
cash into the deal he has suggested in the past that it might do 
so by issuing stock selling noninsurance assets or restructuring 
the deal with goldsmith 
ms johnson senior staff counsel to the insurance department 
said the department had ruled that axamidi had failed to meet 
three of five test standards and hoylake had failed four of the 
five tests 
she also said bebears earlier suggestions that he could sell 
assets or stock to raise cash were too vague 
its going to have to be more than just trust me ill 
provide details later ms johnson said 
still another problem is the gap issue the fact that once 
hoylake purchased bat farmers might not be quickly transferred to 
axamidi under british law a bat subsidiary would first have the 
legal responsibility to decide independently whether to sell 
farmers and at what price ms johnson said 
illinois idaho oregon and washington have also held hearings 
on the proposed takeover they have yet to announce their 
decisions hearings began monday in texas insurance departments in 
arizona kansas and ohio have yet to set hearing dates

ames department stores inc citing 
lower than anticipated sales at the former zayre stores it bought 
in 1988 has announced an estimated net loss of 228 million for 
the year ended january 27 
the discount department store chain also said monday it was 
negotiating with its banks for a new credit agreement 
the net loss which is subject to a final audit includes the 
establishment of an aftertax restructuring reserve of 
approximately 150 million among other things the reserve will 
cover the cost of closing 74 unprofitable stores after a new credit 
agreement is reached the company said 
the stores are primarily former zayre stores in florida 
illinois indiana and ohio said douglas w ewing ames director of 
investor relations 
the operating loss for the year resulted primarily from 
substantially lower than anticipated sales and gross margins from 
the former zayre stores peter hollis ames chief executive 
officer said in a statement the profitability of the original 
ames stores has been maintained we are dedicated to improving the 
performance of the entire company 
ames bought the 392store zayre chain on oct 28 1988 for 778 
million doubling its size it has since closed some of those 
stores and converted others to the ames name

antimonopoly law by japanese automakers and parts suppliers 
a commission official yoshiro sekine said the panel will study 
boones claims and decide what action to take 
pickens has been seeking greater participation in the management 
of koito manufacturing co a japanese auto parts maker after 
becoming its largest single shareholder in march 1989 
sekine said boone claimed that japans 11 automakers put unfair 
pressure on parts suppliers to lower the prices of their products 
he said boone also claimed that the automakers close relations 
with parts makers limit free competition among the parts suppliers 
and hinder entry by outside companies especially foreign makers 
into the japanese market 
sekine declined to provide further details 
koitos secondlargest shareholder is toyota motor corp 
koitos largest customer 
pickens purchase of the koito shares has stirred speculation 
that he is trying to force the company to buy them back at a 
profit a practice known as greenmail pickens has denied the 
greenmail accusation

international paper co said tuesday lower 
prices in some key product lines disappointments in manufacturing 
operations and a higher effective tax rate led to a 193 percent 
decline in its firstquarter profit 
the purchase nybased paper and forest products maker said it 
earned 180 million or 165 a share in the three months ended 
march 31 down from 223 million or 196 a share a year earlier 
revenue rose 231 percent to 32 billion from 26 billion 
john a georges chairman and chief executive said the results 
were affected by lower prices in paper pulps and printed and 
writing papers 
the deepest price cuts came in uncoated printing and writing 
papers he said recent increases in industry capacity led to 
price reductions even though sales volume remained at healthy 
levels he said 
he said paper pulp price declines stemmed from inventory 
corrections by customers 
manufacturing costs rose at some mills due to higher wood prices 
and weatherrelated conditions georges said production 
interruptions associated with capital projects and process 
modifications also affected the performance of the mill systems he 
said 
these situations were temporary and manufacturing conditions 
are returning to normal he said 
the companys effective tax rate for the quarter rose to 40 
percent from 38 percent a year ago he said 
georges said the companys other businesses posted improved 
performances citing contributions to operating income from recent 
acquisitions speciality products businesses and consumer packaging 
while the uncertainty of future economic conditions makes it 
difficult to predict performance we believe that our investments 
in new markets development of additional higher value products and 
improved operating efficiencies should provide the basis for 
continuing good financial results he said

the justice department announced today that 
the government plans to freeze and seize assets in cases involving 
alleged savings and loan fraud 
the announcement came a day after the bush administration 
acknowledged that its 50 billion savings and loan bailout will not 
be enough a congressional report has said costs could be as high 
as 500 billion 
a major problem with sampl investigations said justice spokesman 
david runkel is that the assets are not there following the 
convictions the new effort will try to prevent assets from 
being dissipated he said 
in dallas a federal bank fraud task force has brought charges 
against 62 people of whom 49 have been convicted the department 
said 
the government has recovered about 125 million while the 
taxpayers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to cover 
the costs of the illegal actions runkel said 
the assets to be targeted could be either those of the sampls or 
of the individuals involved and the actions would be 
prejudgment attachments he said 
the authority to freeze and seize the assets was part of the sampl 
bailout package approved by congress last year 
its a device to freeze assets that are derived from savings 
and loan wrongdoing runkel said 
attorney general dick thornburgh met today with timothy ryan 
who was sworn in monday to a fiveyear term as director of the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision as a result of 
the meeting thornburgh directed his staff and us attorneys to 
meet with ryans people to coordinate efforts 
i want to send a message to the public we will not tolerate 
the fraudulent practices and decisions in the industry that in the 
past have led to so many failures and put such a financial burden 
on the american taxpayer ryan told top officials at his agency 
theres no question that the cost is increasing and well have 
to take that into account in deciding future actions white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday 
fitzwater was responding to a report by the general accounting 
office an investigative arm of congress that the cost of the 
presidents bailout program would be 325 billion instead of the 
257 billion estimated only five months earlier 
comptroller general charles a bowsher who directs the gao 
said the cost could easily surpass 400 billion and could hit 500 
billion if the economy falters the estimates include the 
governments borrowing expenses over 40 years 
previously treasury department officials had said only that a 
shortfall was possible private analysts have said for months that 
the 50 billion program enacted last year was inadequate 
we dont have an analysis either to endorse or reject the gao 
numbers except to say there clearly is going to be additional 
costs fitzwater said those numbers will have to be decided 
upon at some point 
at this time there is not enough information to make a 
reliable estimate of how much more may be required he said 
ryan 44 was confirmed last wednesday by the senate on a 6237 
vote democratic opponents complained that the former labor 
department solicitor had no direct experience in banking 
ryan succeeds salvatore r martoche an assistant treasury 
secretary who served one month as acting director of the thrift 
office after the resignation of m danny wall wall quit under 
congressional criticism for his handling of the failure of lincoln 
savings and loan association based in irvine calif

two members of the mitsubishi group created from 
the breakup of mitsubishi mining during the us occupation after 
world war ii announced tuesday that they will merge 
mitsubishi metal corp and mitsubishi mining amp cement co in 
announcing their merger attempted to head off expected criticism 
that the move is a step toward reestablishment of the monopoly 
power held by japans prewar zaibatsu financial combines 
the mitsubishi group companies comprised one of the three most 
powerful zaibatsu before and during world war ii 
under the merger plan nine shares of mitsubishi metal will 
equal 10 shares of mitsubishi mining amp cement effective dec 1 the 
companies said 
the merger will link one of japans largest smelters of 
nonferrous metals with one of its largest producers of cement 
every president of the two companies over the past 40 years 
sought out the possibility of a merger said mitsubishi metal 
president takeshi nagano who will become chairman of the new 
company 
when this merger is complete we will feel that the war is 
finally over for our companies nagano said at a news conference 
jointly sponsored by the two firms 
the presidents of the two companies said the merger should not 
be seen as a monopolistic threat 
by combining resources the two firms will be able to grow into 
a comprehensive company which is the best way to conduct a 
flexible and dynamic adjustment to various structural changes 
progressing worldwide nagano said 
masaya fujimaru president of mitsubishi mining amp cement who 
will be president of the new company said the merger is not aimed 
at strengthening the business affiliations of the mitsubishi group 
which is still known for its strong ties among member companies 
nagano said the metal business is vulnerable to changes in 
foreign exchange rates and market prices and the merger would help 
protect against such vulnerability 
in addition the companies said the combination of research in 
metals and ceramics is expected to create a wide range of new 
materials 
the sales of the new company are expected to total the 
equivalent of about 57 billion during the first year and 64 
billion within the first five years the two companies said the 
new company which will have 9000 employees will have total 
assets of 51 billion they said 
the companies decided on the merger in early march right before 
mitsubishi mining amp cement closed its last coal mine in ohyubari 
marking the end of the companys 120year coal mining business

federal safety officials today concluded that 
failures by the airline the manufacturer and the government all 
contributed to the loss of a cargo door on united flight 811 over 
the pacific ocean last year nine passengers were blown out of the 
aircraft to their deaths 
the national transportation safety board voted 30 to blame 
united airlines boeing and the federal aviation administration in 
the feb 24 1989 accident which has already led to faa action to 
ensure that boeing 747 cargo doors are secure 
the board said united failed to properly inspect the door of the 
airliner after its electrical system failed in december 1988 and 
mechanics had to operate it manually it had been operating 
electrically since then however 
boeing and the faa were cited for failing to order timely 
corrective measures after another cargo door malfunctioned on a 
1987 pan american flight from london to new york the board noted 
however that the faa has since issued directives for improving the 
doors and plans additional action 
united spokesman robert dowdy said the airline has complied with 
all faa requirements except one that resulted from a clerical 
error six words mandating an inspection were left out of a 
regulation when it was copied from faa documents into the company 
system investigators said 
dowdy said the board conducted a good investigation with the 
evidence it had but said recovery of the cargo door itself is 
needed to make it morethorough boeing had recommended that the 
board conclude that probable cause of the incident could not be 
determined 
in seattle boeing spokesman jack gamble said the company had no 
comment on the ntsb finding except to say we feel no 1 those 
cargo doors are safe 
there were subsequent changes made as a result of the 
accident changes and inspection processes all of the necessary 
actions have been taken to ensure integrity of that doors 
operation in flight gamble said 
the faa is expected to issue a new order requiring an additional 
warning system in boeing747 cargo doors to indicate to the pilot 
and the ground crew that the doors are properly locked 
investigators told the board 
the board said there is evidence that the current system can 
indicate that the door is locked when it is not 
the plane returned to honolulu from a scheduled flight to new 
zealand after the door popped off at about 22000 feet ripping off 
a 15by10foot section of the fuselage and hurling a group of 
passengers and their seats out of the aircraft 
five other passengers were seriously hurt and 33 received minor 
injuries the plane carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers 
ron schleed investigator in charge for the accident said 
efforts to locate and recover the cargo door from three miles below 
the ocean would continue despite the fact the board has completed 
its report he said a navy vessel and sophisticated probe device 
would be available in june to search for the door 
investigators hope to determine exactly what failure in the 
mechanism may have caused the door to fly off although they 
believe it was caused by damage to devices either during manual 
opening and closing of the door or due to a electrical malfunction

corn futures prices closed moderately higher 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade reflecting increased export 
sales soybean futures retreated and wheat finished mixed 
the gain in corn marked the eighth daily increase in the last 
nine trading sessions 
some of the buying was a reaction to agriculture department 
announcements of us corn sales to the soviet union totaling more 
than 15 million metric tons since friday 
tuesdays trading also featured the return of largescale buying 
by commercial grain dealers who have been absent from the market 
in recent days 
this indicates the commercials are pricing these purchases and 
that there may be some more announcements coming out said susan 
leighty grains analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
strength in the wheat reflected spillover buying from corn she 
said soybeans traded lower in line with weaker soybean meal 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 362 a bushel corn was

the attempted hostile takeover of bat industries 
plc by a sir james goldsmithled investor group will continue 
despite a potentialy devastating setback from california insurance 
regulators a spokesman for the group said tuesday 
we are reviewing the judgment but these insurance hearings are 
going on in nine states and we will continue our efforts in all the 
regulatory hearings said david beck spokesman for hoylake 
investments ltd 
california state insurance regulators on monday rejected a 
proposed acquisition of bats farmers insurance companies by 
frances axamidi assurances 
the sale of farmers group inc to axamidi assurances is a key 
element of hoylakes strategy in its proposed 21 billion takeover 
of bat britains largest conglomerate 
one objection by the california insurance regulators was 
axamidis financing of its 45 billion offer for farmers entirely 
with borrowed funds axamidi has stated it would raise cash but 
has not yet indicated how 
beck said hoylake was not surprised by the insurance 
commissioners ruling 
when bat acquired farmers they were rejected by california 
initially and rejected several times in several different 
states beck said it doesnt come wholly as a surprise 
bat acquired farmers last year for 52 billion following a 
protracted takeover battle that also saw challenges to the deal by 
a number of state insurance regulators 
bat issued a statement tuesday that it was not surprised by the 
ruling 
california has long opposed highly leveraged acquisitions of 
its insurance companies and no doubt the other eight states will 
reach similar conclusions the statement read 
illinois idaho oregon and washington also have held hearings 
on the proposed takeover they have yet to announce their decisions 
hearings began monday in texas insurance departments in 
arizona kansas and ohio have yet to set hearing dates 
bat has launched a defensive strategy against the hostile bid 
which includes selling its saks fifth avenue and marshall field 
stores after restructuring the company has said bat intends to 
focus on its remaining tobacco and financial services business 
bat chairman pat sheehy issued a statement which said the 
company looked forward to being able to manage our business of 
which farmers is a key strategic element without further 
distractions 
the hoylake takeover bid was announced in july by the powerful 
investor group led by goldsmith british investment banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer 
the acquisition would be the biggest british takeover and rival 
the record 25 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg 
kravis roberts and co in 1989 as the biggest anywhere 
hoylake has said it intends to break up the londonbased bat 
which has interests in tobacco financial services retailing and 
paper to better realize the value of the separate businesses

the chicago board of trade acted within ethics 
rules when it declared an emergency and ordered traders to reduce 
july 1989 soybean holdings congressional investigators said 
tuesday 
the general accounting office was asked to probe last summers 
order to liquidate large stakes in the july futures contract the 
controversy centered on ferruzzi finanziaria spa one of the 
worlds largest soybean processors 
ferruzzi had gained a huge stake in the soybean contract and 
traders believed the companys position could lead to price 
manipulation 
the board of trade was widely criticized by farmers who saw the 
value of soybeans drop they suggested that traders may have 
learned secretly about the emergency order before it was publicly 
announced july 11 
but the gao concluded that board of trade members who held 
contracts did not participate in meetings that led to the emergency 
order 
the board of trade and the governments commodity futures 
trading commission followed their policies and procedures 
concerning emergency actions the gao said 
our review confirmed that the data supported cftcs 
conclusion that the board of trade was in compliance with cftc 
requirements investigators said 
between may 25 and july 11 the cftc asked ferruzzi at least 10 
times to voluntarily reduce its large position in july soybean 
futures the board of trade made the same request at least six 
times 
ferruzzi refused to honor the requests and on july 11 the board 
of trade told members with more than 3 million july bushels to 
reduce those holdings to less than 1 million 
in november the american agriculture movement filed a lawsuit 
against the board of trade alleging that the emergency order 
illegally manipulated soybean prices 
board of trade chairman karsten cash mahlmann called the 
lawsuit which seeks more than 100 million in damages for farmers 
frivolous

a court ruling that insurance 
companies are liable for up to 960 million in damages for asbestos 
exposure could clear the way for settlement of thousands of claims 
a victims advocate said tuesday 
the five insurance companies reacted with caution to the ruling 
by a new jersey superior court judge which involved claims 
stemming from asbestos products made by owensillinois corp from 
1948 to 1958 
heather maurer executive director of the asbestos victims of 
america in soquel calif which represents more than 8000 people 
the decision is a key step to resolving lawsuits filed against 
asbestos manufacturers 
this basically means that our asbestos victims now have 
recourse and the manufacturers no longer will be able to say we 
dont have any money to pay you because our insurance companies 
wont pay us she said 
andrew berry an attorney for owensillinois of toledo ohio 
said the ruling last friday was the largest of its kind involving 
claims against an asbestos manufacturer 
owensillinois had sought a ruling to determine whether its five 
insurance companies would be liable to cover damage awards the 
insurers claimed that asbestosrelated lawsuits were excluded from 
policies written between 1977 and 1985 
asbestos is widely used in building materials and as a 
soundproofing and fireproofing agent it has been linked to 
health problems and deaths caused by tiny particles that become 
trapped in the lungs 
allstate insurance co one of the five companies involved in 
the decision said in a statement tuesday it was surprised and 
disappointed with the ruling 
allstate based in northbrook ill said its exposure to claims 
would not exceed 25 million and thus would not threaten the health 
of the company 
general reinsurance co a stamford connbased firm that 
assumed much of the insurance exposure of owens insurance ltd an 
owenillinois subsidiary said the asbestos claims would not impact 
its earnings or financial condition 
both companies said the decision would be reviewed to whether to 
appeal 
owensillinois claimed in the 5yearold lawsuit insurers 
wrongfully refused to honor claims the judge rejected insurers 
arguments that the owensillinois policies did not cover asbestos 
damage berry said 
most of the 75000 suits against owensillinois involved 
individuals and companies claiming injuries and damages stemming 
from the use of an insulation product manufactured by 
owensillinois he said 
included were claims of asbestosis and other forms of lung 
cancer linked to asbestos exposure 
asbestos exposure also has been linked to cancers of the 
esophagus and colon and to mesothelioma an alwaysfatal cancer of 
the lining of lungs or abdominal cavities 
united insurance co and cigna reinsurance co the two other 
insurance companies involved in the case did not have an immediate 
comment to the decision owensillinois spokesman jeff hoff also 
declined comment 
new jersey has been the focus of much of the court action over 
asbestos exposure partly because it was the home of the 
johnsmanville corp formerly of manville nj 
now known as manville corp of denver the asbestos maker filed 
for bankruptcy protection in 1982 after a number of injury and 
wrongful death claims 
the company eventually settled the claims by contributing 600 
million to several trust funds meant to compensate those made ill 
by manville products

the stateowned shipyard where workers 
founded the solidarity labor movement will be transferred to 
private ownership by selling shares to employees and the public 
its manager announced tuesday 
the fate of the shipyard in the northern port of gdansk had been 
uncertain since october 1988 when polands thencommunist 
government announced plans to close it solidarity leader lech 
walesa viewed the step as a political move but authorities said 
the shipyard was unprofitable and must be closed as part of 
economic reforms 
poland should finally understand that we were fighting for 
everybody but we got nothing out of it walesa told workers 
tuesday at a gdansk shipyard rally where the ownership transfer was 
announced the time of struggle is over now we are fighting 
for ourselves 
the manager of the shipyard hans szyt read a telegram from 
industry minister tadeusz syryjczyk announcing the decision during 
the rally by 2000 workers protesting the slow pace of government 
decisions on the shipyards fate 
the shares will be sold to the public for 105 each with the 
founding capital to total about 114 million said andrzej 
popczyk director of the industry ministrys legal department 
shipyard workers will be able to purchase 20 percent of the 
shares at half the offering price before the end of 1990 and at 
half the market price after that popczyk said 
the solidarityled government and parliament are working out 
complex reforms allowing the sale of state enterprises as part of a 
radical switch from a centrally planned socialist economy to a 
marketdriven system 
the state industries although largely unprofitable and 
outmoded make up much of polands national wealth and there has 
been widespread concern about how and at what price they will be 
sold to private investors 
few other details of the plan for the gdansk shipyard were 
offered immediately including the number of shares to be issued 
and the timetable for the sale 
when the communists were ousted and the solidarityled 
government took over last fall discussions began on how to save 
the highly symbolic shipyard 
one muchpublicized offer from the polishborn american heiress 
barbara piaseckajohnson seemed to fall through when terms could 
not be reached apparently because the workers were unwilling to 
accept the pay and nostrike agreements she required she has 
offered further negotiations 
the solidarity movement was born at the shipyard when walesa an 
electrician fired for union work scaled a fence to lead a strike 
in 1980 as the movement swept poland communist authorities were 
forced to recognize solidarity as the first legal independent trade 
union in the soviet bloc 
on dec 13 1981 martial law was imposed to repress 
solidaritys surging power but beset by a staggering economy and 
dispirited populace the communist regime was forced to turn to 
solidarity for help and relegalized the group in late 1988 
within a year the communists were trounced in largely 
democratic elections and the first noncommunist government in the 
east bloc was installed with a solidarity veteran as prime minister

ast research inc a small us computer 
maker is invading japan with a clone of that countrys most 
popular personal computer a rare attack on a market dominated by 
domestic machines 
the ast computer to be unveiled wednesday in tokyo runs programs 
designed for nec corps pc9801 but can be switched over to the 
different operating system used by ibm corp it will be the first 
pc in japan to run both systems and ast says it will be priced 
competitively with nec computers 
nec has some 70 percent of the japanese personal computer 
market analysts estimate 
ast a decadeold irvinebased company had 457 million in 
sales last year and also aggressively has been courting business in 
the soviet union and eastern european companies 
japans market is already wellestablished and is the 
secondbiggest market for pcs in the world behind the united 
states 
the introduction of a us product tailored specifically for 
japanese buyers will provide a test trade case for the japanese 
who say they would buy us products if only americans would tailor 
them to japanese buying habits 
i think this will really test the japanese willingness and see 
if they will follow through ast president safi qureshey said in 
a telephone interview this machine is japanese compatible 
but it is also more than what they can buy today in japan 
he also said the japanese cannot say that the product is 
missing features it counters the arguments that american companies 
are lazy just comfortable with the us market 
but some us observers believe asts machine will be unable to 
make many inroads into necs dominion 
tim bajarin of the santa clarabased creative strategies 
international computer consulting firm noted that ibm already is 
selling pcs in japan and apple also is selling products there 
particularly desktop publishing setups 
the fact that this particular box is pretty innovative and 
priced competitively means it will get some attention he said 
but nec is such a powerhouse i cant imagine they will do much 
damage there if anything they ast will take share away from 
ibm 
but qureshey said competition from apple compaq ast and the 
hosts of other manufacturers have chewed away pieces of ibms 
business 
nec is so dominant that a small percentage of their share 
means a lot to a small entrant he said 
he suggested instead that another nec imitation already 
introduced in japan by seiko epson corp may be the loser in the 
battle 
were actually the third in the market qureshey said but 
were the only ones compatible with both japanese and american 
machines 
a basic nec computer with no hard disk and no monitor costs 
about 390000 yen or the equivalent of 2475 ast spokesman joel 
don said seiko epsons pc costs 328000 yen or about 2080 
according to ast spokesman joel don 
our machine will be in between nec and epson in terms of 
competitive pricing don said 
ast teamed with japans kawasaki steel corp and tomcat computer 
corp to develop its new computer named the dual sx16 the 
machines will be sold under the brand names of japanese 
distributors ast is negotiating with several potential 
distributors including sharp corp don said 
the company plans to build the first machines at its fountain 
valley plant in southern california but probably will shift 
production to taiwan when distribution arrangements are completed 
he said

soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures rose

at 5240 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 135 cents to 246 
cents lower with may at 5843 cents a gallon 
as in the five previous sessions selling was largely motivated 
by perceptions of oversupply due to seasonal refinery shutdowns and 
opec overproduction of crude oil 
theres a lot of bearish sentiment in the market said 
william hinton an energy broker with stotler amp co 
those views were supported tuesday by a trade report on european 
crude oil stocks that showed supplies increasing there 
after the close of trading in new york the american petroleum 
institute released its weekly report on us petroleum stocks 
showing an 81million barrel rise in us crude supplies 
the api report far surpassed the expectations of even the most 
bearish analysts who had expected it to show at most a 
3millionbarrel buildup 
one reason for the unexpectedly large increase in crude supplies 
was an unforeseen 18 percent decrease in refinery activity at 
this time of year oil refineries usually increase activity after 
seasonal shutdowns to adjust for greater gasoline production 
cocoa futures soared on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange largely in reaction renewed fears of supply disruptions

an attempt to oust lockheed corps directors but won on several 
shareholder issues including seeking to abolish the companys 
socalled poison pill 
citing preliminary tallies simmons said four shareholders 
rights proposals each received 57 percent to 97 percent of the 
votes cast at last months annual shareholders meeting

percent and 61 percent of the votes each the billionaid 
lockheed maker of the stealth fighter and other military 
hardware said its directors won with 62 percent of the vote the

sacs 
lockheed said its nominees won 78 percent of the vote of 
shareholders not controlled by simmons the results are 
preliminary and will not be official until monday lockheed 
spokesman steve shadet said 
it appears we achieved a clean sweep on the issues of 
confidential voting opting out of the delaware antitakeover law 
abolition of the poison pill and antigreenmail said simmons 
who controls about 19 percent of lockheed stock 
the shareholdeother tumble 
tuesday sending crude oil prices to their lowest level in more 
than a year 
analysts blamed the recent price decline on sizeable supplies 
and production while demand has been weaker than expected 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil lost 76 cents to settle at 1768 per 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the contract fell 71 
cents on monday 
later contracts posted smaller losses tuesday the may 
settlement price was the lowest for a nearmonth contract for west 
texas intermediate since it finished below 17 a barrel in february 
1989 according to elders futures inc 
peter beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders 
said west texas intermediate has fallen 27 percent in the past 11 
weeks 
analysts cited recent reports that indicate the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has been producing 24 million barrels 
of oil a day with no signs of a letup 
in addition they said the normal maintenance periods for many 
oil refineries are ending and the refineries should soon resume 
production 
at the same time they said demand for oil has been weak with 
big customers either placing smaller orders because of weak 
business conditions or postponing purchases in anticipation of 
further price declines 
with heavy imports coming in weaker than expected demand and 
good stocks already this market has no other way but to go down 
under the weight of in excess of 2 million barrels a day of 
crude said james steel energy analyst for the brokerage refco 
inc in new york 
bob baker oil analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
said he estimates opec is producing 15 million barrels a day more 
than the market can sustain and said they have shown no 
indications of moving down 
gasoline futures also dropped sharply on tuesday on the new york 
merc 
the contract for may delivery of unleaded gasoline settled 246 
cents lower at 5843 cents a gallon after mondays drop of 122 
cents later contract months had smaller losses 
the decline in home heating oil prices was not as sharp 
may home heating oil fell 067 cent to 5240 cents a gallon 
after falling 064 cent on monday later contracts posted bigger 
declines 
prudential baches baker said the steep decline in gasoline 
futures may have reflected an earlier overestimation of how strong 
demand would be 
we have been seeing 1 and 2 percent less consumption here than 
we had last year he said 
he said the more subdued decline in home heating oil may reflect 
some lingering demand because of unexpectedly cold weather in some 
parts of the country 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery closed at 1620 per 
million british thermal units down from 1637 on monday 
contracts for delivery further in the future were also lower
