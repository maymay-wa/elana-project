air force officials 
announced plans thursday to increase unmanned launches at this 
coastal base after reaffirming a decision to put its space shuttle 
facilities in mothballs 
col sebastian colitore said at the 25th annual space congress 
convention thursday in cocoa beach fla that the air force would 
build one new launch pad and modify another at the base to launch 
the titan 4 missile 
his statement came a day after maj gen donald cromer chief of 
the space and missile test organization at vandenberg reaffirmed a 
february announcement that the 35 billion shuttle launch facility 
at vandenberg was being placed in mothballs because of federal 
budget cuts 
cromer said the move would save the air force 40 million in 
1989 
the air force plans to use the shuttle pad to launch other 
unmanned missles maj sgt bruce zielsdorf a vandenberg 
spokesman said thursday 
the titan 4 the militarys workhorse missile carries huge 
shuttlesized payloads and satellites into orbit the first planned 
launch of the titan 4 which is 20 feet taller than the shuttle at 
204 feet is set for february 1990 colitore said 
the air force also will modify another launch pad for old titan 
2 intercontinental missiles that are being refurbished into space 
boosters said lt col mike callaway project manager the first 
launch of the titan 2 is set for july 1 at vandenberg he said 
colitore said the air force would increase its unmanned launches 
at vandenberg 150 miles northwest of los angeles on the california 
coast 
the vandenberg shuttle site has been regularly maintained at a 
cost of 50 million a year since the space shuttle challenger 
exploded during launch in florida in january 1986 killing the 
seven people aboard 
it was to be the next site of a shuttle launch in july 1986 but 
after the challenger disaster nasa moved the launch back to 1992 
now launches have been indefinitely postponed at vandenberg 
although an august shuttle launch is planned at cape canaveral in 
florida 
even if vandenbergs vast shuttle complex which includes a 
launch pad buildings and runway were to be reactivated it would 
take at least four years for it to be functional zielsdorf said

the florida lotterys first 
computerized numbers game produced 859 winners friday night and 
that didnt include the st petersburg times which published a 
photo of a winning ticket hours before the contest 
a photograph at the top of the front page of friday mornings 
paper showed the numbers 806 which proved to be the winning 
combination in the first cash 3 contest the photo showed a sample 
ticket sent to the paper a month ago 
this was entirely coincidental city editor jack reed said 
it doesnt seem like that should need to be said but weve 
gotten so many calls 
the cash 3 winners will split a total payout of 94090 
sales of the lotto and cash 3 tickets began when lt gov bobby 
brantley purchased two cash 3 betting slips 
but the kickoff was delayed several minutes when a computer 
terminal at the new lottery headquarters refused to issue 
brantleys tickets because the terminals password had not been 
entered correctly 
across the state 3142 retailers were supposed to be hooked 
into a central computer to begin dispensing the 50cent cash 3 and 
1 lotto tickets 
several reported their machines were not working or said they 
could not get through on a hotline set up by control data corp 
which is operating the online computer system 
by 730 pm 616543 had been wagered on cash 3 and 345377 
on the lotto game 
most online games start out slow and then grow lottery 
secretary rebecca paul said she predicted combined lotto and cash 
3 sales would surpass 10 million in the first eight days of sales 
and 1 billion in the first year 
thirtyfive percent of all lottery revenue is earmarked for 
public education 
twentyeight states including florida and the district of 
columbia have legalized lotteries law enforcement officials hope 
the florida games will help undermine illegal numbers rackets 
some of the people down here have been playing illegal numbers 
since they were teenagers said lt norflett harris of the miami 
police vice squad but if they can find a way to play the same 
amount win the same amount and do it legally im reasonably sure 
a lot of them will switch over and play the legal game or start 
playing both 
cash 3 offers daily top prizes of 500 players pick numbers 
from 000 to 999 
in the lotto game players pick six numbers from 1 to 49 the 
first winning number will be drawn may 7 when the jackpot will be 
at least 2 million but could reach 4 million

helga huitt is 83 years old doesnt do 
a lot of driving and gets very few parking tickets 
well she gets a lot of tickets actually but she shouldnt 
mrs huitt who lives in manhattan had a license plate stolen 
from her 1975 plymouth duster in albany two years ago 
by the end of the next day she had reported the theft to new 
york city police and received new plates from the department of 
motor vehicles 
that was not the end of it 
mrs huitt has gotten notices from the new york city parking 
violations bureau about 169 unpaid tickets totaling 9299 
including interest and penalties 
she tried to explain but the notices kept coming a default 
judgment had been issued they said we can take your property and 
bank accounts they said 
i was living in a nightmare she said 
finally through the help of state sen mary goodhue mrs huitt 
was given a letter here on thursday from the parking bureau 
clearing her of the tickets and saying she didnt owe new york city 
a cent for now 
we solved this but there is something wrong with the 
system mrs goodhue said thursday she and gregory breen an 
administrative supervisor for the pvb said that as long as someone 
is still out there with her license plate the computers say its 
her car violating the parking laws 
and shell still get dunning notices 
there is nothing in the system to trip it if someone has 
reported the car stolen or the plates stolen said mrs goodhue 
mrs huitt had so much trouble because she had lost the police 
receipt showing she had reported her car stolen that infuriates 
mrs goodhue 
there should be a system to double check against stolen 
license plates and stolen cars she said you can have two cars 
out there with the same plate and the wrong person getting dunned 
these things shouldnt be allowed to continue happening pvb 
computers should talk to dmv computers 
breen admitted that there was no mechanical system that would 
notify pvb that a ticket was given to a stolen car or plate 
the burden of proof was on the victim as it were to show that 
the vehicle on the ticket isnt theirs or wasnt where the ticket 
said it was he said 
mrs huitt now driving a 1987 ford escort says she will frame 
her 10000 letter 
breen said she should also hope police find the car with her 
license plate and destroy that plate so her nightmare can end for 
good

palestinian moslems respond to a prayer call 
from a minaret and head for a mosque in the old city a few hundred 
yards away ultraorthodox jews dressed in black bow again and 
again before a stone wall 
arabs and israelis enemies but neighbors inside the walls of 
ancient jerusalem pass without speaking israeli riot police stand 
guard on rooftops and in alleys where antiisraeli graffiti are 
scrawled on some walls 
jerusalem is a city both jews and moslem passionately claim 
and reluctantly share 
for the jews it is as the old testaments psalms say 
jerusalem my highest joy for the moslems it is al quds 
or the holy 
its name means city of peace but it is at the heart of the 
arabisraeli conflict 
if secretary of state george p shultz is able to persuade the 
two sides to sit at a negotiating table the issue of this citys 
future is likely to be a major stumbling block 
initially settled about 2500 years before the birth of christ 
jerusalem has been beseiged and conquered 37 times by foreign 
forces including the romans the crusaders and the arab general 
saladin 
today walled ancient jerusalem covers a crowded square mile of 
narrow cobblestone streets broad courtyards hidden behind locked 
doors and a colorful arab market often shuttered by strikes in the 
5monthold palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
nowhere in jerusalem are jewisharab differences more strongly 
felt than in the old city 
hundreds of palestinian worshipers and israeli troops converge 
each friday for moslem prayers at the citys two holiest mosques 
the dome of the rock and al aqsa where angry arab protests often 
erupt 
tear gas thrown to quell the demonstrations sometimes disturbs 
jewish prayers at the adjoining western wall the last remnant of 
the second jewish temple destroyed by the romans in ad 70 and 
judaisms holiest shrine 
it is here that israel seeks to break the back of the uprising 
by forcing merchants who supply the occupied west bank to obey 
israeli rule instead of palestine liberation organization orders 
fourteen arab merchants face up to two years in jail for opening 
shops during ploordained hours in violation of army orders 
as the city grows increasingly tense however most of the 
17000 moslems and 2000 jews who live inside ancient jerusalem say 
they grow more determined in their commitment to stay 
the old city tastes of history in every stone there is a 
book said palestinian poet fawzi bakri born within jerusalems 
walls 42 years ago 
i dont live in jerusalem it lives in me he said i can 
never leave 
for israeli evelyn davis who has lived here five years the 
soul of the old city is in its western wall also known as the 
wailing wall 
the wall offers solace to so many jewish people you see them 
day after day talking to god said mrs davis 44 a native of 
greenbelt md 
but the old city is more than a shrine it is my home she 
said if i am threatened i will turn into a shebear 
the old city was held by jordan for the first 19 years of 
israeli history until jewish troops overran it in the 1967 war 
then israel proclaimed the city its capital a decision that arabs 
refuse to recognize 
palestinians in jerusalem still recall israels conquest with 
bitterness 
mahmud abu sneineh 52 said he was forced to leave his 
apartment after the war when israelis bought the building where he 
lived he moved to hebron on the west bank but was soon drawn back 
to jerusalem even though he could afford only two rooms for his 
family of six 
nothing can match the old city he said we will stay here 
and die here which will surely happen because blood will be shed 
over this city 
israeli poet yehuda amichai sees the problem in dark terms in 
his book poems of jerusalem he writes 
jerusalem stone is the only stone that can 
feel pain it has a network of nerves 
from time to time jerusalem crowds into 
mass protests like the tower of babel 
and afterward the city disperses muttering 
prayers of complaint and sporadic screams from churches 
and synagogues and loudmoaning mosques 
each to his own place 
palestinian poet bakri knows amichais poetry and appreciates 
that others love this city as he does but he supports the arab 
revolt 
my only fear bakri said fingering worry beads is that 
the uprising brings this city closer to more calamity

the roughly chiseled features and 
downcast eyes are all that remain as reminders of the little girl 
who lived here more than 2000 years ago 
nearby looking down at her in the excavation stood another 
little girl this one from the modern village that had been built 
atop the ancient saar burial mounds where the chiseled stone was 
found in february 
the village girls hair was cut short like that of the girl in 
stone they could have been sisters had they not been born 20 
centuries apart 
the little girl tombstone is one of five identified as 
belonging to the tylos culture that existed on this island in the 
persian gulf around the time of christ 
the thousands of ancient graves on bahrain 30 miles long an 10 
miles across at its widest point once gave rise to a theory that 
it was used as a regional burying ground 
however the danish archaeologist bruno frolich among others 
says there is no existing evidence that requires us to assume 
that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of bahrain 
island 
over the years many of these burial sites have been obliterated 
by population and urban growth a process that continues the saar 
mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own 
the property and are impatient to have it cleared 
our problem is that the construction of new buildings is 
coming very quickly said abdul aziz sowaileh the superintendent 
of archaeology bahrain would like to build houses houses and 
everywhere you dig in bahrain you will find some evidence of the 
prehistoric or ancient past 
so we cant preserve all the mounds but we try to do our best 
to preserve as many as we can 
at this site known as the baby grave 85 graves radiate 
from the center of a giant burial mound with the most recent at 
the outer edges 
thirtyfive jars containing skeletal remains of infants were 
also found here giving the site its name 
sowaileh said some burial jars pottery and skeletal remains 
probably will be removed and exhibited in bahrains new national 
museum 
ancient writings suggest bahrain may have been the garden of 
eden described in the old testament the sumerians of what is now 
southern iraq knew the island as dilmun during the bronze age 
some 4500 years ago 
succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones making this a rich 
area for archaeologists although most of the saar mounds a few 
miles west of manama bahrains main city are older this 
particular site dates from the grecoroman period 200 bc200 
ad when the island was called tylos 
for centuries bahrain which is near the persian gulfs western 
shore has been a stoppingoff place for traders merchants 
pirates and armies on the move 
alexander the great never reached bahrain during 13 years of 
conquering the world as he knew it but some of his generals did 
along with skeletal remains the contents of other graves 
escaped pillage over the years one family mound has yielded a 
trove of about 1000 items necklaces glazed pottery and 
glassware some in relatively good condition 
the mounds are rounded cones enclosing burial chambers or grave 
complexes from afar they resemble giant anthills up close they 
are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance 
some rise to about six feet others are at ground level at this 
site the chambers are generally below ground cut into bedrock 
bahrain still has about 100000 known burial mounds 
in 1880 a british officerexplorer el durand wrote in his 
journal mighty mounds bare of vegetation tower above the palm 
groves mass upon mass mound upon mound they stretch on in 
endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to 
the sea 
the 30 tylos mounds of which the family site is one could 
prove important in the study of the tylos civilization sowaileh 
said it shows for example that people of that time made glazed 
pottery 
we also notice a change in burial customs from this period 
he said people are buried clothed their positions are changed 
so they are placed on their backs and put into some kind of 
coffin we didnt see these things before the greeks came to 
bahrain 
he said the discovery of more than 300 silver greek coins some 
bearing the likeness of alexander the great indicate that ancient 
tylos like modern bahrain was a flourishing trade center 
sowaileh surveying the gravesite as he spoke said the 
craftsmanship of such artifacts as the little girl tombstone is 
local 
there are other tombstones very similar to this one that 
have inscriptions in greek and must have been made for the greek 
people living here at the time but they dont have the facial 
representation like this one he said of the little girl in stone 
the little girl from the village had wandered off by now to 
rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound 
her past is only now being discovered

the southern polish mill town of nowa huta 
where thousands of steelworkers went on strike this week for higher 
pay was built in the 1950s to be a model socialist community 
with a population of 220000 people nowa huta the name means 
new steel mill dates from a polish government resolution passed 
in 1949 by the communist government then entering its stalinist 
period 
the governments aim was to build a huge steel plant next to the 
ancient polish capital of krakow then a stronghold of the roman 
catholic intelligentsia class that resisted the communist takeover 
of poland 
peasants from around poland were brought to nowa huta with 
promises of a better life they were to build the town and the 
steel plant and then work in the factory 
the building of the town was celebrated in popular songs of the 
period and portrayed in many polish films including andrzej 
wajdas man of marble about a model socialist worker who 
becomes disillusioned with the system 
today nowa huta is a drab workingclass district which like the 
rest of krakow suffers from heavy pollution from the plant the 
plants 32000 workers mostly live in the community 
at first nowa huta was a separate town but it was incorporated 
as krakows largest district in 1951 
besides the steel plant named after lenin the town features a 
huge monument to the first soviet leader the monument was damaged 
in a 1979 dynamite attack but later was restored by authorities 
until 1977 the town had no church in keeping with its 
modelsocialist image but krakows thenarchbishop cardinal karol 
wojtyla now pope john paul ii worked relentlessly on government 
authorities for permission to build one 
on may 15 1977 he succeeded and consecrated the ultramodern 
church of the holy ark a local landmark and today one of at least 
five churches in nowa huta

irans twin defeats by the iraqis on the 
faw peninsula and the us navy in the persian gulf have undermined 
its strategy that a war of attrition would eventually exhaust iraq 
military analysts say 
time is no longer on our side hashemi rafsanjani irans 
powerful parliament speaker and a member of the supreme defense 
council admitted in a tehran radio interview last week 
thats very indicative that maybe the socalled pragmatists in 
tehran are now going to get the upper hand the iranians have had a 
lot of sense knocked into them in the last few weeks said 
hansheino kopietz a middle east specialist with the londonbased 
international institute for strategic studies 
irans defeats on land and sea last week were their most serious 
in several years and analysts believe tehran needs a spectacular 
operation to regain the initiative in the 7yearold gulf war 
iraqs faw peninsula captured by the iranians in february 1986 
was considered a strategic boon but not vital an iraqi force 
led by units of the elite presidential guards seized the peninsula 
april 1618 
its loss has had a major psychological impact kopietz said 
irans loss of two frigates and a missile boat sunk or disabled 
by the us navy on april 18 in the first serious clash between 
the iranians and americans is considered more important because 
those warships cannot be replaced 
already irans navy suffers a lack of spare parts and missiles 
and most of its major surface ships including two usbuilt 
destroyers are believed nonoperational 
the iranians are having to rethink their whole strategy 
kopietz said in a telephone interview theyve lost the 
initiative in many ways and theyll have to do something to get it 
back the pressure is on them to pull off something spectacular 
kopietz and other western analysts said an escalation in the 
iraqis use of outlawed chemical weapons in recent weeks and a 
sevenweek missile bombardment of iranian cities has also taken its 
toll on iranian morale 
a sustained bombing campaign by iraqs superior air force has 
damaged irans already battered economy prime targets have been 
oil refineries and installations and power plants 
sources in the petroleum industry speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the bombing has cut irans refining capacity by 
about a third 
oil exports irans economic lifeblood have been disrupted by 
iraqi air raids on tankers in the gulf a drop in demand for oil 
and increasingly shaky prices on the world market have eroded oil 
revenue on which the iranians depend to pay for their war effort 
the middle east economic survey a respected oil industry weekly 
newsletter published in cyprus reports that iran has imported 
about 3 million barrels of refined petroleum products such as 
kerosene and aviation gas in recent weeks 
this unprecedented sudden import of gas oil could be due to 
damage inflicted on iranian refineries because of the war the 
newsletter says 
diplomats recently in tehran reported that almost twothirds of 
the countrys factories have been shut down by shortages of raw 
materials and spare parts others are operating at half their 
normal capacity or less 
only factories producing weapons ammunition and other 
warrelated items are working at full tilt they said 
iran is also increasingly isolated diplomatically saudi 
arabias decision on tuesday to sever its longtouchy relations 
with tehran citing terrorism and subversion was another blow 
im sure other arab states in the gulf will follow kopietz 
said despite the war iran relies on countries like the united 
arab emirates for trade and if thats affected it could have very 
serious repercussions 
since april 18 iranian leaders including rafsanjani and 
president ali khamenei have been calling on their countrymen to 
mobilize vowing revenge against iraq the united states and 
reactionary states like saudi arabia and kuwait 
we are prepared to conduct military operations on several 
fronts rafsanjani declared 
but the iranians failed to launch their big winter offensive 
this year triggering speculation that despite boasts of having 
trained 5 million men and women tehran is having recruiting 
problems 
lt gen george b crist the marine officer who commands us 
forces in the region testifed before the senate armed forces 
committee recently that iran was not capable of launching a major 
offensive in the foreseeable future because of manpower and 
materiel problems 
although the iranians outnumber the iraqis threetoone in 
population crist said the fact is that the iraqis right now have 
more men under arms than the iranians do 
but despite the problems the analysts do not believe the 
iranians are likely give up what islamic patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini considers a crusade to crush his longtime 
adversary president saddam hussein of iraq

the grocery cart of the future is here a 
hightech videoequipped gadget that can say hello and offer 
games shopping tips sports scores and heres the catch 
onthespot advertising to the consumer 
were expecting it to make shopping more fun less of a hassle 
and more efficient for consumers said forrest anderson director 
for marketing communications at information resources inc which 
developed the cart 
the chicagobased marketingresearch company spent two years 
inventing the videocart with a liquidcrystaldisplay video screen 
mounted near the kiddie seat to entertain inform and offer a few 
words from the sponsors 
shoppers using iris videocarts will be able to call up store 
maps reserve numbers at the deli counter find out which checkout 
line is shortest play tic tac toe or trivia games to pass the time 
in line and get the time weather forecast or sports scores 
the carts would be provided free to the supermarkets with costs 
paid by advertisers whose commercials could be transmitted 
nationally by satellite to local supermarkets 
the hightech carts are to be testmarketed this fall in three 
stores anderson said one in the chicago area the others in 
cities not yet chosen 
if the testmarketing goes well iri plans to introduce the 
carts in majorcity grocery stores in july 1989 and go national in 
1991 with carts in 10000 supermarkets 
the video screens will be especially encased to make them 
kidproof grapejuiceproof shock and water resistant with 
an alarm system to prevent theft anderson said 
ads will make up about 15 percent of the programming the rest 
will be entertainment and information services 
iri chairman john malec who developed the cart introduced in 
chicago and new york this week called it the most important new 
advertising and promotion medium since television 
using sensors in the aisles an ad for coffee or soda pop can be 
automatically triggered when the cart reaches the area where those 
products are shelved 
the use of instore advertising signs attached to shopping 
carts sales pitches on store sound systems and the like has 
burgeoned in recent years with spending growing 14 percent a year 
over the past decade to an estimated 126 billion last year 
according to industry estimates 
videocart offers the advantage of packaging the ads with 
entertainment said malec 
iri plans to invest 200 million over the next three years in 
developing the system anderson said 
one foodcompany official expressed interest in the carts but 
said he would want to see the testmarket results before making a 
commitment 
ronald frahler retail trade promotion manager for the 
deerfield illbased kitchens of sara lee a major frozen 
bakedgoods producer suggested there might be some confusion as 
shoppers get used to wheeling and viewing 
there is probably going to be some bumping into each other 
said frahler who viewed the cart in chicago 
but he said the concept is fascinating and it seems to be well 
thought out

yuppies who cant afford to have it all are 
calling on a new accessory to tone up their image a fake cellular 
phone thats a dead ringer for the musthave gadget 
we are a statusdriven city theres no doubt about it 
said michelle stein president of neu tech a dallas hightech 
accessory store 
the cellular phoney is a realistic copy of the devices that have 
become standard fixtures in the bmws and mercedes of bigcity 
dealmakers 
at 1595 for the handset and a fake stickon antenna the fake 
phones live up to the advertising slogan of status without the 
static ms stein said 
she said she has sold hundreds of the fake phones in the last 
year although she did not have an exact count 
at art explosion another dallas store offering the cellular 
phoneys business is brisk whenever a new shipment arrives said 
salesman larry cornmesser 
the cellular phoneys are made by faux thats french for 
false systems in los altos calif an estimated 40000 phones 
have been sold many in los angeles another hub of freeway fashion 
but the items do well wherever the real phones are popular 
retailers said 
at three art explosion outlets in dallas several hundred have 
been sold since the christmas season said martha widlus 
spokeswoman at the companys headquarters in ohio 
other fake models also are on the market including just the 
antenna 
although many people are buying the cellular phoneys as gag 
gifts some find the gadgets ring true ms stein said 
its so incredibly reallooking that you have to begin to 
wonder how many people driving around out there with an antenna on 
the back of their car actually have a phony she said 
everybody is hungering for high technology across the board 
but because of cost prohibitions not everybody can have them

the horseradish touted through the 
years for its ability to spice up everything from romance to steak 
grows nowhere quite so well as in the nations horseradish 
capital 
now the proud farmers just across the mississippi river from st 
louis who still cultivate the ugly pungent root that their 
ancestors brought from europe in the 19th century have decided its 
time to celebrate its success 
so theyre sponsoring the first international horseradish 
festival saturday in collinsville complete with contests to see 
who can eat the most horseradishes or throw their roots the 
farthest 
so rich is the soil so perfect the climate so experienced the 
farmers that this little section of southwestern illinois produces 
about 60 percent of the nations horseradish supply 
its a lot of work but its family tradition said craig 
keller 31 a fourth generation horseradish grower its what we 
know how to do and we enjoy it 
the festival saturday is cosponsored by the growers and wryt 
radio 
well have a horseradish rootthrowing contest spoon races 
carrying horseradish and a horseradish eating contest if we can 
find someone willing to participate said kent scheffel general 
manager of wryt radio 
centuries ago claims were made that the white root that can 
grow up to a foot long would stimulate the appetite relieve colic 
rid children of worms and serve as an aphrodisiac now its more 
likely to be served with prime rib 
though actually a member of the mustard family the germans 
called it a sea radish meerrettich many of todays plants 
are from the original european root cuttings 
its like immortality said plant geneticist jack juvik of 
the university of illinois perhaps the only place horseradish 
research is conducted 
growers say the best horseradish burns their tongues and makes 
their eyes water and they love it 
when you smash it with your teeth there is a chemical 
reaction and that makes the heat said keller it gets real 
hot 
most of their crop is bought by companies that grind up the 
roots and bottle them as traditional horseradish sauce 
besides volatile prices there are other problems for the 
growers horseradishes have to be lifted from the soil by hand and 
stripped of secondary roots weeds have to be cultivated manually 
since herbicide companies do not want to develop chemicals for a 
lowvolume crop and machinery has to be built by the farmers 
you dont call john deere and say you want to buy a 
horseradish picker said keller who harvests from 5000 to 
10000 pounds per acre

thousands of destitute migrant workers 
are being victimized by farmers who charge them as much as 400 
each to prepare false immigration papers authorities say 
as many as 25000 migrants dependent on social service agencies 
for food and shelter are in the state unemployed and waiting for 
oregons strawberry harvest the countrys second largest after 
californias to begin about june 1 
under the nations new immigration law most migrants who picked 
crops in the united states for at least 90 days in 198586 may 
qualify as permanent resident aliens and continue to legally enter 
the country to work in future years 
some farmers are preparing fraudulent documents for migrants who 
otherwise would not qualify under the law said david beebe the 
district director of the us immigration and naturalization 
service in portland 
others demand excessive fees to prepare the documents the 
migrants must present to federal authorities to fulfill the laws 
requirements he said 
the immigration service is aware of unscrupulous employers 
who are finding new ways to exploit workers beebe said he 
emphasized however that the majority of strawberry growers treat 
pickers fairly 
beebe declined to comment on what steps his agency is taking to 
deal with the dishonest farmers and their allies including 
printers who can prodcuce false rent receipts and other documents 
the agricultural workers have until nov 30 to file the papers 
after that employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face 
stiff penalties 
the migrants must pay 185 each to apply for amnesty under the 
new law fees for physical examinations pictures and other 
required documents push the cost to near 300 
strawberry farmer doug krahmer said he has heard of growers 
charging as much as 400 additional to prepare the paperwork 
another grower who asked not to be identified said hes heard 
some farmers are charging 250 
krahmer estimated that as many as onefourth of the migrants are 
being charged more than 25 to help defray the costs involved he 
said he charges 20 to process paperwork for migrants seeking 
documentation at his lloydene farms near cornelius 
but matt unger chairman of the oregon strawberry commission 
said he knows of no grower charging more than 25 
the ones i know of charge nothing or a nominal fee he said 
krahmer said labor contractors brokers who sign up and deliver 
the pickers to growers are promising the papers to attract 
workers last year the strawberry crop was harvested early and 20 
percent of the crop was left in the fields because not enough 
workers were in the state 
many pickers say they were told they must turn in their 
documentation by may 4 the deadline for aliens who arent involved 
in agricultural work hundreds of migrant pickers confused by the 
heavily publicized may deadline are rushing to ins offices around 
the state 
the result this year has been an influx of migrants nearly all 
men and teenage boys weeks before the crop is ready to be picked 
typical of these is 14yearold felix lopez who is broke on 
his own and a long way from his home 
speaking in spanish the teenager from ensenada mexico said 
he has never picked strawberries in oregon before but that a 
friend told him growers would sign the papers he needs to keep 
returning here to work 
the rev david e zegar of st alexanders catholic church in 
cornelius said he believes contractors have drawn migrants to 
oregon early by falsely promising to arrange their immigration 
papers the workers stay in labor camps without money food and 
other essentials he said waiting for the strawberries to ripen 
while social service agencies struggle to meet their needs 
i dont think anybody has the right to put people into a 
situation where they have to beg for food and essentials zegar 
said 
at centro cultural the community center in cornelius migrants 
watch spanishlanguage television in the lobby and wait for dinner 
served monday through thursday at 3 pm each day centro cultural 
serves an average of more than 200 free meals of beans potatoes 
and tortillas to the migrants 
the salvation army is meeting the needs of thousands of other 
migrants distributing tons of beans potatoes rice and flour 
the uncertainty over the workforce has led many growers in 
oregon to abandon planting strawberries plantings for next year 
are down 75 percent plantings are up in california the largest 
strawberry producer which has a resident picker population and 
isnt reliant on foreign labor 
last year oregon produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds 
which sold for a record 315 million

the new doyly carte opera company 
was launched on the stage performing the comic gilbert and 
sullivan operas that made the founding company famous for 107 years 
the new company opened a 10day run thursday at the empire 
theater in the northeast england industrial town of sunderland with 
a preview of iolanthe which drew five minutes of applause 
the yeomen of the guard will follow next wednesday 
i thought it went splendidly and i hope to see us touring the 
united states and canada before very long said richard condon 
the companys general manager 
the critics will be at tonights gala relaunch 
the redhot night is friday said theater manager colin 
angus my experience teaches me that you have to have a warmup 
preview to get everything right if you go in cold the chances 
always are that it will go wrong 
fans of librettist sir william s gilbert and composer sir 
arthur sullivan said the production style was a big improvement on 
the original companys last years when it was condemned as old 
and tired by the statefunded arts council the company folded in 
1982 for lack of money when it was refused a subsidy 
the iolanthe plot ludicrous like all the gilbert and 
sullivan works mocks the law and the unelected house of lords in 
parliament as well as the english fancy for putting on robes 
wigs coronets and velvet knee breeches by involving the lord 
chancellor and his fellow peers with the fairy queen and her 
followers 
the pure englishness not even britishness of gilbert and 
sullivan makes their work difficult for a foreigner like me said 
the only american in the 103member company new yorkborn tom 
emlyn williams who sings tenor and baritone 
some of the gilbert rhymes can only be understood by english 
people the operettas have been translated though i can hardly 
believe it he said 
canadian soprano patricia cameron from halifax nova scotia 
said the only problems she encountered were with the fairy wings 
some didnt arrive some wouldnt stand straight and some fell 
off she said 
i felt the long history of the company was a bit of pressure 
on us to do well miss cameron added 
the new company has an office in london but no home angus has 
offered his ornate theater completed in 1907 as a permanent 
touring base 
condon said the two operas for the relaunch have meant an 
investment of about 13 million 
the company was reborn on a bequest from the estate of the 
founders granddaughter dame bridget doyly carte who died in 
1985 plus commercial sponsorship and donations from supporters 
worldwide 
richard doyly carte a victorian impresario started the 
company in 1875 to stage the operettas and built londons savoy 
hotel and savoy theater from the proceeds 
gilbert and sullivan collaborated on 14 works over 25 years 
including the pirates of penzance the mikado and hms 
pinafore 
other companies professional and amateur perform the savoy 
operas as the works are known but the doyly carte company is the 
only one devoted entirely to them

instead of slowing down george shultz is 
stepping on the gas but the determined secretary of state has 
little to show for his vigorous diplomatic efforts in these final 
months of the reagan administration 
he had hoped to open mideast peace talks this sunday in the 
first stage of an ambitious us program aimed at providing some 
measure of selfrule to the 15 million palestinian arabs who live 
on the israeliheld west bank and in gaza 
but despite two trips to the area shultz was unable to persuade 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir or king hussein of jordan to 
accept his proposal 
shultz says he will keep trying and will try to find the time 
to make another personal appeal to the middle east leaders but he 
seems less optimistic than ever before 
on the soviet front shultz is making arrangements for president 
reagans visit to moscow may 29june 2 for a fourth and probably 
final summit meeting with general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
the centerpiece was supposed to be a treaty to halve the soviet 
and us arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons but with only a 
month left the two sides are still far apart on such issues as the 
us strategic defense initiative and how to monitor the reduction 
of mobile missiles and other weapons that are relatively easy to 
conceal 
even the treaty signed at last years washington summit to scrap 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles is still awaiting senate 
approval 
shultz will try again may 1112 in geneva with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze but he appears to be lowering his 
sights to a summit that would be mostly an exchange of views 
between reagan and gorbachev instead of a historic event 
analysts differ on whether gorbachevs decision to withdraw some 
115000 soviet troops from afghanistan is a victory for us 
foreign policy or a decision taken by moscow for its own reasons 
but on other regional fronts there is little opportunity for the 
reagan administration to claim credit 
the soviets are resisting a us plea that they help impose a 
worldwide arms embargo on iran and they decline to accept a benign 
role in a middle east peace conference i didnt achieve any 
breakthrough shultz admitted thursday to a senate appropriations 
subcommittee about his talks last week in moscow 
taking the long view he reminded the senators how cool the 
ussoviet relationship was in 1985 before gorbachev took over 
shultzs human rights pleas now get a respectful hearing and 
even some action jewish emigration hit a 15month high last month 
giving the subject the pride of place on his agenda shultz 
opened his talks with shevardnadze with human rights and kept at it 
for two hours 
in the past the soviets mostly listened impassively to us 
pleas now american and soviet lawyers and psychiatrists are 
holding meetings to discuss the situation 
otherwise though even the climate is worsening 
gorbachev took sharp exception last week to a speech by reagan 
accusing the soviets of aggression and other bad behavior 
he complained the united states was sermonizing as well as 
attributing any improvement in relations to a policy of strength 
shultz tried to minimize the criticism he said there was a 
rhythm to ussoviet relations that had both moments of 
progress and of discord 
other state department officials were privately critical of the 
tough rhetoric in reagans speech they said it had not been 
submitted to the department for review before delivery 
ever loyal though shultz told the senate subcommittee on 
thursday that we must call it as we see it

senate passage of a billiondollar aids 
research and education bill shows that the government has finally 
declared war on the virus and not on the victims supporters 
say 
the senate voted 874 for the 11 billion bill thursday night 
after agreeing unanimously to require aids tests on people 
convicted of state or federal crimes related to sex or intravenous 
drug use 
the focus now shifts to the house where a bill covering 
research on aids is committee but measures addressing other 
portions of the senate legislation have not be introduced 
the senate bill authorizes 665 million for state and federal 
aids education programs increased hiring at the national 
institutes of health a new home health care program for aids 
victims and special efforts to help highrisk minorities and 
intravenous drug abusers a committee aide said openended research 
money would bring total annual spending to about 11 billion 
finally we have declared war on the virus and not on the 
victims in our battle against aids said sen edward m kennedy 
dmass who as chairman of the labor and human resources committee 
spearheaded support for the bill 
victor basile executive director of the human rights campaign 
fund the national political action committee for the gay and 
lesbian community said he was delighted with bill which he 
said for the first time establishes a national policy on aids 
during frequently bitter debate the senate rejected or weakened 
a number of amendments proposed by conservatives several of them 
by sen jesse helms rnc 
the most controversial was helms attempt to renew an expiring 
1987 ban on federal money for educational materials that allegedly 
promote or encourage homosexual activity the ban passed 942 last 
year but some senators said it has hampered public health efforts 
to reach the gay community 
helms drive was fueled by a gayoriented aids education 
videotape he viewed with several senators on wednesday i thought 
that i had seen everything until i saw this video said the north 
carolina republican theres something wrong when federal tax 
dollars are used for this garbage 
but the bills republican cosponsor sen orrin hatch rutah 
told his gop colleague that he ought to consider public health 
concerns and not just moral ones we have to tell homosexuals 
more than simply to become heterosexuals he said 
the senate agreed to the helms amendment but the victory was 
brief lawmakers also voted for a kennedy amendment that said 
nothing in the bill should prevent the dissemination of accurate 
information to people at risk effectively superseding the helms 
provision 
the debate provoked a number of outbursts at one point majority 
leader robert byrd dwva tried to get a quick vote on a 
provision but sen lowell weicker rconn wouldnt let him 
what the hell could be more important than 15 million people 
who are going to die weicker exploded i suggest we should 
just stick to this business and just do it or not do it and go 
home 
homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief 
victims of aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome a fatal 
disease spread through blood blood products or semen as of april 
21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 americans more than 
half of whom have died 
helms was frustrated in several attempts to win an outright ban 
on federal money for programs in which drug addicts exchange shared 
and possibly aidscontaminated needles for clean ones 
the final version says federal money could not be used for 
cleanneedle programs unless the surgeon general concludes they 
help stop drug addiction or the spread of aids a disgusted helms 
said its just a matter of time before federal dollars flow 
toward the programs 
under the testing amendment sponsored by sen don nickles 
rokla aids tests would be mandatory for those convicted of sex 
or drug crimes carrying a penalty of at least a year in prison 
results would be confidential but could be disclosed to prison 
wardens or victims of sex crimes 
the reagan administration announced last year it would test new 
immigrants and the senate later put its stamp of approval on the 
policy the defense department tests all 21 million men and women 
on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the 
justice department said last october that it would test some 
federal prisoners 
senators voting against the aids bill were helms william 
armstrong rcolo james mcclure ridaho and malcolm wallop 
rwyo not voting were sens joseph biden ddel david boren 
dokla lawton chiles dfla daniel evans rwash david 
karnes rneb jay rockefeller dwva paul simon dill john 
stennis dmiss steve symms ridaho 
despite the bills approval kennedy said it only the first step 
toward a national aids policy that also must address sensitive 
testing and discrimination questions 
the total effort has to include testing confidentiality and 
antidiscrimination provisions he said we begin work on those 
tomorrow

in the bustling and often chaotic seafood 
industry neal workman casts a widening net for what might be the 
most prized catch of all buyers who refuse to pay up 
workmans work has taken him on predawn visits to ramshackle 
back offices in new york citys tough fulton fish market where 
prudent debt collectors seldom venture in an industry notorious for 
its proliferation of deadbeats 
bullhorn in hand workman has brazenly entered crowded seafood 
restaurants at the height of the lunch hour to announce to patrons 
that the fish on their plates may not have been paid for 
its the no 1 problem in the industry says the former debt 
collector and sales representative for dun amp bradstreet inc who 
has carved out a fastgrowing and profitable new business debt 
management services 
fish is in such demand its so popular that its not hard to 
sell its certainly not hard to sell a maine lobster the hard 
part is to get paid for it 
part of the problem is that seafood is a perishable commodity 
whose value is at its highest when it hits the dock and then 
diminishes rapidly 
to get the most for their product before the value drops they 
have to move it very quickly and that means they take unusual 
risks workman explained 
theyll sell to people knowing theres maybe only a 5050 
chance theyll get paid as opposed to a 100 percent chance that 
the fish will spoil and become a nonsaleable item 
because sellers are reluctant to communicate with each other for 
fear of losing a competitive edge unscrupulous restaurateurs and 
wholesalers have been known to switch from supplier to supplier in 
order to avoid ever having to pay their accounts due workman says 
to combat such practices debt management semimonthly publishes 
seascan a continuously updated list of hundreds of seafood 
markets restaurants wholesalers brokers and distributors who are 
in arrears on their debts 
the publication about 50 pages long consists of yellow pages 
with the names of buyers whose payments are at least 30 days past 
due red pages listing buyers whose accounts have been referred to 
the company for collection and white pages tagged the rubber 
sheet which lists buyers whose checks have bounced 
yellow is slow red has stopped workman explains 
everyone who has stopped paying his bills slowed down first 
seascan is distributed to his companys more than 200 clients 
ranging from salmon harvesters in scotlands shetland islands to 
catfish producers in the mississippi delta to shrimp importers on 
the west coast 
a seller who purchases the seascan report and becomes a debt 
management client can refer past due accounts to workmans company 
which receives a percentage of the overdue receivables it collects 
in addition to a 2500 a year membership fee 
the 33yearold nyack ny native who began the business 
three years ago in his home today has 17 employees and subsidiary 
offices in boston and seattle he says his clients are among the 
largest in the industry accounting for nearly half the dollar 
volume of seafood sold in the us market 
workman hasnt emerged unscathed from deadbeat raids he recalls 
the time three fish cutters grabbed him by the jacket at a seafood 
wholesalers in pompano beach fla and tossed him unceremoniously 
onto the sidewalk 
but while inside the establishment workman had spotted some 
boxes bearing the name of one of his major clients he immediately 
telephoned the client and apprised him of the situation the 
client in turn called the wholesaler and threatened to cut off 
future shipments if he didnt pay the debt 
waiting for workman when he returned was an apology and a check 
for 15000

congressional investigators are portraying 
drexel burnham lambert inc as a greedy firm that elbowed its own 
clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues of 
highyield highrisk junk bonds 
but drexel chief executive frederick h joseph in 6 hours of 
testimony thursday before the investigations subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee steadfastly defended the 
firms practice of permitting employees to form private 
partnerships to compete with other investors for bonds underwritten 
by drexel 
under questioning from rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
both the committee and subcommittee joseph acknowledged the 
perception of a conflict is troublesome 
still he said drexel not only condones the partnerships but 
believes they benefit corporate bond issuers by making more money 
available to buy the bonds 
however documents released by the subcommittee showed that on 
several occasions drexel employees purchased bonds from muchsought 
issues for their own accounts at the same time the firms public 
customers were being turned away 
in the case of texstyrene corp a phoenix ariz manufacturer 
of styrofoam products partnerships owned by drexel employees 
purchased 12 million of an initial 50 million offering in 
february 1986 according to the subcommittee 
public customers were allowed to buy only some of the bonds they 
wanted and within 17 days drexel employees made more than 900000 
profits by selling the bonds back to drexel subcommittee documents 
indicate 
in another case the subcommittee said drexel employees 
purchased 235 million of a 25 billion issue in the april 1986 
leveraged buyout of beatrice cos a diversified food and consumer 
products company 
again other customers were denied the chance to purchase as 
many bonds as they had initially ordered and less than three 
months later the employees made a 28 million profit by selling 
614 million of the bonds the subcommittee said 
any way you slice it the people on the outside arent getting 
the same deal as the people on the inside said rep ron wyden 
dore 
rep dennis e eckart dohio said drexel in effect elbowed 
aside its own customers and cut to the head of the line he 
said a telephone survey of five top competitors of drexel whom he 
declined to identify showed that none would permit similar 
practices 
joseph said it is quite common that investors will want to buy 
more bonds than are available and said drexel used the same 
criteria for deciding how many bonds employees could purchase as it 
did for its other customers 
he said purchases by drexel employees are closely monitored for 
propriety by the firms compliance department 
however rep norman lent of new york ranking republican on 
committee said the purchases for insider accounts appear to 
violate the regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
and the national association of securities dealers 
joseph argued that the rules applied only to sales of stock 
because bond prices are not subject to manipulation in the same way 
as are prices of new stock issues 
lent said highquality investmentgrade bonds are exempt from 
the rules but not the risky bonds of the type drexel issued 
the subcommittee released a list of 35 socalled insider 
accounts owned by employees including michael milken chief of 
drexels junk bond trading unit in beverly hills calif and 
relatives of milken 
also listed as having participated in the partnerships are 
dennis levine a former investment banker now serving a prison term 
for securities law violations and martin siegel who also has 
pleaded guilty to violations of securities laws 
both are former drexel employees and have cooperated in 
government probes of wall street corruption 
milken in a subcommittee appearance wednesday cited his 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination in refusing to 
answer questions he confirmed that he has been under investigation 
for 18 months by a new york federal grand jury that is reported to 
be probing insider trading 
both drexel and milken have denied any wrongdoing 
milken pioneered use of junk bonds to allow companies without a 
track record of earnings to get financing based on whether they had 
sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts the bonds pay higher 
interest rates than those of established companies and are 
considered riskier investments

the chief author of the nations landmark 
immigration law says illegal aliens better apply for amnesty by 
next wednesdays deadline because a senate vote has ended any 
chance for an extension 
this is it sen alan simpson rwyo said thursday night 
after helping to kill a plan that would have moved the deadline to 
nov 30 this extraordinary act of grace will end may 4 when we 
are in recess 
those who sought to move the date back nearly seven months were 
defeated when they tried to end debate by opponents of the 
extension only 40 votes could be mustered to end the budding 
filibuster and 60 were needed 
with the senate adjourning today until may 9 supporters of the 
extension have no chance to try to pick up another 20 votes 
even if the extension had passed congress sen phil gramm 
rtexas said president reagan would have vetoed the bill as 
suggested by commissioner alan c nelson of the immigration and 
naturalization service 
the house passed the amnesty extension april 21 by a 213201 
vote indicating that a veto would have been sustained there a 
twothirds vote is needed for an override 
simpson was the chief sponsor of the 1986 law passed to control 
years of massive illegal immigration to the united states the 
measure had two main portions legalization for illegal aliens who 
came to the united states before jan 1 1982 and have lived here 
continually since then and financial penalties for employers who 
knowingly hired illegal residents 
the aliens were given a oneyear period through may 4 to apply 
for temporary residency and start down the longer road toward 
permanent residency and citizenship 
about 13 million applications have been received so far and 
the approval rate is running about 95 percent according to ins 
figures 
those who opposed the extension argued that supporters of the 
change played a cruel hoax on illegal aliens by proposing 
legislation that had no chance of enactment 
officials of the senate judiciary immigration subcommittee said 
thursday that people have been calling daily asking how long the 
extension would last 
even before the vote the ins anticipated it would be swamped as 
the deadline approaches the agency has already announced that any 
alien who shows up before the deadline can file an application now 
and produce the supporting documents later 
offices will officially be open until midnight wednesday and 
the ins said anyone in line will be permitted to file an 
application 
applicants have to pay a fee of 185 for individuals and 420 
for a family 
gramm said illegal aliens who fail to beat the deadline will 
lose the opportunity to get the best gift america has to be in 
the united states legally 
after an initial period when the law was taken seriously the 
level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last 
year he said when people are asked why they are coming they 
say they dont believe the law is going to be enforced 
gramm added that the border patrol is finding a large increase 
in the use of false documents by illegal aliens 
sen alan cranston dcalif who argued for the extension 
predicted that hundreds of thousands of eligible aliens would not 
apply by next wednesday 
there has been a cloud of confusion encircling this program 
since its inception cranston said the regulations defining 
who is eligible for legalization were finalized days before the 
application period opened 
ins public education campaign got off to a slow start and has 
been ineffective in convincing the undocumented in certain 
communities such as the asian pacific community in los angeles 
to come forward he said 
but simpson gramm and others said the original bill was 
carefully balanced between the amnesty and employer sanctions 
programs and should not be unraveled now

alarmed by the growing number of latchkey 
children thrust upon them the nations public librarians are 
shelving their normally quiet roles and clamoring for better day 
care and afterschool programs 
librarians have to become political animals says sue 
rosenzweig of the university of north carolinas center for early 
adolescence weve got to take care of our kids 
their pleas along with proposed solutions are being presented 
in a 50page policy paper today at the public library associations 
national conference 
were really the voice of the children said jody stefansson 
of san marino calif 
the public librarys image as a safe friendly educational and 
costfree haven has made it hardest hit by the growing number of 
latchkey children 
like many childrens librarians ms stefansson regularly finds 
herself serving as policeman caretaker referee and nurse forty 
to 60 children as young as firstgraders descend upon her every 
weekday afternoon many of them instructed to do so by their 
working parents 
the parents think their children are really reading and 
thats the biggest myth she said thursday during the fourday 
conference which ends saturday 
the youngsters keep pouring in despite ms stefanssons 
successful work with community groups to offer better afterschool 
care shes even developed a network of babysitters for working 
parents 
i dont want to be a surrogate parent she said 
noise is up and graffiti is commonplace at many libraries say 
leaders of the 6000member public library association a division 
of the american library association 
skateboards whiz through reference rooms bicycles clutter the 
halls flowers are trampled and parking lots are pickup and dropoff 
stations 
its hard for the library to close when the parents dont get 
there in time to pick up their kids said susan goldberg 
president of the public library association 
what were concerned about are those children who cant 
leave who are not happy being there agreed steven herb of the 
dauphin county library system in harrisburg pa we can only go 
so far in trying to provide a good program a good attitude the 
right helping hand the smile 
by no means are librarians yearning for quiet empty space 
having lots of kids in a library is something a librarian 
loves they encourage it thats what were there for ms 
goldberg said were looking at the issue on the broader basis 
can or should public libraries be daycare centers 
the groups policy paper six months in the making urges 
librarians to ask community leaders and agencies to develop more 
afterschool programs it will be presented to the plas executive 
committee in may then go before the board of directors in july for 
final approval 
while not confined to libraries the situation is symptomatic 
of a bigger problem involving child neglect and sometimes even 
abuse said helen blank director of child care for the childrens 
defense fund in washington 
during the early 1970s some 30 percent of children under age 6 
had a mother who worked outside the home ms blank said current 
estimates put that figure at 54 percent and the number is 
increasing 
mary k chelton of rockville md primary author of the plas 
policy paper worries that latchkey children may grow up to become 
adults who never want to see another library in the meantime 
she says theyre missing out on quality time with family or 
skilled child care supervisors 
its not a question of whos supposed to take care of the 
kids ms rosenzweig said its a question of lost 
opportunity

john sasso who resigned as michael dukakis top 
aide after embarrassing his boss with an attack video aimed at 
a rival candidate is still in contact with the democratic 
frontrunner and some predict he would have a top job in a dukakis 
white house 
mike and i are good friends and as he has said we still 
talk from time to time discuss things sasso said in a brief 
telephone conversation this week but i have no active role with 
the campaign 
he wouldnt say what he and dukakis discuss except that their 
talks include campaignrelated issues he said the two have not 
discussed potential running mates for dukakis the democratic 
frontrunner 
aides say sasso is in weekly contact with the candidate sasso 
however has no formal role in the campaign 
this is the way it has to be sasso said 
now working at a boston advertising and public relations firm 
sasso declined further comment saying he is not granting 
interviews about the campaign 
he resigned his job as manager of the dukakis campaign after 
admitting he gave reporters a videotape that showed democratic 
rival joseph biden giving a speech patterned on one by british 
politician neil kinnock without giving kinnock credit 
that along with revelations that biden had exaggerated his 
academic record eventually drove the delaware senator to drop out 
of the race 
the incident caused a furor and became an issue in the primary 
campaign former democratic candidate richard gephardt in a 
lastditch drive before the super tuesday contacts put an ad on 
the air that said in part mike dukakis smeared joe biden 
and now hes attempting to smear dick gephardt 
dukakis is known for his caution and aides say there has been no 
discussion of bringing sasso back into the campaign 
if dukakis were the democratic nominee running against george 
bush sassos presence in the campaign could hamper any dukakis 
effort to bring up the socalled sleaze factor the long list 
of reagan administration officials accused of wrongdoing 
but some dukakis aides say privately that they would not be 
surprised to see sasso back at dukakis side if he won the november 
election perhaps as white house chief of staff 
dukakis and sasso have a long history together and sasso has 
helped see dukakis through some dark days sasso helped dukakis 
return from political exile four years after he was voted out of 
the governors office in 1978 
dukakis met sasso a few days after that 1978 loss keeping a 
promise he had made to assist a referendum drive that sasso 
managed sasso impressed that dukakis had kept his word despite 
the crushing defeat offered to help dukakis if he ever ran for 
office again 
he managed dukakis successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign and 
became dukakis chief aide at the statehouse where he was credited 
with helping the governor mend fences with legislators and interest 
groups alienated in his first term 
sasso who took a leave from his statehouse post to manage 
geraldine ferraros unsuccessful 1984 vice presidential campaign 
was among the first to urge dukakis to run for president he 
brought in veterans from ferraros staff and that of former vice 
president walter mondale when he assembled the dukakis campaign 
the attack video incident was particularly embarrassing 
because it came at a time when dukakis was urging rivals in the 
thencrowded democratic field to wage positive campaigns 
to compound the problem sasso acknowledged his role in the 
episide only after dukakis said publicly he did not believe his 
campaign was responsible for distributing the tapes 
and dukakis appeared indecisive after sassos admission at 
first saying he did not want to fire him finally though he 
acknowledged that john has to go 
sassos assistant susan estrich was promoted to campaign 
manager 
estrich who worked with sasso in 1984 and is a member of the 
democratic national committee also consults periodically with her 
friend and former boss 
i chat with him occassionally about how things are going 
estrich said but i think john realizes that the strength of this 
campaign is the candidate

strong wind and rising tides hampered 
the cleanup of a 175000gallon oil spill and posed a new threat to 
a fragile bird sanctuary where nearly 200 oilsoaked birds and 
animals have died 
the good news is the oil is no longer getting out of peyton 
slough where 80 percent of it was trapped but the bad news is 
that whats out there in the strait and bays is going to get 
swirled around a bit by nature coast guard spokesman dave 
zawadzki said thursday 
meanwhile a state water quality engineer speculated the size of 
shell oil cos spill may be even larger than the 175000 gallons 
estimated by the company the spill occurred saturday when a 
drainpipe that carries off rainwater broke inside an oil tank 
allowing oil to be siphoned out 
so far workers have recovered some 126000 gallons of the san 
joaquin crude a particularly thick oil from the area 40 miles 
northeast of san francisco the coast guard said 
because much of the oil remains in peyton slough and nearby 
marshes kazemi hossain an engineer with the state regional water 
quality control board told reporters he expects shell will 
revise upwards their spill estimate after we do our own 
calculations 
earlier thursday westerly winds up to 25 mph and increasingly 
higher tides pushed up to 1600 gallons of oil out of remote 
sloughs into the carquinez strait and into still more waterfowl 
nesting areas similar gusts were expected today national weather 
service forecasters said 
by the weekend easterly winds and exceptionally high weekend 
tides peaking about 5 feet are likely to send still more oil 
into uncontaminated areas zawadzki said 
eight skimmer boats on thursday began removing new oilsheen 
patches stretching six miles from martinez marina where 400 boats 
were trapped in the oily harbor to ryer island where the the oil 
got into nesting areas 
some 450 oily waterfowl and animals have been recovered of 
those 192 have died or were dead when discovered according to 
brian hunter regional manager of the state fish and game 
department 
the coast guard advised sport fishing and recreational boats 
owners to stay out of suisun bay over the weekend where several 
oil sheens were spotted the bay is about 40 miles northeast of san 
francisco 
boat skippers many of whom make a living by taking out weekend 
parties of sports fishermen were upset they would not be allowed 
out to sea sunday for the opening of the salmon season they also 
could not leave the marina for the sacramentosan joaquin delta 
where steelhead trout are approaching the peak of their spawning 
season 
this is going to be a big blow to a lot of old timers around 
here because they count on getting out to sea and getting a good 
catch early in the season when they can get the best price said 
angelo torliano 74 whose son operates a family fishing business

robust export demand and failure to add to the 
fleet since 1982 have caused a shortage of railroad cars to move 
wheat and corn says a transportation official with the agriculture 
department 
although the car shortages appear to have eased in recent days 
steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch that 
occurred earlier this year martin fitzpatrick jr head of the 
departments office of transportation said thursday 
fitzpatrick also defended usda export policies and programs 
which have helped trigger a rebound in farm commodity exports 
a study released by fitzpatrick showed a severe disruption of 
grain shipments in the united states this year through midapril 
because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads 
the study was requested by reps jim slattery dkan and 
virginia smith rneb fitzpatrick said he planned to cite the 
study further at a hearing on monday may 2 in kansas city mo 
conducted by a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
fitzpatrick said the actual number of cars available for grain 
movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last 
significant number was added to the railroad fleet 
also there has been a large surge in export wheat sales under 
the departments export enhancement program or eep during the 
past few months big sales to the soviet union in particular have 
added to the railroad grain traffic 
under eep exporters can sell wheat or other designated 
commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and 
then collect subsidies from usda in the form of governmentowned 
surplus grain or other agricultural products 
fitzpatrick said car shortages meant some local elevators were 
unable to take delivery of grain from farmers grain merchants had 
difficulty completing sales and railroads hiked rates and 
restricted use of cars in certain markets 
also he said the departments commodity credit corp 
received limited response to its weekly auctions of surplus 
wheat because of the car shortages 
fitzpatrick was asked by a reporter whether the rail car 
shortages had interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the 
extent that ships were kept waiting for grain to load 
we do not believe that to be the case as a general rule he 
said but there may have been some specific circumstances what 
that happened in the last six months its not a trend it is not 
a significant problem down the road fitzpatrick said 
although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has 
improved the last 10 days fitzpatrick noted that export demand has 
slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased also he said 
railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies 
and many of those now are being reconciled 
fitzpatrick said that it will take pressure from congress farm 
groups the grain trade and usda to settle the rail car situation 
ideally he said shippers and the railroads should sit down under 
auspices of the interstate commerce commission and resolve the 
problems 
the icc he said has the authority to force a settlement 
fitzpatrick was asked if he thought the icc was dragging its feet 
all i would say to you is the icc has full authority to 
resolve this issue he said its been almost six years that 
they have had it on their table so you draw your own conclusion

farm policy could be improved worldwide by 
making government support to farmers independent of acreage and 
production levels says the national center for food and 
agricultural policy 
this policy of decoupling would lead to more efficient 
production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when 
compared to current farm policies the center reported thursday 
some form of decoupling for american farmers has been advocated 
unsuccessfully in congress for a number of years one example would 
be to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits 
without tying them to specific acreage or production levels 
as defined by the center a part of the independent nonprofit 
washingtonbased think tank resources for the future decoupling 
would mean providing government support to farmers in ways that 
do not distort production prices consumption resource allocation 
or trade 
decoupling doesnt set well with some farm groups the national 
farmers union for example says it is tantamount to putting 
farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for 
price supports 
a statement issued by nfu at its recent annual convention said 
farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost 
of producing food these payments are actually subsidies to 
consumers that pass through the hands of farmers

two ballets with music composed by pulitzer 
prizewinners for the new york city ballets american music 
festival were premiered this week at the new york state theater 
charles wuorinen who won the pulitzer for music in 1970 
conducted thursday nights premiere of his five written for 
cello and orchestra cello soloist fred sherrys part was often 
spiky without obvious melody or beat but always listenable 
jeanpierre bonnefoux a member of the new york city ballet from 
1970 to 80 and chairman of indiana universitys dance department 
since 1985 choreographed in neoclassic style 
he has his men in gray and women in silvergray and he moves 
them in diagonal patterns and wedge shapes when jock soto lifted 
maria calegari she seemed to float michael byars and damian 
woetzel had some high jumping and several times danced with seven 
women around them 
wednesday night saw the premiere of tanzspiel by ellen 
taaffe zwilich who won the pulitzer prize for music in 1983 the 
companys coballet master in chief peter martins choreographed 
this plotless dance lacked that inner pulse that makes one 
movement seem to follow another logically 
tanzspiel had some lovely romantic dancing for kyra nichols 
and lindsay fischer martins proved again that he knows how to fill 
a stage with dancers but tanzspiel doesnt flow the music is 
ominous much of the time and fischer often has grim movements in 
dim light there were exits where applause obviously was expected 
but there wasnt any 
also wednesday the company beautifully danced glass pieces 
choreographed by jerome robbins to philip glass glass pieces 
makes a better impression with each viewing miss nichols and soto 
danced with superlative virtuosity in stars and stripes george 
balanchines choreography to john philip sousa 
thursdays program began with jubilee danced by fresh 
proficient students at the school of american ballet joseph 
duells choreography to hershy kays music was charming but 
repetitious he should have used less of the music 
calcium light night is a series of dazzling modern solos 
choreographed by martins in 1977 to music by charles ives soto and 
heather watts were the impressive performers the evening ended 
with the dazzling darci kistler and robert lafosse convincing as a 
tapdancer starring in balanchines dance to richard rodgers

arizonas attorney general said thursday 
that the state cannot pay former gov evan mechams 200000 legal 
bill from his impeachment trial without a new law authorizing such 
action 
legislators said thursday they almost certainly will not pass 
such a law 
a spokeswoman in mechams office said the former republican 
governor would not comment on the nonbinding opinion issued by 
attorney general bob corbin also a republican until mecham and 
his lawyers had a chance to review it 
two days after mechams removal april 4 in a senate impeachment 
trial the senate voted 1613 to pay 202433 to his attorneys 
fred craft and jerris leonard at the time supporters said it was 
a healing gesture 
but state treasurer ray rottas balked at writing the check and 
asked corbin for an opinion on whether the payment was permitted 
there is no authority to pay evan mechams costs and 
attorneys fees corbin concluded however he told reporters 
that the state could pay mechams expenses if a new law were passed 
to authorize it 
we are not going to pass in my estimation anything in either 
house said gop sen john mawhinney 
house speaker joe lane also a republican said house 
republicans were not enthusiastic about paying either the legal 
fees or mechams recall expenses 
the former governor has asked the state to pay him 231000 for 
his campaign costs before a may 17 recall vote aimed at his removal 
was canceled 
mecham was convicted by the senate of trying to thwart a death 
threat investigation and misusing 80000 by loaning it to his auto 
dealership he faces a criminal trial may 19 on charges of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan

the house and senate appeared headed for a 
fight over arms control restrictions opposed by president reagan as 
the two democraticcontrolled chambers work on versions of a 
pentagon budget bill 
the house voted thursday to ban all but the smallest us 
nuclear tests the third restriction approved in two days as the 
chamber works on its version of a defense bill 
but the senate armed services committee which finished work 
thursday on its version includes only one restriction that reagan 
doesnt want 
that would ban any star wars tests that violate the narrow 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
that limit was approved by the house along with the restriction 
on most nuclear tests and a prohibition against any nuclear 
weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified salt ii 
nuclear arms treaty neither of the last two is in the senate 
measure 
when the two bills are passed separately by the house and 
senate they will be sent to a housesenate conference committee to 
reconcile differences 
in some ways were more liberal than the senate or at least 
the liberals are more powerful here explained rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
both bills authorize pentagon spending of 2995 billion in the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 that was the total set last december 
in the budget summit between congress and reagan to reduce the 
federal budget deficit 
the total was 33 billion less than the pentagon had originally 
thought it would receive in the next fiscal year to meet the lower 
figure defense secretary frank carlucci ordered cuts in manpower 
along with the early retirement of 16 navy frigates 
he took some tough decisions and made hard choices and we 
supported him in our budget said sen sam nunn dga chairman 
of the senate armed services committee 
aspin agreed carlucci made a lot of tough choices and thats 
why the pentagon fared pretty well in our committee we didnt cut 
much

<TEXT>
voted 214186 to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons 
larger than one kiloton the decision came after the house passed 
3990 a republicanbacked amendment praising reagans effort to 
negotiate limits on testing 
a similar ban was also approved a year ago by the house but was 
dropped by the housesenate conference committee and ended up as 
only an advisory request 
rep richard gephardt dmo said we owe it to our children 
to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests but rep 
william broomfield rmich said the restriction would totally 
undercut our negotiators he referred to ongoing ussoviet 
talks 
voted down 205197 an antisatellite asat ban which was 
proposed for a fourth year but the panel also turned down 
212195 a proposal to spend 100 million for development of a 
groundbased antisatellite weapon 
the asat limit had been imposed by congress the past three years 
and the pentagon responded by dropping work on the program to 
develop an asat weapon fired from a highflying f15 jet the air 
force is now working on different types of asats particularly 
those using groundbased lasers 
another difference between the two bills is over how much to 
authorize for the strategic defense initiative as star wars is 
formally known 
the senate panel recommended 46 billion for sdi the house 
bill provides 40 billion although that figure may change when 
the issue is debated next week on the floor 
currently sdi receives 39 billion and reagan had sought 48 
billion for the next fiscal year

a justice department official denies he tried 
to taint the irancontra investigation by pressing congressional 
testimony about the shredding of sensitive documents on an 
investigator for independent counsel lawrence walsh 
in a letter to walsh william bradford reynolds said thursday 
his fleeting reference to the immunized congressional testimony 
of fired national security council aide oliver north in front of 
one of walshs investigators was wholly inadvertent 
reynolds did not identify the testimony but justice department 
sources say it concerns norths statements that he shredded 
sensitive documents in the presence of reynolds and another aide to 
attorney general edwin meese iii reynolds has publicly denied that 
portion of norths testimony 
reynolds said the mention of norths testimony was prompted by a 
question from the investigator judith hetherton an associate 
counsel on the independent counsels staff 
in testimony that reynolds wrote he was startled to read 
walsh said in federal court wednesday at the pretrial taint 
hearing in the irancontra scandal that hetherton had to use 
forceful language to cut off reynolds as he started to relate 
some of norths testimony 
she really had to be energetic to get him to stop testified 
walsh 
reynolds flatly rejected walshs characterization 
the exchange with hetherton took a minute or two in normal 
conversational tones and neither of us interrupted neither 
her language nor mine ever approached being forceful or even 
remotely impolite reynolds said in the letter 
the fact is that my fleeting reference to something that came 
up during norths congressional testimony last summer was in 
response to a question by hetherton just before reynolds 
subsequent grand jury appearance reynolds wrote 
as soon as i answered she advised me that i should not 
discuss with her or the grand jury any immunized congressional 
testimony and i instantly apologized assuring her that my 
reference had been wholly inadvertent said reynolds the 
counselor to meese 
by law walsh must convince the judge in the case that the 
indictments of north and three others was obtained independently of 
immunized congressional testimony 
north and two of the defendants in the case are trying to use 
their immunity grants as a way of getting the indictments 
dismissed north former national security adviser john poindexter 
retired air force maj gen richard secord and albert hakim 
secords business partner are under indictment for conspiracy 
theft and fraud charges 
james wieghart a spokesman for walsh had no comment on 
reynolds letter 
north testified that he shredded sensitive documents while 
reynolds and another meese aide thenchief of staff john 
richardson were in norths office reviewing his files during a 
weekend inquiry in november 1986 
the inquiry led to the uncovering of the diversion to the 
contras of money from the reagan administrations secret arms sales 
to iran norths testimony raised the suggestion of incompetence by 
the attorney generals staff or of a possible coverup to which 
meeses staff acquiesced

a consumer group contends that quaker oats co 
advertisements overstate the benefit of the companys cereal 
products in reducing the risk of heart attacks 
the center for science in the public interest filed a complaint 
thursday seeking a federal trade commission order to halt a 
magazine advertising campaign for quaker oats and oat bran 
a quaker spokesman said the company has ample evidence to 
support its claim that eating oat cereal helps reduce cholesterol 
a major cause of heart disease 
scientific research documents the effect that oats can have 
spokesman ron bottrell said were confident with the claims that 
have been made 
the ads which feature actor wilford brimley recommend lowering 
fat intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet 
the center objected to one section saying that clinical studies 
show serumcholesterol dropped an average of nearly 10 percent 
among people who ate quaker oats daily as part of a lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet 
quaker is grossly exaggerating said bruce silverglade 
legal director for the nonprofit advocacy group the brimley ads 
make the reader believe that quaker oats are some type of magic 
wand 
in fact most of the improvement in the health of individuals 
who eat quaker oats was due to also eating a lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet 
he said oat cereal by itself accounted for only a 3 percent 
cholesterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in 
the risk of heart disease a modest to minimal improvement of 
borderline significance 
a heartdisease specialist at the national heart lung and blood 
institute in bethesda md said he had not seen the ads and did 
not want to take sides 
nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that 
amount dr basil rifkind said on the other hand if you look 
at it in population terms we usually say that even small 
reductions in cholesterol could be meaningful 
commission spokeswoman dee ellison said the ftc had no immediate 
comment on the complaint

the american red cross is right on target 
with plans to start testing donated blood for a rare virus linked 
to a vicious form of adult leukemia says the national cancer 
institute researcher who first discovered the virus 
dr robert gallo a scientist credited with discovering the 
human tlymphotropic virus type 1 or htlv1 said the nations 
blood supply should be tested to protect future generations from 
the slowacting but dangerous virus 
in a science magazine report published today red cross 
scientist recommended that blood donated across the country should 
be tested for the htlv1 virus as soon as a practical test be 
developed the recommendation was made after a red cross survey 
found 10 units infected with the virus out of 39898 units tested 
i think there are as many people infected with this virus as 
are infected with the aids virus gallo said 
alan e williams a research scientist at the red cross 
laboratory in rockville md said his research team estimates that 
the risk of becoming infected with the htlv1 leukemia virus is 
about 2800 in 12 million or about 1 chance in 4286 for every 
unit of blood transfused annually 
the danger is minimal but not insignificant williams said 
for that reason he said the red cross wants to take an 
active stance to keep the situation from getting worse as it 
possibly could 
williams said current methods of testing donated blood for the 
virus take up to three days and a more practical test must be 
developed before htlv1 screening can begin 
he said at least three drug companies which he declined to 
name are trying to develop screening tests but these are months 
from possible approval by the food and drug administration 
the nci researcher discovered and identified the htlv1 virus in 
1978 gallo said his understanding of htlv1 a retrovirus that 
takes over genetic control of cells it attacks led him to look for 
a retrovirus as the cause of aids he is credited as codiscoverer 
of the hiv virus that causes aids 
gallo said htlv1 may be rare in the continental united states 
but it is endemic in parts of europe alaska africa and the orient 
in time due to increased travel and increased sexual contact 
these kinds of virus are all increasing in the continental 
us said gallo because htlv1 has a long latent period before 
it causes disease he said it is not as readily seen as aids 
but our children and our childrens children will see it if we 
dont start eliminating it from the blood supply 
gallo added im very glad to see the way the red cross has 
responded 
dr edward murphy a national cancer institute researcher who 
has studied the htlv1 virus extensively said it is linked to 
adult tcell leukemialymphoma a type of blood cancer usually 
fatal within six months 
another disease closely linked to the virus said murphy is 
tropical spastic paraparesis in which the virus attacks nerve 
cells that control the lower extremities and causes paralysis and 
eventually death 
the incubation period for expression of the leukemia is thought 
to be 30 years or more but people exposed to the virus become 
infectious within two weeks to six months said murphy incubation 
for paraparesis is slightly shorter 
the virus can be spread in ways similar to the aids virus by 
sexual contact or the exchange of body fluids such as by sharing 
drug needles htlv1 also is thought to be spread through mothers 
milk said murphy 
williams said the red cross survey checked for htlv1 in samples 
from eight different blood banks blood donors who tested positive 
for the virus were found in atlanta washington birmingham ala 
and los angeles 
blood also was tested in st paul minn portland ore 
baltimore and miami but no htlv1 was found 
though the positive tests totaled only 10 out of more than 
39000 samples tested williams said a highly selective group 
was used they go through several levels of screening before 
the blood is ever drawn he said

the executor for liberaces estate said 
he authorized the marketing of a ceramic decanter in the late 
entertainers image and a dog calendar to capitalize on liberaces 
name after his death 
since mr liberace loved dogs i thought it would be a good 
idea for his fans to have a dog calendar so we made a deal joel 
strote testified thursday in a civil lawsuit filed by five liberace 
associates seeking to remove strote as executor of an estate valued 
as high as 20 million 
strote a beverly hills lawyer said he agreed to market the 
items so that more money could be made for the liberace foundation 
for the performing arts which provides scholarships for students 
at 22 colleges 
in addition strote said that in february 1987 he conceived the 
idea of an auction of liberace memorabilia liberace died feb 5 
1987 of complications from aids 
i wanted to strike while the iron was hot he said if i 
could help make this auction a fabulous event the foundation would 
gain worldwide attention 
the auction in los angeles earlier this month grossed slightly 
over 2 million and featured furnishings and memorabilia from 
liberace homes in new york citys trump tower las vegas los 
angeles palm springs and lake tahoe 
the state civil suit was filed by the entertainers sister 
angie liberace seymour heller his manager for 37 years 
housekeepers dorothy mcmahon and gladys luckie and cary james 
liberaces companion for seven years 
the five charge that strote drew up a will and trust agreements 
with liberace then had him sign them 13 days before his death 
strote contends liberace was well enough to know what he was doing 
but the entertainers former nurse disputed that contention in 
testimony wednesday 
strote said tuesday that his firm had been paid about 400000 
from the estate in a 13month period and that he would be paid his 
normal retainer while involved in the current case 
the attorney for the plaintiffs harold gewerter complained 
thursday that strotes attorneys were dragging out the current 
hearing while strote was being paid 250 an hour as a witness

a 20yearold drug available without 
prescription in mexico and japan puts up a strong fight against the 
aids virus in laboratory tests but a national cancer institute 
researcher says the finding is not a breakthrough 
the drug called dextran sulfate was found to prevent the aids 
virus from infecting and killing the bodys tcell lymphocytes the 
main target of the virus researchers say in a science article 
published today 
but dr samuel broder of nci one of the coauthors of the 
research paper said in an interview that much still remains to be 
learned about the drug before it could possibly be used to treat 
aids 
this is not a breakthrough said broder he said that though 
the drug is a potent agent against the aids virus in a test 
tube it is not clear that the drug can be given to patients in 
strong enough doses to affect the course of the disease 
we found in the test tube that this agent is a very a powerful 
inhibitor of the hiv virus said dr flossie wongstaal a nci 
researcher and coauthor of a study on dextran sulfate hiv for 
human immunodeficiency virus is the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
dr wongstaal said the drug has been used for more than two 
decades in japan and elsewhere as an anticoagulant and has 
demonstrated that it has no significant toxicity 
broder said dextran sulfate is only one of a large family of 
potential antivirals that must first undergo carefully controlled 
trials 
dr robert gallo an nci researcher and codiscoverer of the 
aids virus said dextran sulfate should be studied further 
im impressed by the results ive seen in vitro and it merits 
trials in patients he said the question is will it be able 
to be taken by patients for long periods of time 
a spokesman at nci said dextran sulfate now is in clinical 
trials at san francisco general hospital and results from the tests 
are expected to be announced at an international aids meeting in 
stockholm in june 
dr wongstaal said the drug prevents the hiv virus from 
invading the tcell lymphocytes a type of immunity cell that the 
aids virus normally attacks 
usually the hiv virus attacks the tcells by first attaching to 
a receptor a type of protein on the cells outer layer or 
envelope in the test tube studies dextran sulfate was found 
effective in preventing the virus from binding to the cell 
envelope thus preventing it from invading and killing the cell 
untreated hiv will change the genetic pattern of the tcell and 
force it to start making copies of the virus but this cannot take 
place if the virus cannot invade the cell 
the drug was first formulated by the uneo fine chemical industry 
of osaka japan it was used for decades to treat blood clots but 
has not been approved for that use in the united states by the food 
and drug administration the drug can be purchased routinely over 
the counter in mexico and in japan however 
last may the fda approved the drug for use in limited clinical 
trials in san francisco and uneo now holds a patent for its use 
against aids 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons 
the chief victims of aids in the united states have been 
homosexual men and intravenous drug users although a small 
percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated 
blood heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women 
to their offspring 
as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 
americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died since 
june 1981 according to the federal centers for disease control 
no one is known to have recovered from aids

a ban on plastic handguns that could slip past 
metal detectors and xrays will stop a major security problem 
before it starts says the chairman of the house committee that 
cleared such a guncontrol measure 
plastic firearms cannot be detected at security checkpoints 
when subject to inspection by metal detectors and they do not 
generate a distinct xray image rep peter w rodino jr 
dnj said consequently plastic firearms offer the potential 
terrorist a window of opportunity and pose a serious threat to the 
public safety of all americans 
on thursday rodinos committee approved by voice vote 
legislation sponsored by rep bill hughes dnj to ban the 
manufacture sale or possession of undetectable plastic firearms 
the approval came after the panel defeated 2312 an amendment by 
rep george w gekas rpa that would have led to the death 
penalty for anyone using a socalled plastic gun in the 
commission of a crime 
law enforcement agencies and gun control groups have been 
lobbying intensely for standards that would prevent terrorists from 
concealing plastic guns and slipping them past detectors 
no plastic gun has been manufactured but a florida company has 
a patent on one that it has said it will manufacture for law 
enforcement agencies in about two years 
hughes chairman of the judiciary crime subcommittee said the 
legislation will not affect existing firearms but takes aim at a 
new generation of plastic firearms experts believe will be 
developed and perfected in the near future 
this legislation is a fair and reasonable attempt to head off 
a serious law enforcement problem before it happens said hughes 
its apparent that plastic guns would become the weapons of 
choice for terrorists and other criminals if they became 
available 
under the bill guns must contain at least 37 ounces of 
electronically detectable metal to make sure they can be picked up 
by magnetometer devices it also requires that firearm components 
generate accurate xray images to assist in their detection 
the bill makes it a federal offense to knowingly manufacture 
import sell transfer or possess a plastic firearm it sets fines 
of up to 250000 for individuals and 1 million for organizations 
and up to five years in jail 
the legislation is similar to one agreed to by the justice 
department law enforcement groups and the national rifle 
association which has opposed any changes in the law that measure 
is expected to see quick passage in the senate 
mary kaaren jolly nra federal liaison applauded the house 
judiciary action saying we think it is the best piece of 
legislation introduced to date in either the house or senate side

last falls deficitreduction agreement was 
supposed to make this an easy year for passing a budget but the 
house and senate have managed to get in an argument anyway 
talks between the chambers on a compromise 11 trillion 
spending plan collapsed thursday amid angry accusations of 
badfaith negotiating 
that which i fear the worst has befallen me said senate 
budget committee chairman lawton chiles dfla who is retiring 
after this year citing burnout from his three terms 
chiles blasted house negotiators for sending an offer on the 
fiscal 1989 spending plan not in the spirit of what we sent 
you he told the house in colorful words usually impolite in 
public meetings it should not expect a response and should come 
back with a new proposal 
rep william h gray iii dpa the house budget chairman took 
offense 
im not going to sit here and be told if you dont like what 
we offered then lump it he said 
gray offered to negotiate through the weekend but chiles said 
he was heading back to florida for next week when the senate is on 
recess 
when the house makes an offer that moves as far to the senate 
as the senate did to the house send it to me by wire and ill come 
back he told gray 
another meeting was set for may 9 but chiles warned wed 
better get on our seersucker suits and turn on the air 
conditioning i think were going into summer 
last falls deficitreduction pact between president reagan and 
congressional leaders laid down the outlines for the budget for the 
spending year beginning next oct 1 it settled what is usually the 
biggest fight guns versus butter by providing specific 
figures for overall military foreign aid and domestic spending 
the budgets approved by the house and senate however took 
slightly different approaches toward the domestic budget 
for example the senate led by chiles approved a bigger 
increase in the space program which is wellrepresented in his 
home state the house has refused to go along favoring more 
spending on housing and poverty programs 
another issue is a senate plan to alter the white house 
agreement to add more drugfighting money house members oppose 
breaking the summit pact for drugs alone and not aid for the 
homeless and other needs 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico senior republican on the 
senate panel said house nitpicking was threatening to make 
an absolute joke out of this process 
we were supposed to have a year where the budget summit made 
it easy he said now he said were about to destroy it 
the house and senate must compromise on the budget before it 
becomes the official guide for congress annual spending bills 
congress missed its april 15 deadline for completing the budget 
resolution if one isnt approved by the middle of next month the 
two chambers will begin passing their spending bills without one 
sen j james exon dneb a budget committee member urged 
that heads remain cool and emphasized that differences were not 
great 
all weve got to do is agree to have an easy time he said

a newly updated hymnal for united methodists 
has won preliminary approval at the churchs governing general 
conference except for some missing masculine pronouns about god 
the objections arose over phrases in the accompanying psalter of 
psalms not the hymns themselves 
noting that in many cases masculine personal pronouns such as 
he and him had been replaced by god or gods the 
rev riley case of marion indiana said 
the truth is that this proposed psalter has no pronouns for 
god it is a depersonalized god and the feeling in the trenches 
will be that the bible has been changed 
harriett olson of morristown nj countered that removing 
pronouns is not depersonalizing god its calling god by gods 
name 
the issue arose in a hearing thursday of a legislative 
committee it voted to asked the conference to restore masculine 
pronouns in 34 psalms in a lengthy section of them 
the proposed hymnbook generally got the committees solid 
backing including the hymns and accompanying prayers readings and 
rituals for communion baptism marriage and other observance 
the conference the top governing body of about 10 million 
members is concentrating in its early stages on committee 
hearings with most proposed legislation to hit the floor next week 
action on the hymnbook may come as early as saturday by the 996 
delegates half clergy and half laity the delegates represent the 
countrys second largest protestant denomination next to southern 
baptists 
the committee recommended replacing only one of the 624 proposed 
hymns asking that lord of the dance be substituted for awake 
o sleeper 
work on the new hymnbook revising a 1966 edition has gone on 
for four years and involved methodists around the country 
grassroots reaction sometimes toppled committee decisions 
the new book preserves 329 hymns from the old book and includes 
295 new ones the lyrics while using inclusive sexual terms for 
people retains customary masculine pronouns for god 
but the section of psalms in some cases didnt do so which 
provoked the call for restoration 
for instance as in psalm 466 the committee didnt like the 
proposed phrase gods voice resounds in place of the usage in 
the new revised standard version of the bible he utters his 
voice 
masculine descriptions of god also is an issue in other matters 
before the conference including proposals to allow substitution of 
creator redeemer and sustainer for the traditional usage 
father son and holy spirit 
the conference has scheduled action monday on controversial 
proposals to eliminate stands terming homosexual practice 
incompatible with christian teaching and banning active 
homosexuals from the ministry 
criticizing the focus on homosexuality eric st clarke 
president of the carribbean council of churches said there is 
no talk about heterosexual sins why is there nothing else going 
on in the church

people who complain about their lawyers are 
out of luck in most states if they expect help from the agency that 
is supposed to regulate the profession a legal reform group says 
a report card issued thursday by halt a consumer advocacy 
organization campaigning to reform the attorney discipline process 
gave most states surveyed an f in policing lawyers 
nobody is doing a good job the question is how bad kay 
ostberg halts director of research and education said at news 
conference 
but the american bar association which says it also is working 
for reforms insists there have been improvements in recent years 
i would say that most of the states are doing a reasonably 
good job given the resources they have said the abas timothy 
mcpike who handles matters involving professional standards 
halt says disciplinary agencies often have a conflict of 
interest because they are run by lawyers and because the 
disciplinary process itself is mired in secrecy in many states 
the public never learns which lawyers are being investigated or the 
outcome of the probe 
the most common complaints are of excessive legal fees or an 
attorneys neglect ms ostberg said disciplinary agencies dont 
usually act unless the offense is shown to be excessive 
she cited a 1986 aba survey of 40 states which found that 54605 
complaints were received but only 1146 or 2 percent resulted in 
any form of public discipline ninetyfive percent were dismissed 
without any discipline 
mcpike says those numbers reflect that many complaints are not 
serious enough to warrant action 
ninety percent of the complaints dont even make it past the 
first screening people complain because their lawyer didnt answer 
their phone call fast enough he said you have to have a good 
strong case before you can take somebodys license from them 
halt proposed speeding up the process of dealing with 
complaints opening records to the public and having nonlawyers 
serve on independent commissions to monitor and investigate 
complaints 
mcpike said that in 1985 the most recent year for which figures 
are available 20 states made disciplinary proceedings public after 
it was determined there was probable cause to warrant the filing of 
charges thirtythree states have nonlawyers serving on 
disciplinary boards he said 
complaints are handled on the state level by organizations 
operated under the states highest court these organizations are 
run as arms of state bar associations or as separate disciplinary 
governing boards 
the halt survey conducted during february and march graded 
disciplinary agencies in five categories whether the agency is 
subject to public review or control allows public access to its 
proceedings makes disciplinary records public encourages the 
filing of complaints and has a fair and responsive disciplinary 
process 
thirtythree states and the district of columbia responded to 
the survey the rest of the states did not respond 
halt gave each state that responded a final grade based on 
the five criteria 
alaska d arkansas f california d colorado f 
connecticut d district of columbia f florida f hawaii f 
idaho f illinois f kentucky f maryland d massachusetts f 
minnesota d mississippi f missouri f montana f nevada f 
new jersey f new mexico f north carolina f ohio f oregon

federal authorities in more than 2000 
inspections of eastern and continental airlines jets have so far 
found no grossly unsafe aircraft according to the chief of the 
federal aviation administration 
faa administrator allan mcartor said thursday that 5 percent of 
the inspections uncovered minor safety infractions that 
required planes to be taken out of service and at times flights to 
be delayed 
he characterized the percentage as not unusually high 
the faa began its planebyplane inspections april 13 and 
mcartor said they will continue through midmay 
both airlines are owned by the houstonbased texas air corp 
the countrys largest airline company which also is under a 
special review by the federal government 
transportation secretary jim burnley said his departments 
separate inspection of texas airs management and financial 
practices is half completed and everything is going very well 
burnley did not elaborate on any of the findings so far 
burnley and mcartor met with reporters to announce a series of 
organizational changes at the faa aimed primarily at giving the 
agencys washington headquarters more control over its regional 
offices 
but many of the questions turned to the probes of texas air and 
its two airline subsidiaries 
mcartor said there have been about 1000 aircraft inspections at 
eastern and about the same number at continental with many planes 
subjected to inspections more than once at different airports the 
two airlines together have about 580 planes 
in roughly 7 to 8 percent of the inspections at eastern and 
3 percent of the inspections at continental the inspectors found 
problems that required the planes to be taken out of service 
briefly although in some of the cases problems were corrected 
quick enough so that flights were not delayed 
these are not unusual percentages said mcartor adding that 
they likely would be what we would find at other airlines 
undergoing a similarly intense series of examinations in some 
cases he said continental corrected problems before they came to 
the attention of faa inspectors mcartor said 
so far we have not found anything we would consider to be 
grossly unsafe on any aircraft mcartor said but he added that 
while the problems that were found appear to be minor they may 
be cause an erosion of the margin of safety if not corrected 
were dealing with the margin of safety that the faa expects 
the airlines to maintain mcartor said 
no details were available on the kinds of problems that faa 
inspectors have found mcartor mentioned in general that they 
included such items as dents or small tears in aircraft skin or 
minor leaks in equipment 
burnley and mcartor ordered the special review of eastern 
aircraft on april 13 after the faa became concerned about 
continuing safety violations at the miamibased airline at the 
time eastern also was hit with a proposed 823000 fine because of 
earlier violations 
four days later burnley ordered the inspections expanded to 
include continental as well he said a search of faa records showed 
that the agency had assembled a series of enforcement actions 
against continental that could lead to total fines of more than 1 
million

consumer advocates are joining a congressmans 
call for mandatory warning labels on toys that contain parts small 
enough for toddlers to choke on 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said thursday that labels stating 
ages 3 and up seem to many parents simply like recommendations 
for ability levels and not a safety warning 
too often the proud parent thinks my susie and my sammy are 
so smart they certainly have the ability to play with this toy 
said ann brown chairwoman of the consumer affairs committee of 
americans for democratic action 
little does the unsuspecting parent realize that this is not 
an ability label but is a danger label and should be followed 
absolutely she said 
gejdenson has drafted legislation to require all toys with small 
parts to include a label with the word warning in capital 
letters and a statement that children under 3 can choke on the 
parts 
the consumer product safety commission prohibits toy 
manufacturers from marketing products with small parts to children 
under 3 but the agency has no labeling requirements most us 
manufacturers print age recommendations on the toy packages but 
many of those do not outline the potential health hazard 
chris nelson a compliance officer at the commission said the 
agency has asked certain companies to print smallparts warnings on 
their labels 
but she said the commission has not made it mandatory because it 
would be difficult to prove a direct link between the lack of 
labeling and choking deaths and injuries she said such proof would 
be necessary for the commission to issue a regulation

a baptist minister who gathers his flock 
with automatic prerecorded phone messages says the best thing 
about his new telecomputer is that it always turns the other cheek 
it takes no breaks for lunch or a drink of water if somebody 
hangs up it doesnt get mad said the rev charles west one 
person cant make the calls this machine does in the same time 
frame 
the telecomputer is programmed to dial phone numbers and deliver 
wests message of the day to his congregation at the first baptist 
church in bethalto 
if a dialed number isnt answered his machine will redial every 
30 minutes for three hours if it gets a busy signal it will 
redial every five minutes for 30 minutes 
the message is changed every saturday 
west concedes that a taped message sounds impersonal but said 
its a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation of 
525 members 
people are actively involved in their own lives he said 
the church used to be the center of community life but not any 
more 
on the day before easter when daylight savings time began 
the church members got this call 
hello this is pastor west calling i trust youre ready for 
easter dont forget to turn your clocks up 
the call also offered information about church services and had 
room for parishioners to leave a message 
west hopes to reach nonparishioners and invite them to attend 
first baptist with the telecomputer which can be programmed to 
call every phone number in bethalto and the surrounding area 
the pastor believes he could get two new members out of every 20 
calls

are you an easy mark for door to door 
salesmen do you lose receipts for cash down payments do you buy 
wrinkle cream from mail order companies 
these are the types of questions players face in a new board 
game called market place produced by the delaware division of 
consumer affairs 
we use nuts and bolts as the game pieces because the game 
deals with the nuts and bolts of consumer affairs said nancy 
hebner division spokeswoman 
the game was developed as a good way for people to increase 
their knowledge about the pitfalls of being a consumer mrs 
hebner said 
the object of the game is to be the first to reach the money 
tree in the middle of the game board players advance around a 
winding track on the board by drawing a card and following its 
directions 
cards that can make players move back one space say things like 
you spent 40 for miracle weight loss pills that melt away fat 
while you sleep or how about you didnt read the fine print 
of the record club or book club offer 
cards that can help a player advance one or two spaces include 
you always get three written estimates before hiring a roofing 
contractor you send all formal complaint letters by certified 
mail and you never give out your credit card number to sales 
people who call you on the telephone 
the directions on the cards are based on calls the division 
receives daily from consumers mrs hebner said 
its a simple game but if people follow instructions and 
think about what theyre doing it will probably save them a lot of 
money and a lot of grief in the years ahead mrs hebner said

after waiting a lifetime a 79yearold 
father of six will become in june the oldest man ever to be 
ordained a roman catholic priest in the united states 
im here for one purpose only im expecting to graduate and 
become a priest and from then on live the life of priest with 
whatever the duties are given me thats it im not trying to be a 
celebrity william r schumacher said thursday 
in a way its been working on me i dont want it to 
interfere with my vocation said schumacher who is completing 
his final exams at holy apostles college and seminary in this 
hartford suburb in central connecticut 
a widower and the grandfather of 13 schumacher will finish his 
exams next week as a bplus student and graduate may 8 to complete 
his three years as a seminarian 
he will formally enter the priesthood at st tarcissus roman 
catholic church in his native chicago and will be assigned to the 
dallas diocese where he hopes to work with the sick and aged 
a heavy man with a full face wirerim glasses a neatly 
trimmed mustache and thick white hair schumacher hopes there is a 
lesson in his case that will help others his age who are uncertain 
about whether to commit to the church 
he sums up that message as go for it there is an 
opportunity there is a place to be 
schumacher wanted to enroll in a seminary at age 18 after 
completing his schooling at depaul academy but he was dissuaded by 
a priest who reminded him that there was no one to provide for his 
recently widowed mother 
instead he went to work and took courses at depaul and loyola 
universities he married in september 1931 while enrolled in law 
school 
he quit the next year without a degree as the depression dragged 
on and encumberances were getting heavier and heavier 
he became an insurance broker and for the next 40 years pursued 
various other careers as a credit manager and adviser to a variety 
of company presidents in 1962 he took a position as jobs 
counselor with the illinois department of labor a position he held 
until retiring in 1975 
during this period he was active in the boy scouts and the 
church he became a grand knight in the knights of columbus 
after his wife died of a stroke in 1984 schumacher decided it 
was time to enter the priesthood at that time it was when i 
said lord now im ready theres nothing to hold me back 
schumacher recalled 
after deciding to become a priest schumacher then had to fight 
the skeptics and system that thought him too old only four 
seminaries in the country accept students of advanced age and holy 
apostles agreed to accept him if he found a bishop to sponsor him 
after 50 bishops rejected him a dallas bishop finally agreed to 
sponsor him 
four leading american seminaries the national conference of 
catholic bishops and a leading catholic scholar all have confirmed 
that schumacher is the oldest to face ordination according to a 
chicago public relations firm handling publicity for schumacher 
weve overcome the obstacles that have been in the way and 
there were a lot of them and now were on to the beginning 
schumacher said

the blast that ripped a huge hole in an aloha 
airlines jetliner over the pacific ocean appears to be unlike any 
previous accident involving boeing planes say officials of the 
aircraft company 
tom cole and david jimenez of boeing commercial airplanes the 
main boeing co subsidiary said thursday night they had received 
only sketchy reports of the explosion which ripped off the top of 
the fuselage just behind the cockpit to about the wing injuring 60 
people and leaving one person missing 
both executives said there were no fuel lines or other potential 
sources for an explosion in the firstclass cabin just behind the 
cockpit where passengers on the boeing 737200 reported that the 
blast occurred 
the fuel is in the wing the engines are in the wing and the 
fuel lines are all right there cole said in a telephone 
interview from his home 
even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore 
loose from one of the two engines and ripped into the fuselage in 
midflight it could not hit forward from the wing and the effect 
would be nothing like what happened to the aloha plane he said 
to have it just explode in the air is just unheard of cole 
said i think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not 
related to any other accidents we have had 
fbi agents were sent from honolulu to check the possibility that 
a bomb might have been put on the plane said fbi spokesman robert 
heafner 
jimenez also interviewed from his home said the plane was one 
of nine 737200s delivered to aloha in the late 1970s 
the 737 series is boeings smallest jetliner and the companys 
alltime best seller with total orders for 2031 planes as of 
thursday cole said 35 to 37 737s have either crashed or been 
disabled by terrorists lightning or other means 
the first 737200 was put into service in april 1968 and nearly 
1100 remain in use today cole said it can carry as many as 120 
passengers depending on the seating configuration and has a range 
of 2600 miles 
the 200 was the second version of the 737s and costs 17 million 
to 22 million each production of the model has ceased with the 
last 737200 to be delivered later this year jimenez said

and his late wife making the charity one of the nations 10 
wealthiest its director said 
the los altosbased david and lucile packard foundation valued 
at 145 million would rank with others such as the ford 
foundation valued at 47 billion executive director cole wilbur 
said thursday 
the bulk of the donation will consist of stock contributed to 
the foundation a charitable organization created by the packards 
in 1964 to finance education and health projects throughout the 
world wilbur said 
packard 75 told wilbur last week of his intention to leave the 
money to the foundation when he dies the director said 
his feeling is that there is a lot of important concerns in 
research and education and hed like to help develop them and to 
help really make a difference in this community and the world

judge gerhard a gesells angry charge that 
the reagan administration was impeding the trial of oliver north 
and three irancontra codefendants was a performance familar to 
lawyers who frequent his courtroom 
a day after gesell accused the administration of intentionally 
withholding classified documents that he says the defendants were 
entitled to see the veteran federal judge calmly acknowledged the 
governments fears about disclosing some of its most sensitive 
secrets 
having angrily said wednesday that a stone wall is being built 
up between this court and the trial gesell took the bench in 
us district court on thursday and discussed the problem in milder 
tones 
he blandly described it as an obstacle caused by concerns in 
the government generally concerning the confidentiality of 
documents and offered to see if i can be of any help to this 
situation 
the switch in the judges courtroom demeanor was described by 
one lawyer as typical gesell bark bark bark meow meow 
meow 
another lawyer who also did not want to be personally 
associated with a comment about a sitting judge said gesell 
blows hot and cold 
despite his changed demeanor gesell did not retreat thursday 
from his earlier threat to dismiss the case unless the relevant 
classified documents are shown to the defense and made available 
for use at trial as evidence 
that possibility is a very real one particularly if independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh is unable to persuade the cia the state 
department or other national security agencies to declassify 
sensitive documents gesell decides are needed as evidence for the 
defense 
the government is obliged to make all relevant information 
available in some reasonable way to the defense and using the 
monolithic term government might not be appropriate where the 
independent counsel really does not call the shots said richard 
benveniste a former watergate prosecutor 
lawyers for north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and businessmen albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord will be looking closely for material they 
can predict wont be declassified 
as former guardians of some of the nations most sensitive 
secrets north and poindexter are in a unique position to help 
their lawyers find evidence that is beyond the courts reach 
a successful search of the 300000 pages of sensitive material 
collected by walsh could lead to dismissal of charges they 
conspired to illegally divert profits from the usiran arms sales 
to the nicaraguan rebels 
at an earlier hearing gesell referred to the complicated 
procedures for handling sensitive documents and remarked that north 
knows more about the methods than those in the classification 
system 
with secret documents deemed relevant and admissable as evidence 
you end up with the double ds declassify or dismiss said 
defense lawyer e lawrence barcella jr who once prosecuted 
antiterrorism cases for the justice department 
i dont know of any case since the classified information 
procedures act was passed not quite 10 years ago that has ever had 
the volume of relevant classified material that this one does he 
said 
the law contains elaborate procedures for determining whether 
classified material is relevant evidence for the prosecution and 
the defense if the government wont declassify a document it 
allows for deletions of secret material of substitution of 
summaries to enable the introduction of relevant evidence 
but not all documents can be easily altered or summarized and 
gesell said he wont spend much time on that process particularly 
since walsh says 50000 pages are relevant to the case 
what is the government going to do or the judge going to do 
if the government says we cant declassify this it is just too 
sensitive barcella said 
the problem is particularly acute in the irancontra case 
because the essence of some of the crimes that are charged is 
classified activity he said 
joseph digenova who recently resigned as us attorney here 
noted that it may very well be that some of that stuff is so 
sensitive under no circumstances should it be released 
and if gesell is forced to dismiss the charges because there is 
too much classified evidence so be it digenova said that 
was how the statute was designed that is the way it is supposed to 
work

lord brockway the veteran socialist pacifist 
political writer and prison inmate who campaigned for indias 
independence from britain and championed african nationalism has 
died his family reported 
he was 99 
brockway died thursday night at watford general hospital in 
hertfordshire outside london he had been in the hospital since 
april 19 his family said he had been in bad health for some time 
but no specific cause of death was given 
paying tribute to him thursday night neil kinnock leader of 
the socialist opposition labor party said throughout the whole 
of this century in britain and in so many other countries he was 
an inspiration to all who love liberty and work for socialism 
archibald fenner brockway was born in calcutta india the son 
of a clergyman and was educated in britain at the school for the 
sons of missionaries 
during world war i brockway became secretary of the no 
conscription fellowship he was later joint secretary of the 
british committee of the indian national congress editor of the 
publication india joint secretary of the prison system inquiry 
committee and chairman of the no more war movement and war 
resisters international 
in 1927 he was a fraternal delegate to the indian trade union 
congress and indian national congress and in 1929 he was elected 
to the british house of commons as a labor party legislator 
in the early 1930s he transferred his allegiance to the 
independent labor party becoming its chairman in 1931 but he 
rejoined the main labor party in 1946 
throughout his commons career brockway campaigned for abolition 
of the house of lords the unelected upper house of the british 
parliament on grounds it was a bastion of privilege 
but in 1964 he accepted a life peerage from queen elizabeth ii 
which automatically gave him a seat in the lords he said at the 
time that he accepted the peerage reluctantly but he attended 
debates in the lords regularly 
brockway wrote about 30 books mostly on politics and social 
issues 
in his autobiography he recalled encounters with his close 
friend the irishborn playwright and socialist george bernard shaw 
with george orwell the leftwing british author of 1984 
animal farm and other books and with mahatma gandhi whose 
campaign for indian freedom from british rule culminated in 
independence in 1947 
brockway served five prison terms during his turbulent life 
two prison terms one with hard labor resulted from his 
militant pacifism during world war i the other three stemmed from 
demonstrations against the hydrogen bomb capitalism and racialism 
he was a champion of african nationalism and during his years in 
the commons was sometimes referred to by parliamentary colleagues 
as the honorable member for africa 
describing himself as a humanist but not an atheist brockway 
once declared i dont know if there is a god or an afterlife and 
i dont particularly worry about it but if there is the best way 
to prepare is to work for justice here now 
former labor party leader michael foot said he was one of the 
very greatest libertarian socialists of this century and all 
democratic socialists all over the world honor him 
brockway is survived by his second wife edith king their son 
and four daughters from his first marriage to lilla harveysmith

a woman whose car plowed into an afterschool 
crowd at an elementary school killing a 4yearold girl and a 
woman and injuring eight others has been charged with negligent 
driving police say 
witnesses said the twodoor sedan crashed through a chainlink 
fence and careened across an asphalt playground before running up a 
short flight of stairs to where the crowd was gathered thursday 
afternoon in an entryway of cyrus h mccormick elementary school 
there were mothers screaming looking for their children 
said araceli hernandez whose niece lives with her and attends the 
school almost every child that was on the floor had their mother 
next to them 
principal jim crowe and teachers helped lift the car which was 
lodged in the twostory building to free some victims trapped 
beneath the wheels 
i called for 10 ambulances crowe said i told them there 
were bodies all over the playground 
two of the injured youngsters remained in critical condition 
today 
marcella diaz 30 was waiting for her 5yearold son roger 
and her 12yearold daughter lynne when the accident happened 
i was picking up my son when i turned my head and saw the car 
coming she says i just screamed and picked up my son with my 
hands and ran away the car missed us by a yard and a half 
isabel fuentes 37 was charged with leaving the scene of an 
accident and negligent driving officer terry pickens said she was 
arrested near the school and freed after posting 100 cash bond and 
her drivers license 
reuben fuentes a pupil at the school said his mother 
apparently had come to the school to pick him up 
our opinion is that she was driving too fast for conditions 
said sgt thomas reynolds of the police departments major 
accidents unit he didnt know exactly how fast she was traveling 
but said mrs fuentes who suffered a bloody nose in the accident 
was going over the 20 mph speed limit 
there was no evidence of intoxication or use of drugs reynolds 
said adding that authorities were investigating the possibility 
that the cars brakes failed or the accelerator malfunctioned 
a police spokeswoman who declined to give her name said today

life is just a game played out on a big 
checkered board or so they seem to be saying in chess the 
heavyhanded british musical hit that lumbered into broadways 
imperial theater on thursday night 
in this case its the theatergoers who are checkmated trapped 
for more than three hours in a cold and unappealing musical that 
ranks as one of the seasons biggest disappointments 
thats surprising considering the show boasts a provocative 
tuneful score with lyrics by tim rice and music by benny andersson 
and bjorn ulvaeus two members of the pop group abba but the 
songwriters are shortchanged by director trevor nunn and playwright 
richard nelson who have fashioned a musical that is big on metaphor 
and short on credibility not to mention entertainment 
the plot apparently reworked a bit from the london production 
is a romantic triangle involving a volatile and vulgar american 
chess champion philip casnoff his soviet opponent david 
carroll and the americans second judy kuhn a hungarian refugee 
who falls for the russian at the drop of a rook 
the american is sort of the john mcenroe of chess the 
champions manners and politics are somewhere to the right of 
genghis khan his distastefulness dulls one point of this love 
triangle making it hard for the audience to wonder who will end up 
with whom let alone who will win the big match 
the triangle eventually becomes a quartet when it is revealed 
that the russian has a wife marcia mitzman back in moscow she 
doesnt show up until the second act and by then the story has 
bogged down completely 
the three chess players are manipulated by an assortment of cia 
and kgb agents as well as public relations types who sing and dance 
their way through the show everyone is the pawn of someone else a 
soap opera message nelson reiterates with numbing frequency 
nunn who previously worked wonders on cats les 
miserables and the life and adventures of nicholas nickleby 
falters with this show like les miserables chess relies 
on a turntable to make the musical move but it doesnt work as 
well 
set designer robin wagner provides a series of gray 
concretelike columns that glide swivel and turn around the stage 
their perpetual motion eventually becomes monotonous and even 
irritating 
much of the time the characters just stand on stage and shout 
at each other or toward the audience theres not much nunn can do 
with these argumentative moments but when a number cries out for 
some musical movement it doesnt get any help 
consider the exotic song one night in bangkok a sizable pop 
success several years ago and virtually thrown away here in an 
embarrassing fleshpeddling scene that looks like it was borrowed 
from a summer stock revival of the world of suzie wong 
the show has been cast with strong voices even down to the 
smallest roles at a result many of the songs soar in spite of the 
story miss kuhn has a radiant voice and when she doesnt push it 
the sound embraces the theater her quiet moments are the best 
particularly heaven help my heart a delicate solo and i 
know him so well a duet of commiseration that miss kuhn sings 
with the russians neglected wife 
the songwriters also have provided some memorable music for the 
men particularly the bitter pity the child which contains 
rices finest lyrics its an explanation by the american grand 
master as to why he turned out to be such a rotter casnoff 
succeeds too well in conveying the characters miserable 
personality 
carroll who possesses an even better voice manages to make the 
russian more than a milquetoast not an inconsiderable achievement 
considering nelsons laborious plot the performer brings the 
overlong first act to a thrilling conclusion with a ringing anthem 
to his homeland 
as good as the score is there is too much of it the 
songwriters added several songs for the american production 
including someone elses story one number that has likely pop 
potential but less would have been more 
the costumes by theoni v aldredge are undistinguished 
allpurpose modern clothes that are remarkably ordinary and in the 
case of miss kuhn unflattering david herseys lighting at least 
tries to bathe wagners dozen or so behemoth columns in a soft 
humanizing glow 
its that humane personal quality which is missing from the 
rest of the production the musical revels in its political message 
and its conceit of a chess game as a microcosm of real life not 
even the fine handiwork of its three gifted songwriters can make 
the sledgehammer symbolism of chess palatable 
in other reviews 
howard kissel writes in the daily news that chess is a show 
without a game plan 
the characters are cliches and not even appropriate ones 
neither of the love stories is emotionally involving visually 
chess is drab the show is shrilly overamplified 
the lingering question is why anyone imagined 
international politics was something to sing about 
in the new york times frank rich writes rather than 
condescend to throwing the audience a bone of genuinely romantic or 
melodramatic entertainment or even providing a tense chess game 
the authors pass the time pontificating about politics in sweeping 
generalities reminiscent of mr rices evita 
referring to the musicals metaphorical equation of chess and 
war rich says war is hell and chess sometimes comes 
remarkably close

<TEXT>
a new york congressman says an attempt by the 
reagan administration to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid 
to cities with rent control has virtually been defeated 
rep charles schumer dny on thursday revealed what he said 
amounted to an admission of defeat in a letter from housing and 
urban development secretary samuel r pierce jr the letter said 
the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to 
restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control 
laws 
the restriction cannot go into effect until legislation has 
been adopted by congress and signed by the president pierce 
wrote 
in january the office of management and budget had suggested 
making the change through federal regulation but hud spokesman 
jack flynn said his department has always maintained that it 
would require legislation to change the grant program 
the letter is a carefully worded admission of defeat 
schumer said of pierces comments administration officials first 
tried to impose their callous plan through regulation because they 
knew legislation to interfere with local housing laws would stand 
no chance in congress once they saw that congress would not let 
their regulation go into effect they backed off

a proposal to make tennis star ivan lendl an 
american citizen in time to play for the us olympic team in seoul 
this summer is moving swiftly through congress but the team may 
have no room for the worlds no 1 player 
the house judiciary committee on thursday approved the special 
immigration bill for lendl which would waive the fiveyear period 
permanent residents are required to wait before receiving 
citizenship 
but the chief spokesman for the us tennis association said the 
team has already been selected and that it is highly unlikely a 
player would be bumped to make room for lendl even if the czech 
native receives us citizenship and clears another series of 
procedural hurdles to become eligible 
this would put us in a very difficult situation said ed 
fabricius director of communications for the association i 
dont see it happening weve already selected the team 
lendl 28 the worlds no 1 ranked tennis player is a native 
of czechoslovakia but has lived in greenwich conn since 1981 
and has adopted the united states as his home lendl won his 
permanent resident status last year and has personally lobbied

an artist whose portraits over the decades have 
included herbert hoover and conrad hilton says he hasnt seen his 
most treasured work in 26 years a painting of his wife 
gustav likan 77 has returned to chicago from his home in 
austin texas to try to find the 30inchby40inch painting of 
his wife in a violet dress with a cat on her lap she died last 
year 
my wife was so beautiful the picture really had a lot of 
charm said likan who wants to acquire the picture from its 
current owner whoever and wherever that may be 
the story told in thursdays chicago tribune began in 1962 when 
the struggling yugoslavian immigrant couldnt afford to repay 
2000 he borrowed from his brotherinlaw to get his family to the 
united states 
likan had made a name for himself decades earlier by painting 
portraits of yugoslavias young king peter and murals for argentine 
first lady eva perons schools 
his brotherinlaw filed a lawsuit to recover the money and 
some of likans paintings were auctioned by the cook county 
sheriff the brotherinlaw bought the painting of mrs likan for 
355 but likan believes it was then immediately sold 
the brotherinlaw and his wife died without children in the 
mid1960s and the two families parted ways after the disagreement 
so likan doesnt know where the painting might be 
its a dream to have this picture likan said maybe the 
owner is rich he doesnt need the painting its worth a lot more 
to me from an artistic standpoint and for my family 
the painting was valued at 2000 when it was auctioned likan 
said adding that he believes it would be worth 8000 today 
it could be anyplace said capt james zurawski of the 
police departments financial investigation unit its like

deep dark suntans are fading from fashionability 
because of cancer and wrinkle fears according to a survey 
sponsored by a dermatologists group but tanningindustry 
officials say the bronze look is alive and well 
fifty fashion leaders surveyed by the american academy of 
dermatology and the avon foundation were virtually unanimous in 
their opinion that the dark tan once fashionable is no longer in 
vogue the academy said 
the main reasons for caution under the sun are fear of 
premature aging and knowledge about skin cancer the doctors 
group said 
those polled ranged from cosmopolitan magazine editor helen 
gurley brown to new york modelagency head eileen ford the academy 
said in a statement promoting may as melanomaskin cancer 
detection and prevention month 
doctors say the popularity of suntanning is partly to blame for 
the soaring us rates of melanoma a skin cancer that killed an 
estimated 5800 americans last year 
there are still addictedtotan people who will never conquer 
the addiction ms brown told the survey the reason the rest 
of us are more careful is because of all the information being 
disseminated you just could not avoid knowing at this point if 
you can read that heavy suntanning does cause skin cancer 
ms ford told the survey todays style is a healthy glow not 
sunbaked skin 
but those in the tanning trade point to booming business at 
tanning parlors an increasing number of tourists at sun resorts 
and millions of dollars being spent on tanning aids 
there are more than 275000 commercial tanning beds in the 
united states said bo wunsch a spokesman for silver solarium 
inc a tanning equipment importer in san francisco 
it is not only the fashion in this country it is the fashion 
throughout western europe he said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
vacations to sun resorts have not fallen off either according 
to figures from club med sales inc in new york which sold 350400 
trips to its 109 sun resorts last year said spokeswoman edwina 
arnold that was almost a 16 percent rise from the 302100 trips in 
1985 she said 
in the 450 million suntanlotion market products that promote 
tanning more than block it gained a slight market share from 1986 
to 1987 from 46 percent to 52 percent said debra bennetts a 
spokeswoman for makers of bain de soleil 
she shared the view that lighter tanning is the trend and said 
her company richardsonvicks in wilton conn for the first time 
is adding a new product this season with the highest possible sun 
protection factor or spf rating 30 
and in our advertising for this current season our models 
tan is much lighter than in past years she said in a telephone 
interview thursday we like to think were going to set what 
becomes fashionable 
but david rollins us distributor of eurotan professional tan 
accelerator said people are buying his product faster than ever 
and his company in harrisburg ill has sold 500000 bottles since 
february 
managers of two chicago tanning parlors randomly selected said 
they are having their best year ever 
i really dont see tanning ever going out of style to be 
honest with you said tom neighbors manager of eurotan halsted 
which serves about 100 customers a day its been around

if you know your cholesterol level 
congratulations most americans dont 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
only 6 percent of the adults surveyed in 32 states last year could 
recall what their cholesterol levels were 
people dont know their numbers said dr patrick l 
remington a cdc cholesterol specialist weve got a long way to 
go to get people to know their numbers 
the federal governments behavioral risk factor surveillance 
system regularly asks people about their health and behavior last 
year for the first time interviewers asked randomly selected 
adults in 32 states and the district of columbia about their 
cholesterol 
less than half the respondents 47 percent had ever had a 
cholesterol check at all less than half of those people or just 
19 percent overall said they had been told what their cholesterol 
level was and of those people fewer than onethird or only 6 
percent overall remembered what the level was 
in the past a doctor might do a cholesterol check during a 
checkup look at the reading and tell the patient youre 
fine remington said what were encouraging is for patients 
to say id like to know what my number is 
and not only should you know your number but you should know 
what it means 
a cholesterol level of below 200 measured in milligrams per 
deciliter of blood is considered desirable according to the 
cdc more than 200 is considered borderline high and over 240 
is high 
although the survey respondents cholesterol could not be 
independently checked most people who claim to know their 
cholesterol do a very good job remington said and if they 
dont know the exact number they may be able to classify 
themselves as high or desirable he added 
evidence about the links between cholesterol and heart disease 
has grown in the past decade the cdc noted in its weekly report 
government researchers believe a 25 percent reduction in 
cholesterol can cut a persons risk of heart disease in half 
remington said cholesterol specialists want people to know their 
exact numbers to avoid misconceptions an old rule of thumb said 
that anything under a figure of 200pluspatientage was ok but 
thats obviously passe he said citing the current standards 
in the 32 states and the district of columbia the percentage of 
people knowing their cholesterol ranged from 1 percent in new 
mexico to a high of 9 percent in maine maryland and washington 
state 
the percentage of respondents who had ever had a cholesterol 
check at all ranged from 29 percent in new mexico to 57 percent in 
maryland 
the margin of polling error for the surveys differed from state 
to state and question to question but ranged from 1 percent to 4 
percent 
differences from state to state may reflect differences either 
in the availability and use of cholesterol testing or in the 
respondents awareness of the results the atlantabased cdc said

thousands of people shouted banzai and waved 
japanese flags as emperor hirohito the worlds oldest and 
longestreigning monarch appeared briefly on his palace balcony 
today to mark his 87th birthday 
the emperors birthday is a national holiday 
thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today i am 
happy that so many of you have come today i hope you will all have 
a happy future hirohito said from behind bulletproof glass in a 
speech carried live on national television 
it was his second public appearance since he underwent surgery 
last september to bypass a tumor blocking his digestive tract 
doctors later said the growth was not malignant 
hirohito once worshiped as a living god also spoke to 
wellwishers at the imperial palace grounds on new years day 
nobuyoshi shimane an accountant in tokyo was one of the 
estimated 35000 who came in three shifts under a drizzling rain 
today and stood in a palace courtyard to see the emperor in his 
annual birthday appearance 
i think this will be the last chance to see him because of his 
advanced age shimane said 
hirohito has been on the throne since dec 25 1926 
despite rumors of ill health hirohito appeared relatively 
strong today although he shuffled slowly as he walked he was 
accompanied by crown prince akihito and princess michiko and other 
members of the imperial family missing was empress nagako 85 who 
suffers back and leg ailments 
in a news conference marking his birthday the emperor said he 
was recovering well from surgery and answered questions about his 
memories of world war ii 
after all is considered the war was my most unpleasant 
memory i am pleased with peoples efforts for peace after the war 
hereafter i hope the people do not forget this matter and protect 
peace hirohito said 
he refused to say what caused japan to enter the war in the 
first place saying i do not want to answer the question because 
this will involve criticism against persons 
foreign reporters were not alowed to attend the news conference 
which was conducted monday but not released until today the 
remarks were carried in japanese by the kyodo news service and 
translated by the associated press 
during two previous news conferences for foreign reporters the 
last 13 years ago the emperor expressed his personal sorrow for 
certain things that happened during world war ii 
but he said he acted as a constitutional monarch before and 
during the war and did not play a personal role he also denied 
planning the pearl harbor attack but left many other questions 
unanswered 
during this years news conference hirohito praised yoshihiro 
tokugawa his former grand chamberlain who retired earlier this 
month at the age of 81 after serving for more than half a century 
he protected recordings of the emperors announcement of 
defeat in the war from soldiers who intruded into the imperial 
palace on aug 15 1945 with his language abilities he prepared 
well for my friendly visits to europe and the united states so that 
my visits were successful 
soldiers had planned to seize the recording so the war could 
continue they beat tokugawa with a pistol but he refused to say 
where the recording was hidden when the disk was finally played 
it was the first time most japanese heard their emperors voice 
during that broadcast hirohito urged his subjects to open an 
era of grand peace for the generations to come by suffering the 
insufferable bearing the unbearable 
however hirohito never used the words surrender or 
defeat 
hirohito also said in the interview that it would take him a 
long time to complete his research in marine biology his favorite 
hobby 
he said he had replanted an endangered plant species and it is 
growing well because the imperial garden is similar to forest 
land

the first california condor chick conceived in 
captivity pecked a dimesized hole in its egg which anxious 
keepers gently poked and serenaded with recorded vulture sounds to 
coax the rare bird out of its shell 
the chick should free itself by early saturday said tom 
hanscom spokesman at the san diego wild animal park where the 
chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair of the 
nearly extinct california condors 
the hole makes our condor peoples job easier hanscom 
said theyve been monitoring the chicks activity by close 
observation to detect movement of egg itself now with a direct 
view of the chick we can tell every time it moves 
the chick dislodged the dimesized bit of shell thursday on its 
second day of pecking at the egg accompanied by a recording of 
vultures making hissing and grunting sounds the recording was 
played at twohour intervals to try to duplicate the sounds the 
chick would hear in a natural nesting environment 
condor keepers also occasionally tap the egg lightly with a 
metal rod to match the prodding encouragement of a parent condor 
we are still getting response from the egg when we tap and 
play vulture sounds hanscom said we are happy at the 
response it indicates to us the chick is still alive and strong 
at this point we just to continue to watch 
park officials have set a 72hour deadline ending at 4 am 
saturday at which time keepers will intervene with forceps and 
tweezers and gently chip small parks of the shell until they can 
pull the chick out he said 
officials dont want to intervene prematurely because of the 
danger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes which 
could trigger fatal internal bleeding 
its an exciting time but a very anxious time said hanscom 
we do fear for overexhaustion on the part of the chick well 
all breathe a lot easier when we have a chick out of its shell and 
it indicates to us it is healthy and functioning correctly 
the 10ounce egg about 5 inches long has been under a 24hour 
watch since 4 am wednesday when keepers noticed cracks in one 
end the pip cracks signaled the start of hatching which 
usually takes about three days 
a successful hatching would bring to 28 the known population of 
north americas largest land bird a member of the vulture family 
with a wing span of 10 feet at maturity all 27 california condors 
known to exist are in captivity 14 at the wild animal park and 13 
at the los angeles zoo

passengers aboard a stricken aloha 
airlines jetliner prayed and sang hymns while the plane wobbled 25 
miles to an emergency landing after an explosion blew away part of 
the forward passenger cabins overhead 
there was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up 
and we were looking at blue sky bill fink of honolulu said 
thursday he was in row 18 not far from the boeing 737s forward 
cabin where the explosion occurred 
everybody screamed said passenger dan dennin of honolulu 
however it was very brief the panic the explosion happened 
the rest of the plane was intact and we did not go into any 
unusual attitudes or anything like that 
sixty people were injured two critically and a stewardess was 
missing in the explosion aboard the jetliner which landed at 
kahului airport with one engine aflame and about 15 to 20 feet of 
its front cabin exposed the plane carried 89 passengers five crew 
members and an air traffic controller 
i think that people realized the plane was still flying and 
they quickly went about the business of doing whatever they could 
do to save their lives dennin said i think we flew for almost 
15 minutes with half an airplane so we were all well aware of what 
was going on 
fink and dennin praised the cabin crew for helping calm the 
passengers some of whom hung on to one standing stewardess so she 
would not be sucked out of the plane by the howling wind 
another stewardess clarabelle b lansing of honolulu who 
worked for the airline for 37 years apparently was swept from the 
plane officials said an air and sea search coordinated by the 
us coast guard failed to locate her the search was scheduled to 
resume at first light today 
well i think the stewardess mrs lansing had just picked up 
the microphone to start talking when the explosion occurred 
fink said 
another passenger alice godwin of boulder city nev said the

iraq said today its warplanes raided two 
vessels off the iranian coast resuming attacks on commercial 
shipping in the persian gulf after nearly a month of quiet 
baghdad radio monitored in nicosia said the warplanes staged 
two raids late thursday hitting a very large maritime target and 
a large maritime target a usual reference to supertankers and 
tankers 
the broadcast quoted an unidentified military spokesman as 
saying the planes rerturned safely to base after scoring accurate 
and effective blows he said the missions were designed to 
destroy the oil supplies of the aggressors who use the oil 
revenues to prolong the war 
there was no immediate confirmation of either attack from 
gulfbased shipping executives 
iran never acknowledges iraqi attacks on vessels ferrying its 
oil between the kharg island oil terminal at the northern tip of 
the gulf and safer facilities in the southern part of the waterway 
iraq has claimed sinking iranian warships in the gulf during a 
land thrust earlier this month to recapture the faw peninsula in 
southern iraq 
but the last confirmed iraqi attack on a commercial vessel was 
march 30 when the cypriotflagged anax was damaged in an air raid 
about 70 miles south of kharg 
iran is known to have attacked at least seven ships between 
april 1223 
the socalled tanker war is an offshoot of the iraniraq war 
that began in september 1980

affecting presidential advisers and cabinet posts including the 
ministries of justice and home affairs prime minister lee hyunjae

opposition showing in tuesdays national assembly elections has 
forced them to change strategy to seek dialogue and compromise

aide said 
victims of the reorganization may include ahn moohyuk director 
of the agency for national security planning who was retained from 
the government of former president chun doohwan another aide said 
the intelligence agency came under fire for alleged attempts to 
smear some important opposition candidates in tuesdays elections

president francois mitterrand was judged today the 
winner of an acrimonious debate with rival conservative premier 
jacques chirac televised 10 days before voters return to the polls 
for the presidential runoff 
thirtytwo percent of television viewers gave the socialist 
president the edge and 24 percent said chirac had won thursday 
nights debate twentyone percent called it a draw 23 percent had 
no opinion 
the poll of 800 adults was conducted immediately after the 
debate by the private firm csa for the newpaper le parisien and 
radio france no margin of error was given 
often biting and sarcastic the debate was the first between 
mitterand and chirac since they began sharing power in march 1986 
the two drew on detailed figures and weaved sophisticated arguments 
in attacking each others policies 
newspapers across france featured the debate on their front 
pages today 
with this face to face debate francois mitterrand and jacques 
chirac confirmed that cohabitation has been more difficult than 
either had let be understood before the provincial daily 
courrier de louest said 
the leftist daily liberation said the debate recalled a 
quarrel on a luxurious school playground 
the conservative le figaro like most newspapers said it showed 
the men to be fairly evenly matched 
chirac used the debate to make a clear appeal to the extreme 
right arguing that halting immigration was an imperious 
necessity 
mitterrand agreed that immigration must be reduced but said he 
would not take part in a witchhunt of immigrants 
for chirac 55 the key to winning the may 8 runoff election 
could lie with capturing the votes of those who favor jeanmarie le 
pen leader of the extremeright national front 
le pen running on an antiimmigration platform achieved a 
stunning success in sundays first round of the presidential 
elections garnering 144 percent of the vote compared to 199 
percent for chirac 
mitterrand 71 won with 34 percent 
on sunday le pen is to advise his sympathizers how to vote on 
may 8 
he has publicly ruled out votes in mitterrands favor but he 
has said he is looking for concrete signs chirac and his 
neogaullist rally for the republic would implement policies in 
keeping with the national fronts goals 
thursday nights twohour forum in which two wellknown 
journalists asked the questions was billed as the major political 
event 
the number of immigrants must of course be reduced 
mitterrand said during the exchange but he added that immigration 
was an exaggerated problem sometimes purposely complicated 
that cannot be treated without nuance 
i will not participate during this presidential election in a 
witchhunt of immigrants he said 
very simply immigration must be stopped because france no 
longer has the means to give work to foreigners chirac said 
it is an imperious necessity 
using a term dear to le pen he added its a problem of 
national identity of the french way of life 
you didnt wink there did you mitterrand interjected 
the president appeared to command the first half of the debate 
but chirac responded confidently and with animation on the subjects 
of immigration taxes and security

alleged cocaine den was shot by one of two decorated police 
officers not the pregnant woman blamed immediately after the 
shootout authorities said 
in these kinds of incidents its a little difficult to piece 
things together chief of detectives robert colangelo told a news 
conference thursday we got most of our information from the 
captain who unfortunately was the last one in the room

showed the bullet that killed sgt john f mccormick came from one

statement which still holds true colangelo said 
mayor edward i koch said ms perez was still to blame for the 
death and the tragedy is a police officer was killed as a result 
of the actions taken by drug pushers

the agreement which gives mcdonalds of canada a 49 percent

technology and expertise the reform is part of changes enacted 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev designed to increase the 
quality and quantity of consumer goods 
malishkov and moscow deputy mayor valery a zharov said the 
soviets hope to draw upon the expertise of the fastfood chain to 
improve service in their countrys food industry 
the first soviet mcdonalds a 650seat location on gorky street 
in the center of moscow is expected to open in the second half of 
1989 but cohon and the city officials refused to say exactly where 
the site is 
we dont want to create any lines zharov said with a smile 
at that restaurant soviets will be able to buy a big mac the 
chains trademark hamburger sandwich for 2 rubles or about 3 
another moscow location is projected that would cater to 
foreigners paying in foreign currencies

country cohon said there will be many more 
cohon said a 100000square foot commissary would be built in 
moscow to process french fries meat buns sauces and pies served 
in the restaurants 
both cohon and the soviets said most of the joint ventures 
employees would be soviet citizens but that there would be some 
foreigners in supervisory and management positions 
cohon said that through burger diplomacy workers in the 
joint venture would learn to communication and become part of a 
team 
as of the signing ceremony what the moscow mcdonalds will call 
the chains flagship sandwich appears to be undecided an 
interpreter referred both to a big mac and a bolshoi mac in 
russian bolshoi means big 
the foreign capital for the joint venture comes from mcdonalds 
of canada which has 500 restaurants 54000 employees and 
registered 125 billion in sales last year cohon said 
mcdonalds branched into eastern europe on march 24 when it 
opened a restaurant in belgrade yugoslavia it plans to open a

the bitterly divided christian 
democrats gather today to consider who will be their presidential 
candidate and how to prevent the governing party from falling apart 
at the seams 
the centrist party of president jose napoleon duarte among 
americas closest allies in the hemisphere is suffering one of the 
worst crises in its 28year history 
it was resoundingly defeated by the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena in legislative and municipal 
elections march 20 and appears on the verge of collapse 
about 1800 party members are meeting at a hotel in this capital 
to discuss who will be their candidate in presidential elections 
scheduled for next march 
duarte on tuesday called on the two main rivals julio rey 
prendes and fidel chavez mena to abandon their candidacies for 
the sake of party unity the bitter yearold battle between them 
for the nomination has left at least two people dead and several 
wounded 
chavez mena and rey prendes both party founders and former 
cabinet members rejected the presidents suggestion on wednesday 
and said they would continue their efforts 
duarte proposed abraham rodriguez the partys unsuccessful 
presidential candidate in 1967 elections as a unity nominee 
the party congress was to have endorsed a candidate in a 
nonbinding vote and a party convention of 220 delegates had been 
expected to then make the final binding decision 
but duarte urged members of the congress and delegates to the 
convention not to make their final choice today it remained to be 
seen if his suggestion would be heeded 
duarte who is limited by law to one fiveyear term warned that 
we are threatening our very existence from within the party 
monsignor arturo rivera damas the roman catholic archbishop of 
san salvador seconded that assessment during a talk with foreign 
journalists thursday 
he said the christian democrats should resolve the crisis in a 
peaceful manner if they want to survive as a party otherwise the 
division will lead them to selfdestruction

cambodian guerrillas said the west 
should exploit vietnams urgent requests for food aid to increase 
pressure for the withdrawal of 140000 vietnamese troops from 
cambodia 
if aid is given it would be like a transfusion of fresh 
blood into the body of a bloodstarved vietnam writhing in its 
death throes thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war 
of aggression in cambodia said the text of a guerrilla 
broadcast obtained today from a western embassy in bangkok 
we appeal to them instead to take advantage of this moment 
to bring greater pressure to bear on it and force it to quickly 
end its war of aggression in cambodia said the tuesday broadcast 
the broadcast came over the radio of the khmer rouge the 
largest of three guerrilla groups fighting vietnamese troops that 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 a western diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity recently said vietnamese officials appealed 
for aid in a march 14 meeting in hanoi with representatives of 
foreign countries and relief agencies 
according to official vietnamese media reports bad weather 
disease and insect plagues also have seriously damaged the rice 
crop early this year 
rice is the staple crop in vietnam aid officials say they see 
no signs of starvation on any significant scale but there is 
widespread malnutrition 
the western envoy said the vietnamese officials asked for 
fertilizer and insecticides to protect this years harvests the 
envoy said that would cost about 100 million and it was doubtful 
the international community would be able to provide it 
the envoy based in hanoi spoke on condition of anonymity 
earlier this month vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach 
suggested to visiting sen larry pressler rsd that food aid 
could be offered to peasants in areas where they were asked to help 
search for remains of americans killed in the vietnam war the 
state department said it was outraged at the suggestion the two 
issues should be linked 
the khmer rouge broadcast said the food shortages were due not 
to mistakes in agricultural policy as the vietnamese government 
has claimed but to vietnams invasion of cambodia in an attempt to 
dominate all of indochina 
the khmer rouge governed cambodia from 1975 to 1978 and an 
estimated 1 million to 2 million of cambodias 8 million people 
died from khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest

american evangelist billy graham said today he 
was encouraged by the growing but still limited religious freedom 
in china and was optimistic about christianitys future in the 
communist nation 
graham also said he had been unable to substantiate reports that 
a chinese itinerant preacher who spreads the gospel in defiance of 
the statesponsored church was arrested after arriving in beijing 
to hear the southern baptist minister 
graham speaking at a news conference in this british colony at 
the end of his 16day visit to china said he contacted highlevel 
chinese authorities and the us embassy to get information about 
the reported arrest of xu yongzhe but received neither 
verification nor denial of the report 
my wife and i have been praying daily for him if he indeed has 
been detained graham said he said he could not intervene in the 
matter but could relate my feelings about it and i have already 
done that he did not elaborate 
according to the director of the chinese church research center 
in hong kong xu was arrested april 16 after traveling to beijing 
from central china to hear graham the center has links to 
protestants in china who worship in unofficial house churches 
a source in beijing with links to preachers outside the 
statesanctioned church has confirmed xus arrest 
graham said he did not know xu and had not heard of him before 
his reported detention 
the 69yearold graham spoke with government leaders and 
christians from inside and outside the official chinese church 
during his first china trip which took him to beijing nanking 
shanghai and canton 
christians form a tiny minority of chinas 1 billion people the 
official protestant church has about 4 million members as does the 
official catholic church which does not recognize vatican 
authority 
millions of other christians are believed to practice their 
faith independently in the privacy of their homes 
graham said some people told him of persecution during the 
ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution during which religion 
was banned graham also heard of christians still suffering 
discrimination in income housing education and social status 
because of their faith 
the evangelist said he was encouraged that there is now a 
limited id like you to underscore the word limited measure 
of religious freedom and that thousands of churches have reopened 
in recent years i expressed the hope there will be steady progress 
toward greater religious freedom for all believers 
graham said he was very optimistic about the future of the 
christian faith in china christians in china could be salt and 
light in chinese society and could be a great moral and spiritual 
force for good in the nation where god has placed them 
graham said he would like to return to china but indicated he 
probably would not speak before huge stadium crowds as he has done 
in many of the nearly 70 other countries he has visited

panamanian gen antonio manuel noriega doesnt have 
to surrender to us authorities in order to challenge his drug 
indictment a federal judge has ruled 
the best way to avoid the appearance that this indictment has 
assumed the character of a political proceeding rather than a 
legal one is to determine its legal validity upon the arguments of 
counsel us district judge william hoeveler said thursday 
the judge gave noriegas attorney neal sonnett 10 days to 
submit challenges to the feb 4 indictment hoeveler said he would 
set a hearing date after the government responded 
sonnett hailed the ruling which does not affect a separate 
noriega drug indictment in tampa 
i think it is an outstanding legal victory for gen noriega 
and a wellreasoned opinion on the part of judge hoeveler the 
attorney said 
the lead prosecutor in the case chief assistant us attorney 
richard gregorie was traveling thursday and unavailable for 
comment 
gregorie has said that if noriega wants to challenge the 
indictment he should surrender himself 
noriega is accused in the 12count indictment of taking at least 
46 million in payoffs from members of the medellin cartel to 
protect cocaine shipments launder money supply drug laboratories 
and shelter the colombian gang leaders from law enforcement 
sonnett who has traveled to panama to meet with noriega cited 
new york draft resister cases in which attorneys were allowed to 
make arguments while their clients were in canada 
the judge agreed noting that the justice department has not 
yet sought extraditon of gen noriega and it does not appear 
likely that it will seek extradition in the near future 
in another development it was disclosed thursday that the 
federal prosecutor whose office issued the feb 4 indictment naming 
noriega will resign june 17 and rejoin his former law firm 
us attorney leon kellner whose office is responsible for the 
southern district of florida the nations busiest in terms of 
caseload will resign for personal reasons said his executive 
assistant ana barnett

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
today urged president reagan not to veto legislation requiring 
companies to give notice before closing plants telling union 
members that workers deserve better from america 
i hope the president will take the time to think about the 
three million american workers who lose their jobs in this country 
every year through plant shutdowns dukakis said in at least 
half those cases those plants shut down with little or no notice 
to those most affected their own employees 
dukakis referred to trade legislation passed by congress this 
week but which the white house says reagan will veto because of an 
amendment requiring notice before plants are closed republican 
opponents say the measure does not belong in the trade bill and 
would be undue government interference with business 
these people are our neighbors said dukakis in prepared 
remarks they deserve better from their employers they deserve 
better from america 
dukakis began campaigning in ohio and indiana where primaries 
are scheduled next tuesday 
after taking a break back home in boston following his huge 
victory in pennsylvania over his only remaining rival for the 
democratic presidential nomination jesse jackson dukakis was 
speaking to a meeting of ohio labor leaders at the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers local 683 hall in columbus 
he resumed attacks on corporate mergers and acquisitions which 
he said provide profits for wall street pirates and corporate hit 
teams while costing workers their jobs 
dukakis who arrived in columbus on thursday night had stops 
today including a rally in dayton and a visit to a high school in 
youngstown 
dukakis backers here expressed confidence that momentum from 
victories in new york and pennsylvania will help him roll up a big 
win in ohio as well 
state sen harry meshel of youngstown dukakis ohio campaign 
chairman pointed to a statewide network of 170 public officials 
supporting the massachusetts governor however gov richard 
celeste has not taken sides 
celeste was to appear with dukakis but also planned to join 
jackson for a church service on sunday in cleveland jackson has 
been in the state most of the week 
ohio has 159 delegates up for grabs tuesday with another 24 to 
be added at the convention by various democratic procedures 
before leaving for ohio the massachusetts governor released 
copies of letters sent to reagan and congressional leaders urging 
enactment of the trade bill 
mr president i believe that our record trade deficit 
requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that 
will be in the best interest of all americans dukakis said in 
the letter he said the bill will help return the united states 
to a position in the world where we can once again compete 
successfully with all of our trading partners 
at a news conference dukakis said he would make the trade bill 
a major part of his attack on bush if reagan vetoes the measure 
i think the issues of workers being laid off what is 
happening to the industrial base of this country and the failure 
of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new 
president would do to work hard with business and labor and 
community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our 
industrial base will be very much one of the major issues he 
told reporters 
dukakis has made the plantclosing issue a campaign theme in the 
industrial states he has called on bush the certain republican 
nominee to publicly urge reagan to sign the trade bill

prime minister margaret thatcher today denounced a 
television documentary that contradicted the official version of 
the killing of three unarmed ira guerrillas by british commandos 
the freedom of people depends on the rule of law a fair legal 
system she told a japanese television interviewer the place 
to have trials is a court of law trial by tv or guilt by 
accusation is the day that freedom dies 
television authorities rejected a government request to delay 
the broadcast and the hourlong documentary death on the rock 
aired thursday night 
the program said the guerrillas died while trying to flee or 
surrender to the commandos in gibraltar foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe had said the guerrillas made movements which led 
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger 
thames television said it received scores of calls after the 
broadcast running about 32 against the decision to screen the 
film 
howe called the broadcast grossly and wholly improper and 
said in a british broadcasting corp radio interview that it had 
inevitably been shown on satellite tv in gibraltar where it 
might influence an inquest jury 
gerry adams president of sinn fein legal political arm of the 
outlawed irish republican army said the allegations showed clearly 
the guerrillas were summarily executed 
the foreign office said the thames television program featured 
people due to testify at the inquest in gibraltar and complained 
that their accounts would influence the hearing it had asked lord 
thomson chairman of the controlling independent broadcasting 
authority to delay broadcasting the program 
thomson turned down the request denied the documentary would 
prejudice the inquest and said postponement would give the ira more 
oxygen of publicity 
thames tv said the documentary was the result of a sevenweek 
investigation which included interviews with 150 residents of 
apartments overlooking the area where the guerrillas were shot 
march 6 
in the documentary translator carmen proetta said she saw the 
shootings from her apartment window in the british colony that 
borders spain 
mrs proetta said she saw three armed men in plainclothes get 
out of a police car jump over a metal barrier in the road and open 
fire on two of the guerrillas later identified as mairead farrell 
31 and daniel mccann 30 
when they ms farrell and mccann saw these men had guns in 
their hands they just put their hands up there was no chance 
i mean they went to the floor immediately they dropped mrs 
proetta said 
she described the guerrillas action in putting their hands up 
as like giving themselves up 
mrs proetta said that after the initial shooting which she 
said occurred without warning a blond gunman bent down and with 
the two hands he got his gun like that and went on shooting at 
them 
others described seeing the third guerrilla sean savage 24 
shot in the back as he tried to run away 
mrs proettas account appeared to contradict howes march 7 
statement to parliament that the guerrillas were challenged as they 
walked toward the nearby spanish border and were slain because they 
made movements which led security personnel to believe their 
lives were in danger 
the ira said at the time that the guerrillas had been on 
active service meaning they were planning an attack 
the gibraltar killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in 
northern ireland in which nine people including two british 
soldiers died 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the republic of ireland

opec talks aimed at shoring up oil prices 
bogged down early today in a technical debate that one cartel 
leader called a waste of time 
a nearly fourhour meeting over a proposal to cut oil exports in 
conjunction with independent producers broke up early today without 
any agreements and leaders of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries said they would reconvene this evening 
they said no agreements had been reached 
fernando santos the oil minister of ecuador told reporters 
later that it was impossible to predict whether an accord could be 
reached since theres a wide divergence of views among the 13 
opec members 
the oil ministers are considering a proposal from six nonopec 
oil producers to cut both groups exports by 5 percent in an effort 
to push opec oil prices back to 18 a barrel 
the nonopec group says it will cut its exports only if opec 
does likewise 
but opinions differ sharply within the cartel over whether 
further cutbacks are needed and there are indications some members 
including influential saudi arabia favor enforcement of 
existing output quotas over new cuts 
world oil prices continued sliding early today as the opec 
leaders struggled to resolve their differences 
on the european market brent crude oil from the north sea was 
down 35 cents a barrel at 1680 at midafternoon after having 
lost 30 cents on thursday the us oil markets hadnt yet opened 
traders said the declines reflected doubts that the oil 
ministers meeting would produce a concrete agreement on measures 
designed to boost the oil market 
prices have fallen this year because supplies have risen faster 
than demand 
most opec crudes are selling for 16 a barrel or less although 
oil traded in the west usually sells for more 
on the new york mercantile exchange june contracts for west 
texas intermediate the most widely traded us crude fell 29 
cents to 1798 dollars a barrel on thursday after dropping 33 
cents the day before prices on european markets fell about 30 
cents a barrel on thursday 
some industry analysts believe prices would rebound if opec 
accepted the nonopec offer but others doubt that opec could agree 
on reductions large enough to make a difference in the global 
balance of supply and demand 
opecs opening debate focused more on differing views of the oil 
markets supply and demand balance than on the merits of the 
nonopec groups proposal according to sources who spoke on 
condition they not be identified by name or nationality 
in an apparent effort to bridge the gap in these views the oil 
ministers instructed a team of experts from each member country to 
meet today to assess the present and nearterm market balance 
arturo hernandez grisanti venezuelas oil minister told 
reporters he was unhappy that time was being devoted to a meeting 
of experts which he said only would highlight the differing views 
between opec countries 
this is in some sense a waste of time he said 
hernandez said one suggestion under consideration was to forego 
the proposed export cuts in favor of recommitting the 13 members to 
existing oil production quotas which often are violated 
we know that several countries have been overproducing for 
years he said without naming the countries 
if we can have a full guarantee that these countries are 
going to abide by their quotas that would improve the market 
situation but i have a lot of doubt about that he said 
iran was alone among the opec members in stating its clear 
support for the nonopec offer none have rejected it outright 
hisham nazer the saudi arabian oil minister declined to say 
whether his country favored the nonopec proposal made wednesday 
by mexico egypt china oman angola and malaysia 
but saudi king fahd on thursday bolstered the impression of many 
industry analysts that he would not accept any cuts in opec 
production or exports he said the cartels main goal should be to 
stick to its existing production limits 
i believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling 
and convince nonopec producers of the feasibility of limiting 
their production he said in an interview published by a kuwaiti 
newspaper 
bryan jacoboski who was observing the opec meeting for the 
investment firm painewebber inc said fahds statement was the 
real nail in the coffin of expectations that the cartel would 
accept the nonopec proposal

defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of 
rep mario biaggi are continuing their campaign to put the reagan 
administration on trial for the wedtech corp scandal 
on thursday they got a prosecution witness to admit under 
crossexamination that wedtech hired a distant relative of vice 
president george bush partly because of his contact with the vice 
president 
but the witness wedtech former chief financial officer lawrence 
shorten denied that charles dickey dyer iii related to bush by 
marriage was hired as a management consultant to win bushs 
support for wedtechs bid to obtain a multimilliondollar navy 
contract 
shorten said dyer was hired before he joined wedtech and shorten 
did not think dyer was still working for the bronx defense 
contractor in 1984 when a navy pontoon contract was up 
steve hart a bush spokesman confirmed that dyer is related to 
bush through marriage but said the vice president had nothing to 
do with contracts dyers younger sister margie is married to 
bushs wifes older brother james pierce 
in a telephone interview dyer said he stopped working for 
wedtech in the fall of 1981 although payment for his consulting 
services was strung out until early 1984 
dyer reached at his princeton nj home also denied speaking 
or writing to bush about wedtechs attempt to get a navy pontoon 
contract 
if they wedtech officials had any influence with george 
bush i didnt get it for them he said 
however dyer said he did write the vice president at least 
twice on the companys behalf about an army engine contract in 1981 
hart said bush received five or six letters from dyer 
we have looked into this before and i have seen the letters 
he said the vice president either didnt respond to the letters 
or in the cases where he did respond they were very cursory 
responses 
we have no records of any type of involvement or any action 
involving navy contracts that would suggest the vice president took 
any position one way or another 
he said that bush as chairman of the presidents regulatory 
relief task force often gets letters from small businesses 
in the courtroom shorten also said he was told by a close 
friend of attorney general edwin meese iii that he would have 
president reagan overrule the navy if they did not give the 
contract to wedtech 
the witness is one of four former top wedtech executives who 
have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges all four are now 
cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency 
biaggi and six others are accused of turning wedtech now 
bankrupt into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of 
dollars in bribes to obtain nobid government contracts through a 
program for minoritycontrolled businesses 
defense lawyers have tried to show that wedtech officials had 
close links to highranking officials in the reagan white house and 
did not need the help of a democratic congressman from the bronx

by her daughters account stella nickell put 
cyanide in pain relief capsules to poison her husband of 12 years 
for as much as 176000 in life insurance benefits 
mrs nickell however says she loved bruce nickell more than 
money and her defense lawyer notes that her daughter cindy 
hamilton 28 came forward after pharmaceutical companies offered a 
300000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever 
was responsible for the tampering 
a us district court jury will likely begin deciding between 
those two accounts monday in the nations first 
deathbyproducttampering trial 
testimony before the 12member panel and judge william dwyer 
ended thursday after a government witness supported part of ms 
hamiltons version 
closing arguments were set for monday followed by instructions 
to the jury and the start of deliberations 
mrs nickell 44 is charged with five counts of tampering with 
overthecounter medicine including two involving the death of her 
52yearold husband and sue katherine snow 40 in june 1986 both 
died after swallowing cyanidelaced capsules of extrastrength 
excedrin 
government lawyers claim she tampered with other painrelief 
capsules and put them on store shelves to cover up the killing of 
her husband 
the last witness katherine parker said she was rooming with 
ms hamilton in november 1985 when ms hamilton reported what she 
thought were her mothers plans 
cindy came home and said katy do you know what my mother 
just said to me she asked me how much cocaine it would take to 
kill a person ms parker testified she said that her mother 
had been talking about getting rid of her stepfather she was 
getting tired of him 
ms hamilton had testified tuesday that her mother discussed 
putting cocaine in nickells iced tea to make his death look like 
an overdose 
in crossexamination earlier thursday assistant us attorney 
joanne maida noted that shortly before nickells death mrs 
nickell had twice written a bank to which they owed money to say 
she was taking over the finances and that the couples marriage 
problems would soon be resolved 
mrs nickell responded that she loved her husband and did not 
try to hide insurance policies all signed by her from fbi 
investigators 
she confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an 
investment company 8553 at the time plus a lot more to clear 
titles on their land and mobile home but she denied that their 
financial situation was getting worse and noted that both were 
employed 
her lawyer tom hillier asked if she were responsible for the 
crimes 
no she replied the thought never entered my mind and 
never would because i loved bruce too much theres no way id ever 
think of getting rid of him 
the prosecution also introduced evidence showing that mrs 
nickell had checked out library books on poisonous plants in 1983 
and 1984 she said she had borrowed the books to make sure that 
plants on her rural property werent harmful to her grandchildren

prime minister prem tinsulanonda 
dissolved his cabinet and the parliament today and called new 
elections in a dispute over legislation to protect us copyrights 
the official radio thailand said general elections would be held 
july 24 
earlier today 16 cabinet ministers belonging to the main party 
in prems coalition government submitted their resignations after 
failing to stop party dissidents from voting against the 
governmentbacked bill to protect american copyrights 
the democrat party ministers representing about a third of the 
cabinet resigned because they could not control the party 
dissidents said col sanan kachornprasat the partys secretary 
general 
the radio announcement said prem and would continue at his post 
until the election 
prem thailands longestserving prime minster has headed five 
cabinets since assuming his post in 1980 the last general election 
was held in 1986 
the dissolution of parliament forestalled a probable opposition 
motion to censure the government over its handling of various 
issues including economic problems and recent border clashes with 
laos the censure motion had been expected may 9 
the house of representatives passed the copyright bill 183134 
on thursday but 32 legislators in the dissident group joined 
members of opposition parties in voting against it 
the dissidents said the legislation which protects us 
copyrights of artistic and literary works would force thailand to 
bow to us bullying the united states had indicated that it might 
be forced to cut duty privileges for thai imports if the measure 
wasnt passed 
music and videocassettes and other us products are widely 
pirated in thailand the legislation is expected to be approved by 
the governmentappointed senate 
the us embassy today welcomed passage of the copyright bill 
although it didnt meet an american demand that it specifically 
protect computer software the legislation left that question to 
the thai courts 
we are prepared to await the determination of the thai courts 
as to whether or not software is covered under the existing thai 
copyright law said embassy spokesman ross petzing we believe

defense attorneys after listening to 
22 weeks of government testimony and 115 witnesses will begin 
presenting their case monday in the cocainesmuggling trial of 
carlos lehder rivas 
edward r shohat one of lehders two attorneys said earlier 
this week that the defense case may only take two weeks but 
estimates in this marathon trial have been notoriously conservative 
when the jury selection started in october attorneys said they 
expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months but 
counting jury selection and a twoweek christmas recess the trial 
has ended its 30th week 
lehder 38 accused of being one of the leaders of colombias 
violent medellin cocaine cartel and jack carlton reed 57 are 
being tried on charges of conspiring to smuggle some 33 tons of 
cocaine into the united states through lehders private island in 
the bahamas normans cay from 1978 to 1980 
the prosecution wrapped up its case shortly after noon thursday 
following the presentation of interviews lehder gave earlier this 
decade on colombian radio and television 
us attorney robert w merkle had argued that the presentation 
of the tapes was essential to his case although us district 
judge howell w melton ordered references to adolf hitler and the 
slaying of colombian justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla edited 
from the tapes 
the judge denied motions from defense attorneys for directed 
judgments of acquittal to the charges contained in the 11count 
federal indictment 
in the tapes the jury heard lehder deny several times that he 
was a drug smuggler 
i have never admitted that i have dealt or done any business 
with drugs lehder said in a jungle interview in 1985 
in the same interview however he said this is about 
political action and cocaine has become and marijuana has become 
a revolutionary weapon in the struggle against north american 
imperialism 
stimulants from colombia are the achilles heel of 
imperialism thats why the persecution against us is not legal it 
is political but i have never been arrested in possession of any 
drug whatsoever 
the colombian also made antiamerican statements calling the 
united states a country guided by playboy magazine guided by 
a society let us say drunken on pornography 
he also opposed the extradition treaty that eventually resulted 
in his arrest on the charges for which he is being tried 
so then they say i conspired against the united states i say 
that not only did i conspire but that i conspire now and that i 
shall continue to conspire until the day the extradition 
treaty is canceled 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy

the leader of an armenian terrorist group who was assassinated 
outside his athens home had lived in greece for the past year 
agop agopian was gunned down before dawn thursday as he waited 
for a taxi in front of his suburban apartment police sources said 
agopian lived in greece for at least a year posing as a lebanese 
businessmen he was founder and chief of the armenian secret army 
for the liberation of armenia 
authorities in greece didnt know his identity government 
spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said 
agopian also carried a south yemen diplomatic passport in the 
name of abdul mohammed kasim 
kostopoulos said agopian who was not registered as a diplomat 
here had not been working in greece 
agopian and a woman identified as his sisterinlaw were 
standing in front of agopians home when two masked men emerged 
from a car 
one man shot agopian twice with a sawedoff shotgun and fired 
again when the victim tried to run the assailants fled the woman 
was unhurt 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing 
the assassination could have been the work of a rival extremist 
group said armenian sources in athens who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
police at first identified the victim as 39yearold abdul 
mohammed kashim born in aden based on the south yemeni diplomatic 
passport he carried 
hed lived in athens for at least a year possibly longer 
as henri titizian but he traveled abroad very frequently on the 
yemeni passport said a police source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but after reports from paris said the dead man was the 
longsought leader of the terrorist group his wife janil 
titizian confirmed he was agop agopian the ministry of public 
order said in a statement 
police said ms titizian told them her husband recently arrived 
from south yemen and was on his way to yugoslavia 
the group founded by agopian in 1975 has claimed more than 60 
attacks against turkish targets including the killings of about 30 
turkish diplomats and dependents in western europe and the united 
states 
the marxist organization seeks the foundation of an independent 
armenian state in eastern turkey and vengeance for what they claim 
was the massacre of 15 million armenians by ottoman turks in 
19151916 
the armenian sources said agopian was born in iraq in 1945 and 
that his name was most likely a pseudonym 
he ran the group from beirut with funding from the palestine 
liberation organization and leftist groups but dropped out of sight 
in july 1982 
his group claimed responsibility for the july 1983 bombing of 
the turkish airlines desk at orly airport in paris that killed 
eight people and injured 56 
agopians former secondincommand monte melkonian formed a 
splinter group called asalarevolutionary movement after the orly 
bombing complaining that asala had abandoned its original policy 
of focusing only on turkish targets 
asala has claimed only one attack in athens the killing of 
turkish diplomat galip ozman and his daughter in august 1980 the 
groups political wing the armenian popular movement has operated 
an office in the greek capital for several years

syria during world war i independent historians say at least 
600000 armenians died during the journey

a group affiliated with ralph nader plans to 
push the food and drug administration to more severely restrict a 
powerful antiacne drug that causes birth defects a doctor 
representing the organization said today 
we have an fda with strong laws but weak enforcement said 
dr sidney wolfe of the health research group of public citizen an 
organization that has long been critical of the fda 
american families are too important to be left to a reagan 
administration that seems to give deference to the drug industry 
wolfe said in an interview on nbctvs today 
an fda advisory panel recommended earlier this week that the 
drug accutane remain on the market because it is the only effective 
cure for severe acne but it urged that additional warnings be 
added to new packaging to further discourage use by pregnant women 
and that the fda find a way to legally restrict the drugs 
distribution 
the fda is not bound by the advisory panels recommendations 
wolfe said public citizen would file a petition with the fda to 
implement strong restrictions and is considering filing a lawsuit 
he recommended that dermatologists who prescribe the drug be 
required to sign a sworn statement that they will not misuse it 
accutanes manufacturer laroche laboratories of new jersey had 
proposed new packaging that would more effectively warn against its 
use by pregnant women 
the manufacture acknowledges 62 us cases of birth defects 
caused by accutane since the drug was introduced in 1982 wolfe 
said there could be several hundreds more and thousands of 
abortions induced because of fear of the drugs side effects a 
confidential fda memorandum reported last week by the new york 
times estimated that between 900 and 1300 cases of birth defects 
were caused by accutane between 1982 and 1986 
the company has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
this drug and the fda seems resistant to doing something that would 
significantly reduce the sales wolfe said 
its a very important drug he said and the question is 
why cant it be limited carefully to the smaller number of people 
who really need it without giving it to a larger number of people 
and allowing pregnant women to get the drug

percent of americans chose improved efficiency as the key to 
reducing the trade deficit compared to 24 percent who chose 
fairer trade practices

pat robertsons presidential campaign has 
until may 12 to submit financial records in a federal investigation 
of the taxexempt status of the former television evangelists 
broadcasting network 
us magistrate rebecca b smith on thursday extended a 
showcause order for two weeks for documents originally requested 
by the internal revenue last december 
robert l odonnell attorney for americans for robertson said 
the records would be available within five days 
we have not opposed any of the requests and have made records 
available as quickly as possible he said in asking for a 
continuance of an order filed late last month 
in addition to financial data the irs asked for copies of 
fundraising letters and records of any transactions with the 
freedom council or christian broadcasting network 
cbn was founded by robertson who was its president until last 
october when he announced his candidacy for the republican 
presidential nomination 
the freedom council was established in 1981 with seed money from 
cbn and sought tax exempt status from the irs saying it was 
created to educate christians on how to get involved in politics 
the organization received nearly 3 million from the network in 
1985 according to former council officials and critics contend the 
council which disbanded in 1986 shortly after americans for 
robertson was formed acted as a front for the robertson campaign

with urban that the government would announce in a few days tax law

jesse jackson says he wont give up his 
democratic presidential bid despite a string of losses but he says 
his role now is to raise distinctions between his positions and 
those of democratic rival michael dukakis and republican george 
bush 
jackson on thursday underscored what he considers dukakis 
weaknesses domestic economic proposals and the situation in 
southern africa and he said that his own platform offers voters a 
clear alternative to the frontrunner in contrast to the 
conciliatory tone he has struck throughout the primary campaign 
jackson appears to be taking off the gloves a bit with dukakis 
in speeches thursday he also criticized the massachusetts 
governor for not having a plan to pay for his proposal to provide 
higher education for every young person 
in an interview with the associated press jackson said he wants 
to keep his campaign issues on his partys political agenda even if 
he does not become the democratic nominee but he said he is not 
conceding the nomination to dukakis as the governor is pulling away 
from him in the delegate count 
my role now is to raise distinctions and give people a 
choice he said 
the ap delegate count shows dukakis has amassed 1276 delegates 
to jacksons 852 with 2081 needed to win the nomination this 
summer 
ive got my second wind jackson told a gymnasium full of 
fans at the university of toledo ive just begun to fight 
as for comments attributed to his campaign manager gerald 
austin implying that the campaign was now focused less on winning 
than on contributing to the party jackson told the ap our 
campaign is a campaign of commitment and content there is no 
conflict between campaigning to win and having issues of content to 
make a difference 
we are trying to win when youre behind you run a little 
faster 
jacksons message on thursday was that bush as a member of 
president reagans team wants to continue reaganomics while 
dukakis wants to manage reaganomics i want to reverse 
reaganomics 
he said dukakis is to the right of reagan on south africa 
because reagan is willing to provide weaponry to mozambique against 
alleged south africanbacked rebels while dukakis would not do so 
jackson also lobbed criticism at democratic party chief paul 
kirk saying in the interview that kirk should have stepped in when 
new york mayor ed koch was savaging jackson as an antiisrael 
candidate 
jackson also indicated unhappiness with the partys oversight of 
delegate selection in some states and in puerto rico he would not 
say whether he would challenge any delegate apportionment but said 
those matters are left to austin and campaign chairman willie brown 
reflecting on the months of campaigning jackson said he feels 
he has injected issues that became part of the political dialogue 
our message has been adopted and absorbed he said so now 
dukakis is going to schools to speak to students about drugs hes 
talking about reinvesting in america 
at stake in tuesdays ohio primary are 159 democratic delegates 
a gallup poll this month showed dukakis with a 2to1 lead among 
democratic voters

the number of infant deaths in the united states 
has decreased according to a report by the federal health 
officials 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
for every 1000 live births in the united states in 198485 
premature deaths robbed those infants under age 1 of 694 years of 
life they would have had if they had lived to be age 65 
that was down 7 percent from the average of 749 years for 
198083 
the cdc measures years of potential life lost by people 
dying before 65 as a way to gauge the killers of younger people 
sixtyfive is used as a statistical benchmark most americans life 
expectancy is higher 
since the number of infant deaths depends in part on the number 
of infant births cdc looked at the years of potential life 
lost averages to gauge trends in infant mortality 
deaths of infants between birth and age 1 take the greatest 
amount of potential life of all in 1985 the united states 
recorded 40000 such deaths 
the cdc found that between 198083 and the period 198485 the 
years of potential life lost due to prematurity and low 
birthweight respiratory distress birth trauma and other factors 
went down for both black and white infants 
the atlantabased cdc in its weekly report particularly noted 
a sharp drop in potential life lost to birth trauma and asphyxia 
down 33 percent for whites and 31 percent for blacks 
it makes us curious to look at why ms rowley said 
the cdc said that the marked decline due to birth trauma 
or asphyxia suggests either better care for newborns at birth 
better neonatal care for babies suffering from birth trauma or 
asphyxia or both 
the cdc also found that nonwhite infants die prematurely more 
often than whites although death rates for both groups are 
declining 
although there were fewer years of potential life lost for 
both whites and blacks theres still a big gap between those two 
groups said dr dianne rowley of the cdc 
in recent years she noted there have been programs and 
strategies initiated to try and diminish the excess numbers of 
deaths among blacks and other minorities it will be a while before 
we can evaluate those efforts

hundreds of palestinians demonstrated on the 
moslem sabbath today sources said israeli troops were scouring 
south lebanon in a crackdown on arab guerrillas who sneak across 
the border into israel 
israel radio reported that a small israeli army force entered 
the lebanese villages of kfar hamam and rachaiya el foukhar both 
about five miles north of the israeli border and questioned 
several dozen residents 
security sources in lebanon confirmed that israeli troops and 
their lebanese allies were carrying out searches but said most were 
not in villages but in the rocky terrain in south lebanons eastern 
sector 
the sources who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said five lebanese villagers had been detained 
an army spokesman said two militiamen from the israeliallied 
south lebanon army were killed today when their vehicle ran over a 
land mine on a side road in israels selfdeclared security zone 
north of the border 
the interrogations came after two guerrilla infiltrations within 
two days this week in which two israeli soldiers and five 
palestinian guerrillas were killed 
in jerusalem several hundred arabs demonstrated outside the al 
aqsa mosque after the noon moslem prayers chanting palestine is 
arab and jews leave because the prophet mohammeds army is 
returning 
the demonstrators dispersed without confronting police who were 
stationed nearby 
some of the protesters waved outlawed palestinian flags and 
shouted slogans about plo military leader khalil wazir who was 
assassinated april 16 israeli sources have said israeli commandos 
killed him but the government has not confirmed it 
in the surrounding streets of old jerusalem palestinian 
shopkeepers began opening their stores promptly at 2 pm the hour 
that leaders of the fiveweekold uprising have dictated for shops 
to open during the moslem holy month of ramadan

despite claims by israeli leaders that the arab rebellion was 
waning the death toll rose again thursday with the killing of a 
protester in malek a village near the west bank city of ramallah 
soon after entering the village to search for rioters troops 
were surrounded by hundreds of young arabs who hurled stones and 
then a firebomb the army spokesman said the troops fired in the 
direction of the firebomb thrower killing a palestinian he said 
it was not immediately clear if the slain youth threw the 
firebomb 
the killing raised the arab death toll to 175 since the violence 
began in the territories last dec 8 an israeli soldier and 
israeli teenager have also died

house speaker jim wright said today he doesnt 
like the idea of taking coast guard patrol boats off antidrug 
patrols and moving them to the persian gulf 
i think the average american citizen feels more threatened by 
drugs than by events in the gulf the texas democrat told 
reporters i dont think its a good idea to rob the coast guard 
of its principal missions here one of them being antidrug 
efforts 
wrights comments came a day after the chairman of the house 
armed services committee predicted that the house will 
overwhelmingly vote to block tentative plans to send coast guard 
patrol boats to the gulf 
its not going to even be close said rep les aspin dwis 
referring to a proposal introduced to stop the plan now being 
considered by the pentagon 
the ban will be voted upon by the house next week as the chamber 
continues consideration of the pentagon budget bill 
even though the bill wont become law for several months because 
the senate hasnt yet considered its version of the same measure a 
strong house vote against the plan will likely kill it aspin said 
thursday 
as a practical political matter the administration would not 
be wise to do something that a large majority of congress is 
against and this amendment will win easily aspin explained 
the tentative plan calls for taking six of the coast guards 
110foot islandclass patrol boats off antidrug duty and sending 
them to the persian gulf built for shallow waters the boats would 
help the navy patrol the wartorn area 
the navy is escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers raising 
fears in congress that the united states will be drawn into the 
iraniraq war because of kuwaits ties with iraq there have been 
several usiran naval clashes most recently april 18 when navy 
ships and planes sank or damaged six iranian vessels 
adm paul a yost coast guard commandant told a senate 
subcommittee thursday that he would be delighted to send the 
ships to the gulf if ordered to do so 
yost said the move would have only a minimal impact on 
antidrug efforts because new islandclass builts are being built 
and other ships could be pulled into the antidrug effort off the 
florida coasts and in the caribbean 
but the plan has run into heavy fire on capitol hill 
rep mike lowry dwash a cosponsor of the measure to which 
aspin referred said the reagan administration should use the 
coast guards scarce resources to fight the war on drugs not the 
iraniraq war 
the coast coast is strapped for money and has responded to a 
100 million shortfall in its current budget by closing more than 
30 shore installations and cutting antidrug patrols by 55 percent 
but the navy has offered to pay any costs of sending the coast 
guard vessels to the gulf said yost though part of the 
transportation department the coast guard also has national 
security responsibilities and coast guard ships often operate with 
navy vessels 
yost appeared before the senate appropriations transportation 
subcommittee where he defended the plan but when questioned 
earlier about antidrug efforts he admitted you can always use 
more money and boats 
it seems to me were going to hurt our drug efforts by 
sending the boats to the gulf said sen mark hatfield rore 
sen alfonse damato rny was even more critical i think 
its an incredible policy he told yost we kind of bumbled our 
way into this 
but yost said this is not an idea off the top of somebodys 
head it was well thought out and researched 
lowry disagreed sending the coast guard to the gulf would be 
just another tragic dangerous and poorly conceived move by the 
administration he said

a team of american and soviet scientists 
headed into the nevada desert today to begin a series of 
experiments they hope will prove that a cheatproof ban on all 
testing is possible 
the experiments today and saturday come on the heels of the 
houses passage of a bill thursday forbidding all but the smallest 
nuclear tests if the soviet union agreed to do the same 
scores of seismic monitors have been set up to record three 
nonnuclear explosions in remote areas of the state to try to 
demonstrate that if a ussoviet test ban treaty is signed any 
infraction could be detected 
if the experiments are successful they would show that any 
chance for cheating are about excluded under a test ban evgeni 
velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of sciences said 
thursday 
velikhov an adviser to mikhail gorbachev said we think the 
comprehensive test ban is very important it is extremely important 
to stop the arms race 
the experiment is part of an agreement between the soviet 
academy of sciences and the privatelyfunded natural resources 
defense council of the united states 
the nevada tests will set off 10 tons of tnt in the black rock 
desert 15 miles northeast of here and 100 miles north of reno today 
and another 10ton blast tonight in lathrop wells 50 miles south 
of the nevada test site a 15ton charge was to be detonated 
saturday in broken hills 100 miles east of carson city 
the blasts will be monitored at three permanent centers 
surrounding the test site including one in deep springs calif 
25 miles east of bishop calif where the soviet technicians have 
installed a ton of their own scientific devices for the first time 
in this country 
typical underground nuclear explosions are measured in 
hundreds or thousands of tons of tnt dr thomas cochran senior 
staff scientist of the natural resources defense council told the 
news conference by detonating only 1015 tons we will show that 
it is possible to detect very small explosions 
by comparison the bill passed in the house on thursday called 
for a ban on all underground nuclear explosions equivalent to more 
than 1000 tons of tnt if the soviet union agreed to do the same 
one objection to a test ban has been that lowyield blasts could 
go virtually undetected particularly if they were muffled in deep 
caverns the equipment being used in nevada is designed to be 
sophisticated enough to feel the difference between nuclear and 
industrial explosions and very small earthquakes cochran 
said 
in addition to the equipment from the soviet academy of sciences 
and the natura resources defense center the university of 
nevadareno and the university of wisconsin are taking readings at 
23 sites and the us geological survey has installed 120 
seismometers and recorders along a line from the northwest corner 
of the state to its southern tip 450 miles away

the island of ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with french 
authorities bianconi was the second hostage in two days released 
to mediate

a police station that left four gendarmes dead twelve of those 
hostages later were freed 
the attack was aimed at halting sundays french presidential 
elections on the island 
also on thursday bernard pons minister for overseas 
territories said in noumea that he has asked the government to 
outlaw the kanak front

kanak front as a terrorist faction that does not represent the 
new caledonian population 
i will do everything so that this group is reduced chirac 
said during a televised debate with socialist president francois 
mitterrand his rival in presidential runoff elections may 8 
what counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and 
judicial offical mitterrand said but what counts tomorrow is 
dialogue 
yeiwene yeiwene the no 2 leader in the kanak political group 
said banning the organization would not settle the crisis in new 
caledonia and will not stop the kanak people from taking the fight 
for independence to its end 
an estimated 4000 french troops and gendarmes are in new 
caledonia 
the kidnappers demanded police reinforcements be removed from 
the islands they asked that mediators be sent from paris to 
discuss a new referendum on selfdetermination

customs investigators in london seized 35 tons of 
afghan hashish in the firstever narcotics bust involving britain 
and the soviet union authorities said today 
the drugs came from afghanistan overland through the soviet 
union the soviet authorities got wind of that and agreed to 
cooperate in tracking them letting them out of the soviet union 
and to the united kingdom so that we were able to seize them 
here said home office minister peter lilley 
officers tracked the drugs from kabul the afghan capital by 
rail across the soviet union and by sea from leningrad to londons 
tilbury docks said a customs and excise spokesman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said five men all british were arrested thursday night it 
was not known whether the soviets made any arrests on their own 
territory 
the spokesman said the seizure codenamed operation diplomat 
arose from a visit by prime minister margaret thatcher to moscow 
last year during the visit british foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze discussed ways 
of cooperating against drugs 
in july officials from both countries got together to work out 
practical arrangements for fighting drug smuggling and a 
memorandum of understanding was signed in february 
just before this soviet authorities intercepted the hashish 
hidden in 400 sacks of liquorice root and packed in two containers 
a british customs agent traveled to moscow and plans were made 
to find the drug traffickers the soviets agreed to let the 
containers continue their journey under surveillance 
british investigators took over the watch when the containers 
left leningrad and when they reached tilbury a month ago the drugs 
were secretly removed from the cargo which was then repacked and 
kept under observation the spokesman said 
last thursday officers watched as the containers were collected 
from tilbury and driven to a warehouse in an industrial zone on an 
abandoned us air force base in warrington northwest england 
the load was then moved to storehouses in london and the 
customs investigators began making the arrests the spokesman said

the soviet union despite a new emphasis on 
arms control initiatives and economic improvements continues to 
build and modernize its military might in pursuit of an advantage 
over the west the pentagon said today 
releasing its seventh annual assessment of soviet forces the 
defense department reported there were signs the military 
competition between the two superpowers would soon expand into new 
fields for example the development of hightech conventional 
weapons instead of nuclear arms 
indeed the strategic nuclear balance is essentially stable 
the report states 
to date however we have seen no evidence of the ussr 
changing the offensive nature of its force structure and deployment 
patterns wrote defense secretary frank c carlucci in a preface 
military output has not been reduced nor has military spending 
decreased on the contrary the soviet military budget under 
general secretary mikhail gorbachev continues to grow at a rate 
of 3 percent per year at a level representing 15 to 17 percent of 
their gnp 
by comparison pentagon spending consumes about 6 percent of 
americas gnp 
carlucci appearing at a pentagon press confidence cited 
several other developments including the fact the soviets now have 
two operational longrange nuclear missiles that use mobile 
launchers the ss24 and the ss25 while the united states has 
none 
he also highlighted what he said was the first extensive 
unclassified review of a soviet program to construct underground 
bunkers command centers and secret subways to protect their 
leaders in the event of a war 
there can be only one purpose for these shelters to provide 
the soviet leadership the ability to fight a protracted nuclear 
conflict carlucci asserted these facilities contradict in 
steel and concrete soviet protestations that they share president 
reagans view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be 
fought 
but while soviet military power is formidable carlucci 
continued we must not be overawed 
rather we must strengthen our resolve to preserve our 
security and our freedoms there is no mystery as to what america 
should do in the face of soviet military power he said 
this years review is the last to be prepared by the reagan 
administration 
the 175page glossy booklet differs substantially from the 
earlier reports in that it tries harder to gauge whos leading in 
various technologies and regions of the world rather than just 
reporting what weapons have been added to the soviet arsenal over 
the last year 
indeed the report for the first time carries a subtitle an 
assessment of the threat and acknowledges that in areas such as 
naval power and high technology the united states and its western 
allies still enjoy an advantage 
the report does point to new weapon developments though among 
them

the soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new 
blackjack longrange bomber deployment of the new railmounted 
ss24 nuclear missile has now begun and production should start 
soon for a more accurate version of the huge ss18 intercontinental 
ballistic missile the mainstay of the soviet arsenal 
production of selfpropelled artillery pieces is at an 
alltime high two new attack helicopters the havoc and hokum 
are expected to enter serial production soon and the soviets 
have begun fielding a new tank derived from the t72 exhibiting 
improved protection better mobility and enhanced firepower 
russia will complete a major upgrade of its antiballistic 
missile defense system protecting moscow in 1988 or 1989 a new 
pill box radar to help with tracking and targeting for that 
system is nearing completion at pushkino 
the soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of 
sophisticated cruise missile systems and continue to lead the 
west in the pace of their activities in outer space 
in the area of star wars the soviet union like the united 
states is unlikely to develop small kinetic kill rockets that 
could be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long 
range the soviets could however deploy a shortrange 
spacebased system for space station defense or closein attack by 
a maneuvering satellite in the near future 
the report also spotlights for the first time soviet efforts to 
develop the equipment needed for radioelectronic combat the 
use of electronic jamming and deception techniques to disrupt us 
and allied radio communication systems 
on the strategic nuclear side the report concludes the united 
states can deter a soviet attack and continue to press for 
additional arms control agreements so long as it continues 
president reagans program of introducing weapons such as the b1b 
and stealth bombers and the mx missile while pursuing star wars

pavel wonka a human rights activist who 
died suddenly in a czechoslovak jail had asked the helsinki human 
rights conference to make sure he was not silenced in prison a 
us official said today 
warren zimmermann chief us delegate to the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe condemned wonkas imprisonment 
and said the conference had a special obligation to wonka and to 
people like him 
the conference adopted the helsinki accords on human rights in 
1975 
prison authorities did not explain wonkas death and official 
media in czechoslovakia have not reported it human rights groups 
have said that the activist was beaten in detention 
frantiski dolezel the chief czechoslovak delegate to the 
conference said wonka died of emphysema 
as we record and mourn his untimely death we must also 
condemn the wholly unjustifiable imprisonment and mistreatment he 
suffered while serving his term the us diplomat said 
wonka who was released feb 26 after serving a 21month prison 
sentence was to be under protective surveillance for three 
years after he was freed he was rearrested on april 5 and 
sentenced to another fivemonth jail term on unspecified charges 
april 21 
zimmermann said that in his march 3 message wonka said people 
in the soviet bloc should be made more aware of how their laws 
affect their rights and freedoms 
my right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the 
constitution of czechoslovakia experience however has taught me 
not to depend too much on such declarations zimmermann quoted 
wonka as saying 
therefore i have learned to be careful and i am taking the 
liberty to ask the governments of all the signatory states to 
see that my voice is not silenced under some pretext in 
prison the message said 
several international groups have asked the prague government to 
allow independent doctors to attend wonkas portmortem 
wonka an auto mechanic by profession had sought to run for 
parliament as an independent candidate for his hometown in northern 
bohemia he was known to be suffering from some intestinal problems 
but was not fatally ill according to an emigre source

the columbus county sheriff has been 
removed from office by a judge who ruled that he had failed to 
comply with court orders falsified court documents and kissed two 
women against their will 
i definitely feel betrayed and i definitely feel my 
intentions were not to do anything wrong said former sheriff 
william rhodes i do feel like the things i have done in law 
enforcement i tried to do right 
rhodes 59 said after thursdays ruling that testimony by 
current and former employees had confirmed his suspicions that many 
of them were working against him he said several lied or were 
mistaken in their testimony about events at the department 
i think i had a fair hearing he said the one thing i 
would say is it helped me find out what i wanted to find out about 
the people i was dealing with 
superior court judge robert h hobgood said he found evidence 
supporting all 14 allegations made in a petition filed by district 
attorney michael easley that sought rhodes removal for willful 
misconduct or maladministration in office 
easleys petition followed rhodes guilty plea last month to 
misdemeanor charges of obstructing justice and attempting to 
obstruct justice 
rhodes admitted he informed an attorney associated with a local 
country club that state alcohol law enforcement agents were on 
their way to the club for a raid on beer selling without a permit 
rhodes testified thursday that his actions were not intended to 
obstruct justice but the judge found that he knew or should have 
known that his telling about the raids would result in illegal 
beer supplies being hidden before agents arrived 
the judge also found that the sheriff directed one of his 
deputies to falsify a jail record to show that a defendant had 
served time in the county jail 
the judge also ruled that rhodes violated court orders by 
allowing the temporary release of inmates to visit their families 
or to perform cleanup duties for the county 
hobgood also found that rhodes had kissed two women one 15 and 
another 20 without their consent 
county coroner henry smith rowan will serve as interim sheriff 
until the county commissioners name a replacement to fill rhodes 
term which expires in 1990

secretary of state george p shultz who once 
threatened to resign if compelled to take a lie detector test has 
authorized limited and voluntary use of polygraphs in state 
department criminal and security investigations 
shultz in a statement he submitted thursday to a senate 
appropriations subcommittee sharply questioned the accuracy of 
such tests it should never be acceptable in matters affecting 
the reputations and the livelihoods of individuals he said 
and yet shultz said lie detector tests have a limited place 
in our security program in certain situations he told the 
committee these included requests by state department workers to 
establish their innocence and in criminal counterintelligence or 
personnel security investigations 
shultz said a third circumstance for their use was when a state 
department employee volunteered to work in an intelligence agency 
that required polygraph tests 
but shultz said the tests would be given only with the consent 
of the individual 
it is no secret to the congress or to this committee that i 
have consistently opposed the use of lie detector tests as a tool 
for screening or managing people shultz said 
nor do i believe that we can single out one class of state 
department employees for special treatment just because they are 
called a security service 
he said the regulations in which he had authorized lie detector 
tests were clear circumspect in scope and protect individual 
rights 
in december 1985 shultz said he would resign rather than be 
forced to take a polygraph test under a security program that had 
been ordered by president reagan he called the tests inaccurate 
and unscientific 
reagan subsequently gave shultz discretion to decide whether 
polygraphs would be given in the state department

the reagan administration has reached a 
tentative agreement with panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega under which he will resign as defense chief but remain on 
in panama for the time being a us official said today 
the official insisting on anonymity said the settlement is 
less than ideal because the administration had initially 
insisted that noriega leave panama upon his resignation as part of 
a transition to democratic rule 
we have to settle for threefourths of a loaf the official 
said 
the administration had been concerned that any solution that 
allowed noriega to remain on in panama could enable him to retain 
effective control even if he surrendered his post as commander of 
the defense forces 
but the official said that noriega once he steps down would be 
like a cop out of uniform and would cease to be the dominant 
force in panamas political life 
the timing of noriegas resignation and the question of whether 
he eventually will go into exile remain up in the air and are 
subject to future negotiations the official said 
the washington post said in todays editions that noriega is 
known to prefer the dominican republic if he is forced into exile 
on thursday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater hinted that 
the admininistration was backing away from its demand that noriega 
leave panama as part of a settlement 
the administration goal he said was for noriega to leave 
power 
fitzwater had indicated earlier the arrangement did not 
represent a policy change but president reagan and others had said 
in previous statements no acceptable settlement could be reached 
until noriega left panama 
fitzwater said our policy is that gen noriega must go which 
means leave power weve talked about that a number of times we 
have said we prefer him to leave panama but the policy issue is to 
leave power 
on march 22 reagan was asked by reporters if hed be satisfied 
if the military strongman would step down but not leave his 
country 
we feel noriega should leave panama the president replied 
on march 28 assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said 
the way to end this crisis is to get him noriega out of the 
country 
the post quoted unnamed sources as saying that noriega has 
agreed to resign in a matter of weeks and would permit free 
elections and the restoration of constitutional government 
noriega has said only that he would be willing to step down from 
his post before national elections set for may 1989 if certain 
conditions are met 
the scaling back of the us demand occurred as a top state 
department official michael kozak was in panama for his second 
round of talks with noriega in less than two weeks the official 
said kozak was back in washington today 
the administration has not acknowledged that kozak has met with 
noriega on either visit in an apparent attempt to make it easier 
for the general to arrange a facesaving way out officials believe 
the more noriega is seen to be under us pressure to step down the 
less cooperative he will be 
the post said the tentative deal was worked out during secret 
negotiations this week between the two administration officials 
have been anguished by noriegas ability to hang on to power in the 
face of a severe cashflow crisis that has meant no paychecks for 
thousands of panamanian workers 
among other measures the united states has frozen panamanian 
assets in the united states and cut off payments to panama for 
services relating to panama canal operations 
the administration also has continued to recognize the 
government of president eric arturo delvalle even though he was 
ousted by noriegas supporters two months ago 
noriega was indicted on drug charges in february by two grand 
juries in florida us officials have informed noriega he will not 
be subject to extradition here if he agrees to seek political exile 
in a third country spain has offered noriega conditional exile

a federal appeals court today invited the 
district of columbias highest court to consider whether gun 
manufacturers may be held liable in civil suits for deaths and 
injuries caused by cheap handguns 
the advisory opinion was issued by the us circuit court of 
appeals here about the dismissal of a civil suit against the 
manufacturer of the 22caliber pistol presidential assailant john 
w hinckley jr used to shoot president reagan in 1981 
it invited the district of columbia court of appeals which 
interprets local law in the nations capital to determine whether 
to adopt a 1985 finding by marylands highest state court that gun 
manufacturers are liable for injuries and deaths caused by the 
criminal use of socalled saturday night specials 
the panel of three federal circuit judges found that the 
maryland decision was based on public policy considerations 
expressed in that states guncontrol laws 
the districts gun control statute places limitations on 
handgun ownership and purchases that are at least as strict as the 
maryland provisions concerning handgun possession that formed the 
basis of the 1985 decision by marylands highest court the panel 
said 
such a reassessment is permissive not mandatory by the 
local appellate court the federal panel said 
marylands legislature recently voted to outlaw all cheap 
handguns but that change in policy should not be a factor in the 
dc courts review of the issue the federal panel said in an 
opinion written by circuit judge abner mikva 
the advisory opinion follows by a year a decision by the same 
appellate court upholding the dismissal of roehm of germany as a 
defendant in civil suits filed by others wounded during hinckleys 
attack on reagan 
roehm which makes the guns through its us subsidiary rg 
industries of miami had been sued for 20 million by white house 
press secretary james brady and former dc police officer thomas 
delahanty 
both were wounded along with secret service agent timothy 
mccarthy when hinckley shot reagan on march 30 1981 
the shooting has left brady confined to a wheelchair and 
delahantys wounds forced him to retire from the police force 
a suit against hinckley by the three men is scheduled to go to 
trial may 16 in us distict court here 
two of the three judges in todays opinion kenneth starr and 
harry edwards participated in last years holding that gun 
manufacturers could not be held negligent for failing to prevent 
criminals from using their products 
that decision also found that the strict liability claim fails 
because there is no allegation that the gun failed to operate 
properly the gun was not defective 
because the 1987 opinion was not published by the court it is 
not legal precedent 
in a concurring opinion to todays ruling starr expressed 
regret that the court did not refer last years issue for the same 
study by the dc court 
starr said that if the dc court of appeals holds gun 
manufacturers can be sued the federal appellate court can 
reconsider whether to reinstate the suits by brady and delahanty 
against roehm 
the court said that a review of the liability standard was 
appropriate because the district of columbia was carved out of 
maryland and derived its common law from the state 
the maryland decision by a unanimous court of appeals also 
involved a lawsuit against roehm 
the states highest court said the manufacturer or marketer of a 
saturday night special knows or ought to know that he is making 
or selling a product principally to be used in criminal activity 
these guns are largely unfit for legitimate uses the court 
found

attorneys for tuskegee university have 
asked a judge to drop his order that temporarily blocks the school 
from prohibiting students who owe 300 or more in overdue fees from 
attending classes 
university president benjamin payton said thursday the 10day 
temporary restraining order obtained by students weakens the 
universitys loan collection policy 
payton said the order issued wednesday by circuit judge howard 
f bryan was unfair he said neither school officials nor their 
attorneys were contacted to state their position before bryan 
issued his order 
the universitys policy kept students with overdue fees from 
attending classes and taking final exams which begin next week 
that sparked a week of protests including demonstrations and a 
sitin at the predominantly black private institution followed by 
the students plea to the judge 
leaders of the student government association which directed 
the protests have said school officials should have warned 
students earlier in the semester about the crackdown 
university officials said the crackdown was prompted by abuse of 
an installment payment plan they estimate some 2000 students owe 
almost 15 million 
payton said the order saddens me deeply and it jeopardizes the 
financial wellbeing of the university including its undermining 
of the process that had resulted in significant payments of 
delinquent student fees 
he said it is revealing and unfortunate that students who 
said they didnt have funds to pay their fees had gotten money to 
take the issue to court

if imitation is the highest form of flattery 
the pentagons annual book on soviet military power is basking 
in compliments 
the soviet union has issued its own version whence the threat 
to peace and tom gervasi a critic of the us military this 
spring published what he calls an annotated and corrected 
version of the pentagons propaganda document 
other military experts say that although the pentagon book is 
not perfect it is more accurate and comprehensive than either the 
soviets or gervasis version 
the latest edition released by defense secretary frank carlucci 
today at a pentagon news conference addresses some of the 
criticism by including more information and tables comparing nato 
and warsaw pact force levels and acknowledging that the west leads 
in such areas as naval power and high technology 
the latest 175page volume which for the first time contains 
an index to weapons and photographs reflects carluccis desire for 
a more balanced and thorough approach 
youll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this 
year than in previous years during my testimony before congress 
earlier this year i received a number of requests for an 
assessment of how soviet military capabilities relate to our 
national interests our military capabilities and those of our 
allies carlucci told the news conference 
furthermore i believe it is especially important to share 
with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and 
implications of soviet military power as possible and so this year 
the scope of the book has been expended said carlucci we 
welcome criticism 
in september 1981 thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger 
released the first edition of the book in a presentation beamed by 
satellite to europe the administration was waging a campaign for a 
1 trillion military buildup to close the gap on what he called 
soviet military superiority 
although weinberger billed the glossy 99page booklet as a 
compendium of scrubbed intelligence reports on soviet defense 
analysts outside government called it a rehash of information 
already available in public 
the glossy book contained colorful maps charts photographs and 
artists renditions of soviet weaponry the pentagon published a 
russianlanguage version which diplomats in moscow circulated 
among soviet contacts 
the kremlin was not pleased 
the soviet communist party daily pravda published a lengthy 
frontpage editorial describing the pentagon book as a big lie 
designed for simpletons 
it is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to 
judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of pentagon 
propaganda pravda said on oct 17 1981 
by 1984 however the kremlin decided to weigh in with its own 
effort whence the threat to peace drawing largely on western 
publications to back soviet claims that washington was the chief 
instigator of the arms race 
in his version issued this spring us author gervasi was no 
less harsh than the kremlin 
gervasi wrote that in the pentagon version even the most 
basic facts are distorted as part of reagan administration 
efforts to prove that the united states is on the losing end of a 
military gap 
gervasis version includes the 1987 edition of the pentagon 
book overlaid with his own commentaries for the most part 
corrections of the range and capabilities of soviet and american 
weaponry 
in almost every case the americans have taken the lowest 
estimate for us capabilities and the highest for the soviets 
gervasi said in his book and in a telephone interview 
military expert david isby says that gervasi too plays with 
the numbers 
gervasi he says believes that the soviet union no matter 
what its flaws is never as bad as the united states he looks for 
any figure that shows a soviet weapon to be less capable 
for example gervasi says that the pentagon is incorrect in 
saying that the new soviet 2s7 203mm howitzer has a range of 18 
miles and that instead it has a range of 108 miles gervasis 
figure is for a 203mm gun made in 1931 rather than the latest 
soviet version 
gervasi noted that some of the artists renditions appear to be 
wildly inaccurate a claim that isby says is justified in part an 
early edition of the book carried a purported drawing of the soviet 
t80 tank but it looked more like the us m1 said both isby and 
gervasi 
some of the pentagon figures have been contradicted in testimony 
by administration officials on capitol hill or by other 
authoritative works says isby author of weapons and tactics of 
the soviet army 
but generally the pentagon does a good job isby said in an 
interview 
condoleeza rice an expert on the soviet military and professor 
at stanford university shares isbys assessment of the pentagon 
book 
i find it pretty useful although from time to time you find 
errors she said in an interviewi find gervasi a lot less 
useful 
gervasi rice and isby agreed that although the pentagon book 
has improved over the years it still lacks a workable comparison 
of individual soviet and us weapons or overall forces that 
issue probably cannot be answered authoritatively as long as the 
superpowers disagree over who is ahead in the arms race

a man linked to a leftwing japanese 
terrorist group pleaded innocent today to weapons possession 
charges 17 days after police found three pipe bombs in his car 
along the new jersey turnpike 
fbi agents have been investigating a possible link between the 
man yu kikumura 36 and a uso club bombing in naples italy that 
killed five people including a us servicewoman italian 
authorities have linked the bombing to the terrorist group 
italian authorities have confirmed that kikumura was in their 
country in february fbi spokesman james j knights said he could 
not comment on a continuing investigation 
the japanese foreign ministry has identified kikumura as a 
suspected member of the red army terrorist group 
kikumura 36 was arrested april 12 at a new jersey turnpike 
service area after police found three sophisticated homemade bombs 
and falsified papers in his car 
at kikumuras arraignment defense attorney william kunstler 
questioned how kikumuras case was assigned to the court of us 
district judge alfred e lechner jr a judge kunstlers partner 
called the most conservative in the state 
we were told it was rotation but who knows kunstler said 
we just want to see if it wasnt maneuvered 
us attorney samuel alito jr denied the charges 
i resent his accusations to the press yesterday that we 
calculated the judge to which it was assigned alito said 
there certainly was no effort to link the return of indictments 
kikumura pleaded innocent to all charges in the 12count federal 
indictment nine of which relate to the bombs and three stemming 
from alleged misuse of a visa and a passport 
if convicted on all 12 counts he could face 90 years in prison

as they waited for rescue crewmen from 
the uss bonefish refused to take a hovering helicopters rescue 
line for themselves passing it to their mates instead a sailor 
from the illfated submarine said 
they kept passing it feeling somebody would need it more than 
they the first people we took were those who couldnt swim well 
then we found we had some people who needed medical attention 
said ronald larsen of bellows falls vt the chief electricians 
mate on the vessel 
larsen on thursday said the crew members conducted an orderly 
evacuation of the ship through thick poisonous smoke after a fire 
and explosions damaged the dieselelectric submarine 
three crewmen were killed in sundays accident while 22 others 
from the 92man crew suffered smoke inhalation two remained 
hospitalized in satisfactory condition thursday 
the 219foot bonefish was involved in maneuvers off the coast of 
florida at the time of the fire larsen said the three dead men 
were were relatively new to the boat and may have been doomed by 
their unfamiliarity with its layout 
officials at the atlantic fleet headquarters in norfolk va 
say the first explosion took place in the submarines forward 
battery compartment while the vessel was cruising at periscope 
depth 
the batteries are used to power the sub when it is below the 
surface and recharging them generates hydrogen gas which can 
explode if allowed to accumulate 
however larsen said a fire initially broke out in the crew 
living quarters but apparently couldnt be contained 
they had this small fire in berthing and a couple of people 
manned fire extinguishers and attempted to put it out he said 
initial reports that the fire was under control were followed by 
reports it was spreading he said 
from everybody i talked to there was an explosion later maybe 
five minutes down the road he said 
he said theres a lot of anger among the crew over 
speculation in the media that high levels of hydrogen in the 
battery compartments may have caused the explosions 
i know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery 
well he said 
chief petty officer terry d borton a spokesman at atlantic 
fleet headquarters in norfolk said today the navy had no comment 
on the sequence of fire and explosions aboard the bonefish 
following the explosions the bonefish surfaced and its captain 
cmdr mike wilson ordered the crew evacuated to the kennedy and 
frigate uss carr which were nearby 
no one was available for comment on larsens account an officer 
at fleet headquarters said thursday night telephone calls to four 
spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend 
the bonefish was expected to arrive in charleston its homeport 
by early afternoon said chief petty officer joseph c mowery 
spokesman for the atlantic fleet headquarters in norfolk 
meanwhile the navy prepared for a memorial service saturday for 
the crewmen who died 
navy officials said the remains of lt ray everts 30 of naoma 
wva petty officer 1st class robert w bordelow jr 39 of 
willis texas and petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren 
21 of pisgah forest nc had been removed from the vessel and 
flown to the naval hospital in charleston

supporters today predicted swift house action 
on a bill allowing the united states to adhere to a centuryold 
international copyright treaty and strengthen its hand against 
foreign piracy of records tapes and computer technology 
the measure was approved thursday by a voice vote of the house 
judiciary committee without the socalled moral rights 
provision sought by hollywood film makers to help prevent 
unauthorized coloring and other alterations in works sold to 
television broadcasters 
rep robert w kastenmeier dwis chief sponsor of the house 
bill said the moral rights issue will be considered later in 
separate hearings by his judiciary subcommittee which considers 
copyright issues 
a similar measure also without a moral rights provision was 
approved april 14 by the senate judiciary committee approval of 
the legislation by the full house and senate was expected within 
the next few weeks congressional staff aides said 
if the treaty is then ratified by a twothirds majority of the 
senate the united states would join 76 other nations that 
subscribe to the bern convention for the protection of literary and 
artistic works which sets the world standard for copyright 
protection of creative works exported by any of the signatory 
nations 
kastenmeier and other supporters of the bill said us adherence 
would help stem piracy of americanowned works in the computer and 
entertainment fields us producers of records and tapes for 
example lost an estimated 558 million in sales in 1986 because of 
foreign counterfeiting and piracy according to the us 
international trade commission 
i want to bring this to the full house for a vote right 
away kastenmeier said today through a spokeswoman every day 
the us waits to join bern is another day that the gold medalist 
of the world intellectual property olympics stays on the bench for 
lack of proper credentials 
kastenmeier said the bill would allow the united states to 
improve copyright relations with 24 of the 76 subscribing nations 
joining the bern convention is a trade issue as well as an 
artistic concern he said we enhance our own political 
credibility in our global efforts to raise copyright standards and 
reduce piracy the more we achieve in all those areas the better 
we protect american jobs and american creativity 
at a hearing before a senate judiciary subcommittee on march 3 
film makers steven spielberg and george lucas appealed for a 
statutory moral rights ban on changes in a motion picture by 
its financial backers or buyers without the consent of directors 
and screenwriters 
american law does not protect our painters sculptors 
recording artists authors or film makers from having their life 
work distorted and their reputation distorted said lucas who 
directed the hit movie star wars

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis appealed to 
president reagan today to think about workers who lose their jobs 
when plants close but republican george bush dismissed his 
comments saying he can talk about pink slips i want to talk 
about competitiveness 
bush at a breakfast with supporters in fort wayne ind 
criticized dukakis backing of trade legislation that includes a 
provision requiring that notice be given to workers before plant 
closings reagan is expected to veto the measure which won 
congressional approval this week 
the vice president said the fall election would give voters a 
clear choice between strong republican leadership and 
oldfashioned liberal democrats talking compassion and delivering 
misery 
dukakis campaigning in columbus ohio said i hope the 
president will take the time to think about the three million 
american workers who lose their jobs in this country every year 
through plant shutdowns in at least half those cases those plants 
shut down with little or no notice to those most affected their 
own employees 
these people are our neighbors dukakis said in prepared 
remarks they deserve better from their employers they deserve 
better from america 
democrat jesse jackson far behind dukakis but doggedly 
remaining in the race criticized dukakis today on the issue of 
south africa telling students at a high school in cleveland that 
both bush and dukakis should label south africa a terrorist state 
because of its backing of extremist rebels in mozambique 
he accused the rebels of atrocities and said south africa is 
responsible for that behavior 
the candidates were spending the day in the two states that have 
the next two big primaries next tuesday 
one day earlier the massachusetts governor criticized by bush 
for lacking foreign policy experience met with spains prime 
minister felipe gonzalez and the two conversed in spanish aides 
said 
jackson on wednesday expressed determination during an ohio 
campaign swing to stay in the race despite a series of setbacks 
were winning every day on this long and tortuous journey to 
the white house jackson told supporters in canton on thursday 
later in akron he vowed nothing and nobody is going to turn us 
around 
ohio offers 159 delegates and a gallup poll earlier this month 
indicated dukakis led jackson in the state by a 21 margin 
dukakis widened his delegate lead over jackson as delegates 
from the camps of nowinactive candidates began drifting his way 
new recruits included two former supporters of sen albert gore jr 
of tennessee and one backer of sen paul simon of illinois 
one delegate from new hampshire state rep richard daschbach 
originally a supporter of rep richard gephardt said gephardt had 
told him to go ahead and get behind dukakis he quoted gephardt as 
telling him its time to go weve got to get out and 
support him dukakis 
however deborah johns gephardts press secretary said the 
missouri congressman who abandoned his presidential bid in march 
remains neutral 
as far as i know he is not planning to endorse anyone soon 
she said 
according to the latest associated press delegate count dukakis 
has 1276 to jacksons 852 with 2081 needed to nominate aides 
are beginning to suggest that dukakis could clinch the nomination 
during the primary season which ends june 7 with big contests in 
new jersey and california 
on the republican side bush who achieved a mathematical lock 
on the nomination in tuesdays pennsylvania primary now has 1146 
delegates according to the ap count former television evangelist 
pat robertson who technically remains a candidate has 31 
robertsons campaign has been given two weeks to submit 
financial records in a federal investigation of the taxexempt 
status of robertsons religious broadcasting network us 
magistrate rebecca smith in norfolk va extended a showcause 
order on thursday until may 12 for documents originally requested 
by the internal revenue service last december

future economic activity shot up 08 percent in march pointing to 
continued growth for the rest of the year the commerce department 
said today 
that combined with a revised 13 percent growth rate in 
february gave he index of leading economic indicators its best 
backtoback performance since the last two months of 1986 when 
growth rates of 08 percent and 22 percent were recorded 
februarys rate had previously been reported as a much smaller 
09 percent 
the strength represented a remarkable turnaround in a 
forecasting gauge that at one point after the october stock market 
collapse was sending out signals of an impending recession 
when the december index numbe was first released it marked the 
third consecutive monthly decline in the index the traditional but 
not infallible warning of a recession 
but the initial calculations are subject to substantial 
revisions even months afterward with todays revision the only 
declines recorded since the stock market crash were a 12 percent 
drop in november and a 07 percent fall in january 
analysts said the big gains in the past two months reflected the 
surprising strength the economy has shown so far this year good 
news for republicans hoping to retain the white house 
president reagans chief spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the size and broadbased nature of the march increase in the 
leading indicators are significant and good news they suggest that 
the economy remains on a steady course and that a healthy climate 
for prosperity will continue 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said that the 
leading index suggests the economy will be headed onward and upward 
as we move through the second half of the year from the point of 
view of the administration the news on the economy could hardly be 
better 
sales of new homes posted a 4 percent gain in march rising to 
an annual rate of 655000 units following an even better 141 
percent jump in february sales analysts said the backtoback 
gains showed that the housing industry has shaken off the jitters 
which sent sales down for several months following the october 
stock market collapse 
in other good economic news the government reported tuesday 
that the gross national product grew at a moderate 23 percent 
annual rate from january though march far above the declining gnp 
which had been feared immediately following the 508point drop in 
the stock market on oct 19 
the february and march increases in the leading index were 
likely to fuel growing fears however that the economy is 
expanding too rapidly and threatening to rekindle inflation 
interest rates have been rising in recent days pushed higher by 
investor fears that the economic strength will soon prompt the 
federal reserve to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of 
slowing economic activity 
the march increase in the index reflected widespread strength as 
six of the nine individual indicators showed gains 
the biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices followed by a 
drop in weekly unemployment claims on thursday the government 
reported that weekly unemployment claims fell to the lowest level 
since december 1973 prompting speculation that the unemployment 
report for april which will be released next friday will show a 
further decline to 55 percent down from the current nineyear low 
of 56 percent 
other indicators which showed strenth in march were a slowdown 
in business delivery times indicating rising demand a rise in 
building permits faster growth in the nations money supply and a 
rise in raw materials prices indicating higher demand 
three indicators held the index back the biggest negative 
factor was a drop in the length of the average workweek a drop in 
plant and equipment orders and a decline in manufacturers orders 
for consumer goods 
the various changes left the index at 1933 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
after the gnp report was issued beryl sprinkel the presidents 
chief economic adviser said it showed the administrations 29 
percent gnp forecast for the year was right on track 
he disputed contentions that a big jump in consumer demand 
which had provided much of the first quarter strength in the gnp 
raised any dangers of inflation 
but private economists noted that prices at both the retail and 
wholesale level took a big leap up in march and that those factors 
combined with the strong consumer demand were prompting fears in 
financial markets 
if you get growth too fast then interest rates start going 
up the credit markets are now prepared for higher inflation 
because of the faster growth said tom megan an economist with 
evans economics a washington forecasting firm 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington 
mass said he expected economic growth would slow slightly in the 
current spring quarter helping to quiet fears of an overheating 
economy but he said the economy would begin expanding at about a 3 
percent annual rate in the second half of the year

new home sales increased in march for the 
second consecutive month the government said friday providing new 
confirmation that the housing industry has shaken off its stock 
market crash jitters 
the 4 percent rise in march on top of an even stronger 141 
percent jump in february pushed sales to the highest levels since 
august according to a joint release of the departments of housing 
and urban development and commerce however the pace was still 9 
percent below last year 
analysts predicted this healthy but modest sales level would 
continue into summer but said rising mortgage interest rates 
threaten to choke off growth in the second half of the year 
new singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonallyadjusted rate 
of 655000 units last month up from the monthearlier sales pace 
of 630000 units 
sales had dropped 58 percent in january 62 percent in 
december and 43 percent in november raising fears that weakness 
in housing could spread to other sectors of the economy and help 
push the country into a recession 
i am pleased to see we are picking up the pace said mark 
obrinsky an economist for the us league of savings institutions 
but i doubt that we will see much further pickup 
rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages which had risen above 
115 percent just before the oct 19 stock market crash dipped 
below 10 percent in february and march but they have since edged 
up to 103 percent 
in the short term rising rates may actually help sales said 
kent w colton vice president of the national association of home 
builders because buyers will realize rates have bottomed out and 
will want to lock in a rate before they go up higher 
however analysts expect rates to be approaching precrash 
levels by the end of the year and said that could dampen housing 
activity 
new home sales this year are following a pattern established by 
sales of existing homes and construction starts of new homes both 
earlier reports indicated housing is recovering from low winter 
levels 
sales of existing homes increased 25 percent in march after an 
identical increase in february according to the national 
association of realtors the commerce department said construction 
of singlefamily homes jumped 71 percent in march after a 89 
percent increase in the previous month 
the march increase in new home sales was accompanied by a sharp 
decline in prices the median or midpoint price of new homes was 
101100 in march down 81 percent from february which in turn 
was 68 percent lower than the january record of 118000 
the average price of a new home fell 54 percent to 130300 in 
march after a 49 percent decline in february 
the march rise in sales was propelled by a 236 percent increase 
in sales in the west and a 84 percent climb in the south sales 
were down 189 percent in the midwest and dropped 125 percent in 
the northeast 
john tuccillo chief economist of the realtors group said price 
averages are falling because housing activity is stronger in 
regions where prices are lower also he said lowerpriced homes 
such as those purchased by firsttime buyers are selling more 
briskly than home in the upper brackets

president reagans senior aides apparently got 
the message when chief of staff howard h baker told them he will 
not tolerate attempts to undermine attorney general edwin meese 
iii the presidents spokesman said today 
an administration source said earlier that baker told 
subordinates thursday he had had it with a spate of news 
stories about underground efforts to win meeses ouster 
baker reminded aides that reagan has repeatedly stated his 
confidence in meese and told them those people who disagree with 
that should come to howard baker and talk said the source 
speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly he said baker 
left no doubt that such a meeting would center on the continuing 
job status of the complaining aide 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said he did not believe anybody had 
been in to see baker as a result of his comments 
i dont think anybody missed the message fitzwater said 
theyd be too dumb to work at the white house if they did 
baker reminded aides that reagan has repeatedly stated his 
confidence in meese and told them those people who disagree with 
that should come to howard baker and talk said the source 
speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly he said baker 
left no doubt that such a meeting would center on the continuing 
job status of the complaining aide 
the source said baker made it clear that because reagan still 
has confidence in meese his staff should respect that he said 
baker told aides that he too believes in meeses innocence 
independent counsel james c mckay has been examining meeses 
assistance to the scandalplagued wedtech corp and a proposed 1 
billion oil pipeline project also under investigation are meeses 
meetings with regional bell telephone company executives at a time 
when he owned 14000 in baby bell stock in addition mckay is 
looking into the 40000ayear job for the attorney generals 
wife ursula meese that is being funded by the foundation of a 
washington family that has leased real estate to the justice 
department 
the administration source said baker was not directly challenged 
by anyone in the meeting 
you should have seen all the heads at the table nodding up 
and down and probably someone at that table had been leaking 
stories he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about bakers 
threat said senator baker told the senior staff that the 
president supports ed meese and the white house supports ed meese 
and if anybody questions that policy then they shouldnt 
asked whether baker a former senator from tennessee had 
suggested that those in disagreement might leave the white house 
fitzwater said baker had said come see me if you have any 
problems 
a spate of stories has appeared recently quoting unidentified 
administration and white house officials as saying the time has 
come for the resignation of meese these people were quoted in the 
various accounts as saying that a group of reagans close friends 
and advisers had taken part in an underground effort supposedly 
with nancy reagans support to work for meeses departure 
however mrs reagans spokeswoman elaine crispen denied that 
the first lady had played a role in any such move

ingmar bergmans staging of long 
days journey into night is a smash with audiences and critics 
more than three decades after the play premiered on the same 
stockholm stage 
the revival of eugene oneills classic at the national dramatic 
theater earned what one critic called the best review he ever 
wrote the play opened april 17 and is sold out through august 
this triumph for bergman who turns 70 on july 14 comes at a 
time the director describes as the twilight of his career he has 
said he has made his last film 
but his schedule is unusual for a man claiming to approach 
retirement his modernized swedishlanguage version of hamlet won 
plaudits in london the play goes to new york in june 
he also is preparing shakespeares a winters tale and an 
opera to open here in 1991 in november he published a 
bestselling autobiography magic lantern 
but seldom in his 50year career has the applause of his home 
critics been louder than for the oneill play 
this is sensational world theater if anything wrote 
ingmar bjorksten drama critic of the svenska dagbladet in what he 
called his most enthusiastic review ever 
bergmans handling of the play was full of human knowledge 
and marked by a sympathy and warmth unusual for him 
brilliant headlined aftonbladet which published three 
glowing reviews it called bergman a brilliant editor for 
cutting an hour from the original script with nothing of 
oneills essentials removed 
the play stars bibi andersson whom bergman launched on an 
international career in the 1950s and with whom he had a twoyear 
affair 30 years ago 
i have never experienced such box office pressure for a play 
like this people are writing and calling from all over the 
country even denmark and norway theater director lars lofgren 
told the associated press 
the dramatic theater which celebrates its centennial this year 
was given the rights to stage the world premiere of oneills 
unpublished plays after his death in 1953 
tom olsson the theaters librarian and an oneill scholar said 
that according to the playwrights widow carlotta oneill was 
pleased with the theaters handling of his early plays and their 
success on the swedish stage 
long days journey premiered on feb 10 1956 and the play 
was such a hit that it entered theatrical legend here it won the 
1957 pulitzer prize for drama 
bergman was absent from the revivals opening night 32 years 
later he said later he was looking after his flustricken wife 
ingrid and did not want to draw attention from the actors 
his associates said bergman also was suffering from a painful 
hip which plagued him through the rehearsals and was scheduled for 
an operation shortly after the premiere 
but he received a special ovation when the ensemble bowed to an 
empty seat in the first row after their ninth curtain call 
bergmans movies which he began making in the 1950s won world 
acclaim for their brooding explorations of troubled relationships 
outraged by an charge of tax evasion which was later dropped 
bergman lived in selfimposed exile in west germany for seven 
years before returning home in 1982 to direct the film fanny and 
alexander 
bergmans 70th birthday is likely to be the subject of national 
celebrations chaplin magazine published by the swedish film 
institute published a 90page englishlanguage special edition in 
april with tributes from leading movie directors 
probably the greatest film artist all things considered 
since the invention of the motion picture camera said woody 
allen

aides to vice president george bush said 
friday that president reagan may finally endorse bush at a victory 
party next tuesday although the presidents spokesman said a 
decision has yet to be made 
bush aides speaking on condition of anonymity said there is a 
strong possiblity the president will weigh in with his formal 
support at a party planned to celebrate bushs clinching of the gop 
nomination 
were over the top so we may as well take advantage of it 
said one aide 
bush campaign manager lee atwater would not confirm that reagan 
would appear at the celebration at a washington dc hotel but 
added i wont tell you it aint going to happen 
the previously scheduled event will be held as the ohio indiana 
and district of columbia primary returns come in tuesday night 
which was when bush advisers initially had believed the vice 
president would go over the 1139 delegates needed to lock up the 
gop nomination 
however bush reached that level last tuesday after the 
pennsylvania primary 
there has been no question of reagans endorsement of his vice 
president only the matter of when it would come reagan had vowed 
to remain publicly neutral so long as the gop nomination was in 
contention 
the only remaining gop rival is former television evangelist pat 
robertson but he has ceased active campaigning and has conceded 
victory to bush 
asked when reagan would begin to make campaign appearances for 
bush presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters on 
friday it hasnt been decided

the definition of a dog has become a 
bone of contention in the illinois legislature 
under a proposal approved by a house panel wednesday wolves 
coyotes and crossbreeds no longer can be considered dogs and that 
should make it easier for one county to deal with its budget woes 
the problem is that farmers whose livestock are killed by dogs 
are partially reimbursed from dog registration fees collected by 
county health departments 
while wolves coyotes and crossbreeds are not considered dogs by 
most county prosecutors jo daviess county states attorney j 
christopher moore interprets the definition to include them 
so county health officials saw their funds go toward paying for 
slain livestock costing the county thousands of dollars according 
to state rep richard mulcahey 
mulcaheys bill would revise the definition by limiting it to 
the canis familiaris branch of the family canidae domestic dogs 
in other words 
the full house is scheduled to consider the issue tuesday

government and rebel leaders began a 
second day of meetings today in a climate of mutual distrust 
having made little apparent headway in talks on achieving a lasting 
peace 
the two delegations ended their closeddoor session thursday 
night with neither side offering comment on what progress if any 
had been made 
defense minister humberto ortega started the meeting by calling 
for a 30day extention to the 60day truce that ends june 1 
the usbacked rebels known as contras rejected the proposal 
contra leaders arrived thursday for a second threeday round of 
highlevel meetings to work out details of the ceasefire agreement 
they signed with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government march 23 
in the southern border town of sapoa 
the two sides have agreed on little since signing the 
preliminary peace accord which aims to end the 6yearold war 
that has claimed more than 26000 lives 
in a surprise move the government announced thursday that the 
contras may receive immediate humanitarian aid if it is distributed 
by the international red cross the sapoa accord calls for 
humanitarian aid to be provided to the rebels only after they 
gather in seven mutually agreed ceasefire zones 
it is an effort to ease the pacification process that restores 
peace and the possibility of national reconciliation deputy 
foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told journalists 
under the accords the rebels were to have moved into the zones 
two weeks ago but the two sides have been unable to define the 
security and operating conditions within the zones 
many contra fighters have moved into the general areas of the 
zones over the last few weeks but journalists traveling to the 
isolated regions said the combatants are wary of the pact 
the sandinista proposal calls on the contras to lay down their 
arms an issue not specifically mentioned in the sapoa accords 
we insist that first we should discuss and reach an agreement 
about the modus operandi within the zones said contra leader 
roberto ferrey 
he said that to accept the governments proposal would be 
tantamount to surrender 
the government says the laying down of arms is basic to the 
agreement but the contras say they will do so only when nicaragua 
is on the irreversible road to democracy 
the two sides met thursday at the camino real hotel near the 
airport the contras are isolated from contact with the general 
public but are permitted to make brief forays to speak to waiting 
journalists at a nearby hotel 
the contras first three days of highlevel talks in managua 
began april 15 and netted nothing more than an agreement to meet 
again

developers of a 41 million luxury hotel near 
beverly hills have agreed to expand their parking after affluent 
neighbors threatened to put a cork in the hotels liquor permit 
application 
homeowners who dont want partygoers cars parked around their 
neighborhood will have their chance tuesday at a hearing by the 
board of zoning appeals on the hotels liquor permit request 
no parking no booze was the residents rallying cry at a 
recent meeting 
the neighborhood is going to get nothing but more problems out 
of this hotel said harald hahn president of a homeowners group 
near the 11story 311room ma maison sofitel hotel being built on 
beverly boulevard across from the posh beverly center shopping mall 
the scheduled summer opening of the hotel will mark the return 
of restaurateur patrick terrails trendy ma maison eatery which 
closed on melrose avenue in 1985 
although the hotels 328space garage provides the legal minimum 
number of slots it should be bigger because any overflow will 
spill onto already crowded streets said diana plotkin of the 
beverlywilshire homes association 
the hotels developers have agreed to lease several dozen spaces 
at a nearby bank for nighttime and weekend use and to squeeze 382 
cars into the garage by allowing valet parking only 
we sympathize with what they want to preserve their life 
style and the neighborhood said james keegan president of the 
firm developing the hotel but at the same time we didnt throw 
40 million into a hole in the ground to have a dry hotel

efforts by house democrats to advance a 
sweeping south african sanctions bill were derailed friday when 
partisan squabbling broke out in the foreign affairs committee and 
the measure became entangled with a separate bill on ethiopia 
the legislation would cut off virtually all economic relations 
between the united states and south africa within a year it is 
seen by supporters as building upon the limited sanctions imposed 
two years ago to force pretoria to moderate its apartheid policy 
which deprives majority blacks of political and civil rights 
but the measure is opposed by business interests as too harsh to 
have its intended effect and many republicans who supported 
limited sanctions in 1986 have said they will fight the democrats 
this time 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee had planned to begin work on the sanctions bill 
friday he was forced to postpone his panels meeting until next 
week however after the measure became entangled in a dispute 
about a separate republicansponsored bill to condemn the marxist 
government of ethiopia 
i guess it reflects some of the rising political tensions of 
this election year said rep lee hamilton dind a senior 
committee member 
republicans were holding up the south africa sanctions bill as 
leverage to first force action on the ethiopian measure that bill 
urges president reagan to cut off imports of ethiopian coffee and 
deny trade preferences if the sovietaligned government continues 
to impede relief efforts for starving people in its northern 
provinces 
ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam on april 6 ordered 
foreign relief workers out of the provinces of tigray and eritrea 
where his forces are at war with secessionist rebels mengistu has 
been accused of trying to starve his own people into submission 
and more than 2 million people are reported to be at risk of 
starvation 
the ethiopia sanctions measure sponsored by rep toby roth 
rwis was to have been acted on friday before the committee 
turned to consideration of the south africa sanctions bill but 
rep don bonker dwash objected saying the measure was poorly 
written and was being rushed through without proper referral to the 
trade subcommittee which he heads 
as the committees meeting hit impasse and broke up republicans 
cried foul its a sad mark of politics and procedure roth 
said weve got millions of people starving to death 
he accused bonker who is running for the senate in his 
forestryoriented state of trying to use the situation to advance 
a pet bill imposing restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs 
bonker had told reporters that bill might come before the full 
foreign affairs committee this week but that did not happen 
bonker denied any connection between the two bills 
rep dan burton rind said he would continue to use house 
rules to block consideration of the south africa bill until the 
democraticcontrolled committee acts on ethiopian sanctions the 
ethiopian bill is much more significant at this point that south 
africa he said 
but one democrat said the republicans were merely using every 
tactic they could to delay further action on south africa which 
democrats see as a potent political issue in their favor 
when youre looking to sidetrack an issue your best bet is to 
light forest fires all around the place said rep gary ackerman 
dny its a testy time

new york city police are among the more 
restrained in the nation in using their guns experts say contrary 
to a common perception reinforced by this weeks killings of an 
unarmed woman and a veteran police officer 
many people say theyre killing people left and right 
but thats directly counter to the figures said thomas reppetto 
a former chicago police commander who is president of the citizens 
crime commission of new york city a watchdog group 
tighter guidelines for the use of deadly force began developing 
after a federal study found that police shootings helped spark 13 
riots in the 1960s said james fyfe a former new york policeman 
who is chairman of american universitys department of justice law 
and society 
new york was really at the forefront in terms of the degree of 
the restrictiveness of the policy and remains the most restrained 
among the large police departments in terms of shooting fyfe 
said 
none of which consoles guy ferraro whose 31yearold wife 
lidia was killed early wednesday in a hail of police bullets after 
a car chase that began when she ran a red light 
she was defenseless they surrounded her it was coldblooded 
murder said ferraro 
police said afterward that a sergeant had fired three shots at 
the cars tires because of a police radio report that shots were 
fired officers who converged on the scene may have thought the 
woman fired the shots and was armed police said no weapon was 
found in her car 
the same day a veteran officer was shot during a drug raid the 
fatal bullet came from another officers gun not the gun of a 
woman arrested in the raid as police originally reported 
asked if firearms policy would be changed in the aftermath of 
the two shootings chief of detectives robert colangelo responded 
we are constantly reviewing our policy 
the sergeant who shot out mrs ferraros tires apparently 
violated a 1985 department regulation against firing shots at a 
moving vehicle the sergeant was suspended 
virtually all major police departments have similar rules 
experts said a 1986 us supreme court ruling said deadly physical 
force may not be used to stop a fleeing felon 
fyfe who researched police shootings in new york for his 
doctoral thesis found that a restrictive policy instituted in 1972 
led to a sharp drop in the number of fatal police shootings which 
reached 87 in 1971 
from 1981 through 1984 the average was 33 in the past three 
years it was 15 according to police figures 
the international association of chiefs of police studied police 
shootings in the 57 largest cities from 1975 through 1983 fyfe 
said that in terms of the number of fatal shootings per 1000 
officers new york had a relatively low rate of 136 
the highest rates were jacksonville fla at 717 followed by 
new orleans at 68 and long beach calif at 61 at the lower end 
of the scale were boston 119 san francisco 14 minneapolis 
162 and chicago 171 
in other major cities the rate in dallas was 432 houston 
473 los angeles 305 detroit 333 and atlanta 328 
robert trojanowicz director of the school of criminal justice 
at michigan state university said that in the past 15 to 20 years 
fatal shootings by police have declined because theyre getting 
extensive training and policies are becoming increasingly refined 
specific and restrictive 
in the past he said a person was given a weapon put on 
the street and expected to literally learn on the job 
internal investigations and pressure from citizens make it 
very difficult with current procedures to cover up an errant 
police officers actions trojanowicz said

tens of thousands of christians some huddled 
beneath blankets and umbrellas gathered on the mall today for a 
day of prayer for their churches and their country 
evangelist oral roberts told the crowd this afternoon how he had 
been cured of tuberculosis 53 years ago by a man of god 
the man of god laid hands on me in jesus name and said you 
foul disease i command you in the name of jesus christ you come 
out of this boy and brothers and sisters it was resurrection it 
was divine intervention roberts said to a cheering audience 
i stand here today 53 years later with my lungs sound and 
whole my body healed by the power of god 
earlier the rev gerald derstine of bradenton fla one of the 
first speakers at the washington for jesus rally spoke of 
christians repenting for the sins of the nation 
i am talking about drug addiction alcoholism and suicides we 
feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we 
believe abortion still is an issue derstine said 
organizers said the rally attracted people from all 50 states 
and from more than 100 countries members of many christian 
denominations were present most of those in attendance were 
evangelicals 
sponsors said they expected 350000 people would brave the rain 
and cool weather to join in the continuous dawntodusk prayers 
and songs at noon a us park police spokeswoman who would not 
give her name said the crowd numbered about 80000 
a similar rally in 1980 drew an estimated 200000 people 
when the rally ends seven days of aroundtheclock prayers will 
begin on the site of the rally 
tom robidoux of norwalk conn said he took the day off from 
work to attend because he felt it would be very uplifting to see 
this many people all doing the same thing 
i believe the united states thinks christians are divided 
against one another robidoux said were here to show we can 
stand together 
dae anne fletcher said she traveled to washington from 
clarksburg wva because i just wanted to add my voice to those 
of many others 
before the rally began the rev john gimenez pastor of rock 
church in virginia beach va said participants are going to 
washington to pray were not going there to condemn were not 
going to denounce were going there to point the finger at 
ourselves 
indeed organizers adi the sexandmoney scandals that have 
rocked television evangelism gave added impetus to todays rally 
the rallys aim gimenez said at a news conference thursday is 
to show repentance so we can be more effective to reconcile 
differences within the church and between races and neighborhoods 
and to restore the church to holiness 
when we started organizing this there were no publicized 
scandals in the church gimenez said of the sexandmoney 
troubles that brought down television evangelists jimmy swaggart 
and jim and tammy bakker the scandals just emphasize the need 
for we who are christians to come together 
todays rally was intended to be nonpolitical and thats why 
none of the presidential contenders was invited to speak gimenez 
said pat robertson who is seeking the republican nomination for 
president was one of the key speakers at the rally eight years ago 
but was not invited to speak this time gimenez said 
an exception for political figures was made for a videotaped 
message from president reagan 
although the rally was dedicated to reviving oldfashioned 
christian values it relied on the latest in technology to get its 
message across four huge screens similar to those in baseball 
parks were set up to show the activities on stage and messages 
like those from reagan 
john staggers chairman of the dc networkers for christian 
affairs in washington said he was impressed by the rally 
organizers determination to help the residents of washington 
im usually against groups that come to washington for a day 
and leave us with our problems staggers said 
organizers asked each of the participants to bring a can of food 
for the poor and the homeless and they agreed to help 
washingtonarea churches set up drug treatment centers

two teachers are being questioned and three 
classes have been canceled at california state universitys 
northridge campus after students reported being offered top grades 
for selling raffle tickets officials said 
students reported that the three independent studies courses in 
african history and culture also required no classroom attendance 
and assigned no course work said campus spokeswoman ann salisbury 
university vice president of academic affairs bob suzuki 
announced thursday that the classes had been canceled and the 
schools campus police had launched an investigation 
because we have been informed that there was no syllabus for 
this class and that most students never met with their instructors 
it appears to me that grades were offered in exchange for 
activities not directly related to an officially approved course of 
study suzuki said 
the university is also considering disciplinary action against 
two teachers and may turn over the findings of its investigation to 
the district attorneys office ms salisbury said 
she said interviews with 30 students enrolled in the courses led 
to the probe 
the two teachers being investigated were eleazu s obinna a 
17year faculty member and william j bellamy a firstyear 
lecturer campus officials said 
the raffle tickets were allegedly being sold on behalf of united 
crusade foundation inc a nonprofit charitable organization 
founded by obinna 
i have done nothing wrong the nigerianborn obinna 54 
said thursday i believe this is something concocted by the 
administration not from complaints by students 
obinna said he required 45 hours of course work and graded 
students on their participation in minority community affairs 
bellamy declined comment 
student laural isles 18 said obinna told her to sell 20 
tickets at 5 each for an a grade in his class 
i personally didnt know who was even in charge of the 
class said trey whitaker 18 another student in obinnas class 
my understanding was that the proceeds were going to charity and 
the grade was contingent on how much we sold 
suzukis statement said the university also was looking into the 
legal status of united crusade foundation inc 
obinna said the organization has sponsored summer youth job 
programs and holiday meals for the homeless he said it recently 
lost its nonprofit status but he renewed it with the state

us cuban south african and angolan officials 
will meet here next week for a twoday conference on troop 
withdrawal from angola and independence for southwest africa the 
foreign office said today 
the us delegation will be headed by chester crocker us 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs and washingtons 
chief diplomatic troubleshooter in southern africa the us 
embassy said 
the talks will be held at a secret location in london tuesday 
and wednesday british and us officials said 
the other delegates were not identified but a south african 
foreign ministry statement said the participants would not be of 
cabinet rank 
discussions between the united states angola south africa 
and cuba on troop withdrawal from angola and independence for 
namibia will take place on may 3 and 4 in britain a british 
foreign office spokesman said 
we are pleased to have facilitated and welcome this further 
step in the negotiating process 
crocker was in london this week and had talks with his soviet 
counterpart deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin 
southwest africa or namibia is ruled by south africa in 
defiance of a 1966 un demand to give it independence 
south africa has said it is willing to give namibia 
independence but insists cuba withdraw its estimated 40000 troops 
from neighboring angola 
the united states which has been trying for nine years to 
mediate an agreement backs south africas demand that the first 
move be a cuban withdrawal 
angola demands that south africa and the united states stop 
backing prowestern rebels fighting to overthrow its marxist 
government it says south africa has 9000 troops with heavy 
artillery in angolan territory while south africa says it has not 
had more than 3000 men there at one time since may 1987 
south africa has been waging a 21year war with namibian 
independence fighters based in angola while angola has been 
wracked by civil war since 1975 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
south africas ally in the angolan civil war got us aid worth 
15 million last year including stinger antiaircraft missiles 
in the past few months most of the heavy fighting has been 
around the strategic southeastern city of cuito cuanavale 
cubanbacked angolan forces still hold the city although it has 
been under regular attack by south african and unita troops the 
fighting appears to have reached stalemate in the past two months 
the town 190 miles north of the border with southwest africa 
has a strategic airstrip and is used as a staging post for angolan 
army operations against unita

the soviet union has been pursuing an 
enormously expensive program of constructing huge underground 
bunkers and subways to protect its leaders and allow them to fight 
a protracted nuclear war defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
friday 
while the existence of such complexes has been known for years 
only recently have we been able to do the full analysis of the 
enormous extent of this program hundreds of meters deep with 
subways under several cities carlucci added 
to have something comparable wed have to have facilities 
where we could put every governor mayor every cabinet official 
and our whole command structure underground with subways running 
here and there theres just no comparison with us shelters 
built in the 1950s 
carlucci highlighted the soviet unions socalled passive 
defense program as he released the 1988 version of soviet 
military power an unclassified study of what the russian 
military has been doing over the past year 
the defense secretary cited the underground work as just one 
example of how soviet actions paint a different picture than the 
public statements of kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev with his 
emphasis on arms control initiatives and improving the economy 
without elaborating carlucci also made it clear the united 
states was developing a means of threatening the undergroud bunkers 
although the soviet program strikes at the very basis of 
deterrence we have a number of initiatives underway that will 
provide us an effective response to this program at a fraction of 
the cost that it must have taken the soviets to undertake it he 
said 
last year defense and energy department officials acknowledged 
work had begun on a new family of earthpenetrating nuclear 
warheads for us missiles 
there can be only one purpose for these shelters to provide 
the soviet leadership the ability to fight a protracted nuclear 
conflict carlucci declared these facilities contradict in 
steel and concrete soviet protestations that they share president 
reagans view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be 
fought 
the 1988 review the last to be prepared by the reagan 
administration is the seventh such assessment of soviet forces 
this years 175page glossy publication differs substantially from 
the earlier reports though in that it tries harder to gauge whos 
leading whom in various technologies and regions of the world 
the report does still focus on some new weapon developments 
though among them

the soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new 
blackjack longrange bomber deployment of the new railmounted 
ss24 nuclear missile has begun and production should start soon 
for a more accurate version of the huge ss18 intercontinental 
ballistic missile 
carlucci said the deployment of the ss24 was significant 
because it means the soviets now have two operational icbms that 
are mobile while were still arguing in the congress about 
whether we should have one 
two new attack helicopters the havoc and hokum are expected 
to enter serial production soon and the soviets have begun 
fielding a new tank derived from the t72 exhibiting improved 
protection better mobility and ehnahcned firepower 
the soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of 
sophisticated cruise missile systems and continue to lead the 
west in the pace of their activities in outer space 
in the area of star wars the soviets like the united states 
are unlikely to develop small kinetic kill rockets that could 
be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long range 
the soviets could however deploy a shortrange spacebased 
system for space station defense or closein attack by a 
maneuvering satellite in the near future 
in europe the soviets continue to improve their already large 
advantage in conventional weapons and troops but the north 
atlantic treaty organization is strong enough to deter attack 
primarily because the soviets believe the western allies would 
resort to nuclear weapons if in danger of being overrun the 
pentagon said 
that ability to deter an attack may depend however upon 
success in developing new types of conventional weapons and the 
wests current technological lead is threatened by an extensive 
soviet commitment to surpass the united states and its allies 
the soviet news agency tass in a response written by washington 
correspondent oleg polyakovsky criticized the administration 
friday for continuing to publish the pentagon review 
the stirring up of the myth about the soviet military menace 
is a traditional method of the us politics particularly at a 
time when the budget is being drafted polyakovsky said such a 
publication can do nothing but harm to sovietamerican relations

arrests and despite the death toll the inhabitants still feel 
the uprising is on the official was quoted as saying 
and what matters more than anything else is their own feelings

a mysterious explosion ripped open an 
aloha airlines jet like a convertible at 24000 feet injuring 
60 people and throwing or blowing a flight attendant to her death 
before the pilot landed safely 
there was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up 
and we were looking at blue sky said passenger bill fink of 
honolulu 
the boeing 737 with one of its two engines aflame and about 15 
to 20 feet of its cabin exposed behind the cockpit and down to the 
level of the passenger seats flew for 25 miles after the blast and 
made an emergency landing at kahului airport at 2 pm thursday 8 
pm edt airline officials said 
the cause of the blast on aloha flight 243 was unknown thursday 
night said kevin morimatsu a spokesman for the state department 
of transportation 
the national transportation safety board was sending 
investigators to the scene and fbi agents were sent from honolulu 
to determine whether the blast was caused by a bomb said fbi 
spokesman robert heafner 
however sources close to the federal investigation in 
washington said investigators were focusing most heavily on a 
possible structural failure that may have been caused by a rapid 
decompression and that the force of strong wind at 24000 feet may 
then have ripped away the huge section of fuselage the sources 
spoke on condition they not be identified 
george harvey federal aviation administration area coordinator 
for honolulu said today he could not confirm whether federal 
investigators suspected that a structural failure caused the 
fuselage to tear away from the airplane 
it stands to reason that theyre checking everything 
structure failure explosive devices harvey said ntsb 
investigators will hold their first news conference later today he 
said 
another passenger alice godwin of boulder city nev said she 
put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees i sang 
all the hymns i knew she said that kept me busy 
everybody screamed said dan dennin also of honolulu 
however it was very brief the panic the rest of the plane 
was intact and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or 
anything like that i think that people realized the plane was 
still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing 
whatever they could do to save their lives 
passenger daniel westfall of novato calif said the plane 
jerked around up and down 
mark eberly a ramp supervisor at the airport said he dropped 
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its 
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing i saw hair 
flying in the wind and arms dangling he said 
craig nichols of pocatello idaho said after the plane came to 
a stop on the ground he saw some really mangled people 
including one with an arm almost severed 
it looked like a normal landing with the whole top of the 
plane gone he said 
it looked like a convertible said joe ronderos of los 
angeles 
it was like somebody had peeled off a layer of skin you could 
just see all the passengers sitting there said george harvey 
area coordinator for the federal aviation administration in 
honolulu 
officials at boeing commercial airplanes the primary subsidiary 
of boeing co said there were no fuel lines or other potential 
sources for an explosion in that part of the plane 
the fuel is in the wing the engines are in the wing and the 
fuel lines are all right there boeing spokesman tom cole said in 
seattle 
to have it just explode in the air is just unheard of cole 
said i think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not 
related to any other accidents we have had 
even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore 
loose from an engine and ripped into the fuselage it could not hit 
forward from the wing and the effect would be nothing like what 
happened to the aloha plane he said 
the plane was one of nine 737200s delivered to aloha in the 
late 1970s said boeing spokesman david jimenez the first 737200 
was put into service in april 1968 
at a news conference in honolulu maurice myers president of 
aloha airlines said nothing is stored in the area of the the blast 
myers cited the extraordinary performance of pilot robert l 
schornstheimer in bringing the 737200 in safely schornstheimer 
has flown for the airline for 12 years 
i give credit to the pilot he brought that plane down so 
smoothly it was just like riding in a cadillac said passenger 
john lopez 40 of hilo 
ive had worse landings in normal aircraft dennin said 
sixty people were taken to maui memorial hospital and 12 were 
admitted two in critical condition and four serious said dr 
charles mitchell emergency room director injuries included burns 
bruises and cuts he said 
the missing flight attendant identified as clarabelle b 
lansing of honolulu was probably either ejected by the blast or 
blown out of the plane by the wind said clifford hue another faa 
area manager 
i think the stewardess mrs lansing had just picked up the 
microphone to start talking when the explosion occurred fink 
said 
fink and dennin said some of the passengers hung on to another 
standing flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the 
plane and they praised the cabin crew for helping calm the 
passengers 
the us coast guard mounted a search that included a cutter a 
c130 search and rescue aircraft and two helicopters said coast 
guard spokesman petty officer jeffrey crawley 
however searchers found no trace of mrs lansing a 37year 
employee of the airline or the missing section of the plane he 
said 
the explosion occurred southeast of maui while the plane was at 
an altitude of 24000 feet the airline said it said the 110mile 
flight from hilo on hawaii island to kahului carried 89 passengers 
five crew members and an air traffic controller from hilo airport

an auburn university student was 
arrested friday in connection with an incident last month in which 
a woman was repeatedly raped and left unconscious at a florida 
state university fraternity house authorities said 
jason j mcpharlin 19 of the albama schools pi kappa alpha 
chapter was charged with one count of accessory to a felony and 
one count of failure to report a sexual battery said florida state 
university police spokesman jack handley 
the warrants charged mcpharlin with having helped carry an 
unconscious sexual battery victim from the pi kappa alpha 
fraternity and leaving her in the hallway of the theta chi 
fraternity house said handley 
mcpharlin was to be booked into the leon county jail under a 
6000 bond 
meanwhile a threemember florida state committee met for the 
third day to discuss what punishment will be handed out to the 
fraternity two of whose members were charged earlier this week 
with raping and brutalizing the 18yearold woman 
the fraternity was suspended april 22 pending the hearing 
an interim grand jury report issued last week said the victim 
was raped by more than one person and was found at the theta chi 
fraternity early march 5 intoxicated to a lifethreatening

in 1933 when the marx brothers made the 
movie duck soup with its setting in the mythical kingdom of 
freedonia with two es fredonia mayor harry b hickey 
complained to paramount pictures 
the name of fredonia has been without a blot since 1817 
hickey said i feel it is my duty as mayor to question your 
intentions in using the name of our city in your picture 
the marx brothers fired back this reply 
your excellency they wrote our advice is that you change 
the name of your town it is hurting our picture what makes you 
think you are mayor of fredonia do you wear a black moustache 
play the harp speak with an italian accent or chase girls like 
harpo we are certain you do not therefore we must be the mayor 
of fredonia not you 
thus began the historic connection between the zany brothers and 
this western new york college town a link to be honored saturday 
in the second annual freedonia marxonia film festival and symposium 
about 1000 people wearing groucho glasses and noses are 
expected at fredonia state college for a group picture in the 
afternoon but thats not all 
there will be a serious speech by marx brothers expert paul g 
wesolowski and a nonserious duck soup competition how 
nonserious well last years winning entry was by student karen 
west who submitted a pet mallard duck paddling around in a washtub 
among turnips and carrots 
the post office has thrown itself into the spirit of things and 
will be canceling stamps with a postmark that shows groucho harpo 
and chico and has the extra e in fredonia 
postmaster robert kaus says hes gotten about 150 requests for 
the cancellation some from as far away as belgium italy and the

a group that says treaties giving indians 
special fishing and other rights are discriminatory has hit upon a 
novel fundraising approach its selling beer but critics say 
treaty beer is nothing but hate and prejudice in a can 
gov booth gardner sen dan evans church groups and other 
critics on thursday denounced plans to market the brew in 
washington and called for a boycott 
the first 2500 cases of the beer are scheduled to arrive in 
pierce county next week profits are to be earmarked for challenges 
to indian treaty rights 
dean crist president of stop treaty abuse the group that 
created the beer said his home state of wisconsin and perhaps 40 
other states are having disputes over treaties giving indians 
rights to fish hunt game and use other natural resources 
treaty beer was testmarketed in wisconsin and sold more than 
70000 cans in the first week crist said crist said he expects a 
million cases 24 million cans to be sold every year in 
washington 
the headline on advertising being run in washington newspapers 
says vote with your mouth 
some of the profits will be used to press for implementation of 
initiative 456 said steve arbaugh president of the puget sound 
gillnetters association a group of commercial fishermen in 
washington 
washington state voters approved the initiative in 1984 calling 
for congress to rescind old treaties that were interpreted by 
federal judges as guaranteeing indian fishermen in washington the 
right to half the fish in their usual and accustomed fishing 
grounds 
in separate actions thursday the governor issued a denunciation 
and called for a boycott of the beer and other critics staged a 
joint press conference in seattle 
treaty beer is not welcome in washington and i ask all 
citizens to join me in renouncing the effort to market it in our 
state gardner said 
the governor said cooperation not confrontation has finally 
been achieved in the wake of the court action as the state has 
developed peaceful joint management of fisheries 
gardner added there is very little the state can do to 
legally stop the sale of this product except to strongly 
discourage people to buy it 
the seattle press conference featured comments from evans 
indian rights activists and representatives of the church council 
of greater seattle the forest industry and environmentalists 
evans vice chair of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs said he was saddened to think that outside agitators see 
our state as fertile ground for their message of hate 
stuart bledsoe head of the washington forest protection 
association blasted the rascist mentality and added we 
recognize this brew for what it is hate and prejudice in a can 
in a separate press conference later crist and arbaugh denied 
they were racist crist who called himself an ardent sports 
fisherman said his group thinks treaties that give special fishing 
rights to indians are unfair to other fishermen 
i dont see it as a ku klux klan issue said arbaugh i 
dont see it as an issue to deprive someone of something i 
dont understand why people try to point this out as a racist 
issue racism is when people get special rights 
but bill frank jr chairman of the northwest indian fisheries 
commission called it an effort by antiindian extremists to 
violate treaties he called the beers promoters fringeelement 
radicals who consider indian land and resources fair game to fill 
their own pockets 
officials at schoenling brewing co cincinnati which is making 
the beer under contract for stop treaty abuse did not return 
telephone messages left thursday seeking comment

state corrections officials are 
consistently falling short of a selfimposed quota of releasing 
3000 inmates a month to ease prison crowding according to a 
published report friday 
despite record high parole approval rates the quota system 
which began in september has hit its goal only one month during a 
sixmonth period the houston chronicle said 
an examination of board of pardons and paroles records showed 
that 3083 inmates were paroled in october the only month the 
parolee total exceeded the monthly quota 
in september 2668 convicts were paroled 2057 were released 
in november 2441 in december 2241 in january and 2422 in 
february 
during the same sixmonth period officials approved parole for 
inmates under consideration for the first time at a rate ranging 
from 59 percent in january to 80 percent last september the rate 
for february the most recent month for which figures were 
available was 70 percent 
the revolvingdoor plan was instituted last fall as a 
quickfix to make room for the projected 36000 new inmates in the 
coming year the numbers represented an almost 100 percent criminal 
population turnover 
the catch was that only socalled nonviolent inmates 
serving time for passing bad checks theft creditcard abuse drug 
possession and burglary would be eligible for early release under 
the plan 
parole officials have been predicting in recent months that the 
pool of eligible inmates in those categories soon would dry up a 
situation that would force gov bill clements to invoke a state law 
that allows an award of goodconduct credit to inmates 
parole board member chris mealy said the quota system may be on 
the verge of running its course mealy said he will push a plan 
next week in which parole officials could contract private concerns 
for vacant space to house parole violators

a florida researcher said friday that baldness 
is caused by a biochemical change in cells that stop hair growth 
but it will be five to 10 years before a possible cure is ready for 
testing 
dr marty e sawaya a researcher at the university of miami 
school of medicine said she and colleagues have determined that 
hair follicles that cease growing hair have a high ratio of a 
singlemolecule protein that is able to carrying the male hormone 
testosterone into the cell nucleus and short circuit hair 
growth 
ms sawaya told a news conference at a meeting of the society 
for investigative dermatology that the discovery was made after she 
was able to separate out cells from scalp plugs from men at 
different stages of hair loss 
the physician said cells vigorously growing hair contain a high 
ratio of a protein she called a tetramer which has four molecules 
closely bound together 
but in scalp cells growing hair weakly or not at all she said 
the tetramer ratio is very low and a type of protein she called a 
monomer or a single molecule of protein was dominant 
ms sawaya said it appears the monomer is able to penetrate the 
nucleus of the hair cell and affect the genetic pattern of the cell 
that directs the growth of hair the tetramer protein however is 
unable to enter the cell nucleus 
also she said the monomer is four times more able to bind with 
testosterone than is the tetramer 
in other studies a miami research team was able to isolate an 
inhibitor protein that tends to block binding of the male hormone 
and the monomer ms sawaya said this binding is thought to be an 
important step in the process that leads to a halt in hair growth 
ms sawaya said she now is attempting to purify and eventually 
synthesize this inhibitor protein this protein possibly could be 
administered to men who are starting to go bald and thereby stop 
the process she said 
i would hope we could have something like that in the next 
five to 10 years she said therell be nothing any sooner than 
that 
ms sawaya said her research group has found a way to change the 
protein ratios in the cells and that this technology might 
eventually be applied to assist in the permanent removal of 
unwanted hair such as on the face of a woman 
dr vera price a clinical professor at the university of 
california san francisco praised the work by ms sawaya as 
tremendously interesting she has carried it explanation of 
baldness a little bit further it is an important next step 
ms price said the research clearly shows how the balance of 
protein types changes in hair follicles as they become 
progressively shorter 
normal hairgrowing follicles are long and filled with a thick 
hair shaft but follicles become progressively shorter and the hair 
shaft thinner as the protein ratio shifts 
dr david a norris a dermatology researcher at the university 
of colorado in denver said ms sawayas work has been examined by 
a peer review group and found to be well founded 
it is an important extension of our understanding of the local 
effects that cause male pattern baldness he said 
about 70 percent of all men over age 60 experience some form of 
male pattern baldness and for many the hair loss starts in the 20s 
and 30s hair loss is also a problem with 10 percent to 15 percent 
of the adult female population 
the society of investigative dermatology is a 50yearold 
organization of scientists specializing in rersearch of skin 
disorders

senate democratic leader robert c byrd said 
today he had tentatively decided to open debate may 11 on a 
ussoviet treaty to ban mediumrange nuclear missiles but only 
if the two superpowers could clear up differences on verification 
and other issues 
the state department meanwhile urged the senate to move 
forward expeditiously and said the treatys anticheating 
provisions were effective 
charles e redman the department spokesman said the soviets 
had taken a restrictive view of the right of us monitors to 
inspect containers for missile components as well as access to 
soviet facilities 
he said the state department had raised the issue with the 
soviets at a senior diplomatic level and was waiting for a reply 
so we will see what we get redman said 
the state department official called the soviet interpretation 
of the verification procedures unacceptable 
byrd made clear that debate would not begin on may 11 less 
than three weeks before president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev meet in moscow if areas of concern were still 
unresolved 
reagan administration officials are urging the legislators to 
approve the pact before the may 29june 2 summit to enhance 
prospects for the two nations agreeing to other weapons restraints 
the majority leader said he is especially concerned by published 
reports quoting ranking soviet military leaders as appearing to be 
back away from mutual understandings on what would be permitted 
under treaty provisions allowing onsite verification inspection s 
byrd called on both washington and moscow to quickly deal with that 
question as well as others including a treaty ambiguity on what 
constitutes a weapons delivery system and whether or not such 
star wars weapons as those using laser beams or particle ray 
generatiors are covered by the pact 
earlier a us arms control official said the embassy in moscow 
has been in touch with soviet officials to resolve the differences 
they raised on how to verify compliance with the treaty 
we anticipate that itll be cleared up the official of the 
arms control and disarmament agency said thursday speaking on 
condition of anonymity we dont think this will be a big 
problem 
meanwhile the senate intelligence committee in a closed 
session this week voted sharp cuts in the budgets for intelligence 
agencies because of irritation at the administrations failure to 
seek improved surveillance systems for use in verifying the treaty 
the new york times reported today 
committee chairman sen david l boren dokla said in an 
interview that he is prepared to filibuster the treaty unless the 
white house requests the money the intelligence panel believes is 
needed for monitoring the times reported

panamanian exiles on friday blasted a 
ussponsored deal that would allow gen manuel antonio noriega to 
resign as defense chief calling the change purely cosmetic and one 
that could create an antiamerican backlash 
the us attorneys office meanwhile said drug indictments 
against the panamanian strongman remain in force 
in washington sources reported friday that noriega had agreed 
to step down from his powerful post as head of panamas military 
but would not leave his country immediately as us officials had 
initially demanded 
the reports did not say whether dismissing noriegas 
cocainetrafficking charges in miami and tampa was part of the 
deal but such offers have reportedly been made in the past 
this sounds like a surrender with cosmetics said roberto 
eisenmann exiled publisher of the closed independent newspaper la 
prensa this is the same mistake all over again the united 
states intervening in panama ignoring totally the political forces 
of the country 
gilberto mallol exile representative here of the panamanian 
opposition umbrella group the civic crusade agreed 
this cosmetic solution will only take the country down the 
road to disaster said mallol the reagan administration has no 
right to decide noriega can remain in panama 
mallol disputed us contentions that noriega will be out of 
power as soon as he is out of uniform obviously this deal shows 
noriega is making conditions he will continue to interfere and 
continue the militarization of panama 
mallol warned that the deal could backfire on the united states 
causing a wave of antiamerican sentiment among noriega opponents 
eisenmann said the opposition will not let up because of the 
deal noting the latest outbreak of antinoriega demonstrations 
thursday hundreds of people demonstrated in panama city burning 
barricades and chanting against the military leader 
both mallol and eisenmann agreed that noriega should remain in 
panama only if he agrees to submit to panamanian justice 
they also said the nation must move toward a true democracy and 
break the panamanian defense forces stranglehold on power 
the problem isnt noriega said mallol its the military 
if the militarization of panama is not ended what looks like a 
shortterm solution will lose panama in the long term 
meanwhile the us attorneys office in miami said it had not 
been notified of any change in the status of noriegas indictment 
which accuses him of accepting 46 million in bribes from the 
medellin cartel to protect its cocainesmuggling operations in 
panama he is also under indictment in tampa on separate drug 
charges 
the only two people who can dismiss an indictment are the 
attorney general of the united states or the us attorney for the 
district in which the indictment was brought said richard 
gregorie chief assistant us attorney and lead prosecutor in the 
case as far as we are concerned no dismissal has been entered 
here

the apparent arrest of an underground christian 
preacher comes during a time of unusual tolerance by the communist 
government toward chinas illegal house churches 
another underground minister in beijing said authorities 
recently have not stopped him and other preachers from holding 
weekly services in their homes for dozens and even hundreds of 
people even though they violate chinas ban on preaching outside 
statesanctioned churches 
the minister who spoke on condition of anonymity painted a 
picture of an underground movement toughened by past harsh 
repression and confident it can survive any setbacks 
i was in prison more than 20 years im experienced the 
74yearold minister said grinning broadly if i am arrested 
again and die for the lord it is glorious 
he and xu yongzhe who disappeared april 16 and is believed to 
have been arrested are among thousands of protestant ministers and 
catholic priests and nuns who refuse to join the official churches 
instead they preach at home 
about 8 million people belong to the official protestant and 
catholic churches in china and nearly as many are believed to 
belong to the house churches 
the believers make up a tiny fraction of chinas more than 1 
billion people 
although some house church preachers and members remain in 
prisons and labor camps the minister said there were 500 in 
custody the government is more tolerant of their activities than 
ever before in nearly four decades of communist rule 
the minister said authorities have not bothered him even though 
he remains under probation after being freed from jail in 1979 and 
holds two services each sunday forty people crowd into his 
oneroom home something impossible to hide from neighbors in 
beijings tightly packed residential areas 
xus arrest however was no surprise he had been a fugitive 
since 1982 when he escaped from a jail in henan in central china 
hopped on a bicycle and peddled into hiding he ran an underground 
seminary but was not especially prominent among house church 
preachers his fellow minister said 
xu believed to be about 50 had been in jail only a few months 
charged with illegal proselytizing the other minister said he did 
not know xus sentence 
he said hed been expecting xu to visit the day he disappeared 
instead xus sister came alone and reported that xu disappeared 
while visiting the beijing zoo with two friends the second day 
after he left his hiding place in northern china to hear visiting 
american evangelist billy graham preach in beijing 
he said xus sister received no confirmation from authorities 
that he had been arrested but it appeared certain the ministry of 
state security refused to answer queries about xu 
graham said friday in hong kong at the end of his 16day chinese 
tour that he asked highlevel chinese officials about the reported 
arrest but received neither confirmation nor denial 
the renowned southern baptist minister said he prayed for xu and 
told chinese officials his reaction to the report but could not 
otherwise intervene 
our hope is from the lord not from billy graham xus 
colleague said 
the minister said he studied theology under western missionaries 
in the 1930s but xu and younger house preachers learned through 
selfstudy and informal training by house church preachers funds 
and thousands of bibles are smuggled in each year from religious 
groups outside china 
the minister said the house churches have no central 
organization and do not oppose the government 
we have no time to mess with the things of the world he 
said 
i believe politics and religion should be separate the 
official churches have become a tool of the government they 
preach to serve the modernization policy 
indeed chinas catholic church does not recognize the vatican 
during the 196676 far leftist cultural revolution all churches 
were closed and religious activity was banned 
although some churches have been reopened since deng xiaoping 
came to power in 1978 ministers and priests are closely 
circumscribed they cannot give religious instruction to anyone 
under 18 and must support government campaigns 
preaching on themes such as diligence honesty and respect for 
parents is considered to have social value but the christian 
belief that jesus christ will come again at the end of the world is 
discouraged as likely to undermine hard work 
we are free but only inside the circle the minister said 
running a finger around the rim of a rice bowl in illustration

thousands of people gathered for a 
march through downtown panama city today to support strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega after reports that he had agreed to resign 
as defense chief 
many government offices closed at midmorning and employees were 
told to join the march called by the front for popular unity 
a us official in washington said that under an agreement with 
the reagan administration noriega would stay in panama after 
resigning initially the united states had insisted that he leave 
the country 
it is they the united states that are now seeking a 
facesaving maneuver said a panamanian government official who 
spoke on condition he not be identified 
michael kozak an aide to assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams met with noriega this week and was back in washington 
today the us official said 
there was no official comment here on the reported talks 
panamanian government officials have not confirmed that they were 
being held 
as commander of the 15000member defense forces noriega has 
been the power behind the civilian government 
but the us official said that noriega once he steps down 
would be like a cop out of uniform and would cease to be the 
dominant political force in panama 
the government official said he saw nothing new in the 
washington reports 
on thursday security agents arrested at least 30 people in a 
crackdown on noriega opponents and authorities issued arrest 
warrants for opposition leaders 
riot police and plainclothes officers fired birdshot into the 
air from 12gauge shotguns and lobbed tear gas canisters to 
disperse small groups of protesters in panama city 
hundreds of demonstrators set up burning barricades and taunted 
police and riot troops who patrolled in trucks 
the protesters chanted get out noriega justice and 
in a derogatory reference to noriegas pockmarked face down with 
pineapple face 
journalists saw police arrest several people in the city of 
david near the costa rican border a church source in david said at 
least two people were wounded when demonstrators began throwing 
rocks at police 
police refused to comment on the reports 
before the demonstrations attorney general carlos a villalaz 
told a news conference that the 30 people arrested were planning a 
threeday campaign of violence which he said may have included 
tampering with two panama canal locks 
villalaz said arrest warrants had been issued for 35 directors 
of the national civic crusade an umbrella organization of civic 
and professional groups that has organized antinoriega protests 
since june 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater signaled a shift in us 
policy thursday when he said the administration while not 
insisting that noriega leave panama wants him at least to leave 
power 
the washington post today quoted a source as saying noriega 
would leave after a facesaving transition and was known to 
favor the dominican republic 
the agreement also provides that noriega would not be 
extradicted to the united states according to the post noriega is 
under us indictment on drug charges 
reagan administration officials reportedly have been seeking 
more subtle ways to get noriega to step down after failing to 
dislodge the general with the economic sanctions which have 
created a severe cash shortage in panama 
acting president manuel solis palma told a gathering of 
international labor organizers thursday that panama will continue 
to resist us pressure to oust noriega 
noriega won a legal battle thursday when a federal judge in 
miami ruled he could challenge one of two drugtrafficking 
indictments without surrendering to us authorities 
us district judge william hoeveler gave the generals 
attorney neal sonnett 10 days to submit challenges to the feb 4 
indictment and said he would set a hearing date after the 
government responded

jesse jackson stepped up his attack on 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis friday accusing him of 
being either ignorant or wrong about issues involving southern 
africa 
specifically jackson complained that dukakis had expressed 
opposition to providing weapons to mozambiques marxistled 
government for use against a rebel movement that is brutalizing the 
country 
dukakis he said either has a lack of understanding about the 
options in the region or he supports a policy thats inconsistent 
with the progressive and democratic thrust in the world 
jackson made the comments to reporters following a speech to 
about 2500 students at euclid high school where he received a 
cordial reception but one that was less enthusiastic than he 
usually gets at schools 
he portrayed dukakis as being to the right of president reagan 
on mozambique stating that even conservative british prime 
minister margaret thatcher sends arms to mozambique he said reagan 
wanted to do so also but was thwarted by congressional 
conservatives 
throughout the campaign jackson has made attempts to bring 
southern africa into the campaign debate and he has been making a 
renewed and more intense push to do so as dukakis lead in the 
delegate race has widened 
in the face of the growing likelihood that dukakis will be the 
democratic nominee jackson says he wants to delineate the 
distinctions between himself and the massachusetts governor while 
also trying to focus attention on issues he considers important 
the approach is in contrast to the posture jackson maintained 
through most of the campaign in which he avoided singling out 
democratic opponents for criticism 
campaigning friday in search of votes for tuesdays ohio 
primary jackson also repeated his charge that dukakis has no plan 
to reverse reagan administration economic policies but wants only 
to manage reaganomics 
he said dukakis stance on mozambique exposes a lack of 
understanding of foreign policy the front line states around 
south africa need to be able to defend themselves from south 
africa 
south africa denies it supports the mozambican rebel group 
known as renamo but the state department has said there is 
evidence to the contrary 
jackson in recent days has called on vice president george bush 
the likely republican presidential nominee and dukakis to join him 
in calling for south africa to be treated as a terrorist state 
because of its support for renamo 
it does not take much to class south africa to be a terrorist 
state he said if one does however you must then trigger 
antiterrorist policies we must then put on full trade and arms 
embargoes against south africa and engage our allies with whom we 
trade arms and insist they not sell arms to south africa 
on friday jackson also addressed an outdoor rally under chilly 
gray skies in downtown cleveland a few hundred people braved the 
wind and cold to attend 
at the predominantly white euclid high school jacksons usual 
crowdrousing i am somebody chant drew halfhearted audience 
participation 
when the crowd weakly repeated the words after him the 
candidate joked youre all so pitiful 
eventually he warmed them up by shouting euclid no one 
but afterward student maren lueersen 17 said she felt his 
presentation was too much like church with the students being 
asked to recite chants and stand when he asked how many people knew 
someone who was killed or jailed because of drugs

pediatrics the next week will be the most crucial he said 
quintuplets occur naturally once per 6 million to 7 million 
births according to the hospital but use of a fertility drug ups 
those odds the only other set of quintuplets born at mageewomens 
hospital in 1966 all died within days of birth

or make major changes at their fourbedroom home in greenville a 
small community in northwestern pennsylvania 
weve tried as much as possible to keep a normal attitude 
about the things that we do from day to day simunich said we 
dont have a choice and to worry about it just causes more 
anxiety 
mrs simunich was hospitalized about a month ago as a precaution 
and went into labor several times but was given a drug that stopped 
it wednesday night doctors decided they could wait no longer and 
a 33member medical team delivered the babies by caesarean section 
the quintuplets are expected to remain in the hospital until 
late july 
mrs simunich said her career plans are up in the air but she 
hopes eventually to return to nursing parttime in the meantime 
shes going to go home and wait for the babies to join her

the new defense secretary frank carlucci on 
friday put his own moderate stamp on the pentagons annnual review 
soviet military power 
the book has generated a host of critics and at least two 
imitations since thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger issued 
the first edition in 1981 at the outset of the reagan 
administrations 1 trillion defense buildup 
the soviet union has its own version whence the threat to 
peace and tom gervasi a critic of the us military this 
spring published what he calls an annotated and corrected 
version of the pentagons propaganda document 
now austerity has put a crimp in the pentagon budget and time 
and carlucci have removed some of the books more jagged edges 
early editions of soviet military power drew criticism from 
many analysts on capitol hill and outside government because of 
alleged innaccuracies and failure to compare overall capabilities 
of the warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty organization 
the 1988 edition released at a news conference on friday the 
first since carlucci became replaced weinberger as defense 
secretary last nov 5 addresses those criticisms by including more 
comparative text and graphs it also acknowledges that the west 
leads in such areas as naval power and high technology 
the book has shed the warlike red cover of previous years in 
favor of calmer gray background and a photograph of kremlin leader 
mikhail s gorbachev on the deck of a soviet typhoon nuclear 
ballistic missile submarine 
also the publication devotes most of its first 30 pages to 
gorbachevs overall national security policy before turning to 
military spending and hardware 
youll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this 
year than in previous years carlucci told reporters 
during my testimony before congress earlier this year i 
received a number of requests for an assessment of how soviet 
military capabilities relate to our national interests our 
military capabilities and those of our allies he said 
furthermore i believe it is especially important to share 
with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and 
implications of soviet military power as possible and so this year 
the scope of the book has been expanded said carlucci we 
welcome criticism 
the latest 175page volume is nearly double the 99 pages of the 
first edition and for the first time contains an index to weapons 
and photographs 
in 1981 weinberger in a presentation beamed by satellite to 
europe issued the first edition together with a declaration that 
the soviet union was stronger militarily than the united states 
weinberger billed the book as a compendium of scrubbed 
intelligence reports on soviet defense but analysts outside 
government called it a rehash of information already available 
publicly 
it contained colorful maps charts photographs and artists 
renditions of soviet weaponry the pentagon published a 
russianlanguage version which diplomats in moscow circulated 
among soviet contacts 
the kremlin was not pleased 
the soviet communist party daily pravda published a lengthy 
frontpage editorial describing the pentagon book as a big lie 
designed for simpletons 
it is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to 
judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of pentagon 
propaganda pravda said on oct 17 1981 
a few years later the kremlin weighed in with its own effort 
whence the threat to peace drawing largely on western 
publications to back soviet claims that washington was the chief 
instigator of the arms race 
in his version issued this spring us author gervasi was no 
less harsh than the kremlin 
gervasi wrote that in editions as recent as last year even 
the most basic facts are distorted as part of reagan 
administration efforts to prove that the united states is on the 
losing end of a military gap 
gervasis version includes the 1987 edition of the pentagon 
book overlaid with his own commentaries in large part corrections 
of the range and capabilities of soviet and american weaponry 
in almost every case the americans have taken the lowest 
estimate for us capabilities and the highest for the soviets 
gervasi said in his book and in a telephone interview 
military expert david isby says that gervasi too plays with 
the numbers 
gervasi he said believes that the soviet union no matter 
what its flaws is never as bad as the united states he looks for 
any figure that shows a soviet weapon to be less capable

a massachusettsbased company reported to be 
planning major layoffs has failed to notify the state at a time 
when democratic presidential hopeful michael dukakis has been 
touting a state law on the subject 
a state official says the law wouldnt apply in the case 
dukakis wants president reagan to sign a federal trade bill that 
requires companies to warn workers 60 days before a major layoff or 
plant shutdown he has emphasized that massachusetts was one of the 
first states to impose its own plantclosing law 
the issue has been of particular importance to the massachusetts 
governor as he campaigns in industrial sections of ohio and 
indiana which have primaries tuesday 
dukakis administration officials said it was only this week that 
they saw press reports that cullinet software inc planned to lay 
off 400 of its 2400 workers monday and that half the layoffs would 
occur at the companys westwood mass plant 
cullinet spokeswoman frances wheeler termed reports of the 
layoffs rumors she said she was familiar with the state 
plantclosing law but we dont have any set bound company 
policy about notifying 
of course we would always prefer advance warning said rick 
gureghian spokesman for dukakis executive office of economic and 
manpower affairs 
however unlike the federal proposal the massachusetts law 
requests but does not require companies to provide advance warning 
of plant closings dukakis defends it as effective and says there 
are sanctions to make companies comply in many ways he said 
of the states law it goes beyond this federal proposal and in 
other ways it doesnt 
gureghian said the state defines a plant closing as laying off 
90 percent of the work force at a plant a partial closing 
gureghian said is a permanent cessation of a major discreet 
portion of a company or division 
the reported plans for cullinet layoffs would not apply to 
either definition he said

the biggest burger maker in the free world wants 
to find out if it can cut the mustard in moscow but only after it 
goes hungary 
mcdonalds announced friday it will open the first of a string 
of eateries in downtown moscow next year 
it may not mean golden arches in red square but it will mean 
muscovites can munch fries slurp shakes and gobble big maks 
just like their western counterparts courtesy of mcglasnost 
i think the mcdonalds in moscow will be the highest volume 
mcdonalds in the world predicted george a cohon president of 
mcdonalds restaurants of canada ltd after signing a joint pact 
with the moscow city government 
meanwhile the first mcdonalds in a soviet bloc country opens 
its doors saturday in hungary the budapest burger emporium was 
dedicated on friday 
last month mcdonalds opened a restaurant in belgrade 
yugoslavia its first in a communist nation impatient customers 
waiting in line on opening day became so unruly that police were 
called 
although five more restaurants are planned for belgrade moscow 
could be the big enchilada for mcdonalds which had worldwide 
sales of 143 billion last year 
cohon and vladimir i malishkov chief of food services for the 
soviet capital signed an agreement for the creation of up to 20 
fastfood eateries in moscow and the building of a commissary to 
process beef potatoes and other foods mcdonalds uses 
a big mac our worldfamous sandwich will taste the same in 
moscow as it does in toronto or tokyo or rio or new york 
cohon vowed at a news conference in moscows city hall 
the agreement which gives mcdonalds of canada a 49 percent 
share in the sovietcontroled joint firm is the latest business 
venture concluded by the soviets with a foreign company and th 
first with a canadian firm 
last year the kremlin enacted a new law on joint ventures in a 
bid to woo capital technology and expertise from abroad the 
reform is part of changes enacted under soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev designed to improve the quality and quantity of consumer 
goods 
pepsico inc last september signed a contract to open two pizza 
hut restaurants in moscow in a joint venture a new jersey company 
called astropizza brought a van into the capital this month to 
serve pizza to soviets and foreigners and plans to open a joint 
venture restaurant in moscow later this year 
malishkov and moscow deputy mayor valery a zharov said the 
soviets want to draw upon the expertise of the usbased 
mcdonalds to improve service in their countrys food industry 
and the moscow restaurants are only the beginning 
were not thinking of just opening 20 mcdonalds in this 
country cohon said there will be many more 
soviets will be able to buy a big mac the chains doublepatty 
hamburger sandwich for about 2 rubles or roughly 3 
the first mcdonalds in the soviet capital is expected to open 
on gorky street next year cohon said but nobody will say where 
we dont want to create any lines zharov said with a smile

thousands of employees struck for higher 
pay at a heavy machinery plant friday capping a week of polands 
worst labor trouble since the communist authorities suppressed 
solidarity more than six years ago 
warsaw police detained jacek kuron a senior adviser to the 
outlawed union a member of his household said three 
plainclothesmen arrived as kuron was being interviewed by telephone 
by a western radio station 
strikes began monday with bus and streetcar drivers at bydgoszcz 
in the west workers at the huge lenin steel works at nowa huta in 
the southern industrial belt followed suit tuesday and on friday 
it was the machinery plant at stalowa wola about 65 miles east of 
nowa huta 
another job action was threatened for over the may day holiday 
weekend solidarity activists in krakows municipal transport 
company said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 am 
saturday to support the nowa huta workers 
workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more prices rose 
42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government 
reduced subsidies on many consumer items 
the government has both threatened dismissals and promised to 
improve wages at bydgoszcz the 2800 drivers won a 60 percent pay 
increase with an 11hour strike 
officials of solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities 
use force against strikers they said workers in at least four 
other cities had declared support for the nowa huta action and 
issued strike alerts 
in west germany the newspaper bild quoted solidarity founder 
lech walesa as saying in an interview the strike has to spread 
because the economic situation is bad we really didnt want to 
strike because strikes have never filled a bread basket but the 
government leaves us no choice but to fight for our rights 
government spokesman jerzy urban said an attempt to start a 
strike failed at the 18000worker stalowa wola heavy machinery 
plant but the official news agency pap said later at least one 
department was shut down 
a roman catholic priest in stalowa wola the rev jan niemiec 
said about 7000 strikers were occupying three department and the 
strike began when about 5000 firstshift employees quit working 
he said management tried to lock out most of the secondshift 
workers but some broke in 
niemiec said the number of strikers could be as high as 9000 
but he could not confirm the figure he said the information came 
from a member of the strike committee 
in poland strikers customarily go to their places of employment 
but do not work often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets 
about 12000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the lenin 
plant in nowa huta which means new steel mill and was built as a 
model city in the 1950s just outside krakow 
management representatives met with the plants 
governmentsanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial 
committee that claims to represent at least half the plants 32000 
workers 
the nowa huta strike is the biggfest in poland since those that 
swept the country after food price increases in 1980 bringing down 
a government and giving birth to solidarity the independent union 
federation was suppressed then outlawed after martial law was 
declared in december 1981 
urban said there had been preventative detentions in poland 
this week but did not say how many kuron the solidarity adviser 
said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been 
picked up around the country in the past two days 
bronislaw geremek an adviser to walesa said police stopped his 
car thursday in stalowa wola and detained him solidarity spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz and warsaw solidarity leader zbigniew bujak he 
said onyszkiewicz and bujak remained in custody 
zbigniew romaszewski a solidarity spokesman in warsaw said 
many police were in stalowa wola and at least four solidarity 
activists were detained 
demands at nowa huta are representative recognition of their 
union rights release of detained solidarity activists and an 
immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the 
equivalent of 105 
the strike committee said it had sent a letter to pope john paul 
ii who was krakows archbishop before becoming pope that began 
we address you with our words of devotion and respect we are 
sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for 
decent payment 
urban told a news conference in warsaw the situation in 
poland is not dramatic with only one strike in nowa huta and an 
attempt to organize a strike that failed in stalowa wola 
he said the nowa huta management had decided to fire striking 
workers 
labor minister ireneneusz sekula said the government would 
announce tax law changes and other measures in a few days allowing 
enterprises to grant higher pay he said he could not be more 
specific 
trybuna ludu the communist party newspaper attacked mr 
walesa and company who are trying to use the uneasy situation 
for their own political goals 
it said demands for higher wages were calls for anarchy to 
start unrestrained inflation to create a situation in which we 
would once again have empty store shelves and the creditors would 
lose their growing confidence in us

a new government policy that threatens to turn 
diplomats unpaid parking tickets into airplane tickets expelling 
them from britain has foreign envoys rushing to pay their fines 
the foreign office said friday that 18000member diplomatic 
community ran up only 14437 unpaid fines last year compared with 
108845 in 1984 
foreign office minister timothy eggar told parliament in a 
written statement that the number was down 35 percent from 1986 
diplomats under international conventions are immune from 
prosecution for offenses committed in the host country but the 
host can have the offender expelled 
the foreign office says that in 1985 it began issuing expulsion 
threats against repeat parking offenders but has not yet ordered 
anyone out it said it sent out a dozen such warnings last year 
many diplomats complain they have to park illegally because 
their missions are in the congested heart of london 
egypt with 799 unpaid fines topped eggars list 
rounding out the top five were the soviet union with 622 china 
with 551 france with 513 and spain with 435 
the united nations and 10 countries had no fines unpaid last 
year angola australia el salvador grenada guatemala malta 
new zealand switzerland tonga and the vatican 
the us embassy had 77 unpaid fines only 17 of them in the 
second half of the year canada had 130 including 36 in the second 
half 
we decided in 1985 that we were going to take a very tough 
line and insist that diplomats paid their fines eggar told a 
reporter 
we cant force them to pay he said but we regard it as 
an abuse of diplomatic immunity and we make it quite clear that 
if they are persistent offenders and they dont pay they cant 
stay in the united kingdom 
the foreign office has no figures for fines paid but eggar 
said up to 1984 the number of unpaid fines was rising 
dramatically it is now falling even more dramatically 
he said he would thank missions which pay their fines and 
demand improvements from those that dont he added he was 
confident that all british diplomats abroad paid their fines 
in new york philip goldberg of the citys commission for the 
united nations and the consular corps said british diplomats do 
have outstanding unpaid parking tickets and like most nations 
diplomats generally do not pay them 
but he added british diplomats get relatively few tickets 
they have one of the best records for violations per 
vehicle he said 
in another commons reply eggar reported 43 alleged serious 
offenses by foreign diplomats in 1987 resulting in 18 diplomats 
being ousted 
the offenses included 26 cases of drunken driving 13 of theft 
and shoplifting and one each of forgery driving without 
insurance possession of drugs and indecent assault

a judge ruled friday that a man found 
innocent by reason of insanity on rape charges because he had 
multiple personalities is now well apparently clearing the way for 
his release 
william milligan has been confined in various mental 
institutions around the state for much of the time since the 
original ruling in 1977 
judge c howard johnson said psychiatric and psychological 
reports show milligans multiple personalities have fused and that 
he is well 
milligan who was charged with rape and abduction in three 
attacks in the columbus area once had more than 20 personalities 
according to the book the minds of billy milligan 
as a result of the judges ruling milligan was transferred from 
the maximum security section of the timothy moritz forensics center 
here to the central ohio psychiatric hospital 
milligan had been confined at the moritz center since he was 
captured in december 1986 after escaping from the central ohio 
psychiatric hospital on july 4 1986 
officials say it will take about a month to place him in private 
housing and help him try to find a job 
during his court appearance friday milligan pledged to obey the 
law and said he wants to be a taxpaying citizen he said he wants 
to continue his work as an artist or find a job involving 
computers 
milligan still must undergo therapy twice a week for the next 
year according to the judges ruling 
milligan also was charged in a november 1984 shooting at a barn 
on property owned by a worker at a mental health facility where he 
was a patient 
no one was injured in the shooting and the case was dismissed 
after defense attorneys claimed that milligans constitutional 
rights were violated when a jailer recorded his side of a phone 
conversation with his attorney

delegates committed to albert gore jr and 
paul simon are beginning to defect to democratic frontrunner 
michael dukakis whose presidential campaign is gently pursuing 
them 
we dont consider it raiding said susan brophy a delegate 
tracker for dukakis we consider it a reintroduction 
its definitely a soft sell she said 
gore and simon have both suspended their campaigns but have not 
formally dropped out of the race they hold a combined total of 
just over 600 delegates 
tad devine director of field operations for dukakis said 
weve seen some come in in the last few weeks and we expect to 
rack up some more with another couple of wins which has been the 
case since new york and pennsylvania 
the number of public converts to other campaigns is still small 
one of them jack burson was among 23 delegates in louisiana 
pledged to support gore based on the results of the states march 8 
presidential primary but he has recently switched to dukakis 
gore was my first choice but as i see it hes no longer in 
the race and i had to choose between the people who are burson 
said friday 
burson is one of more than 3500 pledged delegates to the 
democratic national convention who were being picked because of 
their support for a particular presidential candidate party rules 
say those delegates shall in all good conscience reflect the 
sentiments of those who elected them 
party leaders say that means they are free to change their minds 
louisiana democratic chairman james brady said tennessee sen 
gores decision to put his campaign on hold makes his delegates 
gore delegates in name only brady said hes fielded questions 
from a number of them since the campaign was suspended on april 21 
the main question is are we still going brady said we 
had a number of the gore people who thought that since gore was no 
longer there that they may be bumped 
they will go to the convention as gore delegates brady 
said theyll vote for somebody other than gore thats for 
sure 
thats not how the gore campaign prefers to see it 
our preference is at this point in time that the gore 
delegates remain gore delegates said rick hutcheson gores 
delegate tracker who was not aware of bursons defection i 
think there remains a great deal of affection and loyalty to al and 
thats what were going to continue to see 
but david carle a spokesman for simon said the illinois 
senator expected that some of his delegates would go elsewhere when 
his campaign was suspended on april 7 
he made clear to his delegates and other supporters around the 
country that he remained a candidate and intended to go to the 
convention but also expressed understanding for any individual 
decisions that his changed status prompted with his supporters and 
delegates carle said 
however carle said later that he was wrong about the simon 
campaign being resigned to losing delegates he said the campaign 
was staying in contact with the delegates by telephone and letter 
to encourage them to stay with simon 
simon is considering a meeting after june 7 to consult with 
his delegates about what they would prefer to do at that point 
carle said 
so far simon has lost one delegate to dukakis rep barbara 
boxer of california although she is one of the super 
delegates a special class reserved for party leaders and 
politicians who are free to support whomever they please 
kathleen vick who chairs the democrats rules committee said 
two recent developments in the party have contributed to the 
phenomenon of defecting delegates the suspended campaign that is 
neither active nor abandoned and a rules change 
weve got a new fuzzy area of the law as it were ms vick 
said 
eight years ago a democratic delegate was bound to support his 
candidate no matter what and the rules were changed specifically 
to soften that she said 
i think the operative word here is in all good conscience 
she said in 1980 people were calling the delegates automatons

arrested uni said 
merchants around amritsars golden temple sikhisms holiest 
shrine closed their shops when militants fired at a patrol of the

singh 
the attack started when the troops attempted to arrest a wanted 
militant as he was heading for the shrine baldev singh said the 
troops returned the fire but the militant escaped in the confusion 
one woman was injured in the 20minute firefight he said the 
attack prompted authorities to place the citys police force on a 
red alert although security forces did not attempt to enter the 
temple 
security forces have entered the temple previously but usually 
avoid doing so because of sikh sentiment police estimate that at 
least 100 militants armed with automatic rifles are hiding in the 
shrine 
in other militant attacks thursday night at least seven hindus 
were shot and killed in two villages near amritsar five sikhs were 
killed in a raid on a farmers home also near amritsar

the navy said friday it had begun opening 
additional seagoing combat support jobs to women selecting a 
group of 24 for deployment on two ships later this summer 
two women officers and 22 women enlisted personnel will report 
for duty aboard the fleet oilers uss cimarron homeported in pearl 
harbor hawaii in august and uss monongahela homeported in 
norfolk va in september the navy said in a statement 
the two ships were selected because they require the least 
modification to accommodate women 
the upcoming assignments are being made under a decision 
announced last dec 21 by thennavy secretary james h webb 
following a special internal study on the role of women in the navy 
webb adopted what he described as the first clear concise 
definition of combat missions to help determine on which ships 
women could serve unless a ship or aircraft has as its primary 
objective the goal to seek out reconnoiter and engage the 
enemy the jobs on that ship or aircraft should be open to women 
he said 
that policy when fully implemented will almost triple the 
number of seagoing jobs open to women to a new total of almost 
15000 by opening billets on socalled combat logistics force 
ships like the cimarron and monongahela 
all told 27 logistic ships are being opened to female sailors 
further assignments of women to clf ships will continue at a 
measured pace from december 1988 through july 1991 based on 
completion of ship alterations and ship operational requirements 
the navy said 
the navy has about 54000 women on activeduty or about 9 
percent of the force of that total about 5200 are serving on 86 
navy and military sealift command vessels many of them small 
ships including tugs tenders and auxiliaries of various types

saudis said they ended relations because of irans terrorism and 
subversion 
the saudi statement referred to riots by iranian pilgrims at 
mecca last year during the haj the annual pilgrimage to islams 
holiest shrines more than 400 people died in the violence july 31 
after the riots iranians attacked the saudi embassy in iran and 
iranian revolutionary guards conducted strikes on commercial 
shipping in the persian gulf region 
urging all moslem states to follow the saudi example and sever 
their ties with tehran the newspaper alyawm said the islamic 
conference should also expel iran and turn over its seat to the 
iranian opposition 
former iranian leaders shahpour bakhtiar and abolhassan bani 
sadr who are living in exile were among the first to express 
support for the saudi diplomatic break with tehran 
the paper noted that the last ministerial conference of the 
islamic organization held in march in jordan had backed the saudi 
condemnation of the iranian action at mecca and its determination 
to accept only 45000 iranian pilgrims at the upcoming haj as 
compared to 150000 last year 
the saudis have asked all islamic countries to reduce the 
numbers of pilgrams because of ongoing renovations at mecca the 
iranians have refused 
when the iranian government refuses to abide by the decision 
to limit the numbers of pilgrims this means it rejects islamic 
unanimity and breaks off from islamic ranks the paper wrote it 
also accused iran of being a source of terrorism to all 
throughout the world 
iran accuses the saudis of aiding iraq its enemy in the 
7yearold gulf war the iranians regularly attack neutral ships 
including saudi vessels in retaliation for iraqi air raids on its 
tankers 
iran frequently calls for the overthrow of the saudi government 
on thursday tehran radio quoted the martyrs foundation which 
helps the families of slain soldiers as saying it will not be 
long before the sacred shrines will be free from the blooddripping 
claws of the corrupt and dependent sheiks 
the martyrs foundation said the decision to limit the number of 
pilgrims to mecca was grossly impudent and contrary to the 
koran islams holy book 
in kuwait the country closest to the iraqiran war and a target 
of systematic acts of sabotage by proiranian elements as well as 
iranian missile strikes the newspaper alanbaa said the government 
and other arab states should follow the saudi example 
iran has also been accused of collusion in the recent hijacking 
of a kuwait airways jetliner the hijackers who killed two 
hostages had demanded the release of 17 proiranian terrorists 
jailed in kuwait 
as we praise saudi arabias firm and correct decision we 
demand that this decision be turned into a pangulf and even 
panarab one because iran has opted for being an enemy of the arabs 
and it does not conceal its enmity threats and ambitions but 
declare them in a flagrant manner alanbaa wrote

a hundred photographers fanned out across 
california on friday using thousands of rolls of film for an 
everyday portrait of the state 
it was just another day in chinatown where inside a catholic 
school children began with the pledge of allegiance a prayer and 
a song seny norasingh one of the photographers for the planned 
book a day in the life of california also was there 
norasingh watched the firstgraders as they chanted a phonics 
lesson then began to use his camera crouching near the small 
desks several other photographers took photos of norasingh or of 
their colleagues taking pictures of him 
meanwhile 99 other men and women with cameras were on 
assignment in chico stockton the silicon valley fresno yosemite 
and other places between crescent city and el centro for the book 
the volume set for fall publication is part of a series of 
books containing photographs taken in a certain place in a single 
day 
the concept is extremely easy to grasp and elegantly simple 
that is youre creating a visual time capsule a family album 
said david cohen who with rick smolan began the series seven 
years ago 
the books have focused on australia hawaii canada spain 
america and the soviet union 
cohen formerly managing editor of contact press images in new 
york and smolan a former contact photographer have published 
most of the books themselves but they didnt achieve great 
commercial success until the book on america came out in 1986 
cohen said he believes a market for another book on california 
exists despite a glut of coffeetable books filled with photos of 
the state because most are filled with cliches of beauty spots 
or they go completely in the other direction and you see a freak 
show

the mother of teen rocker tiffany has been 
replaced as trustee of the singers 100000 trust fund in the 
latest development of legal wrangling between the two 
janie c williams of suburban norwalk said in an interview 
published friday by the los angeles times that she was removed as 
her 16yearold daughters trustee wednesday by superior court 
judge kenneth black 
all court documents filed in the dispute have been sealed and 
all hearings have been closed 
black named the bank of california and the accounting firm of 
prager amp fenton as new trustees boosted the percentage of 
tiffanys record earnings that must go into the trust fund from 30 
percent to 50 percent and authorized the new trustees to make 
income tax payments out of the account 
tiffany hired attorney john frankenheimer three weeks ago to act 
on her behalf in freeing her finances from both her mother and 
manager george tobin 
tiffany has three top 10 singles including i think were 
alone now and sold more than 4 million copies of her first 
album meaning her royalties should amount to more than 2 million 
according to tobins contract with mca records the times reported 
ms williams told the times and alleged in court documents that 
tiffany and tobin were working toward a break between the singer 
and her immediate family beginning on march 9 when tiffanys 
mother reported her missing because she failed to return home from 
tobins north hollywood recording studio 
the rock star who does not use her last name told the norwalk 
sheriffs station she was not a runaway and later filed in court 
for status as an emancipated minor meaning she would have adult 
rights in contractual matters 
i felt that george wanted all the control and tiffany went 
along with it because she had her dream of being a star and he 
tobin could give it to her ms williams told the newspaper 
i was never introduced as tiffanys mother i was never 
introduced to anybody of any great importance george didnt want 
anybody to know i was tiffanys mother 
in late march tiffanys aunt julie abbas was appointed 
temporary guardian pending the outcome of the emancipation 
proceedings no hearings have been scheduled on the matter which 
is being handled by a courtappointed mediator 
tobins production contract with tiffany gives him 50 percent of 
her royalties and a management agreement grants him 20 percent of 
her concert earnings 
along with those earnings tiffany has a 350000 merchandising 
deal with winterland productions for tiffany clothing and 
souvenirs said ms williams attorney neal goldstein 
he claimed tobin is attempting to kidnap her through the 
court its a judicial kidnapping 
that statement is not worthy of a response frankenheimer 
said we believe the proper forum for deciding this matter is the 
court and not the press 
ms williams told the newspaper she believes tobin now could 
gain control of the trust even though black handed its control 
over to neutral third parties 
goldstein said ms williams would seek a reconsideration of the 
decision or appeal it

taiwan and us trade officials wrapped up 
four days of negotiations friday without reaching any agreement as 
taiwan toughened its stand against further liberalization of its 
trade practices 
we had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action 
plan us trade assistant peter allgeier who heads the us 
delegation said at the end of the talks unfortunately we have 
fallen short of that ambitious goal 
the taiwan delegation bluntly refused to reduce tariffs on about 
60 agricultural products or lift import bans on peanuts poultry 
and animal organs 
another us request to renew a fiveyear bilateral agreement 
next year that limits taiwans rice exports was also turned down 
taiwan called for the scrapping of a 1986 agreement that allows 
taiwanese magazines to advertize american cigarettes claiming it 
promotes smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco 
growers us officials rejected the request 
we would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural 
products because we did not protect our farmers more than your 
country did vice economic minister wang chienshien who heads 
the taiwan delegation said at the closing ceremony 
taiwan officials however promised to review a us proposal 
for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help reduce 
taiwans massive trade surplus with the united states which 
totaled 16 billion last year 
hundreds of farmers staged a protest in taipei on tuesday 
calling on the government not to concede to any us demands the 
farmers claimed taiwans earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other 
agricultural products have already hurt their livelihood 
taiwan reduced tariffs on 3500 foreign products in february 
including 480 agricultural products with import duties dropping to 
an average rate of 226 percent from 35 percent 
in the latest talks taiwanese negotiators agreed to take 
measures to curb the rampant infringement of us copyrights but 
differed with their us counterparts on major details 
taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of us 
works require the permission of their authors but opposed making 
the agreement retroactive 
allgeier said us companies lose tens of millions of us 
dollars every year because of pirated us works in taiwan 
taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original us 
copyrighted works published after 1975 but pirated books are still 
available at many book stores that agreement does not extend to 
translations 
taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent or 
copyright protection to us semiconductor products

soviet presence has wrought little 
change in this city of dusty streets and mud huts but hatred of 
the kremlin forged an alliance among tribal enemies that lasted 10 
years 
whether the moslem guerrillas will revel in their rout of the 
soviets after the red army leaves or press on with the fight to 
oust president najib and his communist government is an open 
question 
the patchwork of tribes and nationalities that joined forces 
more or less after the communist coup in april 1978 have a much 
longer history of strife and infighting 
few of the merchants farmers students and government workers 
biding their time in the relatively safe capital display much 
emotion when asked what they expect to happen when the 115000 
soviet soldiers are gone 
few hold out much hope for najib a former head of the secret 
police chosen by the kremlin two years ago to president babrak 
karmal the soviet military forces are to begin leaving by may 15 
and be out in nine months 
equally few expect a unified opposition to emerge 
for ordinary afghans replacing the peril and loss of the civil 
war with the familiar troubles of the past would be welcome 
afghanistan has always had problems a young taxi driver 
observed in broken english what will happen after the russians 
leave we will see 
dislike of the soviets and nostalgia for the monarchy ousted by 
the military 15 years ago are strong among afghan civilians 
they seem eager to return to their former lives when battles 
were as numerous but dealt with land and water instead of ideology 
mohammad mir an englishspeaking antique dealer who parks his 
blue mercedes outside a cluttered shop on chicken street says 
business is good despite the war but he would be happy to leave it 
all behind for his native city of ghazni 
my house there was destroyed twice so we came to kabul in 
the 1970s he said the attackers were a neighboring tribe that 
coveted his fertile land not political opponent 
mir said he would like to see the king return and the soviets 
leave 
i dont do business with the russian dogs he told an 
american visitor i send them to the indian next door 
just then three soviet soldiers with automatic rifles passed 
the shop looking uncomfortable as they patrolled the shopping 
street 
at the brezhnev market a warren of lowroofed hovels in central 
kabul named for the late soviet leader there is a brisk trade in 
soviet machinery and spare parts one merchant said he would leave 
soon for his home in western afghanistan because soviet troops 
there were packing up to leave 
how will he make a living after a decade of dealing in soviet 
hardware he shrugged and said we made our business in other 
ways before the soviets came and we will make it in other ways when 
they leave 
about 2 million people live in kabul it crouches in duncolored 
poverty in a broad basin ringed by high mountains which the 
guerrillas control 
women wearing fulllength pleated silk veils sort onions 
carrots and geens for sale in their market stalls as others did 
for generations before the soviets came 
crowds of shoppers and traders throng the narrow walkways 
between open troughs carrying waste water the smell of raw sewage 
from the kabul river mingles with exotic scents from the spice 
shops 
rocket fire occasionally reaches the city from the mountains 
car bombs have become more frequent like the one that killed six 
passersby and wounded 49 other people on wednesday the 10th 
anniversary of the communist coup 
mohammad masum said he believes fewer than 20 percent of afghans 
are concerned with politics and even he a member of najibs party 
is ready to cope with whatever political situation develops 
he and other afghans are just tired of war 
i think if there was a true coalition government including 
the king we would all be happy masud said 
najib has offered the guerrillas a coalition but they have 
refused 
at a news conference thursday he suggested a role in the 
government for former king sahir shah who lives in italy but did 
not say what it would be 
i just want to go to my home as soon as they will let me 
said masum an interpreter with the party committee for peace 
solidarity and friendship he and his wife fled their village 
outside kabul in the early days of the war 
im not afraid of either side he said now i interpret 
for the government maybe later i will interpret for someone else

disgruntled truckers are queuing up into 
50rig convoys and creeping along indiana interstates to protest a 
new state law that has boosted the gasoline tax and lowered the 
speed limit for large vehicles 
the convoys are a new wrinkle in a monthold protest by truckers 
boycotting indiana truckstops gas stations and restaurants to call 
attention to regulations that hurt their business 
state police have tracked 12 convoys since tuesday night when 
the first was reported lt ken hollingsworth said friday 
the linedup trucks were moving about 4055 mph staying in one 
lane for the most part and not interfering with regular vehicular 
traffic said hollingsworth 
the convoys averaged about 50 semi tractortrailers and most 
were reported on interstate 70 which passes from ohio to illinois 
through indianapolis 
the truckers are unhappy with a state law that went into effect 
april 1 lowering the speed limit for heavy trucks from 65 mph to 55 
mph on rural sections of interstates for light trucks and cars 
the speed limit remains 65 mph 
indiana also boosted its gasoline tax by 1 cent per gallon 
earlier this month 
ron vernon a trucker from cedar rapids iowa said the lowered 
speed limit would take money out of his pocket 
if i slow down i lose 2 or 3 per hour said vernon who 
had stopped friday to eat at the indy 500 truck plaza in 
whitestown just south of indianapolis were the only occupation 
in the country that gets penalized for working overtime 
truckers werent the only ones complaining 
dave martin owner of the stop 1 truck plaza in cambridge city 
said the boycott had cut his food and fuel sales by 30 percent 
martin said although he thought the truckers have a legitimate 
complaint he does not approve of their methods 
i agree the state is doing the wrong thing but why dont they 
go to the legislature and circle the wagons martin asked 
the boycott was the brainchild of cincinnati disc jockey dale 
sommers whose interstate 700 show is broadcast nightly on 
wlwam 
sommers who goes by the name truckin bozo on the air is 
one of the founders of the fourmonthold north american 
professional truckers association which represents about 2000 
truckers he said he drove an 18wheeler for one week in 1968 
their votes are in another state and dont count in indiana 
sommers said of his trucker listeners and why he urged the boycott 
of truckstops gas stations and restaurants in the state you 
have to make the voters in indiana pay attention 
indianapolis independent contractor james walden said the 
indiana protest may be the start of a nationwide movement 
this things going to grow its starting here but its going 
coast to coast said walden

the 40nation geneva conference on disarmament 
wound up its spring session friday with no breakthrough in sight on 
a global ban on chemical weapons even though many delegates agree 
the ban is more urgent than ever 
negotiations on a convention prohibiting the development 
production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and providing for 
their destruction dominated the threemonth meeting 
however early pronouncements that a text could be finalized 
this year clashed with the reality of the complexities involved 
delegates said 
hungarys david meiszter president of the conference for april 
told a press conference that he was optimistic that agreement will 
come in the near future 
but other conference sources while acknowledging further 
progress simply said many unresolved problems make any predictions 
impossible 
at the same time addresses to the conference have stressed that 
the continued use of chemical weapons in the war between iraq and 
iran have added urgency to the 20yearold negotiations 
the latest addition to the potential stumbling blocks is 
frances insistence on provisions allowing security stocks of 
chemical weapons for eight years after the convention enters into 
force 
france argues that such a possibility is needed in view of the 
very large disproportion between existing chemical stocks this 
is an evident reference to the soviet arsenal 
the soviets say they have 50000 tons of chemical weapons but 
western intelligence sources say that is a gross understatement 
obsolete us chemical weapons stockpiled in west germany are to 
be removed in 1992 under an informal understanding between 
washington and bonn this would leave the soviets with the only 
chemical weapons left on european territory 
diplomatic sources who insisted on anonymity said no other 
delegation supports the french proposal because in effect it would 
give countries that do not have chemical weapons the goahead to 
start production of the arms the moment the convention is ratified 
it is the top issue now said one western source i cant 
see any treaty if france sticks to its position 
the chief us representative ambassador max friedersdorf was 
quoted in an interview as saying that the negotiations are getting 
to the point where we are going to have one a ban or not going 
to have one 
friedersdorf said the problems with the treaty range from 
details of anticheating provisions to monitoring the civilian 
industry to make surce that chemicals are not diverted to hostile 
uses 
the interview was printed in the us missions daily bulletin 
it did not include any mention of the french proposal 
up to now the soviet union and the united states are the only 
member countries that have admitted possession of chemical weapons 
the united states has not officially disclosed its reserves but 
they are generally reported to total less than 30000 tons 
western sources estimate at least 15 other countries may have 
chemical weapons

a medical team plans a 
marathon highrisk operation to separate 16monthold siamese 
twins joined at the head doctors said friday 
doctors at baragwanath hospital the main hospital in the black 
township outside johannesburg performed two preliminary operations 
in october in preparation for tuesdays surgery the procedure is 
expected to take at least nine hours 
the twin girls mpho and mphonyana were born dec 7 1986 to 
sophie mathibela an unmarried 33yearold black domestic worker 
who earns about 60 a month 
the girls share a major blood vessel in their heads doctors 
partially clamped the vein in the earlier operations in hopes that 
lesser blood vessels would take over its functions 
dr robert lipschitz head of the medical team said the chances 
for success were not high but that doctors would not sacrifice one 
of the girls to save the other 
this is going to be a long lengthy intricate operation which 
carries many dangers with it lipschitz told a news conference 
friday the prognosis is still very grave 
though the chances are still not in both the childrens favor 
at this moment they appear to stand the best chance that we can 
give them under the present state of the art he said 
the girls have a combined weight of 33 pounds mpho appears to 
be developing normally and recently began to speak while mphonyana 
is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced the 
hospital said 
the baragwanath doctors have received advice from johns hopkins 
hospital in baltimore where in september doctors separated west 
german twins joined at the head both boys survived and were sent 
home in march but they reportedly are suffering physical and 
mental problems 
ms mathibela was asked to make a 5 contribution to the costs 
of the operation which otherwise are being covered by the hospital 
and the university of the witwatersrand medical school

the seconds are ticking down for the castle that 
once kept the world running like a clock a victim of changing 
times 
herstmonceux castle the home of the royal greenwich 
observatory went on sale thursday for an estimated 112 million 
to 187 million 
the observatory where greenwich mean time was once calculated 
as the reference point for the worlds time zones is expected to 
move into cambridge university in 1990 
time apparently has passed the operation by 
the reason for the move from herstmonceux castle is that most 
of the observatorys observational work is now done overseas 
atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than 
anywhere in the british isles said bill yates a london real 
estate agent 
as a result a new home base more suited to the requirements 
of modern astronomy is to be built at cambridge 
astronomers were up in arms two years ago when the government 
said it would sell the castle in southern england 21 miles 
northeast of brighton in the county of east sussex and move the 
observatory 
greenwich royal observatory clocks first at greenwich and then 
at herstmonceux once calculated greenwich mean time for the world 
but in the past decade britain has only been a minor contributor 
to a parisbased international time service that uses 250 clocks 
around the world 
the observatory said in 1985 that for financial reasons it would 
let its six atomic clocks stop after 101 years of calculating 
greenwich mean time the clocks contain the atomic element cesium 
which must be replaced every few years at a cost of nearly 200000 
the observatorys main functions now are confined to supporting 
its new telescopes in the canary islands and in hawaii where clean 
air permits observation but britains astronomers still opposed 
the move to cambridge 
they said it would scatter the observatorys archives and rare 
books and end three centuries of independent excellence 
the observatory was founded in 1675 by king charles ii it moved 
to its present location a 20th century copy of the original 
herstmonceux castle in 1946 because pollution interfered with 
stargazing at its greenwich location in southeast london 
the buildings at greenwich along with the brass strip marking 
longitude zero the prime meridian from which the world measures 
its time zones remain open as a museum 
yates predicted the sale of the castle which stands on 368 lush 
acres will generate inquiries from around the world

president reagan signed legislation friday 
designed to make it easier for parents to recover children who have 
been wrongfully abducted across international borders in domestic 
custody disputes 
the measure implements the 1980 hague convention on the civil 
aspects of international child abduction to which the united 
states is a party the convention creates a treaty obligation for 
the prompt return of such children 
the convention was written to cover instances such as one in 
which an american marries a german while stationed in west germany 
with the armed forces they have a child and settle in the united 
states and the german partner then returns to germany with the 
child 
supporters of the measure said current law provides no way to 
assure speedy determination of custody rights in such a situation 
the administration supported the bill although the justice 
department objected to one provision giving federal and state 
courts concurrent jurisdiction to hear cases brought under the 
convention the department contended that federal courts never have 
been and should not be involved in custody matters

two marine helicopter pilots missing since 
usiranian fighting in the persian gulf on april 18 were declared 
killed in action friday after the corps disclosed that a 
hostile radar had targeted their copter before it disappeared 
a marine factfinding board after reviewing all the evidence 
in this case determined that there was sufficient evidence to 
conclude that these marines had been killed as a result of hostile 
action sustained in combat or relating thereto the corps said 
in a statement 
the corps refused to say the ah1t cobra gunship flown by capt 
stephen c leslie and capt kenneth w hill had definitely been 
shot down by iranian forces as iran has claimed 
but the statement conceded in making its recommendation the 
factfinding body provided the following explanation while being 
vectored directed to identify an unknown surface contact capts 
hill and leslie reported a fire control radar lockon the uss 
wainwright lost communication and radar contact with capts hill 
and leslie 
the term surface contact is normally used to refer to a 
radar signal indicating the presence of a boat a fire control 
radar is used to track targets for a gun or missile 
the wainwright a cruiser from which the two marines were 
flying was attacked at one point during last weeks fighting by an 
iranian patrol boat suggesting other iranian boats could have been 
in the area 
leslie 30 of new bern nc and hill 33 of thomasville 
nc were assigned to marine light attack helicopter squadron 167 
at the new river nc marine corps air station 
during the day of fighting between us navy ships and iranian 
vessels the two were sent up on what the pentagon has described as 
a routine patrol after the wainwright helped destroy an iranian 
offshore platform 
during the fighting the navy sank or crippled six iranian 
vessels without any of its ships being hit with the exception of 
the two missing marines no americans were injured or killed in 
those battles fortyfour iranians were reported killed 
on april 20 when the two marines were formally declared 
missing the pentagon disclosed it was investigating a radio 
challenge to the cobra heard before it disappeared 
fridays statement disclosing leslie and hill had themselves 
reported a hostile radar contact provided the first indication the 
helicopter had become a target 
pentagon officials until friday had played down irans claims to 
have destroyed the cobra noting the iranians did not begin making 
the claim until after the defense department itself announced the 
helicopter was overdue 
but in its new statement the marine corps said its factfinding 
board had concluded there was sufficient evidence to conclude

prime minister brian mulroney told parliament on 
friday he made some headway in washington toward curtailing us 
acid rain emissions reaching canada but opposition parties taunted 
him for the lack of results 
the tables have turned and we have a greater opportunity to 
arrive at a valid treaty with the united states mulroney said 
after returning from talks with president reagan and congressional 
leaders 
both the opposition liberal party and new democratic party 
slammed the conservative prime minister who has emerged from four 
annual summits with reagan claiming progress on acid rain only to 
be disappointed by a lack of us action 
in a heated exchange in the house of commons new democratic 
party leader ed broadbent ridiculed mulroneys latest claim and 
described reagan as the only head of government in the modern 
world who believes that trees cause pollution 
reagan once said birds and trees contribute to air pollution and 
has refused to order costly acid rain controls 
the prime minister in four years of talks four years of 
buttering up to reagan telling him everything he wanted to hear 
hasnt got one bit of progress on acid rain broadbent said 
but mulroney and foreign minister joe clark noted that reagan 
asked secretary of state george shultz to begin priority talks with 
clark on an eightpoint proposal mulroney delivered with respect to 
an acid rain treaty 
clark termed the washington talks a significant new chapter 
opened 
he noted that during the summit us negotiators at united 
nationssponsored talks in geneva dropped their demand for the 
right to emit 20 percent more nitrogen oxides 
at a news conference in washington late thursday mulroney said 
he would remain persistent on the issue but not become belligerent 
what do you do do you declare war interrupt relationships 
he asked rhetorically 
mulroney added that leading members of congress also reacted 
favorably to his call for a 50 percent reduction in the us 
smokestack emissions causing at least of canadas acid rain 
a treaty is inevitable between the two countries he said 
the major causes of acid rain are nitrogen oxides from motor 
vehicle exhausts and sulfur dioxides from power plants

a fund drive has raised most of the 56 million 
needed to buy a 17th century masterpiece by georges de la tour and 
the government said friday it will provide the rest so the painting 
will remain in france 
the austere portrait st thomas is the last work of de la 
tour 15931652 still in private hands 
with the campaign closing saturday about 42 million of the 
necessary 32 million has been raised from bequests corporations 
and visitors to the louvre museum

international charity group founded in the 11th century 
it has been on show at the jeu de paume a louvre annex since 
the campaign began march 22 and has attracted thousands of 
visitors many of whom put dropped modest donations into the tall 
black urn at the entrance said louvre spokeswoman sylvie poujade 
when the fund drive began finance minister eduoard balladur 
said the government would pay a substantial share to keep the 
painting in france ministry officials confirmed friday that state 
funds would put the campaign over the top 
the knights of malta acquired the painting in 1985 in the will 
of anne de ruille an unmarried countess who lived alone in her 
castle in central france the masterpiece which she was said to 
keep under her bed was a family heirloom ms poujade said 
rules of the order a nonprofit group specializing in hospital 
work require it to sell such valuable possessions and use the 
money for its charities 
officials of the organization said several foreigners offered to 
buy the painting but it preferred to give france an opportunity to 
add it to de la tour paintings already in the louvre including the 
famous tricheur cheater 
proceeds from the sale will help build a hospital in france for 
the mentally and physically handicapped the order said

prices farmers got for raw products in april 
were unchanged on average for the second month in a row but were 
still 4 percent above a year ago the agriculture department said 
friday 
prices were higher for soybeans cattle hay and oranges and 
lower for lettuce eggs milk and strawberries the departments 
agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary report 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses were up 18 percent from january and averaged 37 percent 
more than in april 1987 
higher prices for feeder pigs fertilizer agricultural 
chemicals tractors and other machinery contributed most to the 
increase from january the report said 
department economists say net cash income of farmers set a 
record in 1987 of about 57 billion this years net the 
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses may be in the 
range of 50 billion to 55 billion 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent 
this year compared with a 41 percent average increase in 1987 
according to the preliminary april figures based mostly on 
midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock products 
was unchanged from march but was up 07 percent from a year ago 
higher prices for cattle calves and broilers were offset by 
lower prices for eggs milk and hogs the report said 
crop prices overall were up 09 percent from march and averaged 
99 percent more than a year ago 
the price index for oilbearing crops which consist mainly of 
soybeans was up 33 percent from march and averaged 22 percent 
more than in april 1987 soybeans prices at 636 per bushel were 
up 30 cents during the month 
prices paid to commercial vegetable growers overall dropped 
44 percent from march and also were down 44 percent from a year 
ago 
the prices of most individual vegetables rose from march to 
april but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop 
for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices 
april farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base 
used for comparison according to the preliminary figures the same 
as in march and february a year ago the april index was 125 
percent 
the quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in april 
down two percentage points from the revised january reading of 53 
percent the revised parity ratio for april 1987 also was 51 
percent 
although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded 
because it doesnt take into full account changes in farm 
productivity others contend the ratio is useful in comparing 
yeartoyear changes 
under the parity formula prices farmers get for commodities are 
compared with prices they pay to meet expenses it then uses a 
191014 measurement to express what happened at 100 percent the 
indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying 
power as they had in 191014 
for example the average price of wheat in april was 281 per 
bushel according to the preliminary figures that was 40 percent 
of the parity price of 707 per bushel 
the report also said 
cattle averaged 6890 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally up from 6830 in march and above the 6260 reported 
for april 1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as 
beef 
hogs averaged 4180 per 100 pounds compared with 4220 in 
march and 5080 a year earlier 
corn at 185 a bushel was down from 186 in march but was 
up from the average of 152 a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 281 per bushel compared with 274 in march and 263 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 841 per 100 pounds compared with 879 in 
march and 363 a year earlier 
soybeans were 636 per bushel compared with 606 in march 
and 490 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 573 cents per pound compared 
with 577 in march and 504 cents in april 1987 
eggs were 455 cents per dozen compared with 508 cents in 
march and 548 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1170 per 100 pounds compared with 1190 in march 
and 1220 a year earlier 
broilers were 28 cents per pound live weight compared with 
275 cents in march and 292 cents a year ago

spattered by blood and buffeted by debris 
after their planes roof blew off high over the pacific the 
frightened passengers aboard aloha airlines flight 243 helped one 
another into life jackets and waited calmly 
a stewardess was blown out of the boeing 737 and 60 of the 89 
passengers and remaining crew of four were injured before the plane 
made a safe emergency landing here thursday 
i heard a loud explosion and i saw my bag from under the seat 
in front of me fly right out of the aircraft said david kupihea 
who was in the firstclass section at the front of the plane 
a piece of conduit ripped loose from the plane and punctured 
kupiheas arm 
i kept my head down i pulled out my life vest i used it as a 
cushion you can see the wind blowing in your face he said 
kupihea said he noticed that the passenger next to him john 
lopez was bleeding so he covered him with a seat cover 
when i looked out of the aircraft and saw the island of maui 
i told him hang on john hang on were going to maui 
lopez 40 of hilo needed seven stitches to close a cut on his 
head 
the passengers were frightened but calm some of them reported 
after the severely disabled plane made a safe emergency landing 
here about 15 minutes after the plane was ripped apart during a 
flight from hilo on hawaii island to honolulu 
dan dennin a salesman from honolulu was reading in a window 
seat near the back of the plane when the jet was rocked by the 
blast at first he thought his window had blown out but he looked 
up and saw a gaping hole just behind the cockpit 
a third of the roof was gone i looked up and saw blue 
sky he said 
the intercom system no longer worked but oxygen masks dropped 
in front of passengers where the roof was still intact 
but the wind just blew them away we couldnt use them said 
passenger mae kagihara 
the passengers helped each other don lifejackets and tuck their 
heads down between their legs according to several passengers as 
the plane landed passengers applauded and cheered they said 
the uninjured then helped those who were hurt 
there was debris all over the place said kagihara when 
that thing ripped open there was all that debris flying around 
the guy sitting next to the aisle got hit and there was blood 
all over she said it was all over the place we are lucky to 
be alive kagihara said 
alice godwin of boulder city nev said she had put on a life 
jacket and placed her head between her knees 
i sang all the hymns i knew she said that kept me busy 
rick west a banker from hilo said the passengers remained very 
calm 
it was just a matter of waiting to see what would happen he 
said it was a long wait 
everyone was calm everyone was trying to help each other 
said stanford samson a honolulu pbx supervisor 
kagihara and samson said they didnt think the plane would be 
able to land 
i thought we were going to hit water i thought this is 
it samson said 
at first i thought we were going to crash in the ocean 
kagihara said then when we got close to land i thought at least 
i could swim 
the passengers appeared calm after they landed on maui said 
kevin hildebrant a tour driver who helped take the injured to maui 
memorial hospital 
they were overly calm i guess to compensate for what they 
went through he said

senate democratic leader robert c byrd said 
friday he will call up the mediumrange missile treaty for debate 
on ratification may 11 but only if the white house and kremlin 
quickly resolve disputes over onsite inspection and other issues 
the state department said the treatys anticheating provisions 
are effective but branded as unacceptable a new soviet 
interpretation of how they should work in practice 
the department renewed its call for quick senate action to 
ratify the treaty before president reagan meets with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev at the moscow summit next month 
however charles e redman the department spokesman said the 
soviets had taken a restrictive view of the right of the united 
states to inspect containers for missile components as well as to 
inspect soviet mediumrange missile facilities 
the state department has raised the issue with the soviets at a 
senior diplomatic level and is awaiting a reply redman said 
byrd said the soviet statement indicates to him that moscow is 
backing away from the mutual understanding the two sides had of 
how onsite inspection would work 
he and sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed 
services committee said the treaty cannot be ratified before the 
issue is resolved 
i believe the soviet union should understand it is not a good 
thing to start off by challenging a couple of the key points of 
onsite inspection nunn said 
it is enormously important that we go into this treaty with 
good faith on both sides he said we dont need any clouds of 
bad faith hanging over it 
byrd emphasized that his decision to call up the treaty is 
tentative and debate will not begin on may 11 less than three 
weeks before the moscow summit unless all areas of concern are 
resolved 
byrd called on both washington and moscow to quickly deal with 
onsite inspection problems as well as other issues 
these include an ambiguity in the treaty regarding a precise 
definition as to what constitutes a weapons delivery system and 
whether or not such star wars weapons as those using laser beams or 
particlebeam generators are covered by the pact 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said another area of concern involves the white house 
rather than the soviets 
the problem boren said is whether the administration is 
backing away from a commitment to an expanded longrange investment 
in spy satellites and other technical means used to verify soviet 
compliance with the terms of arms control treaties 
the intelligence panel has said that soviet compliance with any 
treaty making deep cuts in longrange strategic weapons will be 
difficult unless such an investment is made 
hopefully we will be able to say all of these problems have 
been resolved and we will be able to go ahead full speed from there 
and these loose ends will be tied down boren said 
byrd said he had no idea how long the ratification debate will 
take once it begins 
we have to be absolutely certain this is a good treaty he 
said if we get our fingers burned on this it isnt going to 
augur well for future arms control 
the treaty would require the destruction of us and soviet 
mediumrange missiles with a range of between 300 and 3400 miles

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis absorbed twin attacks on 
foreign policy friday as vice president george bush accused him of 
waffling all over the field when the administration attacked 
iranian gunboats and jesse jackson called his views on southern 
africa misguided 
bush the certain republican nominee also previewed a second 
likely campaign issue for the fall saying he favors the death 
penalty for convicted drug kingpins dukakis the likely democratic 
nominee opposes the death penalty in all cases 
the massachusetts governor focused on trade issues as he 
campaigned in ohio in advance of next weeks presidential primary 
renewing his call for president reagan not to veto legislation that 
would in part require companies to give advance notice before 
shutting down factories 
these people are our neighbors he said of factory workers 
who would be affected they deserve better from their employers 
they deserve better from america he said 
as dukakis campaigned in ohio his aides said they were 
beginning to court delegates won by exiled campaign rivals with a 
soft sell campaign dukakis aides have expressed confidence in 
recent days that the governor will have the 2081 delegates needed 
to assure his nomination by the end of the primary season on june 7 
he now has more than 1250 delegates in the associated press 
total and enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over jackson 
bushs remarks uttered in a trip through indiana provided a 
preview of what a fall campaign against dukakis might sound like 
jacksons remarks to an audience in cleveland showed he was far 
from ready to give up his efforts to compete through the end of the 
democratic primaries 
the vice president who already has clinched enough delegates to 
assure his nomination criticized dukakis on economic law and 
order and foreign policy grounds 
the vice president said dukakis wavered initially when asked to 
respond to the administrations military retailiation against iran 
earlier this month 
the presidents different than anything else you cant wait 
around hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show 
said bush 
bush who is expected to make dukakis relative lack of 
experience in foreign affairs an issue in the fall campaign 
concluded 
you cant do that when youre president you cant wait around 
to see which way the wind blows 
dukakis initially said he didnt have enough information to 
judge the administrations actions and said he shouldnt comment 
while he was concentrating on his new york primary campaign 
bush also dismissed comments from dukakis and jackson on the 
importance of fighting drugs as mere campaign rhetoric 
i havent heard them talk about how tough they want to be in 
changing the laws so we at least put some muscle into the law 
i strongly favor the death penalty for the narcotraffickers he 
said 
on the plantclosing issue that dukakis has been campaigning on 
in recent days bush said his likely democratic rival is more 
concerned about pink slips and plant closings than in creating 
new jobs 
i dont feel that its midnight in america he said i 
want to talk about the fact that there are more americans at 
work than any time in the history of the country 
jackson who has been increasingly critical of dukakis in recent 
days following a string of primary defeats assailed his rival for 
not wanting to classify south africa as a terrorist state for 
allegedly supporting rebels battling mozambique 
it exposes a lack of understanding of foreign policy he 
said either he has a lack of understanding about the options 
in the region or he supports a policy thats inconsistent with the 
progressive and democratic thrust in the world 
dukakis has rejected jacksons call to provide arms to 
mozambiques marxist government to fight the rebels campaign aide 
leslie dach said dukakis favors diplomatic steps and economic 
sanctions against south africa that the reagan administration has 
not taken but doesnt rule out possibly down the road arming 
frontline states in their struggle with south africa

the nations top immigration official 
expressed satisfaction friday that congress refused to extend the 
12month amnesty program for illegal aliens which ends at midnight 
wednesday 
alan nelson commissioner of the immigration and naturalization 
service also said that a program of sanctions against employers 
who hire illegal aliens is being imposed gradually and that 
companies should not anticipate a crackdown by the ins 
in opposing an extension of the amnesty program nelson told 
reporters in an interview that the purpose of the 
yearandahalfold law of which the amnesty program is a part is 
to stop illegal immigration 
we wouldnt want to send a message below the border that its 
still ok to come here illegally and then if you do there still 
might be amnesty said nelson congress made it clear one 
time only and stuck to their guns 
nelson said legalization offices will be open saturday and 
sunday offices also will be open until midnight wednesday and 
amnesty candidates standing in line at that time will be processed 
the senate on thursday night blocked a sevenmonth extension of 
the amnesty program for undocumented immigrants 
although amnesty requests have soared in recent weeks as the 
deadline approaches applications are running significantly behind 
initial projections amnesty requests total 129 million with 
another 440000 people applying under a program for agricultural 
workers the ins had estimated as many as 2 million would apply 
nelson said nobody knows how many illegal aliens might 
qualify for the amnesty program and he downplayed the 2 million 
figure he said applications are falling somewhat below initial 
estimates partly because nonprofit groups and other nongovernment 
community groups overestimated the number of applications they 
would help the ins handle 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 aliens who 
came to this country illegally before jan 1 1982 and who have 
lived here continually since then may apply for amnesty 
the program also contains a system of fines for employers who 
knowingly hire undocumented workers 
starting june 1 the ins has the discretion to issue warning 
citations or to levy fines against employers who violate the law 
currently the ins must initially issue warning citations 
nelson stressed the agency would remain flexible saying there 
wont be a crackdown with fines starting june 1 
the purpose of sanctions isnt to penalize employers said 
nelson the purpose is to keep employers from hiring illegal 
aliens and if you can do it with a positive twist youre a lot 
better off 
be sure theyre educated be sure they understand why its 
good business for them to not hire cheap illegal labor said 
nelson 
we can always tighten the screws to the employers and were 
doing that but he said the sanctions portion of the program 
would proceed through a gradual deliberate building process 
the agency is to hire 900 additional investigators through the 
beginning of next year and one of their prime duties will be to 
participate in the employer sanctions program 
to date the ins has issued 2000 citations to employers and 
levied 80 to 90 fines

a house committee friday refused to require 
states seeking the super collider atom smasher to put up at least 
500 million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued 
research installation 
on a 2011 vote the space science and technology committee 
rejected the minimumfunds amendment offered by rep ron packard 
rcalif for the 44 billion superconducting super collider 
just before that members voted 1614 against an alternative 
that would have required the secretary of energy to report to the 
committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning 
state should pay 
the amendments were offered to the 31 billion energy 
department research authorization bill 
as it stands the bill would authorize 16 billion over the 
next three years for the collider of which 148 million would be 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but with no construction 
funds until oct 1 1989 
the bill would set a limit of 25 percent on any foreign 
contributions and require that no more than 33 percent of the 
equipment be of foreign manufacture the administration has said it 
believes it can get foreign countries to contribute at least 25 
percent of the cost but so far there have been no foreign 
commitments and only italy has agreed to explore collaboration 
several amendments to the bill remain to be considered 
including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider 
authorization or eliminate it altogether and to make a 25 percent 
foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant 
atom smasher 
the department sought 363 million for the new fiscal year a 
large part of it to begin construction after site selection that 
selection is to be made in november and confirmed in january 
since the department actually needs no authorization and could 
proceed under its general authority to conduct scientific research 
the bill would be important for the collider only as a statement of 
congressional intent and limit on later appropriations which the 
department does have to have 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the house appropriations 
energy subcommittee has told the illinois delegation his panel 
will approve no more than 60 million 
illinois michigan north carolina tennessee colorado arizona 
and texas are finalists to host the super collider which comprises 
a 53 milesaround tunnel and associated experimental facilities for 
smashing beams of protons into each other at energies 20 times the 
maximum possible today 
current law forbids the states from offering cash contributions 
during the selection process the energy department is insisting on 
donation of the land and the states may undertake site 
improvements which may be substantial 
illinois officials figure the states land purchase tunneling 
road and other work is worth 590 million and several states have 
submitted sealed bids that are to be opened only if that state is 
chosen 
before the vote on packards amendment rep manuel lujan jr 
rnm said tennessee officials had claimed they would have to 
drop out of the competition if a minimumfunds requirement were 
imposed 
others were skeptical that a 500 million requirement would 
deter anyone whoever wins is winning a 50 billion economic 
development program said the chairman rep robert a roe dnj

the house overwhelmingly turned down attempts 
friday to order us troops brought home from western europe and 
japan unless americas allies spend more for defense 
the decisions came as the chamber worked its way through a bill 
authorizing the pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
first the chamber rejected 240120 a proposal by rep john 
bryant dtexas to bring 30000 troops a year back from europe 
and 7000 troops annually from japan starting in 1991 
then a 33221 vote shot down an amendment by rep tommy 
robinson dark to withdraw 70000 troops a year from europe 
moments later the house voted 3590 approval of a proposal 
saying the reagan administration should begin talks with us 
allies about defense burdensharing a similar call was approved by 
congress last year but the proposal is not binding and only 
suggests that the negotiations should start 
both bryant and robinson tied their reduction requirements to 
demands that japan and the other 15 north atlantic treaty 
organization nations should spend a bigger portion of their budgets 
for alliance defense 
the house votes came as the pentagon released its annual 
assessment mandated by congress on allied contributions to the 
common defense 
the report was accompanied by a personal pledge from defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to press at every opportunity for 
progress in improving allied defense capabilities and in sharing 
equitably the roles risks and burdens of the alliance 
carlucci said us allies make a substantial contribution to 
the common defense considerably more than they are often given 
credit for but he said the united states in some areas is 
doing more than most of its partners 
what is very clear is that there are substantial variations in 
performance among individual allies carlucci said 
the report says that in 1986 the latest year for which complete 
figures are available the united states allocated 68 percent of 
its gross national product to defense 
greece which ranked second among the allies allocated 61 
percent england was third with 51 percent followed by turkey at 
48 percent and france at 39 percent the remaining nations had 
shares of 32 percent or less 
legislators in both the house and senate have repeatedly 
criticized nato nations for not doing more but they have rejected 
several attempts in the past three years to order us force 
reductions in europe where 326000 us troops are stationed and 
in japan where there are about 63000 american service personnel 
lets get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect 
them to pay their fair share said bryant we are subsidizing 
their defense 
robinson was even more blunt the real purpose of this 
amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that weve had it these 
people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into 
paying for their defense 
but rep norman dicks dwash called robinsons plan a 
dangerous and irresponsible effort to bring troops home to deal 
with the us trade problem 
rep stephen solarz dny opposed both plans saying this 
would be entirely counterproductive it is simply not possible 
to maintain the viability of a voluntary alliance of free countries 
if one of those countries tries to impose standards on the others 
rep douglas bereuter rneb said this would send the wrong 
message at a time when the united states is trying to urge nato 
countries to spend more for nonnuclear weapons in the wake of the 
ussoviet treaty banning mediumrange nuclear weapons 
but rep david obey dwis said its time uncle sam quit 
being taken for uncle sucker 
the bill authorizes pentagon spending of 2995 billion in the 
fiscal year starting oct 1 which is the same amount proposed by 
the separate bill that will be considered next month by the senate 
differences between the bills that pass each chamber will 
eventually be reconciled by a housesenate conference committee

a man whose first name is john mounted his third 
annual protest friday and called on johns of the world to wrest 
their good names away from toilets customers of prostitutes and 
john doe anonymity 
john brooks armed with a wellthumbed paperback dictionary and 
a battered sign proclaiming april 29 national john day stood 
on a windy downtown corner seeking to draw attention to his claims 
that the proper name of john has been abused 
im defending the name john he yelled drawing amused 
stares from lunchtime crowds 
brooks 45 freely admits theres nothing official about his 
cause and doesnt expect to make a name for himself with the annual 
protests which he said would stop after this year but he says 
years of namecalling prompted him to take action 
a major complaint in the dictionary is john being used as a 
prostitutes client or a toilet he said it makes a swear word 
out of our name doesnt it 
he said the seedy first definition isnt even accurate 
over the last year also the johns arent the ones whove 
been seeing the prostitutes the customers have been jimmies 
brooks said making an oblique reference to recent television 
evangelist scandals 
brooks also is upset about putting john doe on the toes of 
people whove died and they dont know who he is 
as part of his efforts brooks a selfemployed carpenter in 
dallas has created a fictitious lawsuit against society seeking 
125 trillion restitution could be handled by giving all johns 
the day off on april 29 a date he said he picked for no particular 
reason 
at least one john who joined brooks demonstration said he took 
advantage of that idea john malmqvist 20 a carpet technician 
said he talked his boss into giving him a halfday off 
malmqvist said hes also irked at the way john is used in 
hypothetical situations such as why johnny cant read 
if youre in school they always use johnny for this johnny 
for that when theyre giving examples over the speakers talking 
about bad kids they always say well johnny went home and did 
this and that 
passerby bobby mullins 22 said he sympathized with the johns 
plight although he didnt expect to stop using john as a generic 
term 
i probably still will but ill think about that guy over 
there he said

treeplanting in the united states hasnt gone 
to the dogs by any means an agriculture department report showed 
friday 
last year more than 3 million acres were reforested with 23 
billion tree seedlings an area about the size of connecticut 
forest service chief f dale robertson said 
about 87 percent of the 1987 tree plantings was on private 
lands mostly in the south he said 
more than 1 million acres of the seeding involved land enrolled 
in the departments conservation reserve program authorized in the 
1985 farm law he said under the program farmers get federal aid 
to plant trees or grass to protect highly erodible land plus 
annual rental payments for 10 years to keep the land out of crop 
production 
robertson said tree planting has set annual records since 1981 
when more than 237 million acres were reforested 
by comparison he said the civilian conservation corps planted 
about 233 million acres in trees over a 10year period in the 
1930s and early 1940s more than 2 million acres were planted under 
the soil bank program in the late 1950s and early 1960s

a conference next week will bring the united 
states angola cuba and south africa together for the first time 
to discuss troop withdrawals from angola and independence for 
southwest africa the government said friday 
the conference to be held tuesday and wednesday at a secret 
london location follows intense diplomatic activity aimed at 
ending the 13yearold angolan civil war and achieving independence 
for neighboring southwest africa also known as namibia which is 
controlled by by south africa 
announcement of the talks by the foreign office followed a 
meeting friday between anatoly adamishin a soviet deputy foreign 
minister and chester crocker us assistant secretary of state 
for african affairs 
us officials said crocker would lead the us delegation to 
the talks but the delegates of the other nations were not 
identified a statement from south africas foreign ministry said 
none of its representatives would have cabinet rank 
adamishin told a news conference the soviet union although not 
a participant at the meeting supports the political dynamism 
that led to the new attempt at a political settlement in southern 
africa 
the united states seeks a timetable for withdrawal of the 40000 
cuban military personnel in angola angola and the soviet union 
want south africa to withdraw its forces from namibia and comply 
with a 1966 united nations demand to give it independence 
angolas marxist government with cuban help and soviet backing 
is fighting rebels of the national union for the total independence 
of angola or unita which is supported by south africa and the 
united states 
previous efforts at a settlement have stalled in part because 
of us support for south africas demand that the cuban troops 
leave before it gives independence to namibia 
south africa captured the mineralrich territory from germany in 
world war i and controls it under a league of nations mandate 
abrogated by the united nations in 1966 the southwest africa 
peoples organization which has bases in southern angola is 
fighting a guerrilla war for independence for the territory 
the angolan government has refused to talk directly with unita 
and the rebels are not included in the london conference adamishin 
said the soviets and angolans consider unita like an arm of south 
africa 
in its statement announcing the meeting the foreign office 
said discussions between the united states angola south africa 
and cuba on troop withdrawal from angola and independence for 
namibia will take place on may 3 and 4 in britain 
we are pleased to have facilitated and welcome this further 
step in the negotiating process 
in cape town south africa foreign minister r f botha said 
as far as south africa is concerned the talks are going to be 
about cuban withdrawal from angola and it will be useful if 
representatives of the cuban government could be present he did 
not elaborate 
botha said the talks could collapse if angola seeks 
implementation of a un resolution condemning south africa for 
having troops in southern angola in december the un security 
council voted to demand withdrawal of south african troops 
angola claims south africa has 9000 soldiers with heavy 
artillery on its territory but south africa says it has not had 
more than 3000 men there at one time since may 1987

labor minister abubakar umar met with 
leaders of 22 unions friday as labor unrest spread throughout 
nigeria following a rise in the price of gasoline lagos radio 
reported 
it said the union officials asked the government of president 
ibrahim babangida to reconsider the gasoline price increase to 
lower prices for food and other basic commodities to raise 
salaries and to release labor leaders detained since a series of 
strikes began about two weeks ago 
the broadcast said other representatives of nigerias 42 trade 
unions did not show up for the meeting including those 
representing striking civil service and bank workers 
on april 10 the government raised gasoline and diesel fuel 
prices by 3 percent and that was expected to be the first of a 
series of price increases the action followed recommendations by 
the world bank and international monetary fund to increase 
petroleum prices to help cut nigerias 15billion deficit 
since the oilboom days of the mid1970s nigerians have 
regarded cheap gasoline as one of their rights even with the 
increases nigerian gas sells for about 40 cents a gallon 
many lagos banks remained closed for the second day and others 
operated with skeleton crews because of striking workers the news 
agency of nigeria reported banks in kano makurdi calabar and 
ibadan also were affected 
planes were grounded throughout nigeria for most of friday when 
air traffic controllers joined the strike 
aviation minister anthony okpere later reopened the lagos 
international airport and denied any strike took place he blamed 
the closure on saboteurs who he said disrupted the function of 
control tower equipment 
medical and health workers in lagos walked off the job friday 
the news agency said 
six people were killed in april 13 riots that began as a protest 
by university students and led to the governments closing more 
than 20 colleges and universities 
labor unions then joined in the protests

vice president george bush said friday 
that democrat michael dukakis is more concerned about pink slips 
and plant closings than creating new jobs 
he also said dukakis waffled on whether to support president 
reagans retaliatory strike against iran in the persian gulf and 
he accused both dukakis and jesse jackson of being soft on 
penalties for drugpushers 
he defended reagan administration efforts to cut off the supply 
of drugs but told reporters im taking a look now at changing 
the whole structure of how the government is set up to wage the 
drug fight 
bush defended reagans opposition to the trade bill that would 
force factories to give workers advance notice of closings 
referring to reagans threat of a veto he said it will get 
one 
the vice president after touring a magnavox plant that makes 
radios and other gear for the military said notices of plant 
closings should be left to management and labor unions to work out 
not congress 
advance notice does not protect jobs he said all that does 
is guarantee misery im for plant openings 
dukakis had challenged bush to spell out whether he opposes the 
trade bill the product of two years of bipartisan work in congress 
at a breakfast for 325 gop supporters here bush said that while 
the massachusetts governor is talking about pink slips and plant 
closings i want to talk about the fact that there are more 
americans at work than any time in the history of the country 
theres some big drug problems in this country i hear a lot 
of campaign rhetoric i hear both jackson and dukakis assailing the 
administration on this and thus denigrating those men and women in 
the dea drug enforcement administration trying to staunch the 
flow of drugs coming in and catch the criminals he said 
but i havent heard them talk about how tough they want to be 
in changing the laws to put some muscle in he said i 
strongly favor the death penalty for the narcotraffickers those 
kingpins that are pushing the poison on our kids 
the certain republican nominee said frontrunner dukakis was 
waffling all over the field on whether to support reagans 
strike against iranian oil platforms and boats after a mine nearly 
sank a us navy frigate it took the massachusetts governor most 
of a day to formulate a response to the strike earlier this month 
the presidents different than anything else you cant wait 
around hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show 
he said 
bush told the magnavox workers we can compete lets remember 
who we are were the united states of america we rolled back the 
frontiers and battled the deserts and the shows 
bush in interviews with local reporters said he is girding for 
a close race in the fall i think i have to get my message out my 
passions what my heartbeat is he said 
asked whether attorney general edwin meese iii should resign 
because of ongoing investigations into his activities bush said 
let the system work it out let the system make that 
deterrmination 
asked if he would hire meese in his administration bush said 
if he proves innocent i certainly would hire him 
but he said that was a theoretical question were going to 
have change new people in the entire cabinet he said 
in indianapolis bush told reporters we will have some fun 
too if the democrats try to taint him with the socalled sleaze 
factor a reference to alleged wrongdoing by highranking reagan 
administration officials 
bush asked if he was hurt by meeses problems said i think 
democrats are fair i know the democrats i hear them talking about 
it but there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a 
guiltbyassociation mode where we can find in massachusetts 
politics or campaign staff or things of that nature i hope we 
dont have to do it 
he added we will have some fun too trying to look into what 
is going on in illinois or massachusetts depending upon which one 
wins the democratic nomination you know weve got some cannon 
fodder if you want to get into that 
leslie dach a spokesman for dukakis responded i guess his 
support for ed meese is making the vice president nervous the vice 
president knows that the vast majority of americans have serious 
questions about his commitment to ethics in government

a house committee voted friday to permit the 
energy department to withhold payments to some of its contractors 
until they demonstrate they are trying to maintain drugfree 
workplaces 
the measure was attached as an amendment to the 31 billion 
energy department research authorization bill being considered by 
the house space science and technology committee 
approval came on a 207 show of hands 
opponents said the amendment likely would prove to be 
counterproductive and inappropriate rep jimmy hayes dla a 
former prosecutor said if he were a contractor he would defend 
arrested employees in court to avoid interruption of his income 
from the department 
supporters said it was time for congress to get serious about 
the nations drug problem 
have any hearings been held said rep james scheuer dny 
we have had hearings said rep ralph hall dtexas 
hearings are going on right now in the juvenile courts in the 
jails and in the cemeteries 
walkers provision would require all contracts authorized under 
the bill to contain a provision permitting the contracting agency 
most often the energy department to withhold payments upon 
proof of use possession or possession with the intent to 
distribute of any controlled substance in violation of any federal 
state or local law by an employee in the workplace as evidenced 
by the conviction of such employee in a court of competent 
jurisdiction until the contractor demonstrates to the agency 
that it has taken sufficient action to restore a drugfree 
workplace 
convictions arising out of an employers goodfaith efforts to 
enforce a drugfree workplace shall be considered substantial 
evidence that the employer is taking sufficient action walkers 
amendment said 
jeff sherwood spokesman for the energy department said he was 
unable to reach any officials in a position to comment 
the energy department provides funds to universities and others 
that operate laboratories which undertake a wide variety of 
research ranging from the most secret nuclear weapons to 
environmental projects 
prospects for the drug provisions were not immediately clear 
since the science authorization bill for the department has failed 
to get through congress for the past severl years 
the department has permanent general authority to conduct 
scientific research and does so with money provided by 
appropriations committees

the customs service said friday it has seized 
over 500 vehicles ranging from 18wheelers to boats from people 
caught carrying drugs into the country in the last five weeks 
the new confiscation policy is part of the reagan 
administrations zero tolerance antidrug strategy announced 
last month 
people caught bringing drugs into the country are arrested 
their passport seized as evidence and the vehicle used to transport 
the drugs or drug paraphernalia is seized 
in one instance agents seized a 120000 18wheel 
tractortrailer because the driver was carrying a single marijuana 
joint 
if hes the owner of the truck its gone he probably wont 
get it back said michael lane the no 2 customs service 
official in an interview 
in most cases the government will have the vehicles sold at 
auction and the proceeds will go into the treasury 
if the driver caught carring drugs isnt the owner the vehicle 
will be turned over to the owner for a price that includes paying 
the customs services costs involved in confiscating the vehicle 
theres no question that zero tolerance is working customs 
commissioner william von raab said in a statement the message is 
simple we cannot tolerate any drugs in our society and if you get

officials on friday denied reports of 
an agreement with the reagan administration that would have gen 
manuel antonio noriega quit as commander of the military but not 
leave panama 
an estimated 10000 people marched friday in a demonstration of 
support of noriega the head of panamaas 15000member defense 
forces and the dominant force in the civilian government 
that agreement does not exist foreign minister jorge ritter 
told a news conference you can hardly reach an agreement when 
relations with the united states are at the point they are 
ritter confirmed that michael kozak an aide to assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams met with noriega this week 
mr kozak was in panama talking with different groups with 
leaders of the opposition ritter said he also talked with the 
general but did not reach any agreement because they simply were 
not negotiating 
noriega was indicted in florida in february on drug trafficking 
charges the united states subsequently demanded he resign from the 
military and imposed economic sanctions on panama noriega has 
denied the narcoatics allegations 
government officials said privately the proposal on noriega 
quitting was a facesaving move by the united states they said 
noriega has already offered to resign subject to the establishment 
of a national dialogue with opposition forces 
opposition leaders were not immediately available for comment 
panamanian ambassador juan b sosa a leader of the antinoriega 
forces in washington accused the united states of going beyond its 
authority in trying to negotiate panamas political future 
in miami antinoriega exiles called the us proposal a 
surrender with cosmetics 
this cosmetic solution will only take the country down the 
road to disaster said gilberto mallol exiled representative of 
the panamanian opposition umbrella group the civic crusade 
a us official said in washington friday that the reagan 
administration reached a tentative agreement with noriega under 
which he will step down as chief of the defense forces and de facto 
leader of the government but remain in panama 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said kozak met 
with noriega this week but he said the agreement was less than 
ideal because it did not include the generals departure from the 
country 
the march friday was called by the popular unity front which 
includes some labor groups that support the government and some 
parties in the governing coalition 
one of the speakers at the rally alvaro munoz of the national 
council of workers said the problem of noriega must be solved 
through an agreement among panamanians and within the laws of the 
defense forces 
noriega in midmarch offered to resign as commander of the 
defense forces before the may 1989 elections 
panama is suffering a cash shortage because of the us santions 
the reagan administration has refused to make scheduled payments 
to panama for panama canal operations it also has set up accounts 
in the united states under the name of ousted president eric arturo 
delvalle for tax and other payments by americans and american 
companies to this country 
washington continues to recognize delvalle who was deposed by 
pronoriega legislators on feb 26 a day after he tried to fire 
the general but opposition leaders have said they will not 
recognize delvalle if noriega leaves 
noriega has said the us actions are the result of his refusal 
to help the reagan administration overthrow nicaraguas leftist 
government and of efforts by rightists in the the united states to 
prevent the scheduled turnover of the panama canal to panama at the 
end of 1999

the legal requirements for using an 
unprecedented volume of government secrets in court will deprive 
marine lt col oliver l north and three irancontra codefendants 
of a fair trial the defense said friday 
classified information procedures act cipa requirements that 
the defense serve notice of any plans to disclose classified 
information in court will give the prosecution an unfair advantage 
the defense said in a motion filed in us district court 
the requirement imposes burdens on the defense unprecedented 
in american criminal law lawyers for the fired national security 
council aide and his three codefendants said in a joint motion 
in the circumstances of this singular case involving an 
unprecedented volume of classified documents the requirement is 
clearly unconstitutional the defense said 
north former national security adviser john m poindexter 
busisinessmen albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord are accused of conspiring to defraud the governent by 
diverting usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels 
under the law the defense would be barred from using classified 
evidence in the trial unless it notifies the prosecution before the 
trial of all government secrets it plans to disclose 
the requirement forces the defendants to furnish the 
prosecution virtually every detail of the defense case including 
the defendants anticipated testimony at trial the testimony of 
other defense witnesses and the contents of all classified 
documents the lawyers intend to introduce as evidence or use to 
crossexamine prosecution witnesses the defense said 
this sweeping notice requirement violates the defendants 
fundamental constitutional rights including such basic guarantees 
as the privilege against compelled selfincrimination the right to 
effective assistance of counsel the right to crossexamine adverse 
witnesses and the right to due process of law the defense said 
the requirement also deprives the defendants of the right to 
decide during the trial whether they want to testify in their own 
defense 
if the defendants do not include the substance of their 
anticipated testimony in their notice then they run a grave risk 
that the court will preclude large portions of their testimony 
the defense said 
on the other hand the defense lacks the information necessary 
to make an informed decision that the defendants will testify 
since the defense does not know how the prosecutions case will 
fare at any trial the brief said 
the problem is particularly acute because the indictment as 
described by us district judge gerhard a gesell alleges a 
course of conduct carried out using classified materials in 
classified channels from a highly classified site 
the difficulty is compounded by the large volume of documents 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh has said as many as 50000 
pages of classified documents collected during his investigation 
are relevant to the case 
and gesell has ruled that the defense should have an opportunity 
to examine relevant portions of another 250000 pages 
the defense can reasonably predict that hundreds of thousands 
of pages of classified material not yet inventoried and volumes of 
classified testimony will ultimately be involved in the case 
said the joint motion by lawyers for the four defendants 
the defense motion illustrated the difficulty of applying the 
disclosure rule to crossexamination 
armed with the defendants notice walsh can tailor his case 
to blunt the force of the defense crossexamination the notice 
may alert the prosecution to specific areas of vulnerability of 
which it had been not aware

the guidedmissile frigate samuel b roberts 
badly ripped by a mine in the persian gulf two weeks ago will be 
repaired at the shipyards of the bath iron works in bath maine 
the navy announced friday 
the service said a damage assessment of the ship was still under 
way in the united arab emirates port of dubai where the roberts 
was towed after the april 14 mining no estimate could be made as 
to when the frigate could sail for the united states 
but the service said the bath iron works had been selected to 
make repairs because of its proximity to newport ri the home 
port of the ship and because the shipyard has both the capability 
and capacity for doing the restoration 
the samuel b roberts was built at bath and was commissioned 
there in april 1986 the navy said in a statement the cost of 
the repairs has not yet been determined and will not be known 
until a full assessment can be made of the damage 
the navy said no decision had been made on whether temporary 
repairs could be performed in dubai that would allow the ship to 
steam home on its own power a navy source said however the 
damage to the vessel was so severe that it almost certainly 
would have to be towed 
navy officials have said the roberts almost certainly would have 
sunk had it not been for the performance of its crew

thousands of workers struck for higher pay 
at a heavy machinery plant friday capping a week of polands worst 
labor trouble since communist authorities suppressed the solidarity 
union more than six years ago 
warsaw police detained jacek kuron a senior adviser to the 
outlawed solidarity federation a member of kurons household said 
three plainclothesmen arrived at his home in warsaw as kuron was 
being interviewed by telephone by a western radio station 
strikes began monday with bus and streetcar drivers leaving 
their jobs in the western city of bydgoszcz workers at the huge 
lenin steel works at nowa huta outside krakow in the southern 
industrial belt struck tuesday and on friday came the strike at 
the machinery plant at stalowa wola 65 miles east of krakow 
solidarity activists in krakows municipal transport company 
said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 am saturday 
to support the nowa huta action 
workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more prices rose 
42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government 
reduced subsidies on many consumer items 
sunday is may day the international labor day traditionally 
celebrated by the government and used by polish workers to air 
their grievances publicly streets were festooned in advance with 
red communist party banners redandwhite polish flags and posters 
saying workers of all lands unite 
the government has both threatened dismissals and promised to 
improve wages at bydgoszcz the 2800 drivers won a 60 percent pay 
increase ater an 11hour strike 
officials of solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities 
use force against strikers they said workers in at least four 
other cities had declared support for the nowa huta action and 
issued strike alerts 
lech walesa solidaritys founder said in a statement i 
appeal to authorities to maintain reason i am warning against the 
return to the policy of terror which is apparently supposed to 
defend reforms while in reality it defends the way of governing 
which has led poland to ruin 
he said statements by government officials indicated they might 
use force and urged polands workers to show solidarity with 
the strikers in case violence takes place 
an aide read the statement by telephone from walesas apartment 
in gdansk where the 1983 nobel peace laureate works as a shipyard 
electrician the aide who asked that his name not be used said 
walesa instructed regional solidarity leaders to organize protests 
and strikes if the government uses force 
government spokesman jerzy urban said an attempt to start a 
strike failed at the 18000worker stalowa wola heavy machinery 
plant but the official news agency pap said later at least one 
department was shut down 
a roman catholic priest in stalowa wola the rev jan niemiec 
said about 7000 strikers were occupying three department and the 
strike began when about 5000 firstshift employees quit working 
he said management tried to lock out most of the secondshift 
workers but some broke in 
niemiec said the number of strikers could be as high as 9000 
but he could not confirm the figure he said the information came 
from a member of the strike committee 
in poland strikers customarily go to their places of employment 
but do not work often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets 
about 12000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the lenin 
plant in nowa huta which means new steel mill and was built as a 
model city in the 1950s just outside krakow 
management representatives met with the plants 
governmentsanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial 
committee that claims to represent at least half the plants 32000 
workers 
the nowa huta strike is the biggfest in poland since those that 
swept the country after food price increases in 1980 bringing down 
a government and giving birth to solidarity the independent union 
federation was suppressed then outlawed after martial law was 
declared in december 1981 
urban said there had been preventative detentions in poland 
this week but did not say how many kuron the solidarity adviser 
said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been 
picked up around the country in the past two days 
bronislaw geremek an adviser to walesa said police stopped his 
car thursday in stalowa wola and detained him solidarity spokesman 
janusz onyszkiewicz and warsaw solidarity leader zbigniew bujak he 
said onyszkiewicz and bujak remained in custody 
zbigniew romaszewski a solidarity spokesman in warsaw said 
many police were in stalowa wola and at least four solidarity 
activists were detained 
demands at nowa huta are representative recognition of their 
union rights release of detained solidarity activists and an 
immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the 
equivalent of 105 
the strike committee said it had sent a letter to pope john paul 
ii who was krakows archbishop before becoming pope that began 
we address you with our words of devotion and respect we are 
sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for 
decent payment

us ambassador richard burt urged the 
nato allies friday to do more for western defense 
europeans must do more for and among themselves to contribute 
to their own defense in europe and beyond he told an american 
chamber of commerce meeting in hamburg 
europes stake in the international arena is often equal to or 
greater than that of the united states for example in questions of 
access to raw materials such as oil and international markets 
us legislators have spoken in recent months of a growing 
belief among americans that europeans do not contribute enough 
toward western defense 
rupert scholz who takes over as west german defense minister 
next month was quoted by the newspaper die welt as saying in an 
interview it is not a matter of money alone it is ability and 
performance as well 
he said west german and us defense interests cannot not be 
separated

the bunny suits are retired now some replaced 
by pinstripes but the women who found success in ears and 
cottontails still love to lead a cheer for the bygone lifestyle 
i think probably it is a lost era said sandi meehan 49 of 
manhattan who joined other former bunnies planning a saturday 
night reunion when someone says playboy bunny it brings images 
of maybe ziegfeld follies girls or the rockettes 
mrs meehan who worked at playboy clubs from 1961 to 1974 and 
recruited other women during bunny hunts now invests in real 
estate and owns a manhattan bakery with another former bunny 
bunnydom she said gave her valuable training in business and 
public relations 
we former bunnies are very successful businesswomen and we 
are not feminists said mrs meehan feminists are the ones who 
attacked us i dont think its fair i know so many successful 
girls who came from playboy 
one successful girl uh woman invited to the reunion was ms 
magazine founder gloria steinem who once took a job as a bunny to 
write an expose 
steinem wont attend the reunion which will raise funds for 
cancer care inc when we have a dinner where former bunnies feel 
able to tell the truth it will make a lot more money and then 
ill come she said 
but perhaps the feminist leader could strike a common chord with 
exbunny anna lederer 37 who left her native trinidad at 17 
because they thought i was pretty and too young to be involved in 
politics 
it was a mans world it still is said mrs lederer who 
went on to earn a degree in international relations at the 
university of geneva and open an import business 
before that she worked from 1968 to 1971 in the old manhattan 
playboy club which closed in 1982 
i was brought up in a convent she explained i wanted to 
get a job where i wouldnt be so shy anymore she said a club 
managers advice to stand tall and be proud of herself did more 
for me than a psychiatrist could have done 
lorraine muscara 28 rode the cottontail of the era her 
employer the empire club in manhattan opened in november 1985 and 
closed in june 1986 
miss muscara director of sales for a manhattan computer 
maintenance company hurried from her office three nights a week 
trading her business clothes for a bunny costume 
it was a release i couldnt wait to walk into the bunny 
room she said it got me through the day sometimes 
mrs lederer said she organized the reunion of exbunnies who 
live in the metropolitan area at the suggestion of her 13yearold 
son 
years ago we were teenagers young and foolish she said 
now weve lived life matured 
some are bringing up babies on their own most of my 
exbunny friends are in business one is a doctor one runs a 
shelter they have gone on to do incredible things with their 
lives for society she added

company that makes industrial robots the couple also owns at least 
1000 in us treasury notes

created in 1949 under the will of kitty dukakis grandmother mabel 
williams to be distributed to mrs dukakis father harry ellis 
dickson and one created in 1972 by dickson 
it was the trust set up in by dukakis father panos dukakis

democrat michael dukakis turned aside 
sharpened criticism from rival jesse jackson on friday and said it 
would be a tragedy if president reagan vetoes legislation 
requiring companies to give notice before closing factories 
he said workers deserve better from america 
dukakis criticized the reagan administration on issues ranging 
from homelessness to problems with the nations airlines under 
deregulation as he began campaigning toward ohios democratic 
presidential primary next tuesday 
campaigning on the oneyear anniversary of his formal entry into 
the presidential race dukakis urged supporters to ignore polls 
showing him far ahead 
dukakis did not mention his remaining democratic rival jackson 
nor did he respond with criticism when asked about jacksons sharp 
comments in ohio that dukakis would merely manage reagans 
economic program rather than change it 
i just dont talk about these things i have a record 
dukakis said not only that i balance budgets and thats 
something that hasnt been a feature of reaganomics 
dukakis mentioned disagreements he has with jackson on the 
middle east and other issues and said i think youll continue to 
see us conduct this campaign with a lot of mutual respect and 
genuine friendship and the fact that we disagree on some issues i 
dont think will change that 
appearing before labor leaders at a local union hall in 
columbus and later before a lunchtime crowd in downtown dayton 
the massachusetts governor pointed to his own states law requiring 
companies to make public their plans to close plants he said it 
had saved jobs by giving workers and local governments the chance 
to prepare or find alternatives 
i hope the president will take the time to think about the 
three million american workers who lose their jobs in this country 
every year through plant shutdowns dukakis said in at least 
half those cases those plants shut down with little or no notice 
to those most affected their own employees 
these people are our neighbors he said they deserve 
better from their employers they deserve better from america 
reagan has said he would veto trade legislation passed 
overwhelmingly by the senate this week because of a provision 
requiring 60days notice on plant closings 
i hope he will reconsider dukakis said 
speaking to reporters later in youngstown dukakis said i 
think it would be a tragedy if it was vetoed i think he might 
reconsider 
dukakis the likely democratic nominee after big wins in new 
york and pennsylvania is battling jesse jackson for ohios 159 
democratic delegates at stake tuesday after flying around ohio 
friday and saturday he also planned to visit indiana where 79 
delegates are also at stake in that states primary tuesday 
before leaving for ohio dukakis released copies of letters sent 
to reagan and congressional leaders urging enactment of the trade 
bill and said he would make the bill a major part of his attack on 
vice president george bush the certain gop nominee if the measure 
is vetoed by reagan 
dukakis appeared in columbus with ohio gov richard celeste who 
last year had flirted with the idea of running for the presidency 
celeste spoke warmly of dukakis but later said he was taking no 
stand in the race 
its a desire to ensure an open enthusiastic primary in the 
state in which reverend jackson knows hes as welcome as governor 
dukakis at every place including the governors office and his 
supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in 
the fall celeste said 
dukakis did not cite bush by name but referred to him in saying 
the republican party is going to be asking americans to keep 
things as they are but i say we have to change 
repeating his call for reinvestment in american jobs dukakis 
said im not running for president to overthrow governments in 
central america i want to create jobs in middle america

since the prison disturbances by mariel cuban 
detainees last fall the government has released more than 1000 of 
the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in 
communities the justice department announced friday 
one of the triggers to last years uprisings at federal prisons 
in atlanta and oakdale la was the fact that the government was 
taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were 
deemed eligible for release according to legal advocates for the 
detainees federal officials said they were having trouble finding 
halfway house space for the detainees 
from last june until the time the prison riots erupted in 
november the immigration and naturalization service had released 
106 cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors a total 
of 1047 have been placed since the disturbances 
ins has approved 2224 cuban detainees for release since last 
june of whom 1337 have been approved since the riots 
parole has been denied to 1193 mariel cubans and 845 of the 
denials have been decided since the uprisings 
when the riots broke out there were about 7600 cuban detainees 
in various facilities 
the justice department also announced it plans to repatriate 14 
mariel cubans the first group of detainees designated for return 
to cuba since the prison disturbances 
the 14 in federal custody since completing prison sentences for 
crimes committed in the united states have been notified that the 
ins intends to send them back the justice department said 
those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of 
crimes including voluntary manslaughter armed robbery attempted 
firstdegree murder kidnapping and attempted rape 
the repatriation process will include a review of their cases by 
a justice department review panel under an agreement which ended 
the rioting at atlanta and oakdale 
those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to 
submit additional information on their behalf to the justice 
department review panels which specifically exclude immigration 
officers

the senate ethics committee criticized sen 
david durenberger on friday for discussing an espionage case in 
public last year but stopped short of recommending disiplinary 
action against the minnnesota republican 
the committee said the remarks by durenberger the immediate 
past chairman of the senate intelligence committee had 
jeopardized the mutual confidence which must exist between the 
congress and the intelligence community 
the ethics committee has determined that your statements gave 
the appearance that you were disclosing sensitive national security 
information durenberger was told 
the ethics committee investigation centered on comments 
durenberger made at an event sponsored by the american israel 
public affairs committee in palm beach fla on march 15 1987 
some members of the senate were said to have been angered by 
durenbergers reported disclosure to the group that thencia 
director william j casey in 1982 had changed the rules under 
which allies did not spy on each other by recruiting an israeli 
military officer to spy on israel for the united states 
durenberger later denied he had revealed any classified 
information 
in its letter to durenberger the ethics committee said 
because the committee has concluded that your actions were not 
intentional deliberate nor attended with gross negligence and 
because of the particular facts of this case we will not recommend 
that the senate take institutional action against you however the 
committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your 
actions 
the letter was signed by sens howell heflin dala david 
pryor dark terry sanford dnc warren rudman rnh jesse 
helms rnc and nancy kassebaum rkan 
durenberger said friday he was gratified by their findings 
that no action is warranted 
but he added i respectfully disagree with the ethic 
committees conclusion that my statements gave an appearance that 
may have put at risk the mutual confidence that must exist between 
congress and the intelligence community 
sources present at the palm beach meeting who said they took 
careful notes reported that durenberger said the cia recruited its 
israeli spy after israels 1982 invasion of lebanon the spy passed 
along sensitive information about the invasion durenberger 
reportedly told the group 
durenbergers comments were said to be aimed at giving context 
to the case of jonathan jay pollard an american convicted of 
spying on the united states for israel 
in a statement issued later durenberger said he had not been 
seeking to justify israels recruitment of pollard but rather to 
shed light on how it may have occurred and give it 
perspective 
in his statement friday durenberger repeated his previous 
assertions that he had not disclosed anything classified but was 
only referring to newspaper accounts at the time whose content led 
to speculation that there may have been us intelligence sources 
in the israeli government 
i believe that i exercised due care in preparation for this 
speech durenberger said i respectfully disagree with the 
ethic committees conclusion that my statements gave the appearance 
that i was disclosing sensitive information 
to the contrary i expressly indicated that the source of my 
remarks was newspaper articles and i said nothing to leave the 
impression that i was relaying confidential information he said 
director casey was a strong leader loyal to his own view of 
the public interest but his belief that congress should play 
little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual 
confidence long before march 1987 durenberger said 
in a separate statement friday senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan said durenberger was an excellent chairman during one of 
the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight 
i had just as much confidence in dave before the ethics committee 
examination as i do right now

authorities on friday shut down some production 
facilities at a chemical plant in armenia after environmentalists 
contended the equipment increased cases of cancer and other 
diseases 
soviet television said two units producing chloroprene rubber 
were taken out of production friday morning at the nairit 
scientific production association in yerevan because they caused 
irreparable harm to the citys ecology and peoples health 
the decision was made due to multiple demands of residents of 
yerevan about a complicated ecological situation an announcer 
said 
a correspondent for the television news program vremya reported 
from yerevan that the two units sent 3500 tons of pollutants into 
the air annually 
the report showed workers turning off valves on the units built 
in the late 1930s the plant will continue to produce other items 
including anticorrosive paint according to the report 
the shutdown was an example of how soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness has made 
authorities more responsive to citizens complaints 
the soviet news media has carried a number of reports about 
industrial pollution as a threat to public health many cities are 
reported to be in violation of national air pollution standards in 
january the government formed a state committee for environmental 
protection 
at least 3000 armenians marched in yerevan oct 17 to demand 
the shutdown of nairit and a nuclear power station 
soviet television said the national cabinet known as the 
council of ministers in december ordered an end to production of 
chloroprene at nairit using old technology 
in march 1986 activists in armenia sent gorbachev a petition 
demanding that the plant be relocated they said it was 
contributing to a massive increase in stomach cancer cardiac and 
respiratory disease and congenital defects they claimed that over 
the past 15 years the number of leukemia cases in and around 
yerevan quadrupled

mayor carl e officer said friday 
that his cashstrapped city has come up with the money for its 
biweekly payroll but that workers still wont get paid on time 
because of a city hall squabble 
city treasurer charlotte moore whose elective job includes 
authority to sign city payroll checks posted a brief note friday 
afternoon advising city workers that they would not receive their 
checks until monday friday was payday 
on thursday she had said that city coffers were about 70000 
short of meeting the 230000 payroll but officer charged that the 
city had the money on friday and said mrs moore was withholding 
the money deliberately 
this is a case of protest by the city treasurer because of 
recent layoffs in her office officer said in a telephone 
interview 
twentyfive of the approximately 275 city workers were laid off 
monday including all of mrs moores regular staff and the city 
expects to cut another 25 in the next week or two comptroller 
lamar gentry said 
mrs moore did not return numerous telephone calls to her office 
friday 
officer said he also had tried unsuccessfully to reach her 
shes the most wanted person in town right now officer 
said adding he had heard many complaints from city workers 
the withholding of the paychecks doesnt make any sense 
especially when you have over a half a million dollars in cash in 
the bank 
officer said friday that the money had been transferred from 
other accounts mostly revenues collected for the city by the 
state or county in plenty of time to cover the paychecks 
gentry agreed with the mayors charge that the payroll shortage 
was trumped up by mrs moore because of the layoffs 
there is no problem with the payroll only in the treasurers 
eyes he said 
east st louis has been on a financial roller coaster for 
decades sixtyone percent of the citys 55000 residents receive 
some kind of public assistance and about 40 percent of its citizens 
are unemployed 
officials say the depressed citys financial problems show no 
sign of subsiding 
on may 17 two days after its next payroll is due the city 
must make a 54000 payment on a court judgment it owes a granite 
city man walter debow debow was seriously injured in a 1985 
beating at the city jail attorneys for his family last month 
obtained a temporary freeze of the citys assets to force payment 
of the settlement which totals about 4 million 
but gentry said he expects the city to be able to cover its 
upcoming payrolls and the payments on the debow judgment by 
shuffling funds around in the daybyday weekbyweek process 
of trying to keep the city afloat 
ive been doing it the comptrollers job since 84 and we 
havent missed one payroll but weve had to do some juggling 
acts he said 
gentry also said the city was in no greater danger of bankruptcy 
friday than it was four years earlier

the reagan administrations top 
counterterrorism expert on friday predicted a probable surge in 
palestinian terrorism as a result of the uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories and the killing of a palestinian 
guerrilla chieftain 
ambassador l paul bremer also said libya continues to plan 
international terrorist attacks but is looking for such surrogates 
as the japanese red army to do its dirty work 
in an interview bremer said there is a possibility of a 
measurable increase of palestinian terrorism in the coming months 
he cited as reasons the fivemonthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and the 
killing of khalil wazir the secondincommand of the palestine 
liberation organization the killing of wazir known as abu jihad 
was carried out by israeli agents in tunisia almost two weeks ago 
the rapprochement between plo chief yasser arafat and syrian 
president hafez assad following abu jihads assassination also may 
contribute to a terror campaign although it is too soon to assess 
the impact of the thaw he said 
abu nidal the nom de guerre for sabri bannah continues to plan 
terror attacks from his headquarters in libya where he maintains 
300 to 400 operatives bremer said abu nidal heads a palestinian 
faction which broke away from the arafats fatah branch of the plo 
and which has carried out some of the bloodiest terror attacks in 
the world over the past few years 
the organization also maintains eight training camps in the 
syriancontrolled bekaa valley of eastern lebanon he said assad 
in an attempt to win us support expelled abu nidal from syria 
last summer 
but bremer said the groups presence in the bekaa valley is a 
continued irritant in ussyrian relations 
abu nidal operatives were apprehended in the philippines over 
the past six months said a us official who asked not to be 
named also in the philippines libya has links with the filipino 
moro guerrilla group on the southern island of mindanao he said 
several minor bombings in jordan over the last few months may 
have been the work of abu nidal said the official 
having been intimidated by the us bombing raid on libya two 
years ago col moammar gadhafi has been casting about looking 
for surrogates to carry out terror attacks bremer said 
among the candidates are abu nidal and the irish republican 
army bremer said libya is believed to have shipped the ira 
hundreds of tons of sovietmade weapons over the past three years 
gadhafi also sent out feelers to the japanese red army and 
the secret army for the liberation of armenia he said the 
japanese red army claimed responsibility for a bombing earlier this 
month at a uso club in naples italy where a us servicewoman was 
killed 
bremer noted that the attack was carried out a day before the 
april 15 second anniversary of the us bombing of libya he also 
said a japanese red army member was caught april 12 by state 
troopers in new jersey with two bombs in his car 
the man is not cooperating with police but he may have planned 
to use the bombs on the anniversary date bremer said 
in general terror attacks in 1987 rose by 59 percent over the 
1985 record from 785 to 832 according to figures compiled by 
bremers office the increase reflects the surge in bombing attacks 
in pakistan most of which are attributed to the sovietbacked 
afghan secret police 
after afghanistan iran is the second largest sponsor of 
international terrorism with 40 attacks to its name in 1987 
compared with 34 in 1985 according to the figures

eight of opecs 13 member nations 
tentatively agreed early saturday to a small cut in oil production 
for may and june in an effort to prop up sagging prices cartel 
leaders said 
gholamreza aghazadeh the iranian oil minister told reporters 
saudi arabia kuwait qatar and the united arab emirates reserved 
their position until opecs next meeting which he said was set 
for saturday night 
iraq which has not joined opecs existing productionsharing 
system was not expected to particiopate in the proposed new cuts 
said venezuelan oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti 
hernandez said the proposal was made by algeria 
this proposal had the support of eight countries he said 
the four gulf arab oil ministers were to consult with their 
governments and report a final decision at the next session 
hernandez told reporters 
the production cuts would take effect may 1 
it was not immediately clear how the proposed cut of 300000 
barrels a day if adopted would be divided among the 13 members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the proposal calls for oil export cuts by opec in conjunction 
with a group of independent oil producers the nonopec group was 
invited to discuss strategy at opec headquarters in vienna earlier 
this week 
the aim is to raise prices to opecs target of 18 a barrel 
from the current range of 14 to 16 by tightening supplies 
nervous traders sent oil prices lower on european markets where 
brent crude oil from the north sea tumbled 66 cents to 1654 a 
42gallon barrel after having lost 30 cents on thursday 
later prices continued slumping at the new york mercantile 
exchange dropping as much as 43 cents per barrel before rallying 
toward the close and ending largely unchanged analysts said june 
contracts for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
settled at 1799 per barrel up 1 cent from thursday 
the nonopec group comprised of mexico china malaysia 
angola egypt and oman on tuesday offered to reduce their oil 
exports by 5 percent if opec did likewise the cuts would be for 
may and june only 
opec leaders initially welcomed the offer which marked the 
first such proposal from a group of outside oil producers since 
opec was founded in 1960 some called it a historic first step 
toward creating a global oil alliance 
once the cartel leaders sat down to discuss the proposal 
however sharp differences emerged officials said after an initial 
session that ended early friday 
the early discussions focused on whether supplies were far 
enough out of balance with demand to require a cut in production 
said fernandos santos ecuadors oil minister in an attempt to 
resolve this question a team of technical experts from the 13 
cartel member countries met friday afternoon 
the experts group failed to reach a unified view however a 
majority of the experts said some form of additional production 
restraint was needed in order to get prices higher according to 
sources speaking privately 
saudi king fahd appeared to signal on thursday that he would not 
accept any further reductions in opec production he said prices 
would go up if opec simply stuck to its existing output quotas 
which often are violated 
saudi arabia opecs biggest oil producer injected added 
tension into the vienna talks with its decision tuesday to break 
diplomatic relations with iran citing what it called a hostile 
iranian attitude 
iran fighting a 7yearold war with iraq has attacked neutral 
shipping in the persian gulf including saudi ships in retaliation 
for iraqi attacks on iranianchartered ships in the waterway

the federal aviation administration ordered a 
close inspection of the upper skin of oldermodel boeing 737s last 
october because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal 
overlap warning such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression 
the twinengine aloha airlines jetliner that ripped open at 
24000 feet was among the earlymodel boeing 737s subject to the 
faa directive as well as to a series of service bulletins by boeing 
outlining the inspection programs officials said friday 
the faas concern had been raised last year because routine 
inspections turned up cracks near fasteners that join sections of 
sheet metal in three aircraft the same inspections also found 
metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some earlymodel 
boeing 737s because the lamination was no longer holding 
stephanie ackerman manager of public relations for aloha said 
friday we are in full compliance with the october directive we 
did receive the directive the inspections were carried out and we 
are in compliance she would not elaborate on what the 
inspections revealed but said nothing was found that caused alarm 
investigators have yet to determine the cause of thursdays 
incident in which a huge upper section of the aloha jetliner tore 
away leaving passengers exposed to the open skies at 24000 feet 
the pilot made an emergency landing within 15 minutes but a flight 
attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 60 passengers 
were injured two critically 
sources who asked not to be identified said that investigators 
are focusing on a possible structural failure that could have 
caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin 
one theory is that a structural failure such as a tear in the 
cabin skin might have caused an initial loss of cabin pressure and 
then the force of the strong winds may have ripped away the huge 
upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front entry door 
to within a few feet of the wing 
investigators however also are examining the cabin 
pressurization system to determine whether it might have 
malfunctioned 
the airworthiness directive issued by the faa last oct 5 
required that operators of older boeing 737s inspect the extreme 
upper sections of the planes outer skin from just behind the front 
entry door to the tail section for cracks and metal strips that may 
be coming loose 
failure to detect and repair cracks could result in rapid 
depressurization of the airplane the directive warned 
jim boynton a boeing spokesman said in seattle that the 
manufacturer has issued a series of service bulletins on the need 
for periodic inspections on the aircraft skin of the older boeing 
737s for possible cracking or structural weakening because of 
corrosion 
the last bulletin was issued two weeks before thursdays 
incident he said unlike faa directives the bulletins from the 
manufacturer do not require mandatory compliance 
the faa directive last october also outlined a detailed schedule 
of future periodic inspections to protect against cracks or 
loosening of metal strips which reinforce the fuselage where 
sections of sheet metal overlap 
the directive covered the first 291 boeing 737s manufactured 
later aircraft had a stronger bonding and fastening system for the 
sheet metal and were not the subject of concern the faa said 
the boeing co has built 1109 boeing 737200 series aircraft 
such as the one involved in thursdays incident 
according to boeing the aloha plane involved in thursdays 
incident was no 152 off the assembly line it was delivered to a 
leasing company in april 1968 and leased to aloha in december of 
that year according to boeing and the faa 
faa records showed that the plane had extensive repair work done 
to mend cracks and corroded metal on two occasions in 1983 but 
most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the 
plane which seemed not to be related to thursdays incident 
extensive work also was required in 1983 and several other times 
since then on cracks and corrosion on the planes wings according 
to faa records a section of the planes right wing was replaced 
last year when cracks were found in the wing 
many of those repairs were required by another faa directive in 
1982 which stemmed in part from an investigation into the 1981 
crash of a boeing 737 in taiwan which had similarities to the 
incident thursday in hawaii according to aviation experts 
on aug 22 1981 a boeing 737 belonging to far east air 
transport crashed after the top of the cabins metal skin tore from 
the plane at about 22000 feet in both the taiwan and aloha 
accidents about the same section of the plane ripped away 
charles o miller an aviation consultant familiar with the 1981 
crash said a big difference was that in the taiwan accident the 
structural weakness was linked to corrosion in the forward baggage 
compartment below the cabin floor 
in thursdays incident however the aloha jet remained intact 
below the cabin floor and the control cables were not damaged 
allowing the pilot to maintain control and bring the jet in for a 
safe landing

a museum official under fire from cuban exiles for 
including in an auction works by artists they consider sympathetic 
to the cuban government accused his detractors of using the type 
of totalitarian tactics they oppose 
i have been subject to extreme pressure said ramon cernuda 
vice president of the cuban museum of arts and culture 
cernuda has ignored requests to resign though he says he has 
received so many threatening telephone calls that he had to have 
his phone number changed 
the flap began over an april 22 auction that earned the museum 
50000 in commissions from the auction of 173 paintings by various 
cuban artists some of whom live or lived in cuba and some of whom 
live elsewhere 
some of the works were by artists considered by the strongly 
anticommunist cuban exile community to be sympathetic to fidel 
castro 
the privately funded museums governing board of directors 
which had narrowly approved the auction met in emergency session 
friday to discuss the dispute but there was no immediate word on 
whether the board would announce any decision cernuda said he 
would resign only if the 54member board asked him to do so 
mignon medrano a museum founder and its former president is 
among those accusing cernuda of tinkering with the museums 
ideological slant in what medrano considers a misguided pursuit of 
artistic freedom 
we are a museum created and sustained by cuban exiles 
medrano said as long as we have a voice we will never be a 
propaganda vehicle for those artists who collaborate with the 
communists 
museum president nunzio mainieri who says he has asked cernuda 
to quit because of the flap has also canceled a planned showing 
next month of work by cuban artist amelia pelaez one of cubas 
foremost painters she died on the island in 1986 
she recently has been accused by some anticastro activists as a 
collaborator of that government 
that accusation is absurd said art expert jose gomezsicre 
founder of the modern art museum at the organization of american 
states in washington dc 
theyre imbeciles when they say that she was the best painter 
we ever produced he said she never got involved in politics 
all she had to do was paint 
the artists 85yearold sister elena pelaez of miami also 
denied the collaboration charge 
she hasnt been a collaborator of any government much less 
this one ms pelaez said of cuba she just painted and painted 
and painted

us attorney frank l mcnamara said friday that the endangered 
animals which were hunted in mexico were two ocelots a mountain 
lion and two jaguars it is legal to kill jaguars and ocelots in 
mexico with proper permits but it is illegal to return them to the 
united states 
the ocelot and the jaguar are on the endangered species list 
the mountain lion is on the protected species list 
if the reports are true it shows a shocking insensitivity to 
these endangered species which cannot be countenanced mcnamara 
said 
robert keefe a lawyer for hampers said his client maintains 
his innocence he will enter a plea of not guilty and expects to be 
vindicated at the end of trial hagers home and office have 
unlisted telephone numbers and he could not be reached for comment

mcnamaras office reportedly obtained search warrants for 
hampers and hagers homes and offices and confiscated three 
mounted ocelots two jaguars and a mountain lion chief assistant 
us attorney lj oneale of nevada said the trophies will be used 
as evidence 
hampers founded national medical care a walthambased company 
that was a pioneer in the artificial kidney field his wife who 
was revenue commissioner in 197982 ran unsuccessfully against 
massachusetts state treasurer robert crane two years ago 
hager is a former president of the new england conservative 
action committee 
hampers and hager each is charged with two counts of conspiracy 
to smuggle wildlife two counts of smuggling six counts of illegal 
importation of wildlife and four counts of unlawful transportation 
of wildlife 
if convicted they could be sentenced to five years in prison 
and fined 100000 each 
the indictment said hampers and hager knew they were acting 
illegally when they paid antonio rivera a mexican national who was 
their hunting guide to bring the pelts into the united states 
hampers and hager allegedly arranged to have the pelts stuffed 
by a taxidermist in colorado who sent the mounted trophies to the 
mens homes in new hampshire the indictment charges that rivera 
met the men in las vegas to deliver the pelts 
the taxidermist james bensley reportedly cooperated with 
authorities allowing his telephone calls with hampers and hager to 
be recorded by federal agents

passengers on friday praised the aloha 
airlines pilot who safely brought down a jetliner blown open at 
24000 feet with one man saying the landing was just like riding 
in a cadillac 
it came down so smooth it was better than a regular 
landing said mae kagihara who had thought the plane was going 
to crash thursday 
the boeing 737 piloted by robert schornstheimer landed at 
kahului airport on maui island 15 to 20 feet of its upper fuselage 
just behind the front passenger door torn away to the floor 
witnesses said one engine was on fire one attendant apparently was 
sucked from the cabin to her death and 61 people were injured two 
critically 
i give credit to the pilot he brought that plane down so 
smoothly it was just like riding in a cadillac said john lopez 
40 one of 89 passengers aboard flight 243 from hilo on the hawaii 
island to honolulu 
a structural failure is suspected of having caused the cabin to 
blow open investigators have ruled out a bomb blast sources said 
schornstheimer a 42yearold former air force pilot realized 
there was a hole in fuselage but was not aware of the extent of the 
damage until after the landing said his father also named robert 
he says it was just something else all of a sudden there was 
this noise and the planes flying funny and theres a big drag on 
it so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at 
the maui airport which was closest and he was able to get it in 
and land it the elder schornstheimer father said from his home 
in marietta ohio 
the pilot was taken to an undisclosed location by aloha for 
questioning by investigators from the federal aviation 
administration and national transportation safety board officials 
said 
us transportation secretary jim burnley telephoned and 
congratulated him for the landing said a spokesman for the 
department 
because the upper structure was gone there was a possibility 
of the plane buckling said dale bringelson owner of island 
aeromotive who watched the landing from his company hangar at 
kahului airport if he hadnt been real careful it could have 
busted in two the man was highly skilled and it speaks well of the 
profession 
mark eberly a ramp supervisor at the airport said he and a 
friend dropped to their knees as they saw the plane land its cabin 
exposed 
the jetliner was weaving as it headed in he said you could 
tell his plane was on one engine eberly said one engine was 
on fire and smoking 
i have to give the pilot credit he brought it in good 
eberly said 
i cant believe the airplane was still flying or that people 
sitting in that area survived said f emmett miller an aloha 
pilot who has flown 737s for 20 years i think its a statement 
probably any pilot would make looking at it i just think that bob 
schornstheimer did a wonderful job 
the elder schornstheimer said his son sounded calm when they 
spoke by telephone thursday night 
hes pretty calm under pressure he said he was calm and did 
what needed to be done just like any other pilot would have they 
were talking about it on tv like he was a hero but he said he 
just did what any other pilot would have done in the same 
circumstance the father said 
schornstheimers wife mary said she learned of the explosion 
and safe landing from friends i wasnt worried she said i 
have a lot of confidence in his ability as a pilot 
the elder schornstheimer said his son was in the air force from 
1967 to 1974 serving as a flight instructor and then as an air 
traffic controller at vance air force base in enid okla 
schornstheimer then worked as a civilian air traffic controller 
at kaneohe marine air base on oahu from 1974 until joining aloha as 
a pilot in 1977 his father said 
schornstheimer is secretarytreasurer of the local council of 
the air line pilots assocation and just made captain status this 
year said his stepmother nancy schornstheimer

a soviet official on friday criticized natos 
decision to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the issue would 
be discussed at the superpower summit in moscow next month 
deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin told a news conference 
the action by the north atlantic treaty organization diminished the 
significance of last years ussoviet pact to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
nato defense ministers agreed at their nuclear planning group 
meeting in brussels thursday to develop a replacement for the 
shortrange lance missile and a new airlaunched missile for 
bombers 
adamishin called the nato decision serious and said we are 
against modernization we want to reduce the level of nuclear and 
other armaments and not to raise it 
he was asked if the issue was serious enough to be discussed at 
the may 29june 3 meeting of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
president reagan and replied 
they have to discuss this problem its one of the key 
problems of the situation 
as soon as we have some result in reducing arms immediately 
there is a tendency and its a negative tendency to try to 
compensate to try not to give the full development to this 
disarmament tendency 
adamishin said it was a rather interesting coincidence that 
in brussels america asserted the soviet union was conducting tests 
to shorten the range of some intercontinental ballistic missiles 
icbms so they could be targeted towards europe and then nato 
agreed to develop new missiles 
he said lets consider for a moment that the americans are 
right and we are making icbms to hit targets in europe although 
experts would say this is absolute nonsense why not appeal to 
the soviet union to demand clarification to discuss this situation 
no at the moment the news breaks out the decision has been 
adopted by nato 
adamishin said he still hoped us and soviet negotiators would 
reach agreement on cutting longrange nuclear missiles by 50 
percent before the summit 
if we fail in climbing this mountain then the task would be 
to go as high as possible on the way toward the top and to create a 
situation which would make it impossible to go back he said 
we are working in this direction there are very serious 
and large efforts on our side to make this agreement a reality 
he added the united states should be a little bit more 
persistent in trying to resolve outstanding issues and listed as 
examples a ceiling on sealaunched missiles and a verification 
system 
both sides have agreed to those points he said but washington 
has not specified a ceiling or responded to soviet proposals on 
verification 
in the case of icbms and submarinelaunched missiles adamishin 
said there is more or less a clear picture emerging as to how the 
agreement would work 
but with sealaunched cruise missiles and some other weapons 
where the united states has a considerable superiority over us 
there is no agreement he said he did not specify what other 
weapons he was referring to

the justice department on friday cleared one 
of its former prosecutors bestselling novelist scott f turow of 
allegations that he may have obstructed justice in a criminal 
investigation 
the allegations were contained in a federal appeals court 
opinion which raised ethical and legal questions over the fact that 
turow while an assistant us attorney in chicago in the early 
1980s used a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his 
own client 
turow who wrote the book presumed innocent about a midwest 
prosecutor falsely accused of murder did not hinder or obstruct 
the administration of justice in any way justice department 
official john keeney wrote in a onepage letter to turows attorney 
all decisions by turow were approved by his supervisors and 
there is no evidence that any of the actions taken by mr turow 
or his superiors violated any federal criminal statute said 
keeney the acting criminal division chief in the justice 
department 
turow said in a statement that he was gratified by the decision 
as i have said from the outset i am convinced that the 
conduct in question was proper and necessary for effective law 
enforcement he said 
the public integrity probe was launched after the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta refused to dismiss a drug case 
in which turow was marginally involved as a prosecutor federal 
agents arrested a miami man after finding more than 4 pounds of 
cocaine in his house and the man retained two miami lawyers one 
of whom later became a target in operation greylord an 
investigation of corruption in cook county ill 
the target marvin glass contacted the us attorneys office 
in chicago and offered to provide drugrelated information in 
exchange for favorable treatment of his case his offer was 
accepted and he met periodically with turow 
when glass informed turow he was representing the miami man 
ronald ofshe in the drug case turow encouraged him to proceed as 
an informant and turow obtained permission to place a microphone on 
glass to secretly record conversations between him and ofshe 
according to the federal appeals court turow warned him not to 
reveal any privileged attorneyclient conversations 
when ofshe and his other lawyer discovered that glass had been 
acting as an informant they tried unsuccessfully to have the case 
dismissed 
the appeals court rejected the request for dismissal last june 
but said that we do not condone the governments use of criminal 
defense attorneys as informants against their clients last 
november a threejudge panel of the appeals court rejected turows 
request to delete from the record its previous rebuke saying it 
was troubled by the ethical ramifications of his conduct and 
that we believe that turow may have committed an obstruction of 
justice

scientists from around the globe gathered 
friday to plan for international space year in 1992 and were called 
the spiritual descendants of christopher columbus 
you are explorers who know of enduring hardship to triumph 
over great natural obstacles said harvey meyerson president of 
the usisy association which is supervising the planning 
the organization is orchestrating a series of space projects to 
commemorate the 500th anniversary of columbus first voyage to the 
new world in 1492 
this effort unites the universal themes that have powered 
the human spirit in the past and continue to point to a future of 
unlimited horizons added james c fletcher the chief of the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
nearly 90 scientists from 17 space agencies including those of 
the soviet union china and western european opened the threeday 
meeting at the university of new hampshire 
the scientists are planning projects that will use space 
satellites to research global problems including acid rain ozone 
depletion and the apparent gradual warming of the earths climate 
known as the greenhouse effect 
images of the planet from space fletcher said have triggered 
an awareness of earth as a fragile and most precious life support 
system one made even more precious because it is the only body 
in our solar system to harbor and nourish life 
the space year will include tv specials expositions and trade 
fairs the events will help persuade people and governments that 
space technology is worth its high cost said philip goldsmith of 
the european space agency a consortium of several western european 
nations 
its easy to convince the public and political masters of the 
glamor projects like space travel but harder to maintain the 
enthusiasm and funding levels for the long period needed to observe 
earth goldsmith said

the rebels on friday removed a major 
obstacle to agreement in their talks with the government to work 
out details of a ceasefire pact signed last month 
the top rebel leader announced that the insurgents known as 
contras will not insist that their fighters be resupplied with 
weapons and ammunition when they gather in seven ceasefire zones 
during a permanent truce that is being considered 
we have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and 
ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty 
and indivisibility of national territory adolfo calero told a 
news conference 
previously the contras insisted that the ceasefire zones be 
autonomous 
but calero also said the contras rejected the sandinista 
governments demand that all humanitarian aid to the rebels be 
channeled through the international red cross the rebels expect 
177 million in humanitarian aid already approved by the us 
congress 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told reporters 
earlier friday that the rebels have suffered deep internal 
divisions and some segments have rejected disarming and returning 
to civilian life 
the rebels on friday rejected a government proposal to extend by 
30 days a 60day ceasefire that began april 1 they said the 
extension showed a lack of good will to fulfill the agreements 
the ceasefire agreement was signed on march 23 
sandinista officials said the rebel refusal to agree to an 
extension showed the contras were more interested in a truce than a 
permanent peace 
the interim ceasefire accord calls for the contras to move into 
ceasefire zones while talks continue on a longterm accord 
contra leaders insist the sides agree upon just how much freedom 
the rebels will have within those zones 
as the two sides continued their talks in the nicaraguan 
capital police used rubber truncheons to break up a demonstration 
at the headquarters of the general workers confederation an 
umbrella group for antisandinista unions and detained seven 
people 
carlos huembes chairman of the democratic coordinate a 
coalition of unions and parties opposed to the government said 
four workers were arrested outside the social democratic party 
headquarters 
he said they were en route to the demonstration in front of the 
confederation building both the construction workers and the 
social democratic party belong to the coordinate 
the arrests came five days after 38 construction workers and 
auto mechanics began a hunger strike for higher salaries 
police cordoned off the entrance of the union headquarters where 
about 150 people including the hunger strikers huddled behind the 
metal grates of the building a banner strung across the building 
said we prefer to die of hunger fighting with dignity than to 
die working as slaves 
about 1500 workers from both industries have staged wildcat 
strikes since feb 25 demanding higher wages 
jose castillo osejo head of privatelyowned radio corporation 
which broadcast the news of the police actions said interior 
minister tomas borge punched him in the mouth when he was summoned 
to the ministers office on friday he said borge apologized later 
castillo is also a leader of the opposition conservative party 
and the permanent commission on human rights a private watchdog 
group 
the weapons issue has been a major one in the contrasandinista 
talks particularly whether the rebels can keep their arms 
the rebels say they will disarm when nicaragua is on the 
irreversible road to democracy the sandinistas say disarming 
is fundamental to the pact 
but tinoco said an apparent split among contra leaders made such 
negotiations more difficult the rebels deny the split 
the rebels had been supplied arms and weapons since 1981 through 
ciaoperated air drops that stopped earlier this year when congress 
rejected president reagans request for renewed military aid 
government newspapers on friday quoted president daniel ortega 
as saying that 179 million in usapproved aid for children 
orphaned or injured in the war would be permitted only if channeled 
through neutral organizations 
ortega was quoted as saying his side understood the good 
intentions involved in congress approving the money but we 
cannot allow it to arrive through political organisms that are 
clearly against the revolution 
the aid part of a nearly 48 million contra aid package was to 
be funneled to nicaragua through the us agency for international 
development

the governing christian 
democrats on friday named julio adolfo rey prendes their candidate 
in next years presidential elections ignoring warnings that the 
party may split 
the party chief and former cabinet minister was acclaimed by an 
overwhelming majority of the delegates in a raucous congress 
punctuated by insults and derisive whistles 
no other name was proposed supporters of fidel chavez mena rey 
prendes bitter rival in the centrist party fight boycotted the 
nominating congress claiming it was stacked in favor of rey 
prendes 
president jose napoleon duarte the partys honorary president 
did not attend he had urged both rey prendes and chavez mena to 
step aside and let abraham gonzalez an elderly party leader be 
the unity candidate both candidates rejected that suggestion 
under law duarte could not run for a second fiveyear term he 
won the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the 
ussupported conservative government that began in 1980 and 
continues 
the number of delegates eligible to vote was 1099 some had 
left the sheraton hotel auditorium by the time the vote was taken 
but hundreds of delegates raised their credentials when rey 
prendes name was put to the vote 
those opposed including some of the partys top leaders 
mustered only 56 votes in favor of postponing the decision on a 
candidate 
the national convention comprising about 180 delegates later 
unanimously ratified rey prendes nomination 
if this congress makes a decision today this party is not 
going to divide it is going to shatter said aquilino duarte a 
member of the partys 10member political committee or 
directorate he is the minister of commerce and the presidents 
nephew 
he and three other committee members urged delaying a decision 
to give party leaders time to heal deep rifts caused by the rivalry 
roberto viera of the political committee said the christian 
democrats were dooming themselves to defeat in the march election 
he was booed as he warned if we make this decision and the 
party splits the people will not have a democratic option in the 
presidential election 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena defeated 
the christian democrats last month in legislative and municipal 
elections putting arena in a good position to win the presidential 
election 
arenas detractors accuse it of being authoritarian the party 
rejects the charge likening its ideology to that of the us 
republicans 
arena will choose its presidential candidate in september 
when rey prendes a wealthy businessman and fulltime 
politician mounted the podium to accept the nomination most of 
those who had supported postponement walked out 
im sure that once tempers cool well all be together again 
in the struggle rey prendes told the delegates let the anger 
end today 
my arms are open there is no need to exclude anyone he 
said in what was taken as a reference to chavez mena 
but guillermo guevara lacayo a political committee member 
predicted chavez mena would try to have the congress and convention 
annulled 
rey prendes controls most of the party bureaucracy he is a 
former minister of communications former mayor of san salvador and 
a member of the political committee he and chavez mena helped 
found the party in 1960

the labor department proposed friday making 
employers put warning tags or locks on machinery as it is being 
cleaned or serviced nine years after unions requested the 
regulation and more than 1000 deaths later as a result of its 
absence 
the proposed regulations which the occupational safety and 
health administration estimates will save 122 lives and prevent 
60000 injuries annually had languished at the white house for 
nearly a year 
their publication in the federal register on friday occurred 
just one week after senate labor committee chairman edward m 
kennedy dmass cited them in congressional hearings as an 
example of the reagan administrations decision to let workers 
die while waiting on a standard 
employers under the proposal would have to adopt uniform 
procedures to lock out or tag out switches valves or other 
controls to prevent the start up of machines while they are being 
cleaned or serviced 
osha officials estimated about 7 percent of all occupational 
fatalities and 2 per cent of accidentcaused injuries in the 
workplace occur now because such equipment is inadvertently 
restarted while someone is working on it 
this rule would mean safer working conditions for millions of 
employees in general industry assistant labor secretary and osha 
administrator john a pendergrass said friday 
very simple lockout tagout measures which take only a few 
minutes can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries 
in some major manufacturing industries pendergrass said 
the agency said the regulations will apply to some 16 million 
employers and cover an estimated 39 million workers at an estimated 
total annual cost of 135 million to businesses 
they are aimed chiefly at machine operators and laborers who 
work around packaging and wrapping equipment conveyors and 
printing presses which are associated with the highest proportion 
of the accidents osha officials said 
as an example the agency cited one worker who had leaned his 
head into a flour batch mixer and whose neck was crushed when 
another worker inadvertently turned the machine on 
the socalled performanceoriented regulations would require 
employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and 
minimize the potential for inadvertently reactivating it 
unions that began petitioning the agency for the regulations in 
1979 had wanted it to mandate as law specific procedures developed 
by the american national standards institute in 1982 
however osha said it would include the ansi standards only as 
detailed voluntary guidelines in an appendix to the 
regulations the agency noted that business groups had wanted the 
ansi standards eliminated entirely from the appendix out of fears 
that a court might later interpret them as mandatory 
john molovich a safety specialist for the united steelworkers 
union predicted employers will ignore the voluntary guidelines and 
take the cheapest way out by using cardboard warning tags 
instead of locks to prevent a machine from being turned on 
there will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment 
wont start molovich said of the proposed regulations they 
would be better off cutting it into fourinch squares and putting 
it in the outhouse 
the proposal also exempts millions of companies and workers in 
agriculture oil and gas drilling electric utilities the maritime 
industry and construction 
osha officials said protections for them will be included in 
other regulations to be proposed later 
james scully an osha official who worked on the regulations for 
more than a decade testified at the senate labor committee 
hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them 
back in 1977 
but osha took no serious action until 1979 when the united auto 
workers union reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in 
related accidents the previous five years formally asked the 
government for emergency action 
osha denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from 
other unions and scully told the senate panel that officials in 
the agency were taken off any work on them at all in 1981 and 1982 
however osha promised in 1983 to issue in 1984 what was 
published friday copies of the agencys regulatory agenda showed 
similar promises in 1984 1985 and 1986 
osha officials said friday that the proposed regulation was sent 
to the white house office of management and budget in may 1987 for 
approval but was not acted on there until last month 
the agency estimates it will be a minimum of another year before 
the regulations are actually enacted

the head of the federal agency researching 
aids drugs said friday he is basically satisfied with the job 
scientists are doing but acknowledged that some human trials have 
been delayed due to lack of money 
dr anthony s fauci director of the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases told the house subcommittee on 
human resources that about 3500 aids patients are involved in some 
30 clinical trials financed with national institutes of health 
grants 
were never satisfied but we think weve done a pretty good 
job under the circumstances fauci said under questioning from 
rep ted weiss dny the panel chairman and other committee 
members 
pressed by weiss fauci estimated that some trials of aids drugs 
that could have been started this year were delayed for a year 
pending the new budget cycle due to staff shortages 
fauci said that lack of personnel was almost exclusively the 
reason why still more experimental drugs have not yet entered 
clinical trials 
he said his institute one arm of the national institutes of 
health had requested 127 additional staff members for the current 
fiscal year but had received only 11 new slots in the budget 
approved by congress 
the dimension of the shortfall is such that you cant possibly 
meet your needs concluded weiss 
a bill passed overwhelmingly by the senate on thursday would 
authorize up to 300 new fulltime employees to work on aids at the 
nih during the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
however the level of funds actually appropriated in any budget 
hinges on recommendations from the house and senate appropriations 
subcommittees with jurisdiction over nih those panels under 
overall budgetary constraints not imposed by congressional 
budgetary rules on committees with jurisdiction over 
authorizations typically recommend lower levels 
those panels have yet to shape their recommendations on the nih 
budget for fiscal 1989

gov rose mofford filed amended 
financialdisclosure forms friday to cover transactions omitted 
from sworn documents she filed over the past 10 years and she 
apologized for what she called an honest mistake 
mrs moffords predecessor evan mecham who was impeached and 
removed by the legislature earlier this year is under criminal 
indictment on charges of omitting a 350000 campaign loan from his 
disclosure forms 
questions about mrs moffords forms had been raised a week 
earlier by an associated press story detailing discrepancies 
between her filings and other state and county records and 
attorney general bob corbin began an investigation monday 
failure to file a complete disclosure statement can be a felony 
or a misdemeanor under arizona law 
the amended forms covered land loan and partnership 
transactions omitted from earlier forms filed by mrs mofford 
i now believe that these items should have been disclosed 
earlier she said at a news conference i made an honest 
mistake 
as secretary of state for 10 years before becoming governor upon 
mechams impeachment mrs mofford was in charge of the office 
where disclosure forms are filed and she said that aspect was 
especially embarrassing 
im very sorry she said i want to emphasize that it was 
never my intent to hide anything from anybody 
asked how her position differed from that of mecham who said he 
made an honest mistake in failing to list the 350000 loan and 
had not meant to hide anything mrs mofford replied mine are 
very small amounts of money 
as recently as monday mrs mofford described reports about the 
undisclosed transactions as nitpicking 
on friday however she said was turning over 150 pages of 
documents about transactions to corbins office together with 
copies of her income tax returns 
mrs mofford declined to make her tax returns available to 
reporters but distributed some papers on all the properties loans 
and partnerships the ap had cited she also disclosed an interest 
in one additional partnership 
on the investigation of the allegations against rose mofford 
i have no comment because the matter is under investigation 
corbin said 
mrs mofford said she had decided not to list the items because 
her interest in them was linked to tr mofford whom she divorced 
in 1967 but with whom she remained on good terms with until his 
death from cancer in 1982 
she said that her former husband had given her an interest in a 
number of properties before his death and that she had paid his 
hospital bills in excess of 30000 
i have never made any profit she said i was paying my 
husbands bills 
mrs mofford and her aides acknowledged however that she had 
not listed her former husbands gifts under a reporting section 
that requires disclosure of gifts above 500 or alternatively 
listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a 
section covering amounts of more than 1000 owed to or by the 
officeholder 
its a bad judgment call i admit it im sorry i hope that i 
havent embarrassed the state she said 
mecham did not immediately return messages left at his home and 
office 
nancy puffer founder of a group mecham supporters known as 
concerned arizona voters said she saw little difference between 
mrs moffords problems and mechams especially given mrs 
moffords 10 years as head of the office that administers 
disclosure laws 
you would hope that she would know them backwards and 
forwards ms puffer said if anyone is in a position to know 
them it would be her 
it leaves a little doubt in my mind if she can handle the 
office how well prepared she is she added

the federal aviation administration ordered a 
close inspection of the upper skin of oldermodel boeing 737s last 
october because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal 
overlap warning such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression 
the twinengine aloha airlines jetliner that ripped open at 
24000 feet was among the earlymodel boeing 737s subject to the 
faa directive as well as to a series of service bulletins by boeing 
outlining the inspection programs officials said friday 
the faas concern had been raised last year because routine 
inspections turned up cracks near fasteners that join sections of 
sheet metal in three aircraft the same inspections also found 
metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some earlymodel

the soviet union has been pursuing an 
enormously expensive program of constructing huge underground

while the existence of such complexes has been known for years 
only recently have we been able to do the full analysis of the 
enormous extent of this program hundreds of meters deep with 
subways under several cities carlucci added 
to have something comparable wed have to have facilities 
where we could put every governor mayor every cabinet official 
and our whole command structure underground with subways running

move into cambridge university in 1990 
time apparently has passed the operation by 
the reason for the move from herstmonceux castle is that most

a soviet space shuttle awaiting its 
first test flight looks remarkably like a clone of its american 
predecessor but there are significant differences 
to start with the maiden launch of the russian vehicle will be 
unmanned when the us shuttle made its debut in 1981 two 
astronauts were at the controls 
other major differences the main engines of the soviet craft 
will be on the energia booster rocket instead of on the orbiter 
the soviet craft has jet engines that allow it greater 
maneuverability on landing and it may have an ejection escape 
capsule the soviets will not use solidfuel booster rockets like 
the one that destroyed challenger 
defense department estimates based on reconnaissance photos 
show a russian orbiter with dimensions that are within a few feet 
of the us vehicles the length is calculated at 1255 feet and 
the wingspan at 76 feet compared with 1222 feet and 78 feet 
a 1986 report of the defense intelligence agency showed 
sidebyside drawings of the nasa shuttle and the soviet copy 
outwardly they were identical down to the paint trim 
the pentagon in its 1987 report on soviet military power said 
soviet orbiter development has been heavily dependent on us 
orbiter propulsion computer materials and airframe design 
technology 
by using us technology and designs the report said the 
soviets were able to produce an orbiter years earlier and at far 
less cost than if they had depended on their own technology money 
and scientific expertise could thus be diverted to other areas 
alexander i dunayev head of the soviet space agency 
glavkosmos said recently the russian shuttle would be launched 
in the nearest future 
we are now working quite energetically on testing on land on 
the surface of the components he told a news conference in 
moscow we are working literally around the clock 
dunayev said the flight would be unmanned and computerized 
nasas decision to fly its first shuttle with a crew reflected 
the confidence of the agencys design engineers that the orbiter 
would work the first time but only if there were humans aboard 
flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required 
extensive alterations in the flight computer software so that the 
automatic pilot would respond to radio beacons along the route 
with the program running three years behind schedule and with 
financial pressures rising nasa opted for a manned mission 
spacecraft in the earlier mercury gemini and apollo programs 
underwent extensive unmanned testing before man was committed to 
fly them 
the soviet shuttle will be boosted by the new energia 
superbooster which can hoist a 220000pound payload into orbit 
equaling the power of americas huge saturn 5 rocket that was 
scrapped after the apollo moonlanding program 
the huge rocket passed its first testlaunching last may but 
some small problems will have to be overcome on one or two more 
launchings before it can carry the shuttle 
energia has a central core fueled by hydrogen and four strapon 
liquidfuel rockets either the shuttle or an unmanned cargo vessel 
can be carried piggyback on the rocket 
the us shuttle has three main hydrogen engines that are part 
of the vehicle they ignite at liftoff along with two solidfuel 
rockets a faulty solidfuel rocket joint was blamed for the 
explosion that destroyed challenger and killed its seven crew 
members jan 28 1986 
a disadvantage of the soviet design is that the engines are not 
reuseable because they are jettisoned after liftoff while nasa 
uses shuttle engines repeatedly an advantage of the design is that 
it permits the orbiter to lift more cargo about 66000 pounds 
compared with about 55000 for the us shuttle and it provides 
for installation of landing engines 
after descending from space the american shuttle must fly a 
steep highspeed final approach as a powerless glider if it ever 
completed its reentry without enough energy to reach the runway or 
were forced into an unsatisfactory final approach because of 
crosswinds or other factors the crew would have to crashland the 
vehicle 
the jet engines of the soviet craft would enable it to make its 
final approach at a safer shallower angle it would also allow 
more maneuvering flexibility in the event of a misalignment with 
the runway and permit a second goaround attempt if the first is 
unsatisfactory 
nasa considered the use of jet engines for landing but cost and 
technical tradeoffs early in the program forced abandonment of the 
idea 
although there is no evidence in soviet liturature jim oberg a 
houston aerospace engineer and longtime observer of the russian 
space program believes the soviet orbiter may have a blowaway 
escape capsule 
the us shuttle columbia was fitted with two ejection seats 
like those on jet fighter planes for its first four test flights 
but those missions had only twoman crews and when the number of 
astronauts per flight rose to as many as eight it was not possible 
to provide escape systems for each the existing two were then 
dropped 
when american shuttle flights resume later this year the 
vehicles will be equipped with a system that would allow the crew 
members to bail out if the spacecraft were making a bad landing 
approach and had to be ditched the system includes a rapid blowout 
hatch and a telescoping pole that would enable the astronauts to 
slide past the potential hazard of striking the wing and then 
parachute to safety the system would not help in a challengerlike 
explosion 
the defense department says the russians also are developing a 
small twoman reuseable spaceplane for swift access to orbit at 
least five subscale models have been tested in orbit and the full 
craft is expected to make its first test flight about 1990 it 
would be boosted by a slx16 rocket smaller than energia now 
undergoing testing 
in its assessment of soviet military power the pentagon said 
this craft could be used for among other things reconnaissance 
missions satellite repairs and maintenance crew transport space 
station defense and satellite inspection

tabatha foster is organ transplantations 
endearing wonder child the first person in the world to survive 
half a year with virtually all new insides 
and shes not just surviving but making her presence felt 
the 3yearold recipient of a recordsetting five transplant 
organs ignores doctors and nurses after they do something she 
dislikes shows her displeasure by pitching her pampers to the 
floor and yanks out her intravenous tubes when her mother steps 
out of sight 
she throws tantrums when shes not lifted out of bed as soon as 
she demands and resists being undressed by stiffening her arms 
shes not keen about trying different kinds of blended food and 
when she does always spits out the peas 
shes been spoiled since the day she came into the world a 
lot of her bad habits are going to have to be broken said 
tabathas mother sandra foster 
still mrs foster and doctors agree that trait is whats kept 
her her spunk her stubbornness 
the 36pound pigtailed toddler from madisonville ky had most 
of her abdomen replaced in experimental surgery at childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh in the 15hour operation that ended nov 1 
she received a new liver small intestine and pancreas and parts of 
a stomach and colon 
similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the 
world both times unsuccessfully 
a multiple transplant has since been done at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in chicago the 
10monthold patient michael steward of rockford ill is 
reported in good condition he received a new liver small 
intestine pancreas and part of a stomach feb 9 
despite her feistiness tabathas recovery has been far from 
smooth shes been beset during the past six months by a series of 
liver problems a threatening virus and a mysterious threehour 
lapse of consciousness 
her latest setback a buildup of bile in her liver prompted 
doctors in midapril to insert a drainage tube and downgrade her 
condition from fair to serious 
as many small things go wrong you have to be worried but i 
think on the whole these two cases certainly indicate the 
feasibility of the whole thing said dr thomas e starzl 
director of transplant surgery at childrens hospital and 
affiliated presbyterianuniversity hospital 
theyre cuttingedge cases and im sure there will be more 
three days after tabatha was born doctors removed 95 percent of 
her small bowel because of a potentially fatal intestinal 
deformity she was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet 
which damaged her liver 
doctors at childrens hospital determined it would be easier to 
replace the entire fiveorgan group than just tabathas liver and 
small intestine the hospitals human rights committee granted 
permission oct 23 for the risky surgery on humanitarian grounds 
there was no protocol established for this type of 
procedure said hospital spokeswoman lynn mcmahon the 
statistics worldwide for people who had undergone similar 
operations were not very encouraging 
the fosters needed only a day to make up their minds 
we really didnt have much of a choice said mrs foster 
29 i had seen the downfalls at home and she bounced back from 
them shes been on death row so many times and i just knew that 
wed made it this far theres no sense giving up 
on oct 31 tabatha went into surgery to receive the organs of a 
7weekold virginia girl who had died in an auto accident she 
emerged from the operating room the next day with glowing healthy 
skin previously yellowed by her malfunctioning liver 
she hadnt been like that for years said her father roy 
foster 36 who has two children from a previous marriage 
now too she can consume solid food baby cereal vegetables 
and fruits and yogurt in addition to the liquid diet she receives 
intravenously and through a stomach tube 
confined to a hospital all but seven weeks of her life tabatha 
rather likes the attention there according to her parents 
mrs foster spends virtually every minute with tabatha often 
sleeping in a pullout vinyl chair in the childs private room her 
husband comes up as much as his job allows 
i think she enjoys being at the nurses station more than she 
does being in the playroom foster said 
the feeling is mutual 
of any kid ive met in or out of this hospital i think shes 
an exceptional child shes so pleasant so lovable said roz 
peck 23 a registered nurse who regularly surprises tabatha with 
presents i want her to go home but someone said today what 
are you going to do when she leaves nurses arent the only ones 
who have been touched by tabathas tale 
the fosters quietspoken factory workers have been overwhelmed 
by gifts sent to their daughter enough toys to fill 19 big boxes 
two boxes worth of cards including notes and drawings from 
schoolchildren two teddy bears were so huge they had to be sent 
home by bus 
its a shock to me i just thought wed get the transplant and 
that would be it mrs foster said its a funny thing 
everybody knows you and you dont know them 
whats even more astounding to the couple is the 355000 in 
donations they have received to help cover tabathas medical 
expenses contributors include president reagan frank sinatra 
geraldo rivera and the rock group earth wind and fire 
about 40 percent of the money has come from black churches 
throughout the country according to joseph k williams iii a 
pittsburgh attorney who is serving as trustee of the tabatha foster 
fund tabatha is black 
we feel that its the job of the human race to get behind 
tabatha and to support her in her endeavor said the rev gerald 
chapman chairman of the pennsylvania state baptist associations 
fundraising drive for tabatha 
williams estimates more than 350000 still is owed the hospital 
and bills keep mounting but officials have indicated the hospital 
likely will absorb any unpaid costs since the operation was 
experimental and therefore uninsurable 
the fosters dont expect tabatha to be discharged as an 
outpatient much before her fourth birthday on june 10 they realize 
their worries about infection and organ rejection wont vanish once 
theyre all back home 
its a touchandgo situation mrs foster said and its 
going to be that way for the rest of tabathas life

one notyetpublished book about the mark 
hofmann forgery murders has been sold to television and another to 
film but that doesnt bother authors linda sillitoe and allen 
roberts 
they believe their own volume salamander the story of the 
mormon forgery murders is the one that will be read by the 
mormon community which hofmann betrayed 
the mormon murders a true story of greed forgery deceit and 
death by steven naifeh and gregory white smith and published by 
weidenfeld and nicolson is scheduled for august release it has 
been sold to cbs as a possible miniseries 
a gathering of saints a true story of money murder and 
deceit by robert lindsey has a september publishing date film 
rights were purchased by 20th century fox 
roberts a writer and architect was a friend of hofmanns first 
victim a fellow history buff sillitoe was a newspaper reporter 
who used roberts as a source early in the hofmann story 
their collaboration began as an effort to explain hofmann to the 
mormons two years and 556 pages later signature books of salt 
lake city is seeking to beat two new york publishers out of a 
share of the national market 
i think both of us were motivated by a need to know and to 
communicate with our own subculture roberts said but they 
decided later to write for nonmormon readers as well 
for six years that unstructured mormon subculture of about 3000 
scholars writers artists and historians had been dazzled and 
intrigued by hofmanns finds of supposedly historical documents 
that forced a sometimes painful reexamination of mormon origins 
the enigmatic hofmanns success gave him ready access to the 
high church officials numbered among his most avid customers he 
had begun to forge lucrative american historical and literary 
documents when under pressure to produce promised documents that 
didnt exist he turned to murder to cover his tracks 
his first bomb on oct 15 1985 killed a young mormon bishop 
steve christensen who had bought and donated hofmanns most famous 
creation the socalled salamander letter to the church 
the salamander letter was purported to have been written by 
martin harris an early associate of church founder joseph smith 
it gives an account of smiths finding of gold plates from which 
he said he translated the book of mormon which is contrary to 
the official church version the letter said an old spirit 
directed smith to the plates then transformed itself into a white 
salamander the official church version has it that an angel named 
moroni directed smith to the plates in 1827 
a second bomb intended to divert suspicion from hofmann killed 
kathy sheets wife of a former christensen business partner 
but a third bomb the next day which hofmann called a suicide 
device seriously injured its maker and exposed him as the likely 
killer fifteen months later in a controversial pretrial plea 
bargain hofmann admitted his guilt detailed his forgeries and was 
sentenced to five years to life in prison 
hofmann was such an equal opportunity ripoff artist 
because he took everybody for what they were worth said 
sillitoe who quit her job at the deseret news in order to work on 
the book 
its not just that he exploited the mormon churchs secrecy 
or the paranoia that people criticize but he also exploited the 
faith and the values and the trust and the belief whatever people 
had to give he exploited she said 
but salamander is not merely an indictment of a master 
manipulator and forger the authors sought in their interviews with 
some 200 sources to explain who and what had shaped a man for whom 
deceit was the means and the end 
i think he had a double difficulty roberts said his 
parentage was firstgeneration german and very authoritarian and 
then you add to that the fact they were orthodox conservative 
mormons which carres another layer of authoritarianism 
an inquisitive boy hofmann couldnt raise questions in that 
environment roberts said thus he was a secret agnostic while 
serving a mission for the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints and more than a decade later fooled a lie detector about 
the bombings 
he comes right out of the heart of the culture in every way 
sillitoe said and thats what was so fascinating to me about the 
story is that everything fed into it the history the theology 
the polygamy everything and youve got it right there on the 
doorstep of the church office building 
the authors sought to interview hofmann 33 at utah state 
prison where the state board of pardons recently told him he will 
spend the rest of his life but the inmate refused 
sillitoe and roberts were somewhat more successful with three 
church leaders who figured in the hofmann story they provided 
written answers to a dozen typed questions their reticence was 
understandable hofmann had cast them as he had friends and 
family in the role of dupe 
i think there was a strong instinct to protect the 
institution said sillitoe who regrets that the hofmann case 
seems to have invigorated the faiths traditional 
antiintellectual segment 
for signature books salamander is unique the company 
founded in 1981 to publish mormonrelated works produced just six 
titles in 1987 and never has spent more than 15000 to promote any 
one book 
the robertssillitoe work has up to 100000 in advertising a 
publicist has been hired the authors are touring and there is a 
first printing of 15000 copies more than double signatures

daniel j travanti no longer the 
tightlipped furillo of hill street blues is entering a new 
phase in his campaign to breach that mythical mystical 
invisible barrier that separates television from movie actors 
travanti can be seen in theaters this month in midnight 
crossing a mystery thriller from vestron pictures he plays the 
husband of faye dunaway who is blinded with glaucoma and both 
embark on a caribbean yacht cruise that becomes enmeshed in stolen 
treasure and murder 
travanti discussed his life after hill street blues at his 
pacific palisades home where his neighbors are john forsythe and 
arnold schwarzenegger the series has obviously provided travanti 
with prosperity but it also left him with a new challenge 
the problem for many actors he said is that mystical 
mythical barrier that you have to cross through a misty field 
youre on this side of it and youre called a television actor 
or youre called a theater actor on the other side is the cinema 
motion pictures feature films 
somehow they see you coming and they dont want you to cross 
over i dont know why nobody has been able to explain it they 
used to say people dont want to pay to see someone when they can 
see him free thats all changed 
and so you face that strange phenomenon of crossing over that 
foggy field and coming out the other side and becoming a movie 
actor it has nothing to do with ability necessarily or how you 
look or how you sound some make it and some dont 
since i finished the series last year ive done what i wished 
i could do i went from midnight crossing to a play i never 
sang for my father which had a successful sixmonth tour and now 
im doing another movie with kris kristofferson and cheryl ladd 
millennium so by summer i will have done two feature films and a 
successful play tour and my next television appearance will be an 
american playhouse version of the play in june 
the actor doesnt worry about escaping the persona of frank 
furillo 
i did that in the first season of hill street blues he 
said by playing totally different characters in television 
movies adam and a case of libel and i also played edward r 
murrow on television 
not all of the characters have been straightarrow like the 
captain the guy i played in a matter of libel was complex 
the guy in midnight crossing is maybe a lesscontrolled 
cousin of that fellow so to speak ed murrow one of the heroes of 
our time was also a complicated man though we couldnt show much 
of that in a twohour movie 
daniel j travanti is a late bloomer as an actor 
i charged through college university of wisconsin in three 
years with phi beta kappa and every other honor i knocked my 
brains out i dont know what i was rushing toward no matter 
how fast i ran it turned out i couldnt get there any faster than 
i was supposed to 
in new york it all screeched to a crawl he said many 
actors who are told they are talented in school or regional 
theaters get to new york city and get stonewalled not frozen 
out i worked all the time i was just so confused and so neurotic 
that i drove myself crazy and i drove others around me crazy 
for a long time i limped along and bumped along and hiccupped 
along i always made a living this fall will mark 25 years as an 
actor never having to work as anything else the big turning point 
came 15 years ago when i found sobriety he said referring to 
his alcoholism 
i dont want to belabor that because i dont want it to be an 
overpowering identity of mine but i am willing to mention it and 
talk about it privately 
since then its been a matter of patiently trudging chugging 
moving steadily along and hoping for a break

yugoslavs are at a crossroads and 
the way they turn could mean profound changes in the route josip 
broz tito mapped out for them when he founded the communist state 
after world war ii 
the road yugoslavia takes is likely to depend on the outcome of 
a fierce public struggle between communist party hardliners and 
reformers demanding changes including marketoriented economic 
policies pluralistic politics and greater links with western 
europe 
but right now political disarray is paralyzing decisionmaking 
at a time of deep economic crisis the worst ever in yugoslavias 
postwar history 
the nation is grappling with an inflation rate of 170 percent 
europes highest and a 20 billion foreign debt 
living standards for a people once well off by east european 
standards have declined by a third since 1980 and about 11 million 
people about 15 percent of the work force are looking for jobs 
the outcome of the clash between hardliners and reformers could 
have deep meaning not only for 232 million yugoslavs but also for 
other east european nations some of which face similar but less 
pressing decisions in the era of reform laid down by general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev in the soviet union 
yugoslavia is officially a nonaligned nation that functions 
independently of moscows east bloc and has closer links to the 
west than the soviet allies 
hardliners here are contending that reformers demands would 
mean a restoration of capitalism in yugoslavia although the 
reformers say they remain socialists 
dobrica cosic a reformer and former prominent communist who is 
now yugoslavias bestselling author has described the country as 
a gravely ill balkan patient with an uncertain future 
the fate of yugoslavia will be decided in a struggle between 
repressive and conservative authorities who will use all 
available means to defend the existing regime and forces that 
strive for an enlightened civilized pluralistic socialism for a 
modern society and democratic yugoslavia he was quoted by the 
official news agency tanjug as telling a group of serbian writers 
cosic did not specify what he meant by all available means 
but many yugoslavs took him to mean the use of police or even 
military repression to keep public criticism and dissent from 
spreading 
cosic a world war ii partisan who was purged from the communist 
partys central committee in the late 1960s spoke at a serbian 
writers meeting during which proposals were made for amending the 
constitution adopted in 1974 while tito was alive and the nations 
sole leader 
the constitution granted wide autonomy to the countrys six 
often fractious republics and two provinces 
the document is generally blamed for the todays problems it 
created a virtual confederation in which each constituent region 
has power to veto important decisions the result is endless 
arguments and deadlocks on key issues even the nations presidency 
is rotated among the regions 
according to tanjug cosic maintained that the existing system 
is only a semblance of a socialist society in reality it is a 
state of organized chaos which has antagonized our peoples and 
republics and which has caused our economy to slide into total 
unprofitability 
a joint statement by unions of serbian writers philosophers and 
sociologists adopted at the meeting called for an end to the 
communist partys monopoly in yugoslavia a oneparty state like 
other east european countries 
recently a number of leading intellectuals in serbia the 
largest republic and slovenia the most economically developed 
region called on the communist party to permit some degree of 
political pluralism as one way of overcoming economic and political 
problems 
it was the first time that official groups had issued any 
written statement of that kind 
the staterun press and communist party officials assailed the 
intellectuals statement and cosics speech charging that they 
represent an attempt to subvert the government 
the authorities reacted even more sharply to criticism in 
slovenias media of the army and the state security service 
a number of articles published in the slovenian press 
particularly in the liberal youth periodical mladina had denounced 
the army as an undemocratic prosoviet institution prepared to 
stage a military coup 
defense minister branko mamula and several highranking military 
officials had previously voiced concern about what they saw as a 
deterioration in the economic and political situations 
the communist leadership responded to the attacks on the army 
and security forces with sharp warnings against such criticism and 
called for legal action against it 
the official reaction culminated in early april when a 
parliamentary commission responsible for state security denounced 
the critical articles as part of an international conspiracy to 
overthrow the government 
jelena lovric a prominent political columnist for danas widely 
considered the most liberal staterun periodical rejected that 
official claim 
she said the real danger for the government stemmed from the 
domestically triggered economic crisis and that the claim of 
foreignbacked conspiracies is creating chaos and sowing fear 
among the already frightened populace 
are such panicky assertions about antisocialist conspiracies 
not in fact aimed at creating the conditions for use of all 
available measures she wrote in a commentary apparently 
alluding to cosics remarks 
at a recent meeting milan kucan leader of the more liberal 
slovenian communist party contended that yugoslavias 
unvanquished crisis is jeopardizing the countrys communist 
system 
changes radical ones are more than necessary tanjug 
quoted kucan as saying 
communists in slovenia have been the most outspoken in offering 
unorthodox proposals for the countrys problems including a more 
marketoriented economy and closer ties with western europe 
in april slovenias parliament began a procedure to force 
premier branko mikulics federal government out of office on 
grounds that its economic policies were ineffective the action was 
the first of its kind in postwar yugoslavia 
communist party officials in other yugoslav republics maintained 
that the slovenian legislative action would mean a return of 
capitalism 
responing in an interview to that contention slovenias 
presidentelect janez stanovnik said those who follow events 
in slovenia from the outside see enemies and counterrevolutionaries 
everywhere while we here are feeling the enthusiasm of a 
democratic reform

when two bankers were gunned down in a 1983 
ambush on an abandoned southwest minnesota farm some speculated 
that bitterness about the farm crisis was behind the violence 
but a new book contends that a conspiracy between a failed dairy 
farmer whose marriage had crumbled and his militaristic teenage 
son not the rural economic crisis triggered the killings 
i look at the killings as being the final outcome of a broken 
family and broken identities said joseph amato 49 the books 
author and a history professor at southwest state university in 
marshall 
when father and son conspire a minnesota farm murder 
concentrates on the relationship between james jenkins and his 
18yearold son steven and discounts the farm crisis of the 1980s 
as a major factor in the murders 
amato said in an interview that he became intrigued by the case 
because it just seemed to be very peculiar that a father and son 
would get together and ambush a man his journalistic account of 
the killings took 2 years to research and write 
published in march by iowa state university press the 226page 
book is now in a second printing of 3000 copies after selling out 
a first run of 2500 according to neelum chaudhry the publishers 
advertising and publicity manager 
as former director of southwest states rural studies program 
amato said he was familiar with the problems facing farmers he 
also knew the terror that swept the minnesota prairie the night of 
the killings 
doors that hadnt been locked in memory were locked people 
who really didnt like neighbors slept over at their house that 
night he said 
on the morning of sept 29 1983 rudolph blythe jr and deems 
toby thulin were shot to death on a 10acre abandoned dairy 
farm near the small town of ruthton in the southwest corner of 
minnesota 
blythe was president of buffalo ridge state bank in ruthton 
which had taken over the farm abandoned by james jenkins in 1980 
thulin was blythes chief loan officer the two were lured to the 
deserted farm by a telephone caller who said he was interested in 
the property 
two men were seen fleeing the farm in a white pickup truck and 
a search began for james jenkins and his son three days later 
steven jenkins surrendered to authorities in paducah texas he led 
authorities to an abandoned farm where his 46yearold father was 
found dead of a shotgun blast the death was ruled a suicide by 
texas authorities 
amato portrays the two men as frustrated by lost dreams working 
each other into a rage 
the elder jenkins marriage had recently collapsed and he had 
declared bankruptcy amato speculates that the younger jenkins a 
high school dropout was upset that a spleen injury suffered in an 
accident might end his dream of joining the military 
this father worked this son up and this son either used his 
father or exploited his father amato said he maintains that 
tension between the two men was the cause of the killings i 
think this father brought out the aggression in the son 
for the two amato said the crime may have been the last lie 
they shared together and the lie was ill have a farm and youll 
be a soldier 
amato argues that the farm crisis played a minor role he notes 
that james jenkins failed as a farmer in 1980 several years before 
the farm crisis reached its peak though a hard worker and clever 
handyman amato said the elder jenkins failed when just about 
anyone would have made it farming 
amatos theories differ markedly from those of a previous book 
on the killings 
final harvest an american tragedy published in 1986 links 
the killings to the farm crisis that books author andrew h 
malcolm of the new york times declined to comment on amatos book 
steven jenkins mother darlene abraham and sister michele 
schewe issued a statement about the book 
mr amato did a fairly credible job of gathering the facts 
available along with opinions and misinformation and weaving them 
into a story to support his greek tragedy 
in the conspiracy chapter he tells us in detail and depth of 
steven and james innermost thoughts and feelings how can an 
accurate description of either be possible when hes never met nor 
spoken to the father or the son we strongly disagree with the 
portrayal of steve steve is innocent 
steven jenkins himself declined to be interviewed about the book 
amato speculates that james jenkins lured the banker to the farm 
to either kidnap or terrorize him the bank president and his loan 
officer apparently surprised the father and son by arriving earlier 
than expected 
according to the prosecutions scenario at steven jenkins 1984 
trial the teenager fired his m1 carbine at thulin killing the 
loan officer then chased blythe across the yard and cut him down 
with a second volley 
the prosecution argued that steven jenkins who liked 
marinetype haircuts camouflage fatigues and tattoos was the 
triggerman the younger jenkins was obsessed with guns explosives 
and the military and slept with the murder weapon in his room his 
father was unfamiliar with guns had poor eyesight and wasnt fit 
enough to have chased blythe the prosecution contended 
a lincoln county jury agreed that steven jenkins pulled the 
trigger he was convicted of first and seconddegree murder and 
sentenced to life in prison he becomes eligible for parole in 
2001 when he will be 36

with just a touchup here and there 
necessity could be a fine satire on the madefortv movie genre 
necessity stars loni anderson as a model named lauren 
lasalle who is living an idyllic life with husband and darling baby 
girl when suddenly after several years of marriage she realizes 
that her husband is a cocaine dealer 
apparently she has never asked why he has a helicopter and 
several hit men hanging around their fabulous upstate new york 
house 
while this woman is clearly no mental giant she does figure out 
how to swipe 2 million of hubbys drug money establish a new 
identity in california and launder the funds through stock market 
transactions 
but necessity does intend to be taken seriously just to 
double check cbs calls it a drama of shattered illusions 
luckily for those involved the movie airs tuesday night cbs 
black hole of ratings so no one neither friends nor colleagues 
nor relatives nor anyone else for that matter need ever know 
back to lauren who once ensconced in los angeles takes flying 
lessons is she going to forget the kid and start a new life as a 
commercial airline pilot no way shes going to go back to new 
york and swoop down and pluck her child from the evil influences of 
her husband who is busy obsessing in artful double exposures about 
the wrong she has done him 
which brings us to the subject of bizarre casting 
james naughton who plays the deseanddose drug dealing 
husband most recently starred in paul newmans film of the glass 
menagerie no flies on him 
john heard who plays charlie the lovable flying instructor 
can currently be seen in robert redfords film the milagro 
beanfield war 
both are fine stage actors are their agents telling them they 
better grab this turkey while they can since they might never work 
again a really dumb madefortv movie starring loni anderson 
sure sign us up 
well maybe at least they thought it was a satire 
anyway charlie must tell lauren who is quite good at 
highspeed car chases that shes nevertheless just too darn dumb 
to operate an airplane 
since charlie has a kid of his own and can use 50000 he 
agrees to pilot the babynapping plane himself 
the getaway goes awry of course so lauren slaps baby in a car 
seat and takes off on a highspeed truckhelicopter chase through 
the hills and vales lauren apparently believes it is better to 
risk babys neck stuntdriving over brushy cliffs and mowing down 
fences than leave her to grow up on daddys drug money 
all this setup is just so wonderfully kitsch its hard to 
believe the ending is even better in fact its so good its 
worth taping just for the slowmo dialogue and 12 gunshots pumped 
into a victim who stands up and grabs his shoulder 
this is serious isnt it

ancient custom permits one woman in kenya 
to take another as a wife but a divorce case involving two 
such women has thrown up a challenge to kenyas westernstyle legal 
system 
the case involves wanjiru gutu a barren widow who 10 years ago 
took mary njeri macharia as a wife to bear her the children she 
desperately wanted 
the relationship went sour and the women have asked a 
westernstyle divorce court to sort out their broken marriage 
including the question of alimony child support and property 
settlement 
we dont have a precedent for this case said paul mberi 
ms macharias lawyer 
the problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in 
the courts is changing to the western legal system but at the same 
time in the village we are living with people whose arrangements 
are based on customary law concepts 
marriage between women is not uncommon in kenya and neither is 
divorce 
but this case is unique because the couple has turned to western 
laws instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders 
decide the issue 
barren women such as ms gutu often take one or more fertile 
women as wives to bear children which the female husband 
then claims as her own even married women make such arrangements 
with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his 
spouses wife 
barren women often are ostracized in africa where wealth and 
prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has 
since both ms macharia and ms gutu were single ms macharia 
was entitled to choose the man to father the children 
for the surrogate mother such an arrangement offers the 
security of a home and income 
ms macharia in her late 20s was a single mother of two 
children aged 12 and 10 when she married ms gutu and took her 
surname she brought them to ms gutus home and had two more 
children now 7 and 5 
after a fierce quarrel in january 1986 ms gutu chased her 
wife from their matrimonial home in the western kenyan town of 
nakuru according to court records 
before turning to the westernstyle courts ms macharia twice 
went to a court of tribal elders asking for alimony and child 
support or a share of ms gutus property including a small 
grocery store 
ms gutu about 60 complained that ms macharia beat her 
threatened her life and stole from the business 
both times the elders ruled that ms macharia could keep the 
children but should receive nothing else 
this was not a hardship in the past as the woman would go 
back to her father and his community which jointly owned and 
shared land and resources explained gibson kamau kuria a 
nairobi lawyer who specializes in family law 
ms macharia did return to her father a peasant farmer near 
nakuru but when she felt that she and the children were a burden 
she sued her former husband for divorce in the district 
magistrates court again demanding alimony and child support or a 
share of ms gutus property 
she filed suit in august 1986 but the case has been delayed by 
a backlog and is expected to be heard soon 
ms gutu had told the tribal courts ms macharia had no money or 
property when they married and that the relationsip gave her 
status and a comfortable lifestyle 
odhiambo ochieng ms gutus lawyer argues in an affidavit 
that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law only 
a traditional solution is possible for ms macharia to return to 
her fathers family with nothing 
kenyas very diversity is at the root of the nowbudding legal 
problems 
the east african nations 22 million people are divided among 
dozens of ethnic groups who abide by islamic hindu and various 
tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory western laws 
inherited from british colonizers at independence 25 years ago 
a case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer sm 
otieno against his luo clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow 
or the tribe should bury him the high court ruled that in the 
absence of written law customary law prevails 
otienos widow lost 
these problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go 
away until kenya is lived in by an overall younger and more modern 
generation ochieng said

a 199yearold proposed constitutional amendment that would 
delay pay raises that members of congress give themselves until 
voters have a say is being spurred toward washington by a college 
student who says hes tired of the sneaky way the pay hikes now 
come about 
the amendment has been approved by 23 state legislatures asked 
what will happen if the required threefourths majority of states 
ratify it a congressional researcher replied i dont know 
its a sleeper said west virginia legislator david 
mckinley who this year added his state to the roll call of those 
ratifying the amendment georgia also approved it in 1988 
the amendment first proposed in 1789 by the framers of the 
constitution as part of a 12amendment bill of rights states no 
law varying the compensation for the services of the senators and 
representatives shall take effect until an election of 
representatives shall have intervened 
by 1791 six states had ratified it maryland north carolina 
south carolina delaware vermont and virginia the bandwagon 
stalled until 1873 when congress bestowed on itself a whopping 
raise and ohio ratified the amendment wyoming approved it 1978 
then in 1982 along came gregory watson a university of texas 
student who was researching a term paper on the death of the equal 
rights amendment when he was sidetracked by this little book that 
said five or six amendments never had been ratified 
in the dustbin with the congressional pay proposal were 
amendments allowing slavery prohibiting us citizens from 
accepting titles of nobility and outlawing child labor 
with the december 1981 fiasco still fresh in my mind when 
congress gave itself a special tax break which no other american 
would enjoy i thought gregory why dont you try to get this 
ratified 
watson mailed letters to state legislators in maine thenstate 
sen melvin shute wrote back 
the next year shute introduced a resolution ratifying the 1789 
amendment boom it passed watson said 
excited by success in maine watson sent more letters and found 
more legislators willing to propose resolutions backing the 
amendment 
colorado joined in 1984 followed by south dakota new 
hampshire arizona tennessee and oklahoma in 1985 new mexico 
indiana and utah ratified in 1986 and montana connecticut and 
wisconsin in 1987 when congress gave itself two pay raises 
ratification resolutions have been introduced in every state but 
arkansas watson said 
i think the average american feels the way i do watson 
said you shouldnt begrudge a member of congress from getting a 
fair wage what i object to is the sneaky tricky cutesy way they 
hide these raises 
he referred to last years maneuvering in which the senate and 
then the house made token votes refusing 12100 pay raises and 
then pocketed the money consumer advocates attacked house speaker 
jim wright dtexas for delaying the vote until its results no 
longer mattered 
congress had already given itself a 3 percent increase last 
year to compensate for inflation members of congress now make 
89500 
i think people are disgusted with the congress said georgia 
state sen paul coverdell who helped ratify the amendment in his 
state this year greg watson has made an obsession out of 
rectifying the situation 
not everyone feels so strongly 
even james madison who made the pay stricture part of his 
proposed bill of rights argued for it somewhat halfheartedly 
possibly a reason why it isnt among the 10 amendments that became 
the bill of rights 
i do not believe this is a power which in the ordinary course 
of government will be abused madison said but there is a 
seeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without control to 
put their hands in the public coffers 
west virginia legislator james humphries calling the resolution 
frivolous tried to kill it in committee 
its as moldy as 6monthold bread he contended 
kansas state rep robert h miller has refused to let the 
resolution out of his federal and state affairs committee 
we consider tinkering with the us constitution pretty 
serious stuff im not going to do it based on the word of some guy 
from texas said miller who called the amendment a nonissue 
opposition to the amendment is fueled by selfinterest said 
georgias coverdell before this years success his attempts to 
achieve ratification were blocked in committee for three years 
i guess the committee members all hoped to be in congress 
he said 
nonetheless he said its like apple pie and motherhood 
nobody was willing to oppose it but i can tell you i got no 
support 
what happens if watsons amendment wins ratification in the 
required 38 states and gets to washington 
i dont know said david huckabee a congressional research 
service analyst but the amendment which has no deadline is bound 
to be a sore spot he said 
if congress chooses to not accept the ratification because 
its so old theres a question of whether you could get enough 
legal footing to get it into court its possible that the courts 
might not want to enter into the fray huckabee said 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva backs the issue 
but i have some question as to whether the courts would uphold 
such an old amendment since some of the ratifications are so 
ancient 
if need be byrd said he will reintroduce the measure to 
ensure courts uphold it 
rep robert lagomarsino rcalif is trying to do just that in 
the house but his amendment remains in the house judiciary 
committee said his aide john doherty 
i think its basically selfinterest doherty said of the 
opposition its amazing how little support there is for this 
but nobody publicly opposes it 
rep william ford dmich who chaired the house committee 
endorsing the last raise and who was quoted as saying the raise was 
too damn little remains silent on the amendment 
im not certain if he cares to say anything on this said 
his aide tom joyce 
although watson now 25 said he received a c on his term 
paper from a professor who didnt think the amendment was much of 
an issue huckabee saw a broader meaning in the students efforts 
this is quite a civics lesson he said that one person 
can make a difference

when joseph pulitzer jr was an 
undergraduate at harvard university in 1935 he bought a striking 
painting by modigliani beginning an extraordinary collection of 
modern art 
the collection grew to more than 250 paintings drawings and 
sculptures in the ensuing halfcentury pulitzer recently returned 
to harvard for the opening of an exhibit featuring 86 of his those 
works 
more than 40 artists are represented in the exhibit which will 
be at harvards fogg museum until june 12 when it moves to the 
saint louis art museum in missouri from july 8 through aug 28 
there are perhaps only three or four museums in the country 
who could put together from their own collections a display to 
match the depth and breadth of this one said edgar peters 
bowron director of the harvard university art museums 
included are 12 works by picasso four each by monet klee and 
miro three each by degas matisse lipchitz and lichtenstein and 
pieces by cezanne brancusi pollock and warhol 
i wanted to buy creative art that would have a validity and 
vitality that would transcend fashion said pulitzer whose 
grandfathers will established the pulitzer prizes in journalism 
and the arts 
i was much more interested in the living rather than going 
deeply into the past he said explaining why he chose to collect 
modern art 
a fine arts major at harvard pulitzer graduated in 1936 and 
joined the staff of the st louis postdispatch he became its 
editor and publisher and now is chairman of the pulitzer publishing 
co 
he has been generous with his purchases giving pieces to 
museums including the fogg and the saint louis art museum which 
has that first modigliani elvira resting at a table some 
remain at his home 
joe started collecting from the purest of reasons love of 
art said michael shapiro chief curator of the saint louis art 
museum 
and hes not cashing in his chips shapiro added referring 
to collectors who sell for profit 
shapiro bowron and judith weisslevy curator of prints 
drawings and photographs at the saint louis museum made the 
selections from the pulitzer collection to put in the exhibit 
it was intended to demonstrate the quality and range of the 
collection bowron said of their choices and noted that pulitzer 
also had a say 
we made the initial selection but then joe with his unerring 
eye said you must put in this one and that one bowron said 
installing the exhibit was difficult because the works were so 
varied in size media and style 
one perspective on the exhibit said shapiro is that pulitzer 
bought the modigliani four years before richard serra who has a 
painting a drawing and a sculpture in the show was born 
the collection is very much a synopsis of mainstream modernism 
and its evolving shapiro said 
in a certain sense we distilled them the selections out of 
joes distillation a summary history of modern art in europe and 
america it is a history of modern art 
the exhibit also marks the publication by the harvard university 
art museums of the fourth volume of the catalog of the pulitzer 
collection 
it was written by angelica zander rudenstine a curator and 
scholar and as a member of the visiting committee an adviser to 
harvards fine arts department 
i have said to angelica if she ever departs from her 
profession as art historian i would like to hire her for the st 
louis postdispatch as an investigative reporter pulitzer said

if current corporate earnings were the only 
determinant of trends in stock prices the market would surely be 
thriving right now 
companies in a wide variety of industries big names and small 
have lately posted strong profit gains for the first quarter 
and most analysts agree that the earning outlook remains bright 
for the balance of the year 
standard amp poors corp calculates that the several hundred 
companies included in its industrial index chalked up a 39 percent 
increase in profits last year for 1988 it estimates a further 21 
percent gain 
the earnings picture has been much stronger than would be 
suggested by the pace of overall economic growth in the united 
states which has been moderate at most 
as robert s salomon jr at the investment firm of salomon 
brothers inc observed recent costcutting and streamlining have 
produced earnings increases that have oustripped the economys 
sluggish pace 
a weak dollar has helped industrial america gain a better 
competitive position in world markets 
prominent companies like dupont and johnson amp johnson to cite 
two examples from the past few days have accompanied their latest 
reports with announcements of dividend increases 
but while the earnings trend may be causing great cheer in 
executive suites around the country it has met with a chilly 
reception on wall street where stock prices continue to drift 
around aimlessly on low volume 
the market hasnt yet rewarded positive surprises but has 
punished disappointments said melissa brown at prudentialbache 
securities 
this is hardly the first time of course that the stock market 
has been seemingly out of synch with the producing and consuming 
economy 
the question investors have to grapple with is not how earnings 
are doing now but what they will look like six months a year or 
more in the future 
just how far ahead the market in its collective vision can 
see is a matter of longstanding debate 
it can be argued that many of the gains now being posted in 
corporate profits were discounted or foreshadowed in stock 
prices during the great bull market of 198287 
in early 1987 notes standard amp poors in its advisory 
publication the outlook the sampp industrial stocks traded at prices 
as much as 23 times their current earnings 
recently the pe ratio has been running at a much more 
conservative 12 to 1 depressed by the crash last fall and more 
recent worries about rising interest rates and inflation 
even if pes merely hold at their recent levels a continued 
rise in earnings would theoretically translate into high stock 
prices 
a 20 percent increase in 1988 earnings of companies in the 
dow jones industrial average would be enough to support a dow 
industrial average of 2800 argues john dessauer in his advisory 
letter dessauers journal and there is at least the possibility 
that earnings gains this year will exceed 20 percent

karl malden says my father my son is the 
story of a closeknit family rather than a story of vietnam and the 
tragedy of agent orange 
malden plays adm elmo r zumwalt jr who ordered the use of 
the chemical defoliant agent orange to cler the jungle away from 
vietnams rivers to protect navy patrol boats keith carradine 
plays his son elmo r zumwalt iii a former patrol boat skipper 
who believes his cancer was caused by the defoliant 
i think what youre going to see is a terrific family love 
story said malden ive never seen a family so tight 
the twohour film is based on the book the zumwalts wrote about 
their experiences the movie which cbs will televise sunday may 
22 was shot in georgia 
its a fascinating story said malden when the admiral 
was assigned to vietnam his son wanted to go too and when the 
admiral gets there he realizes the viet cong are knocking off the 
boat crews left and right because the jungle goes right down to the 
river it was giving them protection 
the admiral heard they were using agent orange in missouri and 
kansas to kill weeds on some farms he looked into it and then 
ordered its use the irony is that his son was captain of one of 
those little river boats and his son was the only one on his boat 
to get sick 
elmo iii was afflicted with two kinds of cancer lymphoma and 
hodgkins disease which both zumwalts believe was caused by agent 
orange he has undergone chemotherapy radiation and bone marrow 
transplants 
the admiral did some investigating later and found the 
government had led him astray about agent orange said malden 
the government knew there was a higher rate of cancer in those 
areas where it was used as a defoliant and withheld the 
information 
in addition the younger zumwalt has a son with a learning 
disability 
elmo and his wife came with their two children when we were 
shooting the boat scenes said malden they built a little 
village in the swamp the boy was so excited i was in uniform and 
wearing the admirals name badge elmo told his son whos about 10 
or 12 this is grandpa 
all that day i was grandpa to the boy and he kept kissing me 
on the boat going back he sat next to me his affection was so 
touching i had to look the other way i think the admiral feels 
hes the cause of elmos and the boys problem i think he feels 
guilty 
this was not maldens first military role he played gen omar 
bradley in patton he was in winged victory the army air 
corps stage show in world war ii that was also filmed as a movie 
after the war i was in every kind of war movie he said 
i was a private a corporal and i was the good sergeant to 
richard widmarks tough sergeant in take the high ground 
malden who had made his movie debut before the war won an 
oscar as best supporting actor for a streetcar named desire 
three years later he teamed up with marlon brando again for on 
the waterfront 
most recently he costarred in the barbra streisand movie 
nuts 
malden wellknown to television audiences for his 15 years as 
spokesman for american express travelers checks played lt mike 
stone in the tv series streets of san francisco his costar 
michael douglas just won an academy award as best actor for wall 
street maldens only other series was skag in which he 
played a steel mill worker that was a role he played in real life 
in his hometown of gary ind before he became an actor 
my father was an amateur actor in europe and after he came to 
this country he organized 30 church choirs he said he was 
president for six years of the serbian singing society of the us 
and canada he was a milkman and did that when he had time off 
i decided to become an actor because i wasnt getting anywhere 
in the mills i had friends at the art institute in chicago and 
decided to go there when i told my father he said are you crazy 
you want to give up a good job in the middle of the depression 
thank god for my mother she said to give it a try

in a victory for brazils left 
lawmakers rewriting brazils authoritarian constitution have voted 
overwhelmingly to limit mineral mining to domestic companies 
the thursday night vote came on the heels of a wednesday vote to 
give special protections to certain domesticallyowned enterprises 
a move that foreign businessmen indicated may discourage the influx 
of foreign capital to brazils beleaguered economy 
legislators doubling as a constituent assembly sang the national 
anthem thursday night after voting to prohibit foreign companies 
from mining for minerals or drilling for hydraulic energy 
the constitutional article would give foreign companies such as 
subsidiaries of british petroleum bauxite mining companies such as 
alcan and alcoa and south africas angloamerican company a 
fiveyear grace period to adapt to the new legislation 
foreignowned companies control 20 percent of mining rights or 
requests for mining rights in brazil private domestic companies 
own 52 percent and staterun companies own 18 percent 
also on thursday legislators voted 303156 to maintain present 
legislation allowing foreign participation in petroleum 
distribution 
a radical proposal that was rejected would have barred royal 
dutch shell atlantic richfield texaco and exxon from selling 
gasoline in brazil foreign companies now hold 55 percent of the 
market here 
the thursday votes followed wednesdays equally radical 
decisions making it harder and less inviting for foreign companies 
to operate in brazil in a bipartisan agreement lawmakers voted 
to define what constitutes a brazilian company and a 
domesticcapital brazilian company 
the key distinction is that domesticcapital companies will 
enjoy as yetundetermined protection and special benefits and 
will be allowed to develop the also yetundetermined strategic or 
essential areas of the economy 
legislators decided that a domesticcapital company must have a 
majority of its voting capital and its decisionmaking power 
belonging permanently to residents of this country a brazilian 
company would be simply any company established under brazilian law 
the congress is expected to finish brazils eighth constitution 
late this year 
rep sandra cavalcanti of the conservative liberal front party 
said the new laws prevent multinationals from being considered 
national that is brazilian concerns 
its not fair that say a general motors has the right and 
the access to brazilian savings she said this way they can 
come in but with their own investments and own foreign savings 
but the new statutes were widely considered nationalistic and 
the initial reaction of foreign businessmen was negative 
the red flag is up for foreign capital said christopher 
lund president of the sao paulo american chamber of commerce in a 
telephone interview it is unfortunate because they made it more 
difficult to do business in brazil 
lund a businessman who has lived in brazil since 1962 said the 
law will be harmful to the brazilian economy by limiting the vital 
influx of foreign capital 
brazil is strapped with a huge foreign debt of 121 billion 
inflation of over 16 percent monthly and one of the worlds most 
unequal distributions of wealth about twothirds of the nations 
143 million people earn less than 40 a week 
brazilians have the right to change their own laws but if 
their true objective is to change the life of millions of 
brazilians you first have to have an economy that will generate 
wealth said lund you cant do that by limiting foreign 
capital 
wolfgang sauer a west germanborn naturalized brazilian who is 
president of autolatina the local holding group for ford and 
volkswagen said discrimination will not resolve the economic 
problems of this country

us and japanese officials have reported no 
progress after a third day of meetings to break a deadlock over 
lowering japanese trade barriers against american beef and oranges 
they agreed to meet again today but no one on the us 
delegation was optimistic about the outcome said gary holmes 
spokesman for the chief american negotiator trade representative 
clayton yeutter 
the differences between the two sides have not been 
narrowed said hidero maki spokesman and economic affairs chief 
for agriculture minister takashi sato japans negotiator the 
negotiations are going to take longer than anticipated maki told 
reporters thursday 
adding to the gloom us treasury secretary james a baker told 
a gathering of washington visitors chances are not as bright as 
id like to see that japan will further open its market to beef 
and oranges 
baker repeated warnings that the us government will try to 
have the japanese import quotas declared illegal under the rules of 
gatt the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states had been requesting that japan end the quotas 
that the two countries agreed to in a fouryear pact that expired 
at the end of march with the collapse of an earlier round of 
satoyeutter negotiations 
us officials said ending the quotas was still the demand they 
declined to comment on japanese reports that a compromise was under 
discussion 
the talks have been centering on the timing of 
liberalization of imports into japan said japanese embassy 
spokesman toshiyuki takano 
according to maki four specific topics are covered in the 
negotiations 
they are improvement of access to the japanese market future 
role of japans livestock industry promotion corporation the 
semigovernment body that now handles 80 percent of beef imports 
interim measures pending liberalization and measures to follow 
lifting of the quotas he said

duke power co has tentatively agreed to 
operate the troubled rancho seco nuclear plant in california 
company officials said 
the deal is dependent on approval by sacramento voters to 
restart the troubled facility idled since an emergency shutdown in 
december 1985 said bill lee dukes chairman and chief executive 
officer 
if the sacramento voters approve we are confident that we can 
operate rancho seco in a safe and efficient manner lee said in 
announcing the agreement thursday at the companys annual meeting 
in charlotte 
competition is increasing and the shackles of regulation seem 
to be loosening in some quarters lee told shareholders there 
is risk but also great opportunity 
three of dukes seven nuclear units have the same babcock amp 
wilcox co reactor design as the rancho seco plant 
details of the agreement in principle with the sacramento 
municipal utility district were not disclosed 
lee said operating rancho seco about 25 miles south of 
sacramento would enable the charlottebased utility to diversify 
and market its engineering and technical services and thus 
increase diversified earnings 
a negotiating team headed by doug booth dukes president and 
chief operating officer met for several hours wednesday in 
charlotte with richard byrne smuds genera manager and other smud 
officials to discuss an operating arrangement duke officials said 
the plant currently is the object of two competing local 
initiatives on june 7 in california and one offered by smud and 
supported by duke would authorize an 18month test operating 
period the other would close the plant permanently 
ed smeloff one of smuds five directors attended dukes annual 
meeting and accused duke of interfering with smuds internal 
affairs and meddling with the ballot measure 
smeloff criticized duke for contributing 100000 to the 
campaign to keep the plant running and pleaded with shareholders 
please let us make that decision ourselves 
in a subsequent interview smeloff said i dont have a 
problem with duke wanting to come out and run a plant efficiently 
i dont have a problem with duke wanting to make some money in 
sacramento my problem is the integrity of the sacramento political 
process 
duke abandoned its interest in owning the plant after it failed 
to find a california partner 
but lee in an interview thursday said we think were doing 
whats in our interests and the interests of those consumers 
the plant hasnt run well he conceded but they have 
invested 1 billion in it the incremental cost of running it now 
that theyve already got that investment is very little and lower 
than any other source of electricity in california

trade talks ended in deadlock friday 
between taiwan and the united states and officials of the island 
toughened their stand on further liberalizing its import and export 
policies 
we had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action 
plan us trade assistant peter allgeier who heads the us 
delegation said at the end of a fourday negotiation session 
unfortunately we have fallen short of that ambitious goal 
he said 
the taiwan delegation refused to reduce tariffs on 60 
agricultural products or to lift import bans on peanuts poultry 
and animal organs 
another us request to renew a fiveyear bilateral agreement 
next year that limits taiwans rice exports was also rejected 
taiwan called for scrapping a 1986 agreement that allows local 
magazines to advertize american cigarettes claiming it promotes 
smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco growers us 
officials rejected the request 
we would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural 
products because we did not protect our farmers more than your 
country did said vice economic minister wang chienshien who 
heads the taiwan delegation 
taiwan officials however promised to review later a us 
proposal for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help 
reduce taiwans massive trade surplus with the united states which 
totaled 16 billion last year 
hundreds of farmers protested in the capital taipei earlier in 
the week exhorting the government to resist any us demands the 
farmers claimed taiwans earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other 
agricultural products have already hurt their livelihoods 
taiwan reduced tariffs on 3500 foreign products in february 
including 480 agricultural items import duties dropped to an 
average rate of 226 percent from 35 percent 
in the latest talks taiwanese negotiators agreed to take 
measures to curb what the americans called the rampant infringement 
of us intellectual property rights but differed with their us 
counterparts on major details 
taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of us 
works require the permission of their authors but opposed making 
the agreement retroactive 
the discussion of a bilateral copyright agreement was very 
disappointing allgeier said taiwans positions are 
outofstep with more positive trends elsewhere in the region 
he said us companies lose tens of millions of us dollars 
every year because of pirated us works in taiwan 
taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original us 
copyrighted works published after 1975 but pirated books are still 
available at many book stores that agreement does not extend to 
translations 
taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent or 
copyright protection to us semiconductor products 
taiwan however refused to allow american banks to set up 
branches outside of taipei or ease restrictions on their credit 
services 
we know the modernization of our financial businesses can help 
with our economic development but this has to be taken step by 
step wang said 
officials said more negotiation sessions will be held in june 
and august to settle these differences

a federal judge has ruled that usg corp can use 
a poison pill strategy in defending itself against desert 
partners lps hostile 16 billion takeover bid 
us district judge james f holderman refused thursday to grant 
a preliminary injunction sought by desert partners against the use 
of the defensive tactic 
usgs poison pill would make it prohibitively expensive for 
desert partners to acquire an 85 percent stake in the company even 
if shareholders tendered the 39 million shares the texasbased 
partnership is seeking 
under the plan usg shareholders would have the right to buy a 
new series of preferred stock if suitors like desert partners 
acquire more than 20 percent of usg stock 
holderman said he based his decision on the corporate laws of 
delaware where many major companies are incorporated 
once the board decides to maintain the companys independence 
delaware law does not require a board of directors to put their 
company on the auction block or assist a potential acquirer to 
formulate an adequate takeover bid holderman said 
usg chairman robert j day said he was pleased with the decision 
desert partners headed up by two texas oilmen says it has 
lined up financing commitments totaling 19 billion including a 
14 billion bank facility and 500 million in subordinated debt 
desert partners has offered 42 a share in cash for up to 39 
million usg shares in addition they would offer about 600 
million in debt securities and warrants or rights to buy stock 
also valued at 42 each for the balance of the deal 
desert partners now owns 99 percent of usg shares

opecs president is interested in either visiting 
texas or sending representatives to learn better ways of monitoring 
the cartels oil production texas railroad commissioner kent hance 
says 
in a telephone interview thursday with the houston post from 
vienna austria hance said he met for about 90 minutes with 
rilwanu lukman opec president and oil minister of nigeria 
we discussed the monitoring procedures we use at the 
commission to know what everyone is producing hance was quoted 
as saying he expressed interest in coming to texas or at least 
sending some of his staff to see how we do that 
the texas railroad commission regulates oil production in the 
state which was devastated economically by a collapse in world oil 
prices two years ago 
alleged quota cheating by some members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has been blamed for the current 
global oil glut and the weak prices members of the cartel have 
been meeting with nonmember nations in vienna to discuss ways to 
stabilize prices 
hance did not participate in the meetings but came to hold 
private talks with participants his presence received widespread 
attention and incited speculation of a possible strategic 
relationship between opec and texas which would be the cartels 
fourthlargest oil producer if it were a member 
nonopec producers attending the meeting have suggested both 
opec and nonopec oil producers agree to 5 percent oil production 
cuts in order to boost prices 
theyve never really asked about texas making cuts hance 
said but i told them we could not would not consider making 
cuts because we consume more than we produce 
earlier this week hance said he saw his mission as opening a 
dialogue with the cartel 
were not in love with opec but we need to have input into 
decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the 
worlds oil supplies he said 
i look at whats happened to our texas economy since oil 
prices crashed in 1986 he said no one else is going to be 
speaking up for the state of texas and someone had to do 
something

corning glass works the nations leading 
maker of cookware said friday it has signed a definitive agreement 
to purchase revere ware inc the secondlargest manufacturer of 
rangetop cookware 
corning said the acquisition would be made in cash but 
spokesman eugene saunders would not comment on a report that the 
price was 120 million 
revere ware a clinton illbased maker of stainless steel and 
copper cookware is a subsidiary of the privately held revere 
copper and brass inc founded by paul revere in 1801 
the sale was very good for our company revere ware 
president peter cameron said friday from his illinois office the 
two companies are very well alligned theres little redundancy 
about a quarter of cornings 21 billion in annual revenue 
comes from consumer products made of glass or glassceramics sold 
under the pyrex corning ware visions and corelle trademarks

the acquisition to be completed by the end of june would add 
more than 10 percent to cornings consumer products sales the 
companys consumer products division reported sales of 5479 
million in 1987 
corning chairman james r houghton said the acquisition offers 
us a strong brand name and a business that complements our own 
affording us added value in the consumer marketplace 
he said the deal will not dilute earnings in the first 12 months 
of operation and after that period would be a contributor to 
earnings 
we know that revere will substantially strengthen cornings 
position in department stores and that corning can significantly 
broaden reveres position in other markets houghton said 
in addition to consumer housewares corning manufactures 
automobile pollution control devices fiber optics and specialty 
glass and ceramics it also operates a network of clinical testing 
labs

compared to other periods over the past two 
decades these are dull days in the marketplace 
there are no new issues on the economic front says a report 
from data resources inc supplier of economic numbers and 
projections to government and industry 
about the only thing new it says is that the allegedy 
overextended recovery is simply one month older next month it 
seems to suggest the news is likely to be that the recovery is 
older by still another month 
everyone is watching for a rise or fall of interest rates but 
the rates dont respond inflation seems to be safely tucked away 
for the moment at least the dollar has stopped moving the stock 
market seems tired of it all 
congress and the white house arent doing much to stir things 
since it is well known that any brief period of calm can be 
destroyed by one illtimed proposal or careless comment besides 
its an election year 
even the trade bill once thought of as landmark legislation 
isnt likely to make a very big difference in the economy the 
consumer seems neither very bullish nor bearish investors hang 
around the sidelines quiet pervades 
every now and then there is an attempt to produce a little 
action a report hints at inflation but the next one buries the 
thought interest rates jiggle higher but then fall back almost 
all the way 
concern develops that the expansion is turning into boom or 
bust but the latest gross national product figures neutralize the 
fears showing that growth is in the noninflationary 
nonrecessionary range of 25 percent and steady 
such intervals have been rare in the past and usually brief 
and always have preceded movements one way or the other this 
knowledge is a factor in the current quiet it makes investors 
observers waiting for cues to develop 
consider the contrast with the 1970s when prices interest 
rates and most other economic elements were out of whack people 
knew then that prices and interest rates would continue to soar so 
a wild enthusiasm was generated 
real estate hucksters appeared everywhere selling desert land 
swamp land and land that wasnt even theirs to people who bought 
from a brochure and then went looking for it later 
getrichquick seminars roamed the country with financial 
evangelists mesmerizing folks with tales of how they were down out 
and broke a few years ago but how they just ordinary folks like 
you learned to make a fortune 
believing them ordinary folks went out and borrowed big amounts 
of money and invested it mainly in real estate certain that they 
could repay the bank with cheaper dollars while their assets soared 
in value for many it was true 
tax shelters were the rage you might recall your neighbor 
bragging about how much in taxes he saved by getting into cattle 
feeding and you knew that it didnt turn out the way he said it 
would when he never spoke about it again 
its very much different now nobody knows which way the economy 
is going to head the big dreams have been tucked away for another 
day and if there is any prevailing mood it is probably one of 
bearishness 
battered by the oct 19 crash last years outspoken stock 
market bulls morosely search for bearings smallinvestor 
conventions once footstomping revivals for folks who dreamed of 
quick fortunes in coins gold and odd stocks are now like prayer 
meetings 
everyone waits for the economy to make a move one way or 
another knowing that whenever it does there will be action again 
and plenty of those ingenious creative oldfashioned and often 
exploitive opportunities

northwest airlines said today it has reached 
a tentative fouryear contract agreement covering its 10000 
mechanics and ground service employees 
the company also signed a contract today with the union 
representing 6700 flight attendants the union announced earlier 
today that its members had ratified the tentative agreement 
the agreement with the international association of machinists 
district lodge 143 unifies three contracts covering former republic 
airlines workers and northwest workers the two minneapolisbased 
airlines merged in 1986 
terry erskine the airlines vice president of law and labor 
relations said the agreement was reached thursday night after two 
weeks of negotiations 
the agreement will bring former republic workers to parity with 
their northwest counterparts by increasing wages an average of 20 
percent for rampservice employees and 13 percent for mechanics and 
related personnel erskine said 
guy cook president and general chairman of iam district lodge 
143 announced the tentative agreement from atlanta at the same 
time erskine made the announcement at a news conference in eagan 
it was not immediately known whether the union was recommending 
approval or rejection of the contract 
erskine said the ratification process will begin next week and 
take a month or six weeks to complete 
in addition to equalizing wages the proposed agreement would 
include an average pay increase of about 32 percent a year for all 
employees covered by the contract 
erskine said the agreement also unifies work rules pensions and 
benefits all modeled after the northwest mechanics contract 
the proposed contract also includes a 5year newhire pay scale 
with entry level wages 17 percent lower than current rates for 
unskilled and semiskilled jobs 
the tentative contract agreement with the flight attendants was 
reached on march 22 ending a strike threatened for march 29 
suzanne balzer a spokeswoman for teamsters local 2747 said 
this morning that 61 percent or 2854 attendants approved the 
contract which 1829 or 39 percent voted against 
were pleased that it was that strong a for vote 
considering the group of people who were trying to run a no 
vote campaign ms balzer said 
a simple majority of the attendants voting was needed to ratify 
6646 were eligible to vote 
the teamsters bargaining committee passed the contract proposal 
to union members without recommending approval or rejection union 
officials had said they expected it to be ratified 
the pact would take effect june 1 and expire dec 31 1992 but 
would not be retroactive to the contract starting date of jan 1 
1987 
the pact merges two labor agreements to provide common wages 
fringe benefits and work rules for all flight attendants 
under one section of the proposal flight attendants who worked 
for the minneapolisbased republic airlines before it merged with 
northwest in 1986 will receive pay raises averaging 18 percent 
effective june 1 this will raise them to the highest wage rates of 
original northwest attendants

a sweeping law to protect investors took effect 
friday in britain but the new rules are so cumbersome that 
thousands of financial firms failed to get approval to stay in 
business and needed temporary reprieves 
widely criticized by the british securities industry the 
government granted interim approval to about 7000 firms until they 
could complete the complex paperwork and reporting requirements 
imposed by the law 
about 30000 other firms obtained approval prior to the deadline 
friday dubbed a day short for appointed day the first day 
that key provisions of the financial services act of 1986 were 
enforced 
people are working very hard to get as many people through the 
hoop as quickly as possible said robin dix spokesman for the 
securities and investments board which is responsible for 
enforcing the new law 
it was passed in response to the socalled big bang 
deregulation of october 1986 which liberalized britains stodgy 
securities practices and was designed to make london the worlds 
leading financial center 
while the liberalization boosted britains securities industry 
into a 43 billionayear business lawmakers and consumer groups 
lobbied for the new law to guard against unethical practices that 
victimize investors 
under the new law the securities and investments board oversees 
five selfregulatory organizations responsible for policing the 
financial markets and enforcing provisions that ensure firms have 
enough capital to operate 
brokers and investment professionals operating without 
authorization face criminal sanctions ranging from fines to 
imprisonment 
the new law also requires investment advisers to become more 
knowledgeable about client finances investment goals and 
willingness to take risk 
many in the industry have complained that the new system is a 
hodgepodge of regulations that are difficult to understand 
expensive to enforce and a threat to britains international 
attractiveness as a securities market 
some say the enforcement cost will run into the hundreds of 
millions of dollars and drive business elsewhere 
we think that is a very real fear said robin hutton 
director general of the british merchant banking and securities 
houses association he also claimed the law would not be as 
effective as many of its supporters believe 
it is wrong to think that the new measures will prevent fraud 
and do what the politicians want which is to catch crooks more 
quickly hutton said 
but some consumer advocates claim the regulations dont go far 
enough and fear the cost will be passed to investors some have 
complained because provisions for compensating customers who have 
lost money through the collapse of firms wont go into effect for 
months 
what were saying to investors is dont be lulled into a 
sense of security said helena wiesner a research manager at 
britains consumers association 
under britains financial deregulation brokers were allowed to 
make markets in stocks an activity previously restricted to firms 
called jobbers the deregulation also abolished minimum commissions 
and allowed banks to enter the securities business 
but less than two months afterward several embarrasing 
securities scandals surfaced inciting criticism that londons 
financial district was not properly policed the biggest scandal by 
far has involved stock manipulation allegations surrounding brewery 
giant guinness plc

japan called friday for raising the 
asian development banks capital but faced opposition from the 
united states in what appeared to be a struggle for influence over 
the financial institution 
in a speech to 1500 bankers and finance officials from 47 
countries bank of japan gov satoshi sumita said his country wants 
to recycle up to 30 billion in trade surplus funds one way is by 
increasing its stock in the 21yearold development bank sumita 
said 
he said the bank established to hasten economic development of 
poor asiapacific countries has to expand technical assistance to 
developing countries and increase loans not only to governments but 
also to private businesses to reduce poverty in the region 
if adb is to respond to these issues and to achieve growth it 
is imperative that the banks own financial base be strengthened 
for it is upon this foundation that all operations rest he said 
and i believe that a general capital increase is urgently 
needed 
the bank currently has an authorized capital of 228 billion 
sumita told the annual meeting of the banks board of governors 
that japan wants to increase its share in the banks capital from 
15 percent at present to at least 1641 percent and i hope the 
governors will give this request their favorable consideration 
he added 
but m peter mcpherson deputy us treasury secretary opposed 
any capital increase saying financially the bank remains in 
excellent shape 
at this time my government does not foresee agreement on a 
general capital increase before early 1990 and clearly our 
position on these negotiations will be much influenced by our 
perceptions of the banks plans for using its resources he said 
sources at the bank who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
japan is trying to expand its influence over the bank by increasing 
its shareholdings and thus have the most votes at a time when the 
united states is faced with budgetary difficulties and cutting back 
on expenses 
the bank set up in 1966 is owned and controlled by the 
governments of 18 developed states and 29 developing asian and 
pacific countries policy is formulated by the board of governors 
which meets every year and is composed of the 47 membercountries 
finance ministers or central bank chiefs 
the banks annual report for 1987 shows that japan had a slight 
edge over the united states controlling 15 percent of total shares 
and 124 percent of total voting power against 147 percent and 
122 percent for the united states

news about the nations trade outlook 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed at 
18022 off 22 points or 01 percent

161 billion from 132 billion pounds or 248 billion in 
february 
private economists had expected a deficit of 11 billion pounds

figures but the main institutions didnt buy with any 
followthrough said one equity salesman adding that when wall 
street opened lower it added pressure to the london market 
around midafternoon share prices continued their slump after

soybean futures prices rallied in the last hour 
of trading to close sharply higher friday on the chicago board of 
trade grain futures were mixed 
no single factor sparked the runup in soybean futures but 
revised weather forecasts predicting less rain in the corn belt 
than previous reports played a role said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
government estimates for a low carryover of us soybean stocks 
into the next marketing year have put the market on edge 
lespinasse said 
the soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather because 
if we dont have a good crop this year theyre going to cut that 
carryover down to the bone he said 
overall support stemmed from persistently bullish underlying 
fundamental and technical factors he said 
first and foremost youve got to remember that were in a 
bull market and in a bull market prices go up lespinasse said 
wheat futures closed mixed while corn futures finished slightly 
higher 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 304 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents higher with may at 202 a bushel oats were cent to 1 
cents lower with may at 159 a bushel soybeans were 11 cents to

financier robert holmes a court whose 
fortune dwindled from billions to millions in octobers market 
crash sold most of his stake in his bell group ltd business 
empire friday 
two investor groups said they paid a total of 333 million 
australian dollars or about 253 million for a nearly 40 percent 
interest in bell group which has interests in a variety of 
industries 
the sale reduced holmes a courts stake in bell group which 
controls 43 percent of bell resources ltd to about 3 percent 
the announcement ended days of speculation about the future of 
the oncefeared corporate raider and also tolled the end of an era 
in australian business 
holmes a court who at the peak of his success was one of 
australias wealthiest men earning an estimated 43 every second 
is reported to have become tired of corporate life particularly in 
the wake of the stock market crash 
the companies he controlled lost about 380 million the biggest 
corporate loss in australian history due to investment writedowns 
in the wake of the global market collapse 
under the deal announced friday the western australian state 
government insurance commission and alan bond a brewing and media 
magnate who won the americas cup in 1983 each purchased 199 
percent stakes in bell group 
the commission said it paid the equivalent of 190 a share for 
its stake or about 122 million bond who made his purchase 
through bond corp paid 205 a share or about 1315 million 
both parties said they regarded their holdings as investments 
only and noted that they did not collaborate in purchasing bell 
shares 
sgic chairman wyvern rees said the government authority would 
not interfere with bell groups management 
holmes a court is expected to remain chairman and chief 
executive of bell group said peter mitchell bond corps 
executive director 
calling holmes a courts decision to sell most of his bell group 
holdings undoubtedly difficult mitchell said bond corp was 
satisfied with its investment and had no plans to try to acquire 
the rest of the company 
since the market crash holmes a court has been selling assets to 
help ease his cash crunch bell group and bell resources have sold 
off assets valued at about 342 billion 
in november holmes a court sold bells 123 percent stake in 
us oil giant texaco inc to takeover strategist carl c icahn for 
7955 million taking an esimtated 96 million loss on the 
transaction 
earlier that month he also sold a 25 percent stake in broken 
hill proprietary co australias largest company to other 
interests for nearly 200 million he sold some of his properties 
in perth for about 140 million 
broken hill which has major interests in the united states 
south america and elsewhere had been threatened in recent years by 
bell resources which amassed an 11 percent stake in the company 
through several takeover bids mitchell said bond corp approved of 
bell groups asset sales so far but did not want the company to 
divest its west australian newspapers ltd 
bond corp owns one of australias three commerical national 
television networks its stake in bell group could raise questions 
as to whether bond corp is in violation of the governments media 
crossownership laws which limit the size of investments in 
television and newspaper concerns in the same city 
separately holmes a court dropped his plan to merge bell group 
with bell resources giving way to a pair of corporate raiders 
bidding for bell resources 
bell resources a mining and investment concern is the subject 
of a 684 million takeover bid by sir ronald brierleys industrial 
equity ltd and kerry packers consolidated press holdings ltd 
the merger proposal was seen by many analysts as a move to 
simplify holmes a courts corporate structure after the october 
stock market crash to put togther bell resources cash and 
investments with bell groups industrial operations and therefore 
to reduce bell groups heavy borrowings

those reports followed word tuesday that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product expanded at a healthy 23 
percent annual rate in the first three months of the year it was a 
far better performance than the recession many had expected in the 
aftermath of the 508point stock market plunge last october 
the big worry at the beginning of the year was that a 
recession would derail the republicans but the leading indicator 
is just one more sign that this isnt going to occur said david 
wyss an economist with data resources inc 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co called the 
string of upbeat reports terrific news on the future state of the 
economy 
from the point of view of the administration the news on the 
economy could hardly be better he said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the advances in the leading index were significant and good news 
they suggest that the economy remains on a steady course and that a 
healthy climate for prosperity will continue 
the unexpectedly strong growth has raised some fears that 
inflation may become a problem forcing the federal reserve board 
to hike interest rates in an effort to cool off demand 
but analysts said that while they expect both inflation and 
interest rates to pick up modestly in the next six months they 
dont expect either to increase so quickly that they will raise 
voters concerns 
the strong economy will be more of an ally to republicans than 
a rise in inflation and interest rates will be an adversary said 
donald straszheim chief economist of merrill lynch 
straszheim said he did not look for interest rates to increase 
by more than onehalf to one full percentage point between now and 
election day which he called too small of an increase to be 
worrisome to voters 
the february rise in the leading index hd initially been 
reported as a smaller 09 percent gain with the revision it is 
now the strongest monthly increase since a 22 percent rise in 
december 1986 
the february and march strength represented a significant 
turnaround in the forecasting gauge which is composed of 11 
forwardpointing business barometers designed to predict economic 
activity six to nine months into the future 
following the market collapse the index posted three 
consecutive monthly declines in october november and december the 
traditional signal of an impending recession however with the 
latest revisions two of those declines have now been eliminated 
although a 12 percent drop in november and a 07 percent fall in 
january remain 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group said the 
initial declines exaggerated the economys weakness but he 
cautioned against getting too optimistic based on the big february 
and march advances in the index 
the economy is still growing we wont have a recession this 
year but we wont have a boom either he said 
the march increase in the index reflected widespread strength as 
six of the nine available indicators showed gains 
the biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices followed by a 
drop in weekly unemployment claims 
the government said thursday that weekly unemployment claims had 
dipped to their lowest level in almost 15 years fueling 
speculation that the april unemployment report due out next 
friday will show the jobless rate declining to 55 percent it 
fell to a nineyear low of 56 percent in march 
other barometers showing strength last month were a slowdown in 
delivery times for businesses an indication of rising demand an 
increase in building permits faster growth of the nations money 
supply and an increase in raw materials prices which the index 
views as a positive sign that demand for these products is 
increasing 
three indicators held the index back the biggest negative 
factor was a drop in the length of the average work week followed 
by declines in orders for plant and equipment and demand for 
consumer goods 
analysts said the drop in the work week should be viewed as a 
positive sign that employers are adding more workers to their 
payrolls rather than trying to get by with a smaller workforce and 
more overtime 
the various changes left the index at 1933 percent of its 1967 
base of 100

pan am corp and the parent of northwest airlines on friday 
reported losses for the first quarter which they blamed on higher 
costs 
new yorkbased pan am the eighthlargest airline said its 
first quarter net loss narrowed to 833 million from 936 million 
a year earlier 
revenue jumped 18 percent to 9008 million from 7631 million 
in the first three months of 1987 
st paulbased nwa inc which operates northwest said it had a 
first quarter net loss of 435 million widened from a loss of 35 
million in the first three months of 1987 
the loss occurred despite an increase in firstquarter revenue 
to 124 billion from 117 billion a year earlier 
pan am said an improved performance by its northeast shuttle 
service and pan am world services helped narrow its loss from a 
year earlier the air shuttle links new york boston and 
washington while pan am world services provides ground services to 
other carriers in airports around the world 
the companys main subsidiary pan american world airways 
posted an operating loss of 62 million in the first quarter 
widened from a 511 million loss a year earlier the deterioration 
was blamed on increases in the costs of fuel advertising aircraft 
rentals and other expenses 
the loss at northwest the nations fourthlargest airline was 
attributed to rising costs and a strike threat by flight 
attendants the company said its earnings also were affected by a 
10 million onetime writedown of accounts receivable from a travel 
wholesaler 
higher fuel payroll travel agent commission and maintenance 
costs combined with the threat of a flight attendant strike 
contributed to the increased operating loss said steven g 
rothmeier nwas chairman and chief executive officer 
he said that compared with the first quarter of 1987 the price 
of fuel for the airline jumped by 73 cents a gallon to 592 cents 
payroll expenses increased 74 percent to 4078 million and 
commissions paid to agents were up 221 percent to 192 million 
maintenance salaries and material expenses rose as the airline 
accelerated its overhaul of spare engines nwa said 
the company reached a tentative contract agreement with its 
6700 flight attendants on march 22 averting a strike set for 
march 29 the teamsters union local representing the attendants 
announced earlier friday that the contract had been ratified 
through a mailin vote 
pan am also said it was informed friday by its flight attendants 
union that the attendants had voted to reject a new contract 
calling for 90 million in wage cuts and other labor concessions 
the contract has been ratified by the unions representing pilots 
and flight engineers at the airline and negotiations are ongoing 
between management and the transport workers union 
the company underwent a major management shakeup in january in 
which the chairman and other top executives were replaced to 
ensure its financial recovery pan am would need labor concessions 
totaling around 540 million over three years analysts and company 
sources estimate 
the concessions agreed to by the pilots and flight engineers 
represent about 240 million over three years while the teamsters 
union has informally accepted 35 million

italys second largest bank remains committed to 
acquiring a large stake in irving bank corp but acknowledges its 
chances have dimmed given strong shareholder reception of the rival 
hostile tender offer by bank of new york 
bank of new york disclosed thursday that nearly half of irvings 
outstanding shares had been tendered so far under its 108 billion 
buyout offer of roughly 64 a share in cash and stock 
banca commerciale italiana spa which is offering to acquire a 
45 percent stake in irving for 75 a share has no immediate plans 
to raise its offer but still believes it is the better deal lino 
benassi bca deputy general manager said thursday 
irving stock fell 2 to 6062 a share thursday on the new york 
stock exchange 
we believe that our current offer is the best offer because 
we provide a lot of cash benassi said in an interview 
he also conceded i dont think our chances are extremely 
good of winning irving shareholder approval of bcas proposal 
the italian banks stock purchase is part of a complex 
restructuring proposed by irving banca commerciale also would have 
the right to buy an additional 10 percent of irving stock on the 
open market after the deal was consummated 
bank of new york which holds a 5 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings 185 million shares outstanding the tender offer which 
has been extended three times was set to expire today 
bank of new york said that at the close of business wednesday 
903 million of irvings outstanding shares had been tendered 
those along with the 888634 shares bank of new york already owns 
give it 5396 percent of irvings shares the company said 
we feel were right on track but we dont want to become 
overconfident were still engaged in a proxy fight said 
spokesman owen brady 
the bank is running a slate of 16 nominees to irvings board of 
directors the irving shareholders meeting is scheduled for may 6 
banking experts noted that the shareholders who had tendered 
their stock to bank of new york still could change their minds 
should another better proposal surface but said another offer 
appeared unlikely 
i think they bank of new york are definitely in a strong 
position they have the inside track so to speak said michael 
starr an analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
irving spokesman hal phillips said his company has no comment on 
bank of new yorks latest announcement 
irvings proposed restructuring includes the sale of assets 
such as its 50story wall street headquarters costcutting 
measures and a 10a share special cash dividend banca 
commerciale values the entire irving plan at around 6950 a share 
the banca commerciale proposal still needs regulatory approval 
from both us and italian authorities some analysts say that 
could work in bank of new yorks favor because it already has 
received conditional approval from the federal reserve and new york 
state banking boards for its merger plan 
benassi said he was confident banca commerciale would receive 
all the necessary approval although he admitted it could take a 
few months to achieve the federal reserve bank of new york 
recently noted in a fourpage internal memorandum that it would 
have to revisit the policy issues posed by the fact that 62 
percent of the italian bank is owned by the government agency 
instituto per la recostruzione industriale 
there are no clearcut policies for foreign governmentowned 
banks seeking to merge with domestic banks 
the last time the fed examined such issues was in 1982 when 
banca commerciale acquried long island trust co the fed took 15 
months to approve that application

lucky stores incs attempted escape from 
an unwanted suitor through a 22 billion leveraged buyout by a new 
york investment firm may not be the end of the takeover battle 
some analysts say 
lucky the nations sixthlargest supermarket chain said 
thursday it had agreed tentatively to go private in a cash and 
stock leveraged buyout led by gibbons green van amerongen ltd 
earlier thursday lucky again spurned friendly merger proposals 
by american stores inc of salt lake city which said it was 
prepared to acquire lucky for 60 a share american launched the 
bidding a month ago with a 45 a share tender offer that still is 
outstanding but lucky rebuffed that offer and a later proposal by 
american to pay 50 a share in a friendly merger 
i think we could easily see the bidding war continue said 
jeff siegel of pershing amp co in new york 
american officials declined to return repeated telephone calls 
on thursday 
lucky shares jumped 537 to 6150 in heavy trading thursday 
on the new york stock exchange as speculation of a bidding contest 
heated up american stores rose 112 to 6150 a share 
under the agreement with gibbons green the firm will launch a 
61 a share cash tender offer for 357 million lucky common shares 
about 92 percent of its 386 million common shares outstanding 
the remaining 29 million shares would be exchanged for 
preferred stock with a stated value of 7 each according to a 
joint announcement by the two companies 
so as a whole lucky shareholders would receive 56 a share in 
cash plus 7 in stated value of preferred stock for each of their 
lucky shares assuming the preferred stock trades at slightly less 
than its face value as analysts believe is might the entire 
package could be worth about 218 billion in cash and stock 
the buyout was conditioned on financing being obtained a 
majority of lucky shares being tendered and other conditions 
gibbons green said it expected bank financing to be committed 
shortly 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with the companys cash flow or with 
money raised by the sale of its assets 
gibbons green said it would retain current lucky management and 
employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in dublin 25 
miles east of san francisco 
we believe it lucky is the preeminent supermarket company 
in the areas of its operations said leonard green a partner in 
the firm 
analyst carol palmer of duff amp phelps in chicago questioned 
whether american stores would renew its bid although she said it 
could afford a new offer of as high as 65 a share 
but jonathan ziegler of sutro amp co inc in san francisco 
said i dont know if weve heard the last from american stores 
a merger of american stores and lucky would create the nations 
largest supermarket chain surpassing kroger co 
american stores initial offer for lucky in late march came 
about 1 years after lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by 
new york investor asher edelman by undergoing a major restructuring 
american stores the thirdlargest us operator of grocery and 
drug stores has about 1620 outlets in 40 states 
lucky employs 39000 people and has 480 outlets including 340 
stores in california

today is aday in the city of london the 
appointed day that the core of a sweeping new system for regulating 
the financial services industry takes effect touching almost 
everyone involved in the 43 billion business 
the new regulations imposed under the financial services act of 
1986 are aimed at better protecting investors 
but industry critics call the new system a confusing hodgepodge 
of vague regulations that could cost hundreds of millions of pounds 
to implement are hard to comply with and could drive business out 
of britain and into other financial centers 
we think that is a very real fear said robin hutton 
director general of the british merchant banking and securities 
houses association 
consumer advocates claim the regulations dont provide enough 
protection for investors and that their costs will be passed on to 
consumers 
while the acts major protections take effect today the 
longawaited rules are being introduced piecemeal and some have 
been postponed 
the system replaces a former combination of government 
regulation selfregulation and in some areas such as the giving 
of investment advice no regulation at all 
it plugs quite a few gaps said barbara conway a 
spokeswoman for the new regulatory system 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
criticized for its alleged laissezfaire attitude toward financial 
fraud has been trying to determine how best to protect investors 
while overseeig the financial services industry which it 
deregulated under the socalled big bang in october 1986 
the government has transferred responsibility for industry 
regulation to the 17member securities and investments board a new 
nongovernment watchdog body with statutory powers 
the board in turn has approved five selfregulatory 
organizations covering different financial services sectors which 
will authorize firms and individuals to operate these socalled 
sros will police the approved firms which will be required to 
comply with tough capitaladequacy regulations 
the rules require investment advisers to be more knowledgeable 
about their clients finances investment goals and willingness to 
take risks 
failure of firms and individuals to obtain sro authorization 
constitutes a criminal offense carrying a maximum sentence of two 
years in prison and unlimited fine 
under the big bang deregulation most of which took place oct 
27 1986 brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks an 
activity previously restricted to firms called jobbers 
deregulation also abolished minimum commissions and allowed 
banks to enter the securities business among other things 
but less than two months after big bang stock market scandals 
involving guinness plc and others broke prompting criticism that 
the city londons financial district was not being policed 
properly 
in the guinness scandal seven men including guinness former 
chairman and chief executive officer were charged after guinness 
disclosed that its former management manipulated the companys 
stock price to make a 1986 cashandstock offer for distillers co 
more attractive than a rival bid 
hutton of the industry association said it is wrong to think 
that the new measures will prevent fraud and do what the 
politicians want which is to catch crooks more quickly 
there are other gaps for example the act doesnt cover lloyds 
of london the selfregulating insurance market 
furthermore provisions for compensating clients who have lost 
money through the collapse of firms wont go into effect for months 
what were saying to investors is dont be lulled into a 
sense of security said helena wiesner a research manager at 
britains consumers association 
more than 5000 of the industrys players or more than 10 
percent have not yet obtained sro approval to operate the 
approval process was so cumbersome that sros have granted interim 
authorization to firms to meet todays deadline 
hutton said if and when we get the financial services regime 
up and runningwe should have a very advanced system of 
regulation in this country that will provide an increased measure 
of protection for investors 
how long could that take 
something like two years he said
