without bond while authorities awaited extradition papers from 
puerto rico said police sgt tom hunker 
these guys were pretty cold they admitted to killing a lot of 
people hunker said they said they were just killing insects 
not really people 
a special police squad accompanied by federal agents surrounded 
ortiz and garcia on a street here as they prepared to buy a 
silencer hunker said 
the pair had been under surveillance for some time but officers 
did not initially known how many crimes they were wanted for 
police said ortiz and garcia may have killed two members of a 
rival gang in puerto rico within the last two months

1987 shooting death of a police officer and are wanted for other 
killings hunker said 
ramon ortiz head of the police criminal investigations unit in 
ponce puerto rico said thursday that puerto rican police would ask 
the two be returned to puerto rico

these gunslingers because they are implicated in more than 10 
murders

1987 killing of ponce policeman roberto santos lopez brother of

there do it and come back 
besides talking freely with police about many of their crimes 
carlos ortiz and quinones kept puerto rican newspapers in their room 
with frontpage accounts of many slayings hunker said 
these guys are definitely some of the worst ive seen in 17 
years as a police officer here said hunker they were bragging 
they showed off their bullet holes theyre young and theyre kind 
of wild 
one of the suspects told police he started killing when his 
12yearold brother was killed during a gang war over cocaine the

there is no convincing evidence a lifesize 
statue of christ closed its eyes during a good friday church 
service according to a report issued wednesday by the roman 
catholic diocese of pittsburgh 
before and after photographs of the crucifix at holy trinity 
church in ambridge appear virtually the same said the report by a 
commission appointed by bishop donald wuerl to study the alleged 
miracle 
thousands of the faithful and the curious visited the white 
concrete church about 15 miles northwest of pittsburgh after hearing 
reports the eyes which appeared as small slits partially closed 
march 24 then returned to normal a few days later 
although no one reported seeing the lids moving witnesses said 
they were about onethird open when the plaster crucifix was 
suspended 15 feet above the altar in january during the special 
threehour prayer meeting worshipers and the churchs pastor the 
rev vincent cvitkovic said they noticed they had closed 
the commission reviewed written reports interviewed six 
witnesses and looked over other photographs taken by an independent 
agency the diocese refused to name 
although the witnesses testified to what they had perceived a 
careful examination of the photographs provided by holy trinity 
church as well as those photographs independently commissioned shows 
no convincing evidence that a miracle has occurred the report 
said 
state police trooper chris marion a holy trinity parshioner 
last month claimed he saw the eyes close briefly again as a 
television crew reenacted the good friday incident 
marion said the figure opened its eyes after he climbed a ladder 
under the crucifix during filming of nbctvs unsolved mysteries 
series 
cvitkovic later said he saw nothing of the second incident and 
told church officials nothing happened the commission did not 
investigate the second incident 
commission members said they dont doubt the sincerity of the 
witnesses interviewed but believe they could have been fooled by 
the churchs lighting and the different angles from which they 
observed the crucifix 
the commission is neither encouraging nor discouraging the belief 
the eyes closed winter said our job was to try to verify if a 
miracle occurred he said we could not 
cvitkovic remains on leave for four to six weeks of rest 
reflection and prayer said the rev paul maslach of chicago who 
heads cvitkovics order the croatian franciscans 
cvitkovic is not being punished for talking about the event 
maslach said the priest was exhausted by the work required when 
scores of worshipers began visiting the church to see the crucifix 
he said

kraft is getting ready to roll out its 
wallet now that it has tallied the number of customers who submitted 
winning entries in its botched ready to roll promotion a 
spokeswoman said wednesday 
about 21000 matched gamepiece sets were received by fridays 
deadline spokeswoman kathy knuth said including about 10000 for 
what was to have been the contests one and only grand prize a 
17000 dodge van 
we had originally estimated this alternate payout plan would 
cost 3 million to 4 million she said that is still 
accurate 
a promotional insert in june 11 newspapers in the chicago and 
houston metropolitan areas carried the right half of four game 
pieces for ready to roll 
specially marked packages of kraft cheese contained a left half 
and under the original terms of the contest matched pairs could be 
redeemed for one of 8000 packages of cheese one of 500 
skateboards one of 100 bicycles or at odds of 15millionto1 a 
1990 dodge caravan le 
kraft learned the contest was botched just hours after the sunday 
newspapers were on the streets when several hundred customers 
called to claim the van 
kraft facing the likelihood of more ready to roll winners 
than losers immediately declared the contest null and void and 
ordered the specially marked packages of cheese pulled from store 
shelves 
on june 15 the company formally called kraft general foods 
group of philip morris offered to quadruple the number of prizes 
originally offered and add cash prizes and special drawings 
the proposal came after the company entered into agreements of 
voluntary compliance with the attorneys general of illinois and 
texas 
several angry players filed classaction lawsuits despite krafts 
claims that it could not be held liable for the prizes and several 
of the winners said they would press on with the litigation despite 
krafts offer to sweeten the pot 
under the new payout plan players who matched game pieces for 
the van and submitted them by fridays deadline will receive 250 
and be eligible for a july 14 drawing in which four vans will be 
awarded 
similarly each player who matched game pieces for a bicycle will 
receive 50 skateboard winners 25 and cheese winners 5 those 
players also will be eligible for prizes in the drawings 
ms knuth said wednesday an exact breakdown was not yet 
available but that about 25 percent of the 21000 winning entries 
mailed to the company were for bicycles 20 percent for skateboards 
and 10 percent for cheese

workers replacing juneaus public pool have 
confirmed what city officials feared the lining of the 16yearold 
pool was full of holes 
the pool was losing more than 10000 gallons a day because of the 
holes formed in the aluminum lining by reaction to other metals in 
the rock and fill surrounding the tank city recreation director jim 
dumont said wednesday 
it would be like turning your garden hose on at home and 
letting it run for 24 hours dumont said 
the extra water needed to keep the covered pool full cost the 
city about 15 a day plus the expense of additional chemicals and 
heating 
the new pool will cost about 129 million dumont said the 
lining will be made of concrete 
were thinking of putting the aluminum samples in the display 
case by the assembly chambers so people can see how much damage was 
done dumont said

faced off wednesday night after dozens of homeless people were 
evicted from tompkins square park

opposed by homeless people and advocates for the homeless 
alan moss a parks department deputy commissioner was at the 
park while the eviction was carried out and said this is not 
aimed at the homeless who have been using parks it is aimed at 
getting rid of permanent structures when you see a big spike being 
driven into a tree and boards being nailed together that doesnt 
belong in a park 
he said the new rule would not stop a homeless person from 
sleeping on a park bench or on the grass 
human resources administration workers were on the scene with 
vans so that those who wanted could go to city shelters

on shipments of ostriches and told livestock producers to be on the 
alert 
bont ticks are known to transmit heartwater a disease of cattle 
sheep goats and other ruminants however glosser said the ticks 
removed from the ostriches are not known to transmit any human 
diseases 
so far there is no evidence that the ticks have spread to us 
livestock he said 
glosser said his agency is reviewing inspection methods and 
quarantine facility standards to determine if other action is needed 
to prevent additional pests from entering the united states 
he said the ostriches were in a shipment of 44 adult birds 
imported from zimbabwe on april 2 twentyfive survived and were 
released 30 days later from a privately owned usdaapproved 
quarantine facility in mundelein ill those were sent to cities in

animal health officials placed the infested premises under 
state quarantine identified all the ostriches and are treating the 
birds and soil every 14 days with a pesticide used to control 
livestock ticks glosser said 
other birds or animals that may have had contact with the 
ostriches or those immediately adjacent to the birds are being 
examined for ticks and treated he said if no ticks are found 
the state or federal veterinarian will lift the quarantine and 
continue a tick surveillance for six months 
glosser said rabbits birds steers and other sentinel 
animals are being placed on all farm premises with the adult 
ostriches to see if the ticks are still a threat to domestic 
animals agency health officials also are trapping wildlife on the 
farms to check for ticks

the beginning of the end to angolas 
14year civil war looked promising 
but less than two weeks after president jose eduardo dos santos 
and unita leader jonas savimbi sealed a ceasefire with an historic 
handshake at an african summit in neighboring zaire talks between 
the government and rebels have collapsed 
now peace seems further away than when the guns fell silent on 
june 24 
herman cohen us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs is scheduled to arrive in luanda on friday to survey the 
situation 
he said monday in south africa that he expected a final 
settlement in angola before the end of the year there have been 
some tremendously important developments in angola and i believe 
its on the right track he told a news conference 
the united states which has been providing unita with some 15 
million a year in military aid since 1985 has never recognized 
angola since it gained independence from portugal in november 1975 
although cohen is not expected to announce the establishment of 
formal diplomatic relations with angola diplomats in luanda say a 
lowlevel us representation could soon be sent to the capital 
acknowledging political difficulties between the two countries 
dos santos has said he hoped for understanding and realism from 
the united states 
we hope that now another climate has been established in 
southern africa we can draw the lines that will lead us to a 
normalization with the united states 
an angolan government delegation walked out of talks with unita 
short for the national union for the total independence of angola 
in kinshasa zaire on friday angola accused the rebels of killing 
more than a dozen people in attacks on civilian convoys and of 
sabotaging luandas power supplies in violation of the ceasefire 
signed in gbadolite zaire 
in a statement released in lisbon portugal unita said news of 
the ceasefire is taking time to trickle down to their fighters 
spread around this nation which is twice the size of france 
the rebels also insist their leader is not contemplating exile 
although savimbis reported acceptance of a temporary and 
voluntary stay abroad far from angolan politics was one 
precondition for talks stated by the angolan government 
dos santos following a meeting monday with president denis 
sassounguesso of the congo in the congolese town of pointe noire 
told reporters that the ceasefire violations must stop so a 
favorable environment is created for the reintegration of unita 
members into angolan society and institutions 
he ruled out any powersharing agreement leading to a multiparty 
system 
sources close to the government said the gbadolite summit caught 
government and rebels off guard and both sides are now unsure of 
their next moves 
speaking on angolan radio from pointe noire dos santos described 
the process that led to the gbadolite summit of 20 african heads of 
state as hurried and said it was originally scheduled for august 
president mobutu sese sekou of zaire a unita backer and 
selfappointed moderator in the angolan peace talks is believed to 
have pushed the summit forward so it would occur before his official 
visit to washington last week 
mobutu told the angolan government savimbi was ready to accept 
their peace plan a resident african diplomat said but it looks 
like a lot of things still have to be sorted out 
the diplomat dismissed as mere rumors published reports that 
the angolan government had offered unita three ministerial posts and 
four provincial governerships 
a first priority should be somehow getting their troops 
separated and a monitoring demilitarized zone set up a western 
diplomat said then theres the problem of integrating the rebels 
into the angolan armed forces since january 70 united nations 
monitors have been in angola to oversee the phased withdrawal of 
50000 cuban troops deployed in the country to help angola fight the 
guerrillas 
according to the terms of a usbrokered december 22 agreement 
signed in new york by south africa cuba and angola all the cuban 
troops are to have pulled back beyond the 13th parallel by august 1 
and are to be out of the country by mid1991 
cohen is slated to meet with angolan cuban and south african 
officials who form the commission monitoring progress of the 
agreement 
unita has been fighting the cubanand sovietaided marxist 
government since angolas independence 
shortly before his inauguration in january president bush wrote 
to savimbi pledging continued military support but western 
diplomats here say the tide could be turning 
diplomats say dos santos a 47yearold soviettrained petroleum 
engineer could face resistance to a settlement with unita from 
within his own ruling party 
rumors of coup plots have buzzed around the capital since early 
this year 
but since he succeeded agostinho neto in 1979 dos santos has 
surprised many observers by clamping down on party infighting and 
has systematically concentrated more power in the presidency while 
easing out marxist hardliners

the bush administration is supporting a rule 
allowing us airlines to use foreign repair shops but some members 
of congress are concerned safety might be compromised 
aircraft and parts manufacturers and some domestic carriers 
support the foreign repair rule which went into effect last 
december they say it promotes good trade relations enhances safety 
by making more repair facilities available and in the long run 
saves us jobs 
the rule allows us airlines to fly any of their planes to any 
country for repairs as long as the facility is certified by the 
federal aviation administration 
several foreign governments pushed for the rule change after the 
faa started to crack down on airlines that were violating a 1949 law 
prohibiting foreign repair of airliners used in domestic service 
two bills in the house would rescind the new rule and reimpose 
the former prohibitions with some exceptions for foreignmade 
planes and parts used by us airlines maintenance bases set up by 
us airlines abroad also would not be affected since they are 
regulated as domestic facilities 
i believe that allowing maintenance of us domestic aircraft 
by foreign concerns raises both problems of accountability and 
serious questions of faas ability to stay on top of a rapidly 
changing industry said rep norman mineta dcalif sponsor of a 
bill to rescind the rule 
mineta told a house public works and transportation aviation 
subcommittee hearing last week that the growth of foreign repair 
stations will tax the faas limited number of inspectors abroad 
rep mike synar dokla said the measure threatens the 
livelihood of people who work in 4000 domestic repair facilities 
its no secret that many us airlines will jump at the chance 
to lower their maintenance costs by taking advantage of low wages 
abroad said synar 
but the faa said there is no evidence this is happening 
there has been no signficant change in the way us airlines 
are having maintenance work performed by foreign repair stations 
under the new rule the agency said in a report to congress 
there is no fundamental difference between domestic and foreign 
repair stations other than geography faa associate administrator 
anthony j broderick said in congressional testimony 
broderick said the global nature of the air transportation 
industry prompted the more liberal rule he said the faa would take 
no shortcuts in certifying foreign repair facilities and would 
not certify more than it can monitor with faa inspectors 
the agency watches over 200 certified repair facilities abroad 
the domestic and foreign facilities range from small companies doing 
limited work on individual aircraft parts to large plants that do 
complete overhauls of large passenger jets and engines 
the commerce department also testified in support of the new 
rule saying the united states enjoys a large positive balance in 
repair station work done for foreign airlines in the united states 
in the view of our trading partners the proposed legislation 
is discriminatory and invites retaliatory action warned linda f 
powers deputy assistant commerce secretary 
robert peel of the association of european airlines said the 
associations 21 airline members did 29 million worth of repair 
work on usregistered airliners last year but spent 84 million at 
us repair stations 
at least two major airlines united and american have joined 
their union workers in saying they would like to see restrictions on 
foreign repairs 
among reasons given for opposing the new rule are that foreign 
mechanics are not subject to drug testing that personnel at the 
facilities would not be certified by the faa and that language 
differences would hinder communications and safety 
the lure of being able to perform routine maintenance and 
repairs for any us registered aircraft could lead to a 
proliferation of newly certified foreign repair stations and an 
expansion of many existing foreign facilities said james m 
guyette united vice president for operations 
the faa says it has received 81 applications for foreign repair 
station certification 78 of them in europe and three in the 
pacific one pacific application has been approved and 12 european 
and two other pacific stations are being considered for 
certification the faa said 
it said planned increases in foreignbased inspection personnel 
will allow full surveillance of the additional facilities if they 
are certified 
john j kerrigan of the transport workers union called the rule 
the single most important threat to the future of aviation 
maintenance in this country 
the union which represents 18000 mechanics joined american 
airlines in opposing the 1988 rule change

the price of rice is rising beyond the 
means of many in burma and shortages could provoke renewed calls for 
democratic reform in the country diplomats say 
the military government however has assured the people that 
supplies of the staple are plentiful 
last year rising prices of food particularly rice helped draw 
mass support in burma for months of protests demanding an end to 
more than a quarter century of oneparty rule and authoritarian 
repression 
the governments inability to stem price increases this year 
could once again stir open defiance of the government despite 
septembers bloody crackdown on prodemocracy protests in which 
thousands died diplomats say 
more than 10000 people attended a prodemocracy rally wednesday 
in the burmese capital of rangoon in defiance of martial law which 
prohibits gatherings of more than five people 
it was the largest protest since last years protests 
it is a constant theme for the government now to talk about 
lowering rice prices but they continue to rise a western 
diplomat said from rangoon wednesday speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
if people cannot afford the price of rice they are going to get 
unhappy and start looking for someone to blame again 
the price of rice in rangoon has doubled in the past year the 
diplomat said a 110pound bag that cost the equivalent of 44 a 
year ago now fetches at least 88 he said prices are even higher 
elsewhere in the country he said 
despite huge raises for government employees many people are 
experiencing difficulty purchasing essentials such as rice 
buying rice is a constant theme of conversation in burma the 
diplomat said 
people used to greet each other by asking what have you 
eaten well now they say what did you eat with said one 
rangoon housewife if you say you ate with your hands it means 
that you had rice if you say you used a spoon it means you had to 
make do with rice soup 
and if wage increases have done little to alleviate the problems 
diplomats warn they may spur inflation 
in a broadcast on staterun radio sunday the government blamed 
the sudden rise in rice prices on hoarding of stocks by the wealthy 
following reports of shortages they also blamed the increases on 
transportation difficulties during the monsoon season 
no one is really sure how much rice there is in the country 
that is why people are hoarding they dont know if there is going 
to be enough to get them through the monsoon season one diplomat 
said 
with dissatisfaction growing opposition groups are planning to 
rally on anniversary dates of last years bloody unrest the 
diplomats say 
right now the attitude is that if the government cant provide 
rice then it cant provide anything so what good is it one 
saidrice is really the bottom line in burma its even more 
important than press freedom or anything else like that

collegeeducated women who postponed having 
children until their 30s are getting earlier prenatal care and 
having fewer underweight babies than other mothers according to a 
government report 
four times more women aged 30 to 34 had first babies in 1986 than 
did women in the same age group in 1970 the national center for 
health statistics reported wednesday 
between 1970 and 1986 the number of first births to women 30 to 
34 increased from 42404 to 181504 the center reported for women 
35 to 39 the total first births rose from 11704 to 44427 
the increase in older firsttime mothers reflects women who have 
postponed families while completing educations and launching 
careers sociologists have reported 
among women 30 to 34 the proportion of firsttime mothers who 
have college degrees increased from 40 percent in 1975 to 48 percent 
in 1986 according to the report compiled by stephanie j ventura 
although some increase can be attributed to the overall rise in 
education among women the rate also reflects that some women are 
postponing having children the report said 
it is apparent that welleducated women have postponed 
childbearing and that they are making up for at least some of the 
delay at a growing pace ventura said 
bettereducated mothers are seeking earlier medical attention for 
themselves and their babies resulting in fewer underweight births 
according to the study trends and variations in first births to 
older women 197086 
birth weight is widely used as a measure of infant health with 
babies weighing less than 5 pounds 8 ounces considered at risk 
for women 30 to 34 the report found 75 percent of all first 
births suffered from low birth weight but among women with college 
educations the share was 58 percent 
greater educational attainment is associated with more 
timely receipt of prenatal care and a better outcome in terms of 
birth weight ventura said 
as of 1986 for example about 91 percent of firsttime mothers 
30 to 34 began prenatal care during the first trimester of their 
pregnancy the report showed 
by comparison 774 percent of all firsttime mothers started 
care that early and among women 1519 prenatal care was begun in 
the first three months by only 558 percent of firsttime mothers 
the report did not go into other health factors concerning the 
age at which women first gave birth 
the study comes just two weeks after a census bureau report 
showed that onethird of all the children born in 1988 had mothers 
30 and over 
while women in their 30s were having more children the birth 
rate for younger women has been declining while those women pursue 
educations and careers 
when asked in surveys about expectations of future births large 
numbers of these women continued to report plans for families 
the question that remains is to what extent those women who 
intend to have children will actually have the children they expect 
to bear ventura wrote

us customs commissioner william von raab 
signed an agreement with britain today to simplify procedures for 
exchanging information on drug trafficking commercial fraud and 
other customs matters 
a customs spokesman said the mutual assistance agreement for 
the first time provides a legal basis for intergovernmental 
cooperation that has been going on informally for years 
the new agreement was signed by von raab and jb unwin chairman 
of britains board of customs and excise 
customs spokesman dennis shimkowski said similar agreements are 
being negotiated between the united states and other countries that 
are frequent trade partners 
narcotics smuggling is a prime target of the agreement which 
will allow the quick exchange of drug trafficking intelligence 
between the two governments there also is a provision that calls 
for cooperation in the surveillance of suspected persons or goods 
other provisions provide for investigative and inspection 
assistance when requested and the mutual use of witnesses and 
documents in civil or criminal proceedings both nations are allowed 
to withhold assistance for reasons of national interest 
shimkoski said britain and the united states have been 
cooperating informally for years but there were delays in sharing 
intelligence because the information was sent through diplomatic 
channels 
it took forever to get things done said shimkowski 
the united states already has similar customs agreements with 10 
countries they are west germany austria mexico canada italy 
south korea cyprus sweden finland and norway

attorney general dick thornburgh says 
indictments and convictions obtained by a special dallas task force 
show what can be done nationwide if congress gives him 50 million 
to root out savings and loan embezzlers 
but hes saying no thanks to a house offer of 75 million if 
the texas task force is kept in operation and a similar unit is 
established in southern california 
the two areas have the biggest backlog of sampl fraud cases they 
also account for about twothirds of the thrift losses behind a 157 
billion bailout of the nations biggest financial disaster since the 
1930s depression 
what we prefer to do is have the flexibility to move our 
resources where they are necessary thornburgh said wednesday he 
said his department will oppose the mandated task forces when 
lawmakers start reconciling differences between house and senate 
versions of the bill next week 
meanwhile federal home loan bank board chairman m danny wall 
said wednesday that net withdrawals from the nations 2934 sampls 
eased for the fourth month in a row in may 
wall told reporters there was only a slight outflow of 
deposits in may compared with 54 billion taken out in april 
including interest credited to depositors accounts deposits 
actually rose in may the first time that has occurred since last 
december wall said but excluding interest depositors took out 
more money than they put in 
thornburgh called a press conference wednesday to announce the 
conviction of three former dallas sampl executives on fraud and other 
insider abuse charges and the indictment of a fourth person 
he attributed the convictions all on guilty pleas and 
indictment to the special dallas task force and said it is evidence 
of what can be done if congress provides the tools needed to do 
the job 
since its creation two years ago the task force a joint 
operation of the justice departments criminal division the us 
attorneys office in dallas the fbi the internal revenue service 
and the bank board has obtained 50 indictments and 32 convictions 
thornburgh said 
but he said he opposes a provision in the house sampl bailout bill 
that would mandate the task forces for three years instead 
thornburgh endorsed a senate version that parallels exactly 
president bushs proposal to devote 50 million over the next three 
years for prosecuting sampl fraud but with no strings on how the money 
is spent 
the three former sampl executives listed wednesday by thornburgh as 
entering guilty pleas are 
john h roberts jr former president of summit savings 
association of dallas who was accused of using a nominee borrower 
to obtain a 45 million loan from the institution in order to 
provide an airplane for roberts personal use he faces a maximum 
prison term of 10 years and a 15000 fine 
joseph r smith former vice president at sunbelt savings 
association in dallas who was accused of conspiring to defraud the 
bank board and the irs he faces a maximum sentence of five years 
and a fine of up to 250000 
kenneth c hood former vice president of western savings 
association in dallas who was accused of attempting to defraud the 
irs by creating artificial losses and by making a false 
statement in connection with a 113 million loan from sunbelt he 
faces a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a fine of 
500000 
indicted was bob r franks former president of northpark savings 
association in richardson texas franks is accused of illegally 
diverting 138000 in northpark funds to make an interest payment on 
a 295 million loan from centennial savings association of

business bureaus 
store shoppers on the other hand were a little less satisfied 
in 1988 than they were the previous year the council said in a 
report wednesday 
according to a compilation of figures supplied by the nations 
180 better business bureaus ordered product sales prompted 
58200 complaints compared to 68500 in 1987 dropping from first 
to third in the ranking of complaints against sellers 
ordered products consist of items including subscriptions 
ordered by mail or telephone 
i dont know of a specific action or a specific program but 
what i would suggest is there has been a renewed emphasis on 
customer service said connie heatley a public relations 
executive with the new yorkbased direct marketing association in 
new york 
retail stores prompted 65900 complaints in 1988 moving to no 
1 compared with 65200 or second place the year before 
home furnishings accounted for the highest complaints 12500 in 
the retail category 
service firms were the secondhighest source of complaints at 
58600 compared with 59350 in 1987 when they ranked third auto 
service firms are excluded from that category 
home improvement and remodeling companies ranked fourth 
receiving 46000 complaints compared with 45750 the previous year 
auto truck and recreational vehicle dealers were at the bottom of 
the list both years with 31000 complaints in 1988 and 26750 in 
1987 
in a separate category the council said customer requests for 
assistance in resolving problems numbered 34 million 50 percent

the supreme courts slow journey toward 
conservatism over the past two decades became a quickpaced march in 
its 198889 term with chief justice william h rehnquist leading 
and ronald reagans three appointees right with him 
the rehnquist court came of age as it cut back abortion rights 
curtailed affirmative action for women and minorities limited other 
civil rights protections condoned mandatory drug testing and 
permitted capital punishment for juvenile and retarded killers 
justice anthony m kennedy tipped the balance of power in his 
first full term he solidified a comparatively youthful conservative 
majority that prevailed in a series of important 54 votes 
thus with three appointments former president reagan 
accomplished what richard m nixon failed to do with four 
fundamentally reshape the nations highest court and perhaps the 
future of american law as well 
reagan named sandra day oconnor to the court in 1981 then 
promoted rehnquist and appointed antonin scalia in 1986 after chief 
justice warren e burger retired kennedy joined them early last 
year 
allied with rehnquist and byron r white who was appointed by 
president john f kennedy in 1962 the reagan appointees are now in 
control 
conservatives two years ago were panning rehnquists first term 
as chief justice dejectedly admitting that he had been 
outmaneuvered and overshadowed by william j brennan the courts 
leading liberal 
rehnquist clearly assumed a leadership role the next year but 
not without joining in some surprising rulings that sparked 
commentators to say he had moderated his staunchly conservative 
ideology 
statesmanlike is what some conservatives called rehnquists 
performance in the courts 198788 term but kennedys votes in the 
justcompleted term allowed rehnquist to be rehnquist again 
standardbearer for the causes conservatives hold most dear 
two major exceptions to the courts conservative path through 
1970s and 1980s abortion and civil rights are exceptions no more 
waiting until the last day of the 198889 term to announce a 
decision in its mostly closely watched case of the decade the court 
gave states far greater power to regulate abortion 
the immediate impact abortions are likely to become harder to 
get 
the implications it now appears much more likely the court will 
reverse its 1973 decision in roe vs wade that women have a 
constitutional right to abortion reversal which could come as 
early as next year would allow states to outlaw most abortions 
a clear majority rehnquist white scalia kennedy and oconnor 
believe roe vs wade was wrongly decided only oconnors 
reluctance to throw out the 1973 ruling stopped the court this time 
but three new abortion disputes will be on the courts docket when 
it ends its summer recess in october 
in other key rulings this term the court 
made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove 
onthejob bias by using statistics 
gave white men more power to challenge courtapproved 
affirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful 
reverse discrimination 
shielded states and state officials from some civil rights 
lawsuits 
made it more difficult to sue cities when their employees 
violate someones civil rights 
limited the scope of a key civil rights law ruling that it does 
not apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment 
ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed at 
bettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people 
said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of defendants even 
if those assets were going to be used to hire a lawyer 
ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers to 
death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals 
ruled that the death penalty may be imposed on convicted 
murderers who were as young as 16 when they committed their crime 
ruled that capital punishment also may be imposed for mentally 
retarded killers 
ruled that police may vary from the precise wording of the 
famous miranda warnings before questioning suspects even if the 
result arguably is confusing 
each of those rulings came on 54 votes in each brennan and 
justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
dissented 
in less polarized voting the court also 
upheld the use of mandatory blood and urine testing for railroad 
workers involved in accidents and for us customs employees seeking 
drugenforcement jobs 
allowed law enforcement agents to stop question and even search 
airline passengers whose looks or actions in some way fit the 
profile characteristics of a drug courier 
ruled that states may use antiracketeering laws to prosecute 
pornographic bookstores but barred the states from closing down the 
bookstores before such cases go to trial 
the courts liberal wing although most often in dissent was not 
without its significant victories 
most notably brennan wrote for a 54 majority that included 
kennedy and scalia when the court ruled that burning the american 
flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest 
and brennan was the author when the court ruled 54 that 
sentencing juries may not consider a murder victims personal traits 
when deciding whether the killer should receive life in prison or 
death rehnquist oconnor scalia and kennedy dissented

genital herpes infections are far more common in 
the united states than experts once thought but most people who 
catch the virus never know they have it according to a study 
published today 
when herpes emerged as a national scare in the early 1980s 
experts estimated that perhaps 5 million to 10 million americans had 
it the new data based on blood samples collected a decade ago 
shows that 25 million people were infected 
the number infected probably has increased since then the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases now estimates 
that about 30 million americans carry the sexually transmitted 
virus and 500000 more catch it yearly 
although being formally published in the new england journal of 
medicine the herpes prevalence figures already have been widely 
reported and discussed 
the report was based on an analysis of blood samples drawn from 
4201 people who participated in the second national health and 
nutrition examination survey between 1976 and 1980 it was written 
principally by dr robert e johnson of the us centers for disease 
control 
among the findings 
overall 16 percent of americans were infected the prevalence 
increased from less than 1 percent in youngsters under age 15 to 20 
percent among those between ages 30 and 44 it then nearly leveled 
off 
blacks were far more likely than whites to be infected among 
those between ages 60 and 74 the infection was found in 20 percent 
of whites and 65 percent of blacks however the researchers said 
the gap between the races may have narrowed since the survey was 
conducted 
the infection was more common in women than in men among blacks 
but not whites 
the infection was also more common in those who were divorced 
separated or widowed than in people who stayed married 
genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 a 
related virus herpes simplex type 1 is more common and causes cold 
sores

some savvy ducks have found their version of 
floridas vacation paradise at a water amusement park but the 
management wants the little visitors to go back from whence they 
waddled 
they just hang out use the lazy river ride mooch food and 
eye all the pretty women said richie fontanez a lifeguard at the 
wet n wild theme park where the resident mallard population has 
reached more than 30 
the big problem is what goes in a duck comes out a duck 
on wednesday the park started an eviction attempt the plan was 
to relocate them about 15 miles east to the town of bithlo 
but that was easier said than done 
for eight hours the ducks waddled and fluttered just out of 
range of a small arsenal of nets and baited wire traps set up by 
orange county animal control officers and environmentalists 
but by the end of the day only one had been nabbed by cindy 
westra cofounder of back to nature a wildlife rehabilitation and 
education center near chuluota in neighboring seminole county she 
lured it with bread crumbs and soft words 
theyre greedy little beggars the park has now become a very 
convenient meal ticket for them said carmen shaw the centers 
other founder she and westra volunteered to help capture the 
gentle migratory birds 
nobody knows where they came from but theyve been living at the 
parks lake about six years there are about six times as many ducks 
now as there were originally 
once the duck roundup is over the birds will be taken by car to 
a bithlo ranch where they will be introduced to more mundane 
aquatic pleasures on a local lake 
theyll be safer on the east side of orange county said 
shaw that area of the county has less development and is less 
polluted

more than 2 million moslems from 80 
countries are making the annual pilgrimage to islams holiest 
shrines both in saudi arabia but iranians are staying away to 
protest new limits on the number of pilgrims the iranian media have 
intensified their daily broadsides condemning the saudi royal 
family which oversees the pilgrimage or hajj to mecca and medina 
the saudis last year imposed a quota on the number of pilgrims 
1000 for every 1 million people in a moslem country iran rejected 
the limit which reduced its usual 150000 pilgrims by about 
twothirds 
the saudis said the reductions would prevent crowding while they 
expanded facilities and accomodations in mecca birthplace of the 
prophet mohammed and medina where he is buried 
but the move was widely seen as aimed at curbing militant iranian 
pilgrims who the saudis say have violated a ban on political 
demonstrations since the 1979 islamic revolution 
we never intended to bar the iranians from the hajj interior 
minister prince nayef said in a statement distributed wednesday by 
the official saudi press agency we have told tehran that iranian 
hajjis are welcome to come to the kingdom but in a specific number 
as is the case with hajjis from other islamic countries 
during the pilgrimages oilrich arabian princes mingle with 
paupers from bangladesh other hajjis include uzbeks from the soviet 
union turks nigerians indonesians poles sicilians and chinese 
security has been tight since 1979 when extremists seized the 
grand mosque in mecca and held it for two weeks before saudi forces 
stormed it 
more than 250 people were killed including 100 of the fanatics 
another 63 were later beheaded 
the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary guards posing 
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives in 1987 402 pilgrims most iranians were killed in 
mecca in riots the saudis say the iranian fundamentalists instigated 
the saudis have said that with the iranians absence this year 
there has been little need for the extra security 
weve been told that no iranians are coming and thats a 
relief a pakistani pilgrim abdulkhatir bakhsh said in an 
interview 
the saudis severed relations with tehran in april 1988 citing 
iranian subversion and terrorism 
if the rulers of iran are still bent on offending the hajjis 
we reject and will resist this prince nayef said we will not 
allow anyone to undermine the safey of the hajjis or the homeland 
he said that an unspecified number of iranians living outside 
iran were making the pilgrimage 
by the time the hajj climaxes july 12 saudi officials estimate 
that more than 2 million moslems will have made the pilgrimage 
about half of them saudis 
officials said there are 31 pilgrims from the soviet union 
compared with 15 last year 
more people will be coming in the future thanks to glasnost 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs policy of openness said mufti 
talgat tadzhuddin a soviet pilgrim 
china also has been more liberal allowing 2000 men and women to 
make the pilgrimage twice the size of last years group 
in mecca birthplace of islam the men discard jewelry robes and 
business suits to don two pieces of white seamless cloth the size 
of bath towels the attire signifies equality in the eyes of allah 
women wear headtotoe cloth garments and are not allowed to wear 
perfume 
all moslems are expected to make the pilgrimage at least once if 
they can afford it during the hajj they abstain from cutting their 
hair enjoying pleasures of the flesh and even killing mosquitoes 
the pilgrimage is not just a religious gathering which the 
saudis televise and beam by satellite to moslem countries but also 
an international bazaar 
officials said more than 600000 saudis are congregating in mecca 
and medina to sell items such as food prayer rugs and souvenirs 
the saudi royal familys custodianship of the holy shrines is its 
main source of legitimacy with the worlds 1 billion moslems 
the government spends billions on logistics for the pilgrimage 
whose main destination is mecca but includes a side trip to medina 
the saudis are spending billions more on modernizing mecca and 
medina by building highrise apartments and hotels and gouging huge 
underground parking lots in the rocky hills ringing mecca

here are excerpts from statements made in us 
district court at judge gerhard a gesells sentencing of oliver l 
north on wednesday 
by north 
your honor i have devoted nearly two decades to the service of 
our country and i would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or 
any of its institutions over these years there have been some 
success but i have always believed that those accomplishments were 
more the result of the efforts of the good people i was privileged 
to work with rather than myself 
i also recognize that i have made many mistakes and as a result 
of those mistakes i have been convicted of serious crimes i have 
also lost a chance to ever again serve as a marine 
in his paperwork the prosecutor said that i feel no remorse in 
that he is wrong for i grieve over what has happened and i truly 
do pray about it every day one should not confuse a smile or a wave 
toward the ever present press cameras that seem to follow me around 
for a lack of sensitivity over what has happened or lack of care for 
the consequences 
that i choose to face each day with faith that this will all 
eventually end well that the anguish of my wife and four children 
will some day end should not i believe be held against me i pray 
daily that their two and a half year nightmare will some day end in 
the not too distant future and that they will be able to think of 
something other than what has preoccupied me when they arise in the 
morning 
over the course of these many months i have often wondered when 
this seemingly endless ordeal will indeed end i cannot describe for 
you in words that are adequate how much all of this has hurt my 
family how it has disrupted or interfered with our childrens young 
lives how their days which should have been filled with the joyful 
things of childhood have been so radically altered and different and 
sad 
nor can i tell you how it has affected my wife of nearly 21 years 
to see what she rightly deserves not to see as her children are 
attacked so often uncertain because of what their father did or 
failed to do because of who he was and what he did or didnt do 
nor can i describe to you the hurt that this has meant to betsy 
herself because there are some things that are felt too deeply to 
say in public 
your honor i ask only that you consider these things when you 
weigh the sentence that you be lenient so that they will have a 
chance to rebuild their lives 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
by gesell 
i can assure you colonel north that im going to take into full 
consideration the important fact that before you came to the white 
house you had served your country with distinction in the highest 
traditions of the marine corps 
and the court is not going to overlook that there were major 
matters of military and quasimilitary nature which you performed 
again with the highest distinction at great personal risk to 
yourself after you came to the white house but im sure you realize 
that this case has little to do with your military behavior 
commitment or expertise 
the indictment involves your participation in particular covert 
events i do not think that in this area you were a leader at all 
but really a lowranking subordinate working to carry out 
initiatives of a few cynical superiors you came to be the point man 
in a very complex power play developed by higherups 
whether it was because of the excitement and the challenge or 
because of convictions you responded certainly willingly and 
sometimes even excessively to their requirements and along the way 
you came to accept it seems to me the mistaken view that congress 
couldnt be trusted and that the fate of the country was better left 
to a small inside group not elected by the people who were free to 
act as they chose while publicly professing to act differently 
thus you became and by a series of circumstances in fact and i 
believe in your mind part of a scheme that reflected a total 
distrust in some constitutional values 
now a trial is a very extraordinary thing as you stand there 
now youre not the fall guy for this tragic breach of the public 
trust 
the jury composed of everyday citizens your supporters mocked and 
mocked throughout the trial understood what was taking place 
observing that many others involved in the events were escaping 
without censure or with prosecutorial promises of leniency or 
immunities they used their common sense and they gave you the 
benefit of a reasonable doubt 
youre here now because of your own conduct when the truth was 
coming out apparently you could not face disclosure and decided to 
protect yourself and others you destroyed evidence altered and 
removed official documents created false papers after the events to 
keep congress and others from finding out what was happening 
now i believe that you knew this was morally wrong it was 
against your bringing up it was against your faith it was against 
all of your training under the stress of the moment it was easier 
to choose the role of a martyr but that wasnt a heroic patriotic 
act nor was it in the public interest 
you have had great remorse for your family and understandably so 
it is often the tragic part of what happens when mistakes are made 
i believe you still lack full understanding however of how the 
public service has been tarnished 
nonetheless what you believe is your own business and jail would 
only harden your misconceptions given the many highly commendable 
aspects of your life your punishment will not include jail 
indeed community service may in the end make you more conscious 
of certain values which at times you and your associates appear to 
have overlooked in the elite isolation of the white house 
your notoriety has cause many difficulties but it has also made 
you a rich man and where you go from here is up to you as i see 
it you can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported 
yourself during these recent difficult years or you can turn around 
now and do something useful 
i want to talk to you about the community service ive spent a 
lot of time thinking about it i want the community to get the 
benefit of your organizational and administrative skills which are 
very very high i believe as your counsel has indicated that you 
are a caring person and this community service im putting before 
you like many aspects of this case is unique 
there is a model program to be tested in the district of 
columbia fully financed and in the final formative stages at the 
present time it involves a program of counseling training and 
educating and where necessary providing aftercare for district of 
columbia inner city youths most of whom are living in public 
housing surrounded by the drug culture 
the work will involve no fund raising no public speaking but a 
very complex administrative task of coordinating various private and 
dc resources in a program targeted to see if we cant stop the 
scourge of drugs that hits the young people of this city 
and im asking you and directing that you participate in that 
program and give it your administrative skills your organizational 
skills and if it succeeds as i believe and hope it will it 
gives you an opportunity i think a sense of fulfillment and a 
chance to start something good and wholesome for the future

gov bob martinez said he wants a special session of the 
legislature to adopt new abortion restrictions but gov mario cuomo 
said he would defend new yorks liberal abortion laws despite this 
weeks supreme court ruling 
i dont believe we ought to wait until 1990 to deal with a 
difficult subject martinez said wednesday its not something 
thats going to go away its something that must be dealt with 
in baton rouge the louisiana legislature went into special 
session wednesday but gov buddy roemer said there wasnt enough 
time to add abortion to the agenda 
louisiana already blocks the use of state money and facilities 
for abortions and lawmakers have passed a bill that would make 
abortion a crime if the us supreme court overrules roe vs wade 
the 1973 case that legalized abortion 
martinez a republican and abortion opponent endorsed the 
supreme court ruling that upheld a missouri law restricting 
abortions and invited other states to follow suit he also said he 
was pleased with the ruling because it appeared to reinforce states 
rights 
i think here in florida we will try and develop a policy for 
the state of florida and not interpret what other states may do with 
the ruling the us supreme court issued martinez said clearly 
i believe the unborn ought to have more rights than they have right 
now 
martinez said the special session would come no later than a 
previously scheduled one in october that was called to consider 
growth management and transportation 
currently florida allows abortions during the first six months 
of pregnancy and in the final three months only to protect the 
mothers life state medicaid money will pay for abortions only when 
the mothers life is threatened 
the states parental consent law which is not enforced because 
of a pending lawsuit is one of the strictest in the country said 
sen bob graham dfla it requires unmarried minors to receive the 
permission of their parents a guardian or a judge to have an 
abortion 
it also pleased me that we have a parentalconsent law pending 
before the florida supreme court and certainly the opinion of the 
united states supreme court goes straight to the heart of the 
parentalconsent law requirements said martinez who met with 
prolife activists wednesday to discuss plans for a special session 
new york also allows abortions during the first 24 weeks of 
pregnancy and after that if a womans life is in danger 
although cuomo says he personally opposes abortion he has 
budgeted medicaid funds for abortion each year he said he would do 
so again in next years budget despite the inevitable attempt by 
some legislators to deny fairness to poor people because the supreme 
court follows a lower standard 
we think we have a better way and a fairer way the 
democratic governor said yes we have been different im proud 
of those differences from a new yorkers point of view we do it 
better 
cuomo a roman catholic also said he would oppose any attempt to 
forbid abortions from being performed in public hospitals but he 
would not say what he would do if presented with a bill requiring 
minors to get parental consent for abortions

neptunes poles may be encircled by broad 
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on earth and 
jupiter say scientists studying a new photograph from the voyager 2 
space probe 
two dark bands each about 2700 miles wide are clearly visible 
forming a collar around neptunes south pole the photograph also 
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole said edward 
stone voyager project scientist for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
they are probably regions of clouds associated with highspeed 
jet streams said stone a physicist and vice president at the 
california institute of technology 
the planets southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees 
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude said candice hansen a 
planetary scientist at jet propulsion laboratory 
the new photograph was taken by voyager 2 on june 22 when it was 
572 million miles from neptune because of the time needed to 
process an enhanced color image it was released wednesday by the 
national aeronautics and space administration which called it the 
best color photo of neptune taken so far by the voyager 2 
spacecraft 
today the spacecraft was 446 million miles from the remote 
planet cruising at 42202 mph as it headed for its aug 24 close 
encounter with the solar systems fourthlargest planet 
voyager was 267 billion miles from earth but has traveled 438 
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years 
ago 
the photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot a 
cloud system bigger than the entire planet mars seen in earlier 
images of neptune scientists have said the 6200milewide spot 
probably is a storm similar to jupiters great red spot or earths 
hurricanes 
earths jet streams are 65 to 200mph highaltitude air currents 
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe 
the cloud bands on jupiter saturn and apparently on neptune are 
straight belts encircling those planets uranus also shows faint 
hints of narrower cloud bands 
scientists believe earths jet streams meander across latitudinal 
lines because of interference from continents and temperature 
differences in the oceans 
it may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets 
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with 
relatively simple wind patterns said hansen and caltech planetary 
scientist andrew ingersoll 
jupiters 250mph jet streams are found along the edges of its 
cloud bands and scientists suspect the same is true on neptune 
stone said there is no obvious association between jet streams and 
cloud bands on saturn he added 
stone said that on jupiter and possibly neptune the cloud bands 
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them jupiters 
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat 
within the planet they try to fall back to lower elevations by 
moving north or south but the planets rotation deflects the 
falling clouds to form jet streams he said 
voyager is still too far from neptune to determine if the bands 
contain dark highaltitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of 
clear sky that allow voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in 
neptunes atmosphere said rich terrile a jet propulsion laboratory 
astronomer 
studying neptunes atmosphere will give scientists an 
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the 
most remote fringes of our solar system terrile said adding that 
knowledge of alien atmospheres improves our ability to understand 
our own atmosphere 
voyager 2 and its twin voyager 1 were launched from cape 
canaveral fla in 1977 
they explored jupiter in 1979 voyager 1 flew past saturn in 1980 
and is headed toward interstellar space voyager 2 encountered 
saturn in 1981 uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3000 miles above 
neptunes north pole cloudtops at 9 pm pdt aug 24 
five hours later it will encounter neptunes backwardorbiting 
moon triton at a distance of about 25000 miles 
neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun but because of 
plutos elongated orbit neptune will be the ninth and outermost 
until 2007

analysts said the firsthalf surplus was due mainly to 
recordhigh exports in may which totaled 63 billion 
they said labor and political unrest in south korea helped boost 
taiwan exports as foreign buyers switched their orders to the island 
taiwans surplus with the united states its largest trading 
partner totaled 55 billion in the period compared to 4 billion 
a year ago 
trade with japan taiwans secondlargest trading partner

an outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections 
in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous 
strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years 
ago researchers reported today 
the newly recognized illness which doctors call streptococcal 
toxic shock syndrome can lead from a minor skin infection to death 
in a day or two 
strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor 
illnesses such as sore throats more virulent forms of the microbes 
were once frequent causes of lifethreatening illnesses including 
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever but for reasons unclear the 
dangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s 
in todays new england journal of medicine doctors describe 20 
cases of severe illness including six deaths that were seen 
between 1986 and 1988 in idaho montana utah and nevada they 
believe the illness was caused by strep bacteria that produce 
scarlatina toxin the poison responsible for scarlet fever 
although experts are unsure of the outbreaks scope dr dennis 
l stevens said its a bigger problem than 20 patients believe 
me 
stevens the reports chief author said he expects to hear of 
many more cases after todays publication 
however dr robert breiman of the us centers for disease 
control in atlanta cautioned that there may always have been 
occasional severe strep attacks that have gone unnoticed 
whether these 20 cases are a major change from the past its 
hard to know breiman said 
stevens saw his first case in 1984 at the veterans administration 
medical center in boise idaho the victim had gone to the hospital 
with a mild fever after 10 hours he went into shock eight hours 
later he died 
i was amazed at the rapidity with which this occurred he 
said i saw another case a year later i started talking to 
colleagues they told me of similar cases 
since stevens and his colleagues a group of infectious disease 
specialists who meet once a year as the rocky mountain pus club 
assembled the 20 cases he has since seen more including some in 
california and washington state 
about two years ago other doctors began reporting an increase in 
the number of cases of rheumatic fever in addition outbreaks of 
severe strep disease have been reported recently in britain and 
scandinavia 
dr edward kaplan of the university of minnesota a coauthor of 
the latest study said he believes there may be some connection 
between the emergence of these dangerous strep illnesses perhaps a 
genetic change in the strep bacteria 
with all due respect to some people who are skeptical one 
cant help being impressed with what has happened he said this 
could be either because we are looking harder or its a real event 
i think its a real event 
of the 20 cases described six victims or 30 percent died of 
the illness five died within four days of admission to a hospital 
three of them died within 36 hours most started with red tender 
skin and quickly went on to more serious symptoms including shock 
kidney failure and breathing failure 
most were healthy young adults their median age was 36 and all 
but four were younger than 50 
people born before 1940 when scarlet fever was more common 
probably have had contact with this toxin and probably have 
antibodies that protect them from developing this shocklike 
episode said stevens we think the reason its attacking young 
people and not old people is predominantly because they are 
immunologic virgins to this toxin 
the variety of toxic shock syndrome associated with tampon use in 
menstruating women is caused by a different microbe the 
staphylococcal bacteria

prosecutors of two former top ptl aides 
urged a jury to focus on alleged tax evasion by the pair and not to 
be distracted by big salaries or television celebrities at the 
ministry 
this case is not about jim bakker tammy bakker or richard 
dortch justice department prosecutor joseph bender said 
referring to ptls founder his wife and former top aide 
its not about whether the defendants collected exorbitant 
salaries or bonuses its about the income the defendants failed to 
pay taxes on 
but the attorney for brothers david and james taggart said the 
opposite in his opening remarks wednesday 
this case is not about taxes we concede at the outset there 
are some taxes owed by david and james lawyer ben cotten said 
this is a case about authorization intent and doubt 
the taggarts were indicted by a federal grand jury in december on 
charges of failing to pay 487000 in income taxes from 1984 to 
1987 the indictment was issued the same day that bakker and dortch 
were indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud 
bakkers and dortchs trial on charges of diverting more than 4 
million of ptl money to their own use and conspiring to defraud ptl 
contributors is scheduled to open aug 28 in charlotte 
in a fourhour hearing wednesday attorneys for bakker and dortch 
argued that the case should be moved out of western north carolina 
because of pretrial publicity dortchs attorney also asked that his 
client be tried separately us magistrate paul taylor did not say 
when he would rule on the requests 
in the taggart case prosecutors said david taggart 32 who was 
bakkers personal aide and taggarts 35yearold brother ptls 
former interior decorator used ministry credit cards to get large 
cash advances and used blank ptl checks to pay american express 
bills 
bender said the government would prove the taggarts illegally 
used more than 11 million in ptl money to buy such things as a new 
york condominium luxury autombiles jewelry furs and designer 
clothing 
the first prosecution witness special internal revenue service 
agent deborah burney said the taggarts received nearly 17 million 
in ptl funds from 1984 to 1987 on top of their salaries 
we found there was an understatement of their taxable income 
on their tax filings during that period she said 
cotten said witnesses and documents would show his clients had 
authorization to use the credit cards and take out cash advances 
from the highest levels at ptl 
he described his clients as hardworking dedicated employees who 
were given vast responsibilities in running the multimilliondollar 
ministry in the early 1980s 
during this time frame several people were getting vast 
amounts of benefits through procedures in place that were not under 
the control of david and james taggart cotten said 
the witness list in the taggart trial looks like a whos who 
of tv evangelism 
prosecutors are expected to call up to 69 witnesses including 
evangelists jerry falwell john wesley fletcher rex humbard and rex 
humbard jr 
cottens witnesses could include bakkers daughter tammy sue 
chapman and a former ptl board member the rev aimee cortese 
if convicted the taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in 
prison and face fines of more than 1 million

the us dollar ended sharply lower against the 
japanese yen today while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange 
rose moderately 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 11377 
points or 034 percent ending the day at 3342348 
the dollar finished trading at 13890 yen down 130 yen from 
wednesdays close of 14020 yen it opened at 13830 yen and inched 
up while fluctuating between 13785 yen and 13910 yen 
traders said the dollar fell following its decline on overseas 
markets overnight mainly due to expectations that us interest 
rates would fall as a result of a slowdown in the us economy 
market players were inclined to get rid of the dollar on 
expectations of a further shift toward easy credit by the us 
federal reserves policymaking committee said a trader with the 
bank of tokyo the committee met wednesday and will meet again today 
dollarselling sped up following remarks of a highranking us 
treasury department official that the us government was still 
concerned about the dollars high level against the yen he said 
on the stock exchange the indexs early rise following buying by 
investment trust companies caused optimism in the market said kenji 
ishizuka dealer with daiwa securities 
the yens strength against the dollar largely encouraged 
investors buying incentives he said 
in addition a majority of market players are expecting the 
united states will take action to ease its monetary policy he 
said expectations of lower interest rates are a stock buying 
incentive 
but many participants remained on the sidelines ahead of fridays 
release of the us jobless rate for june by which they believe the 
us monetary authority will determine its stand ishizuka said

federal regulators have approved the nations 
first openair field test of a genetically engineered virus for use 
as a pesticide 
researchers hope the step will help them develop biological means 
of destroying cropdamaging insects 
researchers at the boyce thompson institute for plant research 
will test the virus on cabbage plants at cornell universitys new 
york state agricultural expriment station in geneva beginning later 
this month said h alan wood the virologist who will direct the 
test 
the test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus will 
disappear from the environment quickly after working on insects 
rather than lingering in the field 
the ultimate goal of our project is to come up with 
environmentally safe viral pesticides for biological control of 
insect pests wood said tuesday 
the test would be the first time a genetically altered virus was 
released as an insecticide in the united states said fred betz a 
biologist at the us environmental protection agency several 
genetically altered batcteria have been tested as has a genetically 
altered virus that was tested by inoculating animals 
scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper a pale 
green caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of vegetables 
including cabbage beets broccoli brussels sprouts cauliflower 
collards and kale 
the virus they are using is identical to naturally occurring 
strains known as baculoviruses which cause viral epidemics in many 
agricultural and forest insect pests 
researchers will remove a gene that provides a protective protein 
coat from the virus the disabled virus cannot survive long in the 
environment so scientists will mix it with a naturally occurring 
wild strain of the virus before spraying it 
scientists hope the method will allow the virus to live long 
enough to work on insects without having it linger in the 
environment if the test is successful researchers hope to combine 
the method of disabling the virus with genetic enhancements that 
would make the virus more deadly 
despite their innate ability to kill insect pests many 
baculoviruses need to be genetically improved to be commercially 
viable said cornell entomologist anthony m shelton who is 
collaborating on the test 
the field test will be conducted on a twoacre doughnutshaped 
plot containing 20000 cabbage plants of which 2500 plants in the 
center will be sprayed with the virus 
wood said the surrounding plants will act as a buffer to prevent 
the spread of the virus and as a control group 
shelton and wood said even if the disabled virus does spread 
there would be no danger to humans and animals because baculoviruses 
infect only invertebrates such as insects 
the epa approved the field test after determining it posed no 
environmental or human health hazards 
the test plot will be monitored through 1991

secretary of state james a 
baker iii adjusting us policy to changing realities said today 
that the vietnamesebacked government in cambodia is entitled to a 
central role in efforts to reach a political settlement there 
baker endorsed efforts by resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk and government leader hun sen to reach agreement on 
cambodias political future once vietnam completes its promised 
troop pullout in september 
he called this effort crucial to the achievement of a viable 
political accord 
bakers speech before foreign ministers of the association of 
southeast asian nations marked a subtle shift in the evolving us 
policy toward cambodia as vietnam prepares to complete its 
withdrawal 
for years the united states focused on a complete vietnamese 
pullout deriding hun sen and his allies as hanois puppets 
with withdrawal now close the bush administration is 
increasingly concerned that the khmer rouge militarily the 
strongest of three cambodian resistance factions could fill the 
vacuum left by the departing vietnamese 
for baker there is no higher priority in southeast asia than 
blocking the return to power of the khmer rouge which during its 
197578 rule killed hundreds of thousands as it tried to turn 
cambodia into an agrarian commune 
the vietnamese invaded in late 1978 forcing out the khmer rouge 
baker spelled out the type of agreement he believes would be 
appropriate for cambodia a ceasefire cessation of foreign 
military aid to all factions an interim coalition government led by 
sihanouk and an international presence to oversee free elections 
france has indicated an interest in playing host to a conference 
of the four factions that will vie for power in the aftermath of the 
vietnamese withdrawal 
with us support the asean countries of indonesia thailand 
singapore malaysia the philippines and brunei have been supporting 
the two noncommunist resistance forces in cambodia 
while baker believes a return to power of the khmer rouge could 
lead to a second holocaust in cambodia sihanouks position is that 
moderate elements of the khmer rouge should be welcome to take part 
in a provisional government 
sihanouk a former cambodian head of state fears the khmer rouge 
would otherwise be encouraged to continue the struggle they have 
waged since vietnamese forces ousted them from power 
on wednesday sihanouk ruled out a separate peace agreement with 
the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh and promised to 
keep fighting 
he told a news conference in beijing one of his homes in exile 
that any settlement must include his khmer rouge allies 
fears of a khmer rouge takeover have prompted the first serious 
division within the united states over indochina vietnam laos and 
cambodia since us military involvement there ended 16 years ago 
the bush administration wants to send lethal aid for the first 
time to the noncommunist rebel forces in cambodia but the 
administration is encountering strong resistance in congress where 
some lawmakers worry that us weapons will fall into the hands of 
the khmer rouge 
rep stephen solarz dny has said the alternative to such aid 
might be a second asian auschwitz under khmer rouge sponsorship 
baker expressed hope that the day is near when indochina can be 
transformed from a battlefield to a marketplace 
yet to achieve this end to remake the terrible swords of the 
killing fields into plowshares for a peaceful community we must 
maintain our resolve and our unity of purpose now more than ever

an exasperated judge fined the united mine 
workers an additional 720000 for using convoys to slow coal 
shipments but he doubted the penalties would work 
its all just sort of whistling dixie us district judge 
glen williams said wednesday this order is being flouted 
flaunted openly disobeyed 
williams said he believes the umw leadership is orchestrating the 
tactic against pittston coal group inc 
umw district 28 president jackie stump called the fines 
excessive he also said it was difficult to stop people from joining 
the convoys 
a lot of them are saying we pay taxes on the roads if we 
want well drive on them he said 
scattered violence was reported wednesday which marked the start 
of the fourth month of a strike against pittston by 1900 umw miners 
in virginia west virginia and kentucky wildcat strikes also have 
been reported in several states since june 12 when thousands of 
union miners walked off the job in support of the striking pittston 
miners 
in mcclure state police said a dynamite explosion damaged a 
machinery warehouse owned by pittston at the base of hazel mountain 
no injuries were reported in the blast and authorities said it was 
uncertain whether the explosion was strike related 
pittston president michael odom said that 20 feet from the 
explosion site company employees found 25 to 30 sticks of dynamite 
tightly wrapped with tape odom said the wrapped dynamite failed to 
detonate but traffic had to be rerouted for hours while police 
explosives experts removed the bundle 
it makes me more firm in my resolution that im not going to 
yield to terrorists odom said 
union officials could not be reached for comment in the district 
office or in the hotel where they have been staying 
a miners windshield was smashed as he drove to work at a peabody 
coal co mine near morganfield ky where umw members have been on 
a wildcat strike this week authorities said 
and coal trucks entering a peabody mine near new lexington ohio 
were stopped at gunpoint for the second time this week although no 
shots were fired either time 
odom said a rolling blockade of hundreds of cars and trucks 
continued to clog the main coal hauling road wednesday theyre 
out there in full force ignoring the court order he said 
nearly every working day during the past three weeks the 
bumpertobumper convoys have tied up traffic on roads connecting 
pittstons processing plants with its supply mines 
on june 26 williams declared the union in contempt of court for 
orchestrating the tactic two days the previous week and fined the 
umw and two officers 240000 
williams said he will increase the daily fine to 550000 for 
further violations of the convoy ban 
umw attorney mike passino said the union will appeal the fines 
which now total 960000 
us secretary of labor elizabeth hanford dole meanwhile met in 
washington with umw president richard l trumka who did not 
request any action from her dole spokeswoman johanna schneider 
said she said the talks would continue and were fruitful

lawyers for jailed saudi financier and 
arms dealer adnan khashoggi have asked the swiss to block a us 
request to extradite him so he may stand trial on fraud charges a 
justice ministry spokeswoman said 
khashoggi is charged in a us indictment with helping ousted 
philippines president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda conceal 
assets allegedly plundered from their homeleand 
ministry spokeswoman ursula riedel said it would be at least two 
weeks before swiss authorities reach a decision on whether to 
extradite khashoggi who has been in custody since april 18 
if authorities approve the extradition request khashoggi would 
then have 30 days to take his appeal to the swiss supreme court the 
federal tribunal 
this could mean the former billionaire spending his 54th birthday 
on july 25 and possibly many weeks more in his small jail cell in 
the swiss capital 
ms riedel and khashoggis swiss lawyer ralph zloczower both 
declined to give details of the appeal against extradition which 
was submitted tuesday 
khashoggi the marcoses five other people and a california bank 
were indicted in october by a us district court in new york 
the indictment accuses the marcoses of stealing more than 100 
million from the philippine treasury and using the money to buy real 
estate and expensive art objects in new york 
the us government alleges khashoggi posed as the owner of some 
of the assets to conceal the marcos ownership he is charged with 
racketeering conspiracy obstruction of justice and mail fraud

a vietnamera navy deserter who 
secretly led a normal life for 20 years received a suspended 
sentence and a bad conduct discharge after friends politicians and 
even veterans urged leniency 
charles smith walked away from his navy post at treasure island 
in september 1969 just days after being ordered to report to an 
alaskan outpost he also left behind a wife and son 
smith kept his name married again and lived less than 10 miles 
from the california base during his desertion which was among the 
longest of the navys recent cases 
on wednesday the 43yearold seaman apprentice pleaded guilty to 
unauthorized absence from the navy at a courtmartial he was 
tracked down by navy investigators after his name popped up during a 
credit check smith had recently purchased a home 
judge capt phil roberts ordered smith discharged for bad conduct 
and added a fourmonth suspended sentence and the forfeiture of 
1000 in future navy pay 
i couldnt ask for anything more said smith who had faced a 
maximum life sentence for unauthorized absence 
he also could have been sentenced to one year for desertion and 
two years for marijuana use which was detected during a urinalysis 
after his may 3 surrender said his attorney howard denike 
when smith was asked about his 18 months of active duty during a 
news conference following sentencing he described it as a lot of 
harassment were even now 
smith left the navy after finding out his first wife was 
unfaithful and because he resented the rigidity of military life 
denike said smith enlisted in march 1968 and left the service 
without permission twice for brief periods before his final 
desertion 
smith has never contacted his former family or his parents and a 
sister in ohio he also never obtained a divorce from his first 
wife although denike said he assumes she either annulled the 
marriage or received a divorce 
smith remarried in 1975 had five children bought a house in the 
san francisco suburb san pablo and became active in the episcopal 
church he has worked the last 12 years as a foreman at kardum paint 
co of san francisco earning 24000 yearly 
prosecutor lt dennis hoffman portrayed smith as a problem 
child who never grew up but smiths employer and the church 
pastor testified he was a dependable worker and family man 
friends and his 37yearold wife mary gathered 600 signatures 
from people asking that smith be given an administrative discharge 
and no prison sentence his wife said she knew nothing of her 
husbands desertion 
us reps ron dellums and george miller wrote the navy urging 
leniency and a veterans organization with members from every us 
war and major conflict since the 1930s asked the military to grant 
smith clemency 
from our personal experiences we can understand how an 
individual might simply walk away from the pressures of life in the 
navy particularly in time of hostilities said mike felker 
secretary of the san franciscobased veterans speakers alliance in 
a letter to the court 
following several days in the brig smith has reported daily to 
treasure island for duty on a maintenance unit earning a salary of 
750 monthly he is likely to be placed on leave without pay within 
a few weeks and then discharged 
a new enforcement program has reduced the number of desertion 
cases from 14000 in 1987 to 2485 said lt cmdr kaye roberts 
head of the navy deserter apprehension program in washington dc 
the record for navy deserters who turned themselves in belongs to 
a nowdeceased sailor who jumped ship in 1926 and surrendered to 
navy authorities last year said roberts who would not reveal the 
mans identity 
the longest unresolved desertion case involves a sailor who left 
his base in 1962 she added

if it were up to folks in ollie oliver north 
wouldnt have been placed on two years probation or fined 150000 
for irancontra crimes 
they shouldnt have given him anything hell he should run for 
president hes the only one whos got any sense awilda davis 
said wednesday while nursing a beer at the old ollie inn which she 
used to own 
they pardoned nixon for what he did why cant they pardon 
north 
a federal judge in washington on wednesday sentenced the 
45yearold former white house aide to suspended terms of three two 
and one years for three felony convictions by a jury two months ago 
in addition to the fine north also was ordered to devote 1200 
hours to a new program to help district of columbia youths avoid 
involvement with drugs 
like ms davis several other ollie residents felt the former 
marine lieutenant colonels sentence was too harsh even though he 
could have been sent to prison for 10 years 
ed horras said north was the fall guy for the reagan 
administration when the irancontra affair became public more than 
two years ago horras said he would feel the same way even if the 
town didnt share norths first name the town of 220 residents 
invited north to the ollie big days celebration two years ago 
but he declined the invitation 
north has contended that in the irancontra affair in which 
us arms were secretly sold to iran and profits were diverted to 
the nicaraguan rebels he only acted on behalf of reagan 
administration superiors 
horras believed him 
i think hes a scapegoat he said if one man was able to 
do that what else is going on that we dont know about 
ollie mayor dave gentry said north was fortunate to receive the 
suspended sentence 
now that north has been sentenced gentry expects fewer visits by 
reporters and television news teams 
it will probably be a little drabby now that thats not going 
on anymore gentry said 
one person who might not mind a return to normalcy is ollie 
postmaster bill northup 
during the irancontra hearings we got requests every single 
day for postmarks for seven solid weeks i guess we sent out about 
4000 across the country even to alaska and hawaii northup said 
but things have cooled off ill be looking for more requests 
in the next few weeks because of the sentencing but by and large i 
think things will drop off

oliver north is guilty of nothing more than 
following orders according to his supporters and residents of this 
rural upstate village where he grew up 
he was just an intermediary between reagan and bush and all the 
rest said charles havelka a retired real estate agent whose son 
was friends with north 
its ridiculous havelka said of the threeyear suspended 
prison sentence and 150000 fine north received in federal court in 
washington for his role in the irancontra affair 
havelka said he remembered young oliver north as a regular 
churchgoer a boy scout and later as a marine he said hes sure 
north did no wrong 
if hes a patriotic american and he said he didnt do anything 
wrong then he didnt havelka said 
in suburban albany members of the upstate new york chapter of 
the american freedom coalition rallied and collected signatures on 
petitions calling on president bush to pardon north 
in this particular case the american system of justice has 
performed a great travesty said mitchell goldstein head of the 
group oliver north is guilty of nothing more than following 
orders and going along with his conscience 
the real villains in this drama are those who hounded ollie 
north and his family for the last 2 years in pursuit of a political 
agenda that the american people reject 
public support has mainly been on norths side in philmont 
located about 30 miles south of albany since congressional hearings 
held into the irancontra scandal in the spring of 1987 made north a 
hero to many americans 
the town of 2000 residents even held an oliver north day in 
august 1987 to show their support 
if he came to philmont tomorrow id give him a heros 
welcome said phillip mossman the village mayor 
mossman said norths sentence was too harsh and that the vietnam 
veteran was a fall guy 
dont tell me that reagan and bush didnt know what was going 
on mossman said they come out on national television and call 
him a hero and the next day they fire him

a reputed colombian drug cartel leader accused of 
trafficking tons of cocaine into the united states was arraigned in 
prison for fear fellow smugglers would try to free him authorities 
said 
luis santacruz echeverri 35 is accused of heading us drug 
operations for the cali cartel a colombian drug gang that rivals 
the older medellin cartel 
santacruz who is being held without bond pleaded innocent 
wednesday in an office at the metropolitan correctional center south 
of miami before us magistrate samuel smargon 
it was the first time such a hearing has been held in a prison in 
the south florida federal district authorities said no trial date 
was set 
he is so important from our information that we believe the 
cartel will make efforts to free him even though we have no overt 
indications of any threat chief deputy us marshal james tasso 
said 
an indictment accuses him of involvement in a 2ton cocaine 
shipment seized in chicago in july 1987 the largest such 
confiscation at that time in all he is accused of trafficking 
about 10 tons into the united states 
assistant us attorney toby vick said the role of santacruz in 
the cali cartel was more important than that of carlos lehder rivas 
in the rival medellin cartel lehder was convicted in jacksonville 
last year of drug smuggling and is serving a life sentence 
vick also said after the arraignment that authorities believe 
there is a lot more cocaine involved than what hes charged with 
santacruz is a halfbrother of jose santacruz londono a wealthy 
cali businessman who the drug enforcement administration says is 
coleader of the drug cartel and the target of indictments in 
orlando and new york 
santacruz is believed to be third in command of the cali cartel 
following his halfbrother and gilberto rodriguez tasso said 
santacruz is a master of disguise said tom cash head of the dea 
in miami cash said santacruz visited miami often traveling on 
phony passports and changing his looks with each trip 
he grows a beard he shaves it off he dyes his hair he puts 
on glasses hes like one of the marx brothers merrily changing his 
repertoire while he bounces around the city of miami organizing 
these shipments cash said 
agents spotted santacruz on june 8 in a south miami neighborhood 
and arrested him 
it was like spotting john dillinger as he walked out of a movie 
theater cash said 
santacrus was charged june 14 with 14 drugrelated counts 
the cali and medellin cartels probably account for up to 85 
percent of us cocaine imports said dea spokesman john fernandes 
the cartels have cooperated in the past but by some reports have 
been at war since 1988 within days of santacruzs arrest two men 
were arrested in west palm beach and charged with trying to arrange 
a weapons shipment to colombia for the cali cartel 
the guns along with a drone plane capable of dropping bombs 
were allegedly to be used to kill off pablo escobar gaviria the top 
man in the medellin cartel who was shot down in a helicopter by cali 
gang members and holed up in a colombian hideout authorities said 
authorities however have no evidence linking santacruz with the 
plot

longtime leader janos kadar who came 
to power after soviet troops and tanks crushed the 1956 
antistalinist uprising and ruled for 32 years died today at age 
77 the staterun news agency announced 
mti said kadar died after a prolonged and grave illness he 
had been reported ill in april and was rushed to the hospital monday 
with pneumonia and severe breathing and circulatory problems 
the agency said the ruling communist party informs the party 
membership and the entire hungarian people with profound sorrow 
that comrade janos kadar died following a prolonged grave illness 
on thursday july 6 at 916 am 
kadar led hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance in the 
1970s but in the 1980s came to symbolize resistance to further 
economic and political reform 
in may 1988 he was unseated as party general secretary by karoly 
grosz and named honorary party chairman 
this may kadar lost that post and membership on the partys 
policysetting central committee which wrote him a letter 
criticizing mistakes during his rule 
kadars political legacy has since come under fierce attack and 
the ruling communists have moved rapidly to embrace democratic 
political changes and marketoriented economic reforms 
the change in fortunes was typical of a long career that began in 
1931 when he joined the illegal communist party as a 19yearold 
from a peasant background with only eight years of schooling 
kadar was jailed and seemingly forgotten after a party purge in 
1951 but was rehabilitated after the downfall of his stalinist 
rival matyas rakosi and his rise began

the us dollar fell sharply today against the 
japanese yen for the fourth consecutive day while the tokyo stock 
exchanges key index rose moderately 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 11377 points or 034

close of 14020 yen it opened at 13830 yen and ranged from 13785 
yen to 13910 yen 
the dollar now has fallen 505 yen in four trading days 
traders said speculation accounted for todays fluctuations as 
investors tried to push the currency below the 138 yen mark 
daiwa bank trader mitsuhiko kinugasa said most market players 
were inclined to reduce their dollar holdings in anticipation that 
the us federal reserve board might move toward easier credit 
the feds policymaking committee met wednesday and was to meet 
again later today 
the move toward easy credit would lead to interest rate cuts 
and would make the interest rate gap between the european currencies 
and the dollar even narrower kinugasa said 
central banks of european nations including west germany and 
france raised their discount rates in concert last week 
lower us interest rates make the dollar less attractive to 
foreign investors 
kinugasa said however many investors avoided major moves before 
fridays announcement of the us jobless rate in june which will 
influence the feds decision on whether to cut interest rates 
on the stock exchange the yens strength against the dollar 
reassured japanese investors said kazuhiro nomura a dealer with 
new japan securities co 
he said expectations of an easier credit policy in the united 
states were the major buying incentive for japanese investors

leona helmsleys lawyer urged a federal jury not 
to be prejudiced by the hotel queens enormous wealth or by the fact 
she may not be the nicest person 
ladies and gentlemen attorney gerald feffer said i dont 
believe mrs helmsley is charged in the indictment with being a 
tough bitch 
in the united states we dont put people in jail for being 
unpopular feffer said wednesday in his opening arguments 
the helmsleys are without a doubt one of the richest couples in 
the united states the amount of money they have at their 
disposal is extraordinary its beyond comprehension 
mrs helmsley 69 is on trial in us district court on charges 
of evading federal taxes by disguising 4 million in renovations at 
her connecticut mansion as business expenses she also faces other 
fraud and extortion charges 
feffer downplayed the 1 million in federal taxes mrs helmsley 
is charged with not paying in 198385 he said mrs helmsley and her 
husband harry paid 578 million in federal state and local taxes 
during that time 
feffer told the jury that the businesses were entitled to pay 
part of the cost of renovating decorating and operating the country 
estate the helmsleys purchased in 1983 for 11 million 
in his opening arguments assistant us attorney james devita 
said the helmsleys knew the writeoffs were illegal 
the helmsleys were determined to keep down the cost and charge 
as much as they could get away with to their companies he said 
they used their position in society to evade one of the most 
important responsibilities to pay their fair and accurate share 
of taxes 
the helmsleys head a 5 billion realestate and hotel empire 
helmsley 80 who was indicted in april 1988 with his wife was 
removed from the trial after us district judge john walker jr 
found him mentally incompetent 
devita said an outdoor sound system a marble dance floor and 
jade figures worth half a million dollars were among the purchases 
for dunnellen hall in greenwich conn that mrs helmsley wrote off 
as business expenses 
he said mrs helmsley also used her hotels and businesses as a 
personal piggy bank to pay for other purchases he said these 
included everything from a 45000 silver clock for her husband 
right down to her shoes and underwear 
devita said mrs helmsley yelled at employees and had them fired 
if they did not go along with the scheme 
one executive who paid out 10000 for work at the mansion after 
getting helmsleys approval was forced to personally pay back the 
amount to mrs helmsley because she did not approve the contract 
devita said 
mrs helmsley who appears in advertisements as the queen of 
the helmsley hotels several times shook her head no during 
devitas hourlong statement and her face became noticeably red 
the prosecutor charged that the helmsleys avoided paying for the 
renovation of the estate by submitting phony invoices and records to 
make it appear that the expenses were incurred by 19 different 
companies in their empire 
he also said helmsley and codefendant frank turco a former 
helmsley hotel executive extorted money goods and services 
from vendors doing business or seeking contracts with helmsley 
companies 
he said the scheme unraveled in early 1986 after turco and a 
third defendant joseph licari who was a top aide to helmsley fell 
out of favor with mrs helmsley 
the henchmen were no longer there to keep a lid on it devita 
said

homeless people began moving mattresses and 
shopping carts back into a park early today hours after their tents 
were torn down by city workers 
hundreds of people faced off with police as officers sealed off 
the park entrance ten officers suffered minor injuries and at least 
30 people were arrested charged mostly with disorderly conduct and 
resisting arrest authorities said 
tompkins square park in the east village was the site of a riot 
last summer but the confrontation that began wednesday night was 
limited largely to some egg throwing and jeering at police although 
skirmishes continued into early today 
late wednesday officers appeared to be going out of their way to 
be courteous saying please and thank you to those in their 
path 
homeless people were told to leave the park at 830 pm under a 
new city regulation that took effect wednesday banning residential 
structures like tents from parks 
were giving them a chance to take down their tents and gather 
up their belongings and theyre being offered shelter said alan 
moss a department of parks and recreation deputy commissioner who 
was at the scene 
he said the regulation was aimed at getting rid of unauthorized 
structures when you see a big spike being driven into a tree and 
boards being nailed together that doesnt belong in a park he 
said 
the park was reopened at midnight and the homeless began moving 
mattresses and shopping carts back inside 
deputy police chief charles reuther said there were no plans to 
stop the homeless people from returning as long as they dont 
bring structures 
city human resources administration workers with vans were in the 
park to transport those who wanted to go to city shelters for the 
homeless 
helmeted police officers blocked the entrance to the lower 
manhattan park while workers dismantled the large cardboard boxes 
and other makeshift structures homeless people had been living in 
no raids were planned at other parks because we dont have any 
other place where we have structures going up moss said 
meanwhile several hundred people gathered around the park most 
appeared to be curious rather than hostile 
while the mood was tense the most serious acts involved egg 
throwings and rubbish burning said a police spokesman sgt edward 
burns 
dozens of people were living in the park on aug 7 when police 
tried to enforce a curfew that was later revoked a riot ensued 
injuring 52 officers and 18 civilians more than 100 complaints of 
police brutality were filed

china expressed outrage today at recent moves to 
impose additional sanctions on beijing by members of the us 
congress who sanctimoniously claim to be the guardians of human 
rights 
it accused the united states of seeking to overthrow chinas 
government and turn the country capitalist saying washington had 
helped foment unrest 
the house of representatives voted june 29 to suspend trade and 
development programs with china prohibit the sale of police 
equipment and suspend transfers of nuclear technology 
to those people in the american congress who deliberately 
distort the facts and interfere with chinas internal affairs we 
cannot but express our indignation said the communist party 
newspaper the peoples daily 
congress move followed broader sanctions halting military sales 
and suspending highlevel exchanges imposed by president bush in the 
wake of the bloody military suppression of chinas prodemocracy 
movement 
troops backed by tanks cleared central beijing of protesters on 
june 4 killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
any sovereign country would use the same legal and reasonable 
methods when faced with a situation of this magnitude the 
peoples daily said 
but some antichina and antisocialist congressmen in the 
united states refuse to accept the truth they use their class 
instinct of anticommunism to interfere in chinas internal affairs 
 
they never talk about the suppression of the black human rights 
movement or student protests against the vietnam war in their 
country but sanctimoniously claim to be the guardians of human 
rights 
chinas communist leaders have kept up a barrage of antius 
criticism in an attempt to discredit us news reports about their 
suppression of dissent 
the liberation daily shanghais communist party paper said 
organizers of student protests in the united states must give 
detailed personal information and that permission to demonstrate can 
be rescinded at any time 
it listed student protest incidents in the united states from the 
1950s to 1970s including the killing by national guardsmen of four 
people during an antivietnam war protest at kent state university 
in ohio in 1970 
zhao ziyang ousted as communist party leader for opposing the 
use of troops to crush the prodemocracy movement was hit with more 
broadsides 
a lawmaker charged him with neglecting the leadership of the 
working class 
the peoples republic of china is a communist country that uses 
the coalition of the workers and the farmers as a foundation for 
democratic dictatorship wang houde told the national peoples 
congress whose steering committee ends a session today 
but for a certain period we have been negligent in this 
respect and comrade zhao ziyangs behavior is closely linked to 
this wang said comrade zhao ziyang did not manage well 
relations between workers 
zhao has been stripped of his party and government posts but 
continuing references to him in the press as comrade indicate he 
retains party membership 
the newspaper economic reference charged that washington is 
seeking to overthrow chinas government by turning the country 
capitalist guiding and supporting forces seeking revoltionary 
change stirring up protests among minority ethnic populations 
spreading anticommunist propaganda and cultivating dissidents under 
the banner of human rights 
its wednesday editions said the us governmentrun voice of 
america clearly reflecting the american governments policy 
started the most disgusting rumors fanning the flames and even 
acted as a contact between reactionary forces in china and the 
united states 
the truth already has been exposed american influence was 
behind the supporters of the few people who created this turmoil in 
beijing that turned into a counterrevolutionary rebellion it said 
voa has an estimated listening audience in china of tens of 
millions and official media have repeatedly singled it out for 
criticism 
the government last month expelled a voa correspondent accusing 
him of spreading false reports and violating martial law 
in spite of the antiamerican diatribe china continues to try 
and lure back foreign businessmen who fled the country after the 
crackdown and assure potential foreign investors that the country 
has returned to stability 
deng yingchao head of the chinese peoples association for 
friendship with foreign countries and as widow of former premier 
chou enlai a prominent spokesperson for chinas international 
policy told a japanese lawmaker today that chinas opendoor and 
economic reform policies would not change

longmissed americana and watched his native towns cubs a team 
that hasnt won a world series during the 58 years stolar lived in 
the soviet union 
its beautiful here it should be a painting stolar said 
wednesday night at wrigley field 
the 77yearold stolar and his sovietborn wife gita rozovskaya 
arrived in chicago on tuesday from israel where the family settled 
earlier this year after a 14year battle to leave the soviet union 
the stolars joined us sen paul simon and his wife jeanne at 
a game between the cubs and san diego padres simon dill met 
stolar during a 1980 trip to moscow and was instrumental in securing 
his release

events like this said stolar 
stolar was told by a reporter that the cubs havent won a world 
series since he left town itll come some day dont worry 
said stolar

its america simon said of the sport 
earlier wednesday simon joined stolar on a visit to the west 
side chicago neighborhood where he grew up before his family pulled 
up stakes and emigrated to the soviet union in 1931 
i didnt expect anything stolar said of his sentimental 
journey to humboldt park thats what keeps me young everything i 
get is a gift 
spanish has replaced the yiddish and polish that once filled the 
neighborhoods tenements 
but stolar found the soda fountain where as a teenager he mixed 
ice cream concoctions the thirdfloor apartment where he heard 
adults passionately debate socialism and the high school where he 
acted in a play 
it all looks strange and new to me said stolar who found his 
childhood home replaced by a garbagestrewn lot but somehow it 
feels like home

to their homeland by reports that the bolshevik revolution had 
created a workers paradise the family headed east

appointments during a special session called to study and affirm the 
ruling communist partys crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
the cabinet changes did not appear linked to the crackdown that 
ousted party leader zhao ziyang 
the evening television news said zhu qizhen vice foreign 
minister was appointed ambassador to washington to replace han xu 
who has held the post four years the report said hans term was up 
han along with chinas other ambassadors was recalled to 
beijing last week for what the foreign ministry said was a regular 
meeting but western diplomats said such recalls were not regular 
zhu 61 speaks english fluently and formerly headed the 
ministrys american and oceanic affairs department 
his appointment came as chineseus relations continued to 
worsen with the foreign ministry rejecting a us protest over 
soldiers spraying gunfire at american and other foreign diplomatic 
housing a few days after the army cleared central beijing of 
protesters killing hundreds 
the united states charged in its protest monday that soldiers 
staged an alleged sniper attack from the diplomatic compound so they 
could deliberately target american and other diplomats apartments 
no one was hurt in the incident 
the official xinhua news agency said assistant foreign minister 
liu huaqiu met today with us ambassador james lilley and gave him 
a note saying china categorically rejects the us embassys 
groundless accusation 
it is entirely futile for the us embassy to attempt to exert 
pressure on the chinese government by making a big fuss about an 
incident which has already been resolved the note said 
xinhua said labor minister luo gan 53 who was appointed last 
year was replaced with ruan chongwu a moscoweducated party 
veteran who was minister of public security from 198588 
ruan 56 also was deputy secretary of shanghais party committee 
in the early 1980s under jiang zemin the new national party chief 
he has since last yeasr been vice minister in charge of the state 
science and technology commission 
xinhua did not mention luo in its brief report on ruans 
appointment and gave no reason for the change however hong kongs 
new evening post newspaper said luo already had been given a new 
post as secretarygeneral of the state council chinas cabinet 
china faces a serious problem of stagnant or declining labor 
productivity productivity climbed in the early 1980s when senior 
leader deng xiaoping enacted reforms that allowed worker to be given 
incentive pay 
but continued tight control over job changes overstaffing and 
inflation have counteracted some of the early gains and many 
workers spend hours of their workday drinking tea and playing chess 
gu xiulian until recently governor of the eastern province of 
jiangsu was appointed minister of chemical industry xinhua said 
she replaces qin zhongda 65 who resigned it said 
gu 52 is a member of the party central committee and was 
chinas first female governor she was trained in metallurgy and 
electrical mechanics 
xinhua said both new ministers were nominated by premier li peng

the agent orange fund has dispensed 12 million 
to thousands of vietnam veterans their families and support 
organizations and up to 60 million more will be handed out in the 
next year overseers of the fund say 
the fund was created in 1984 when seven chemical companies agreed 
to pay 180 million to settle a classaction lawsuit brought by 
veterans and their families who alleged injuries from exposure to 
the chemical during the war 
were moving very quickly were ahead of where i thought we 
would be at this time said dennis rhoades director of the agent 
orange class assistance program a socialservice fund created to 
distribute some of the money 
by june 30 118 million in cash was distributed during the 
funds first year according to an annual report wednesday the 
report said 6039 veterans or their survivors received 95 million 
the rest went to 13 organizations 
the program administered by us district judge jack b weinstein 
is expected to distribute some 300 million in all by the end of 
1994 including as much as 60 million during the next 12 months 
the report said 
agent orange a herbicide widely used by american forces to 
destroy ground cover during the vietnam war contained the highly 
toxic chemical dioxin 
in their lawsuit veterans said exposure to agent orange caused 
cancer and other illnesses as well as birth defects in their 
children 
distribution of the money in the fund was held up by challenges 
for four years until the us supreme court a year ago refused to 
hear appeals

censorship laws to foreign media and said security forces can shoot 
sinhalese radicals engaging in violence or putting up 
antigovernment posters 
no news whatsoever can go out of this country without being 
censored foreign minister ranjan wijeratna told a news 
conference if you cannot conform to that please leave the 
country 
i will cancel your visas and deport you if you violate the 
censorship he told reporters who included several foreign 
correspondents if i decide to cancel a visa no appeals will be 
considered 
the government also said today that talks with india about 
withdrawing indian troops should be held in sri lanka the 40000 
troops were invited to sri lanka nearly two years ago to enforce a 
peace plan but the colombo government wants them out by the end of 
the month 
the censorship laws which ban reporting on the radical sinhalese 
movement went into effect this morning the ban was announced 
wednesday and initially foreign media organizations were exempted 
wijeratna said the move is part of a crackdown on the radicals 
who have been trying to overthrow the government for two years 
the government controlled by the islands sinhalese majority 
says the radicals are behind a 4weekold strike by transport 
operators which has crippled the economy of this troubled indian 
ocean island nation 
we will not allow the government to be displaced by guntoting 
criminals wijeratna said our armed forces and police have been 
given wide powers to deal with all form of subversion in the most 
ruthless manner

violence or putting up antigovernment posters all public meetings 
and trade union rallies have also been banned he said 
the government blames sinhalese militants for at least 3500 
killings since they launched an antigovernment campaign in july 
1987 to protest peace overtures being made to separatist tamil 
rebels 
the sinhalese militants said too many concessions were being 
given to the minority tamils who have been fighting since 1983 for 
an independent nation on the islands northern and eastern sectors 
since may the government has been holding talks with the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most powerful rebel militia 
the tigers rejected the 1987 overtures and carried on the war for a 
tamil homeland but last month they agreed to cease hostilities 
against the government and negotiate a settlement 
however they continue to fight the 40000 indian soldiers 
deployed on the island to help end the tamil insurrection the new 
delhi government has refused to stop fighting the rebels until they 
surrender their weapons 
india has also not agreed to colombos requests to pull out the 
soldiers by july 29 the second anniversary of their landing in sri 
lanka saying a hasty withdrawal could lead to even greater ethnic 
violence 
india has suggested that negotiations be held for a gradual 
pullout on tuesday indian prime minister rajiv gandhi offered to 
discuss a timetable 
if india wants to sit down and talk about the troop withdrawal 
they will have to send somebody to talk to president ranasinghe 
premadasa who is handling the issue personally wijeratna told a 
news conference today 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
complain of discrimination by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent 
of the population and control the government and military 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the tamil insurrection

the judge in oliver l norths case balanced 
the former presidential aides achievements against his irancontra 
crimes to fashion a punishment that could defuse the controversy 
over his prosecution 
us district judge gerhard a gesells sentencing decision 
wednesday answered a question posed by defense lawyer brendan v 
sullivan jr who asked what is oliver norths good life worth 
before placing him on two years probation gesell told north he 
had considered the many highly commendable aspects of your life 
as a marine hero in vietnam and later as a staff aide at the 
national security council 
against norths 20 years of service as a marine corps officer and 
a presidential aide gesell weighed the three crimes for which north 
he stands convicted destroying or altering irancontra documents 
helping falsify a chronology of usiran arms sales to deceive 
congress and illegally accepting a home security system 
by giving north what he called a chance to start something good 
and wholesome for the future the judge made it harder for norths 
supporters to portray their hero as a martyr 
gesell told north that while he was a lowranking subordinate 
working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors he 
didnt consider him blameless 
as you stand here now you are not the fall guy for this tragic 
breach of the public trust the judge said 
youre here now because of your own conduct when the truth was 
coming out gesell said of norths role in helping keep congress 
and others from finding out what was happening 
that said gesell gave north a suspended threeyear sentence 
imposed a 150000 fine and ordered him to work 1200 hours while on 
probation to help administrate a program to keep innercity youths 
off drugs 
in doing so the judge may have lowered the volume of the debate 
about whether north was a scapegoat and the victim of a hardnosed 
prosecutor determined to get scalps from the irancontra 
investigation 
the sentence also may relieve some of the pressure on president 
bush to pardon north now that the retired marine lieutenant colonel 
is not facing time behind bars 
fiftyeight house members asked bush to give north a pardon but 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president had not 
considered granting one 
a far more important thing in the north case was that legal 
accountability be established not that imprisonment be decreed 
said laurence tribe a harvard university law professor the 
sentence focuses the country on the right issue 
little would have been gained and much would have been lost by 
adding fuel to the fires of martyrdom in this case tribe said 
i dont think that anybody or very few people wanted all of the 
additional chaos in the country the additional hard feelings that 
we have too much of right now of having oliver north trundled off 
to jail waving the american flag said rep don edwards dcalif 
rep lee hamilton the indiana democrat who cochaired the 1987 
congressional hearings on the irancontra affair said most of his 
colleagues would not really feel comfortable seeing oliver north 
go to jail 
the judge urged north to put the controversy and political hoopla 
behind him 
you can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported 
yourself during these recent difficult years or you can turn around 
now and do something useful the judge said referring to norths 
appearances on the lecture circuit where he reportedly commands 
25000 for each performance 
i fashioned a sentence that punishes you it is my duty to do 
that gesell said but it leaves the future up to you 
indeed norths permanent disqualification from holding federal 
office for altering or destroying national security council 
documents will undermine efforts by his supporters to promote a 
political career 
the judge told north you still lack full understanding of 
how the public service has been tarnished 
nonetheless what you believe is your own business and jail 
would only harden your misconceptions about how government should 
work the judge said 
jail might have also hardened in the minds of many americans the 
image of a legal system indifferent to the achievements of a former 
marine they view as a folk hero

george bushs quick comebacks during his 
explosive interview with dan rather last year were not entirely 
offthecuff a new book says 
several of the presidential candidates responses came from cue 
cards scrawled by media consultant roger ailes cbs correspondent 
bob schieffer and gary paul gates say 
excerpts from their book the acting president ronald reagan 
and the supporting players who helped him create the illusion that 
held america spellbound appear in the july 8 issue of tv guide 
during the live january 1988 interview thenvice president bush 
told rather who had been questioning him on his role in the 
irancontra affair its not fair to judge my whole career by a 
rehash on iran how would you like it if i judged your career by 
those seven minutes when you walked off the set in new york 
bush referred to rathers walkoff from the cbs set in 1987 when 
a tennis match ran into news time it caused the network to go 
black for six minutes 
what people in the bureau and viewers at home could not see was 
that the response had not been entirely spontaneous as the 
interview progressed the crafty ailes had stationed himself beside 
the camera schieffer and gates wrote 
if bush seemed to be struggling for a response ailes would 
write out a key word in huge letters on his yellow legal pad and 
hold it just beneath the camera in bushs line of vision 
just before bush had shouted that it was not fair to judge his 
career on iran ailes had written out on his legal pad the word not 
fair to judge career yours three times during the interview 
bushs answer had come after ailes had prompted him with key words 
or phrases scribbled on the legal pad 
schieffer and gates said that before the interview bush had been 
stirred up by aides who wanted to end the candidates image as a 
wimp 
ailes was like a boxing coach cbs deputy bureau chief mary 
martin is quoted as saying it seemed like he just wanted to keep 
bush stirred up he was waving his arms and telling bush hes 
gonna sandbag you

a bomb today extensively damaged a london book 
store whose sister shop was attacked by arsonists in what 
authorities said was a campaign against salman rushdies novel the 
satanic verses 
many moslems consider the novel blasphemous and the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called in february for the author to be 
sought out and killed 
scotland yard said no one was injured in the 330 am blast from 
a homemade bomb inside collets book store on charing cross road in 
central london damage to the store was extensive windows were 
blown out and the explosion was followed by a fire 
collets said the fire destroyed the first floor and set off 
water sprinklers which destroyed thousands of books 
three improvised devices were found at the scene scotland 
yard said in a statement no further information was immediately 
available 
devices in police parlance normally means bombs but it was not 
clear whether these were in addition to the bomb that caused the 
explosion or whether one of the three devices exploded 
police said antiterrorist detectives are investigating but gave 
no indication who is believed responsible for the bombing no one 
claimed responsibility 
store manager carol taylor said the employees believe the 
attackers mistook the store for another branch of collets just 100 
yards away which stocks the satanic verses and was firebombed on 
april 9 
ms taylor said her store stopped selling rushdies bestseller 
after employees voted in december that it should not be stocked 
a sign reading we dont sell the satanic verses was placed 
in the window ms taylor said but it was removed last month 
because managers thought the controversy had died down 
i heard about the attack on the news this morning and i thought 
to myself theyve got the wrong shop ms taylor said adding 
the store probably will be shut for several months 
police said the april bombing was part of an intimidation 
campaign by moslem militants trying to halt sales of rushdies book 
rushdie a naturalized briton born in india has been in hiding 
since khomeini spiritual leader of irans fundamentalist 
revolution on feb 14 called on moslems to find and kill him 
two iranian moslem clergymen backed khomeinis call by offering a 
total of 52 million for rushdies death 
sales of the book in britain and elsewhere rocketed following the 
publicity created by khomeinis death call

deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
said today that while the united states and other western 
governments intend to assist poland and hungary in developing 
freemarket economies the pace of reform depends primarily on the 
east europeans themselves 
in the last analysis the decisions are going to have to be 
made in warsaw and budapest eagleburger said in a 
governmentsponsored telecast to europe as president bush prepared 
for a visit next week to the two soviet bloc capitals 
the president will be bringing some support eagleburger 
said how much and what kind i will leave until he gets there 
the state department official said the us purpose was to help 
the polish and hungarian economies adopt a freemarket system and to 
place decisions in the hands of private individuals instead of the 
communist governments 
but eagleburger seemed to indicate us support would be 
conditioned on changes by the polish and hungarian governments 
reform he said has to be done basically by the peoples and 
governments involved 
he also cautioned that reform should proceed at a measured pace 
without explaining what potential perils he foresaw 
the us interest in helping is that economic change will ease 
the divisions between east and west in europe and make further us 
and soviet troops reductions there possible eagleburger said 
bush last month proposed cutbacks to equal levels of 275000 
troops as well as reductions in tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear weapons soviet president mikhail s gorbachev earlier 
made his own dramatic proposals for cutbacks 
on related issues eagleburger said us policy calls for the 
reunification of west germany and east germany into one nation and 
he predicted the us senate would follow the lead of the house and 
approve easier credit terms for hungary

a federal judge today dismissed part of a lawsuit 
accusing rob lowe of enticing a teenage girl into sexual antics on 
videotape 
the girls mother lena arlene wilson had sued the heartthrob 
actor under a georgia law involving the seduction of a minor 
daughter and she also alleged that lowe intentionally inflicted 
emotional distress on her family 
us district judge g ernest tidwell who heard arguments last 
week on lowes request that the lawsuit be thrown out agreed to 
dismiss the claim of emotional distress saying the suit did not 
offer enough facts to warrant the allegation 
but the judge refused to dismiss the claim for damages for 
seduction 
the lawsuit stems from a videotape lowe purportedly made in his 
hotel suite while in atlanta last summer for the democratic national 
convention 
the tape widely circulated on atlantas party circuit and shown 
electronically censored on tv news apparently shows lowe ms 
wilsons daughter jan parsons and another woman in sexual 
escapades 
in may ms wilson sued contending lowe enticed her daughter 
then 16 into having sex with another woman while lowe videotaped 
them 
edgar neely iii an attorney for lowe had argued that the 
lawsuit should be dismissed because only a custodial parent may sue 
under georgia law neely said the girls parents are divorced and 
her father has custody 
but j hue henry ms wilsons attorney said that miss parsons 
was living with her mother at the time and that the tape humiliated 
the family and strained ms wilsons relationship with her daughter 
lowe 25 is the star of such films as st elmos fire and

lebanese christian and syrian army gunners 
blasted beiruts segregated residential suburbs with thunderous 
barrages of shellfire today police said four people were killed and 
eight wounded 
the armies ignored a joint appeal for a ceasefire by france and 
the soviet union the fighting ended a twoday lull that came after 
lebanese moslem forces reopened land crossings dividing the 
capitals christian and moslem sectors 
police said syrian troops attacked a ship cruising off the 
christian port of byblos the troops have enforced a 16week 
blockade to prevent the christians from getting arms supplies 
the ship is cruising back and forth three miles off byblos with 
shells falling around it said a police spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations he said he did not have details of 
the ships identity owners or cargo byblos is 20 miles north of 
beirut 
the mainly christian lebanese army accused the syrians of 
provoking the battle with early morning shelling of residential 
centers in the 310squaremile christian enclave where a million 
people are trapped 
a spokesman for maronite gen michel aoun said his gunners 
responded only against syrian artillery and rocket emplacements 
but howitzer rounds also rained on areas that do not harbor 
batteries 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity called on 
residents of moslem west beirut to stay away from areas around 
syrian artillery 
the bombardment caught people in the morning rush hour 
panicking motorists honked their horns hysterically and sped in 
all directions pedestrians dove for cover and shopkeepers hurriedly 
lowered their shutters against flying shrapnel 
rockets flew overhead and artillery blasts shook both sectors as 
the city streets emptied 
the police spokesman said four people were killed and eight 
wounded bringing the toll to 401 killed and 1546 wounded since 
fighting began march 8 between aouns mostly christian troops and 
allied syrian and druse forces 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president francois 
mitterrand of france appealed wednesday for a ceasefire to be 
rigorously respected by all lebanese factions 
syria is moscows chief arab ally paris which ruled lebanon 
until its independence in 1943 traditionally supports the 
christians but has assumed a neutral role in the latest fighting 
in a joint statement ending a visit to france by gorbachev the 
two leaders expressed support for an arab league initiative to 
settle the 14year civil war but also said their countries can help 
notably in the framework of the united nations security council 
france and the soviet union are among the five permanent members 
of the council britain china and the united states are the others 
gorbachev and mitterrand said they are convinced that lebanon 
must remain sovereign independent united with its territorial 
integrity respected 
aoun has pledged to drive out the 40000 syrian troops in 
lebanon charging they have violated their 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the moslems but his 20000 
troops are outnumbered 4to1 by those of syria and allied lebanese 
moslem militias

a palestinian shouting allahu akbar 
grabbed the steering wheel of a crowded passenger bus today and 
forced it into a deep ravine where it burst into flames police 
said fourteen people were reported killed and 27 injured including 
five americans 
police commissioner david kraus said other victims were believed 
still trapped inside the bus which was gutted by flames and lay on 
its roof down a slope off the tel avivjerusalem highway 
allahu akbar or god is great has become a battle cry of 
the nearly 19monthold palestinian uprising 
prime minister yitzhak shamir called the incident a shocking 
disaster the fruit of a disgusting mind hatefilled we have 
reached the height of madness a product of flowing hatred 
engendered by endless incitement 
it doesnt matter much if this is a result of an organized plan 
or a result of the atmosphere some groups create he said on army 
radio i think we will find a way to take care of incidents like 
this 
an arab passenger believed to have grabbed the steering wheel was 
arrested he was at jerusalems hadassah hospital where director 
avi israeli said he was treated for head and chest injuries 
police said the man would be questioned about his motive after he 
recovered they said he was from the occupied territories but was 
not carryng an identification card 
a reporter saw rescuers remove 17 body bags from the bus scene 
but it was uncertain if they contained full or partial remains 
other bags containing victims belongings also were brought out 
of the ravine including glasses shoes canteens a purse and 
wallets and a book of psalms 
at least five of the injured were americans officials at 
hadassah hospital said they did not identify the american victims 
by name 
it was the worst such incident since march 11 1978 when 
palestinian guerrillas from the plos fatah faction infiltrated 
israel from the sea and hijacked a bus on the coastal highway 
thirtythree people were killed and 82 were wounded 
angry israelis called a popular radio talk show and demanded the 
death penalty for terrorists 
the bus driver interviewed from his hospital bed on army radio 
said a bearded arab man of about 25 approached him suddenly and 
grabbed the wheel 
i thought he wanted to ask me something like everybody does on 
the way but he jumped on the steering wheel shouted allahu 
akbar and pulled it with all his strength to the right said the 
driver moshe elul 
elul said he tried with all his strength to turn the wheel back 
to the left but he simply sat down and put his legs on the front 
dashboard to give him support and thats how he dragged us down 
i woke up when the bus started to turn really sharply to the 
right said victor assal 23 of bethesda md i saw people 
screaming up front all of a sudden the ground turned 90 degrees 
the first thing i did was grab for my gun then i lost 
consciousness 
assal who emigrated to israel last year and now serves in the 
army said he was on his way to visit his mother in jerusalem when 
the bus overturned 
todays crash occurred at 1140 am the redandwhite bus of the 
staterun egged company one of many that makes the 45minute run 
between tel aviv and jerusalem daily broke through a steel barrier 
on a straight section of the fourlane highway near this israeli 
arab village about seven miles west of jerusalem 
witnesses said the bus which seats about 50 people was full 
the number of passengers could be higher however since people 
often stand on the ride 
a witness identified only as reuven said on israel radio that he 
pulled the driver from the bus and the driver said how did he do 
this to me 
an army rescue team was brought in and dozens of motorists left 
their vehicles to climb into the ravine and recover victims some 
scaling down on ropes orthodox students in black hats and long 
coats rushed from a nearby jewish seminary to help 
i ran across the road and saw bodies strewn all down the 
ravine said yitzhak cohen 44 a businessman who was driving past 
when the crash occurred 
he said he heard a young female soldier in the bus screaming 
save me save me and he helped her crawl out of the bus 
through a window 
it was unclear how quickly the bus caught fire the gutted 
vehicle was resting on its roof at the ravines bottom and army 
teams brought by helicopter were assisting in the rescue 
injured victims were being taken out of the ravine by small huey 
helicopters and transferred to a larger ch53 chopper that landed on 
the roadway they were being evacuated to hospitals 
police roped off the roadway but traffic was being rerouted on a 
side road through abu ghosh 
daniel mordechai a 48yearold carpenter from ramle said he 
arrived moments after it happened 
at first there was a small fire like a camp fire then there 
was a huge explosion we didnt want to get too close to the bus 
because we were afraid of getting hurt so we helped those who were 
blown out of the bus he said 
the crash came five weeks after a lone arab wielding a knife 
fatally stabbed two elderly jews and injured three in downtown 
jerusalem 
the murderer nidal zaloum 22 of the west bank town of 
ramallah was sentenced in june to life in prison for the attack he 
had shouted allahu akbar when he attacked his victims

janos kadar who took power after the 
soviets crushed the 1956 revolt and steered hungary through relative 
prosperity until moderates forced him out during hard times died 
today he was 77 
kadars death came as the supreme court canceled all charges 
against former premier imre nagy and his associates who led the 1956 
uprising and were executed under kadar on charges of high treason 
the decision signified nagys legal rehabilitation 
kadar the communist who led hungary for 32 years until last year 
and who ultimately came to symbolize resistance to democratic 
change died this morning after a prolonged grave illness the 
staterun mti news agency said 
the agency said the ruling communist party had with profound 
sorrow informed its members and the hungarian people of 
comrade kadars death 
mti said funeral arrangements would be announced later it was 
considered unlikely he would be buried before president bushs visit 
next week 
hungarian television broadcast a halfhour documentary on his 
life this morning and two budapest radio stations canceled all 
programming containing rock n roll music and light entertainment 
kadar was hospitalized monday with pneumonia and severe breathing 
and circulatory problems 
he was first reported gravely ill in april and in may lost his 
post as honorary party chairman as well as a seat on the partys 
central committee which wrote him a letter criticizing mistakes 
during his lengthy rule 
since he was replaced by karoly grosz in may 1988 as party 
general secretary kadars political legacy has come under fierce 
attack and the communists have moved rapidly to embrace democratic 
change promising contested elections and a multiparty system 
after guiding hungary in the 1970s to relative prosperity and 
freedom dubbed goulash communism in the west kadar came to be 
seen as an impediment to further reform in the 1980s 
he will perhaps be most remembered for his 1962 statement to a 
rally in the industrial town of csepel those who are not against 
us are with us 
by the mid1980s hungarys economy was in a tailspin and the 
soviet union was undergoing a political rebirth under mikhail s 
gorbachev 
kadar fell out of favor in ruling circles 
in a published response may 10 that mti said was kadars last 
public statement the former leader admitted mistakes but said 
my actions were guided by good intentions 
in apparent reference to the 1958 execution of nagy and hundreds 
of others after the 1956 revolt kadar said in the letter i hope 
that future generations will assess more objectively the results 
and errors of the past 30 years 
nagys remains initially placed in an unmarked grave were 
reburied in a governmentsanctioned ceremony june 16 that drew 
hundreds of thousands of mourners marked his de facto political 
rehabilitation 
kadars change in fortunes was typical of a long career that 
began in 1931 when he joined the illegal communist party as a 
19yearold from a peasant background with only eight years of 
schooling 
kadar was jailed and seemingly forgotten after a party purge in 
1951 but was rehabilitated after the downfall of his stalinist 
rival matyas rakosi 
while in power kadar was conciliatory and ruthless by turns 
in an interview with the associated press in 1965 he made a 
prophetic comment you have strummed a string to the effect that 
when the monolithic unity of the communist countries is ended what 
is left 
kadar was born may 26 1912 in the adriatic port of fiume which 
was renamed rijeka and became part of yugoslavia when the 
austrohungarian empire broke up 
he advanced through communist party ranks to central committee 
membership in may 1942 having spent more than three years in prison 
on various political charges 
after the communist takeover in 1948 kadar became interior 
minister in rakosis stalinist regime but it was never clear whether 
he controlled the feared political police 
rakosi kept a jealous eye on kadars progress and had him 
arrested in 1951 on charges of espionage and treason when stalin 
died in 1953 rakosis grip on power began to slip kadar was freed 
and rehabilitated the next year 
growing discontent led to rakosis ouster in july 1956 but 
dissatisfaction continued and a popular uprising began within three 
months tens of thousands of students filled the streets demanding 
a free press withdrawal of soviet troops and a multiparty politics 
kadar became party leader a few days later left the capital and 
announced that he had established a rival government to that of 
premier nagy 
on nov 3 he asked the kremlin to help end the revolt 
red army forces moved in and kadar instituted two years of 
repression nagy and his associates were executed in june 1958 
less than four months after nagys death kadar embarked on 
economic reform that brought growing prosperity and increasingly 
cordial ties with the west 
a reticent man who liked chess and reading kadar has been 
described as a sad ascetic man with an intense face a 
dedicated hunter he told the ap hunting trips with soviet leader 
nikita khrushchev were no diplomatic pretexts for me 
if you enter a wood even as much as a meter speech stops he 
said you dont make a noise you dont talk in the woods there 
is silence that is why i like it 
kadar played a shadowy role in the shortlived czechoslovak 
liberalization of 1968 it was said that he opposed intervention in 
czechoslovakia but hungarian soldiers joined the sovietled 
invasion 
his reforms in the 1970s foreshadowed the modernization 
gorbachev now is pursuing in the soviet union less central 
planning more competition and weeding out or streamlining of 
unprofitable state concerns 
economic problems increased however by the late 1980s 
inflation was 18 percent and the foreign debt 18 billion the 
highest per capita in the soviet bloc large price increases and 
other austerity measures fed discontent and the perception that 
kadar was largely to blame 
eight months after grosz replaced kadar parliament legalized 
independent political movements 
and this year the party decided the 1956 revolt was a popular 
uprising not the counterrevolution it had been called for 33 years 
on june 16 nagys remains were reburied with honor 
in a serialized interview with the weekly magyarorszag kadar 
said nagys tragedy is my own personal tragedy as well 
he is survived by his wife maria

the arab league today declared that israels 
plan for elections in the occupied territories was dead and urged 
the united states to abandon support for the initiative 
the leagues envoy clovis maksoud said he would meet friday 
with state department officials and ask the united states to support 
the convening of an international conference to bring about peace 
talks between israel and its arab neighbors 
maksoud said at a news conference that the decision by israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir to accede to demands by his hardline 
supporters had rendered useless his proposal for elections among the 
17 million palestinians under israeli occupation in the west bank 
and the gaza strip 
the shamir plan was devised as a public relations gimmick to 
defuse public outrage against israels inhuman and illegal 
measures in crushing the 18month palestinian uprising maksoud 
said 
i hope the us administration is sufficiently jolted by this 
rude rebuke of its support for its protege to undertake a 
longoverdue and profound reassessment of its support for the 
shamir plan 
the next step should be for the united states to remove its 
protective shield from the shamir government and join european 
countries and the soviet union in supporting an international peace 
conference 
maksoud said he hopes president bushs upcoming trip to europe 
will sensitize him to the support of us allies for an 
international conference and make him more willing to distance 
himself from the intransigent excesses of israel 
shamirs election plan should now be turned into a referendum 
among israelis to determine whether a majority supports the 
rightwing prime minister maksoud said 
the envoy also said an attack thursday by an arab who plunged an 
israeli bus into a ravine reportedly killing 14 people was 
testimony to the exasperation of palestinians living under israeli 
occupation 
maksoud said that while such acts are not authorized by the 
leadership of the palestinian uprising and are not to be condoned 
at times they have to be understood

american scientists proclaimed success today in a 
pioneering experiment to detect the presence of a nuclear warhead 
aboard a soviet warship in the black sea 
the success of the experiment if confirmed by other scientists 
could bolster soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs argument that 
it is possible to verify the presence of nuclear weapons aboard 
ships and submarines 
it was very successful said tom cochran an american 
physicist with the natural resource defense council a liberal 
washington group that organized the experiment with the soviet state 
academy of sciences 
but it remains possible for either side to hide weapons or shield 
them against detection by the type of devices used wednesday 
cochran said 
washington has balked at soviet demands that the proposed 
strategic arms reduction treaty which would cut superpower atomic 
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent include a curb on 
nucleartipped cruise missiles aboard submarines 
us navy officers say they will not allow soviets aboard 
american submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed to 
determine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional or 
nuclear warhead 
soviet technology lags far behind american in the sophisticated 
missiles which can be launched very close to an enemys shore can 
fly at altitudes too low for radar detection and deliver a nuclear 
punch without warning against key coastal areas 
in wednesdays black sea experiment soviet government and 
private american scientists used a variety of radiation detection 
devices to measure the emission of neutrons and gamma rays from a 
nuclear wearhead on an ssn12 subsonic cruise missile aboard the 
soviet missile cruiser slava 
among observers were three american congressmen all democrats 
reps john spratt a member of the house armed services committee 
from south carolina bob carr from michigan and james olin of 
virginia they were in yalta 750 miles south of moscow and not 
available for comment immediately 
cochran and other american scientists from princeton and stanford 
universities made their measurements with portable detectors placed 
alongside the deck launcher less than a yard from the warhead 
simultaneously soviet scientists from the academys institutes 
of geochemistry and earth physics used radiation detection devices 
carried in a military helicopter and a troop transport said cochran 
all the systems tested successfully cochran said in a 
telephone interview 
we detected the signature of the nuclear warhead in the 
launcher he said we used a portable germanium detector that we 
placed alongside the launcher and got a strong signal from the u235 
and the plutonium in the warhead plutonium and u232 a form of 
uranium are two main elements used in nuclear weapons 
at the same time soviet scientists circling in a helicopter 65 
yards above the slava used a neutron detector that indicated the 
presence of plutonium on the ship 
soviet scientists aboard a troop transport circling 70 yards from 
the cruiser used a sodium iodide gamma ray detector that registered 
radiation from the warhead said cochran 
none of the tools by themselves is adequate to verify limits on 
nuclear weapons so you have to put together a package to cover the 
shortcomings of various systems he said 
cochran said the scientists want to do a similar experiment in 
the united states but the american navy has refused to cooperate

the conservative mayor of beijing condemned recent 
activism by chinas intellectuals and hinted at the beginning of a 
farreaching purge of the educated elite 
mayor chen xitong also leveled more accusations at ousted 
communist party chief zhao ziyang charging that zhao connived 
to promote the political turmoil that climaxed with the massacre at 
tiananmen square last month 
mayor chen made his comments friday in a speech to the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature the official xinhua news 
agency released the text of the speech today 
also today the communist party newspaper peoples daily 
expressed outrage at recent moves to impose additional sanctions on 
china by members of the us congress who sanctimoniously claim to 
be the guardians of human rights 
chen said that in september certain hong kong newspapers and 
journals began boosting zhao and debunking senior leader deng 
xiaoping 
the essence of the dialogue was to whip up public opinion for 
covering up zhao ziyangs mistakes keeping his position and power 
and pushing on bourgeois liberalization even more unbridledly 
chen said 
he attacked a series of forums speeches and open letters 
organized since december by intellectuals including dissident fang 
lizhi who took refuge at the us embassy in beijing after the 
military crackdown and magazine editor ge yang and ideologist su 
shaozhi who gathered to discuss political questions 
some of the intellectuals chen named are known to have escaped 
china or gone underground in the last month while others have been 
arrested by naming individual intellectuals and describing their 
activities in detail chens speech appeared to signal a widening 
purge of intellectuals 
zhao all along tolerated and connived at the increasingly 
evident signs of turmoilthus facilitating the formation and 
development of the turmoil chen said 
he said that other party leaders had urged that zhao call a 
meeting april 23 of the partys top body the standing committee of 
the politburo but that instead of accepting this suggestion zhao 
went golfing as if nothing had happened 
because he took such an attitude the party and the government 
lost a chance to stop the turmoil 
zhao was sacked after being accused of trying to split the party 
and supporting the studentled demonstrators 
he has been stripped of his party and government posts but 
chens occasional reference to him as comrade and similar 
references in the official press indicate he retains his party 
membership 
chen also repeated government charges of foreign influence in the 
demonstrations saying political forces outside the chinese 
mainland and in foreign countries had a hand in the turmoil from the 
very beginning 
chinas foreign ministry today rejected a us embassy protest 
over an army attack last month on diplomatic housing xinhua said 
the ministry called groundless the embassys charge that the 
attack was premeditated and targeted certain apartments including 
those of american diplomats 
the chinese government also expressed indignation at recent moves 
to impose sanctions against beijing by members of the us congress 
the house of representatives voted june 29 to suspend trade and 
development programs prohibit sale of police equipment and suspend 
transfers of nuclear technology the senate has yet to act on the 
bill 
to those people in the american congress who deliberately 
distort the fact and interfere with chinas internal affairs we 
cannot but express our indignation said the peoples daily 
troops armed with semiautomatic rifles and backed by tanks 
fought their way to tiananmen square june 34 leaving nearly 300 
dead according to chinese government estimates western and private 
chinese estimates say as many as 3000 people died 
any sovereign country would use the same legal and reasonable 
methods when faced with a situation of this magnitude the 
peoples daily said 
the liberation daily shanghais communist party newspaper said 
the united states also has used force against student protesters 
noting that the national guard shot to death four antivietnam war 
protesters at kent state university in 1970 
chinese media have concentrated on attacking the united states 
although other western governments have voiced strong criticism of 
chinas military action and imposed sanctions as well 
beijing especially has singled out the us governmentrun voice 
of america radio network which has an estimated audience in china 
of tens of millions the government last month expelled a voa 
correspondent accusing him of making false reports and violating 
martial law

a 20inch crack found in an aging united airlines 
jet prompted the government to order immediate inspections of the 
nations oldest boeing 727s 
united mechanics at stapleton international airport located the 
crack june 26 during a routine inspection of the 25yearold plane 
in a directive issued friday the federal aviation administration 
ordered the owners of 46 other boeing 727100 jets built in 1963 and 
1964 to inspect them within two weeks and report any problems 
the directive was made by telegram a method used in cases 
considered urgent the faa noted that cracks in the fuselage skin 
could lead to rapid decompression of the plane 
the 727 no longer manufactured was the alltime bestselling 
commercial jet before being supplanted by the boeing 737 tom cole 
of boeing said there are 1765 727s in service 
inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the 
skin was made thicker on later models cole said he said he did not 
know which airlines were affected but that most of the first 47 
planes went to us carriers 
structural problems in older aircraft usually can be anticipated 
often through computers but the one in the united jet was in an 
unexpected place cole said the crack was below the passenger 
windows and between the front edge of the wing and the cabin door 
the jet one of the oldest in uniteds fleet was repaired and 
resumed flying said faa spokesman david duff 
a tear in an aloha airlines boeing 737 in hawaii last year 
crippled the jet and swept one flight attendant to her death 
earlier this year a fuselage tear in the oldest boeing 747 in 
uniteds fleet swept nine passengers to their deaths over hawaii a 
faulty cargo door is thought to have caused the accident 
the inspection order isnt expected to affect scheduling

capital today the seventh day of quakes that have burst water pipes 
and shaken the tiles off roofs in a seaside tourist town officials 
said 
the meteorological agency said 2506 tremors including a quake 
measuring 43 on the richter scale and 66 others felt by citizens 
were recorded off the peninsula in the first 20 hours of the day 
they brought to 11286 the number of tremors reported in the area 
since friday they were focused at depths of 25 to 31 miles under 
the seabed and about four miles northwest of ito a seaside town 60

a 13member subcommittee of the governments coordinating 
committee for earthquake prediction met in an emergency session 
wednesday and called for a close watch to determine the potential 
for a major earthquake 
the tremors are believed to have been caused by magma movements 
in the volcanic activity developing undersea off the peninsula since 
the fall of 1978 the seismic levels in the current series of 
tremors are considerably strong when compared to the previous ones 
reported in the same area almost every year during the past 
decade said kiyoo mogi a university of tokyo professor who heads 
the subcommittee 
mogi said in a telephone interview that in the same general area 
nearly 17000 tremors including some 290 felt by citizens occurred 
over a onemonth period that began in late july last year 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its 
epicenter an earthquake of 5 is capable of causing considerable 
damage in populated areas

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
newly announced hardline conditions for dealing with the 
palestinians have closed the door to peace plo spokesman ahmed 
abdulrahman said today 
he said the nearly 19monthold uprising of palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip would be escalated 
because this is the only answer to intransigence 
the palestine liberation organization spokesman said shamir had 
also closed the door in the face of president bush and secretary 
of state james a baker iii the only ones working for peace 
these efforts now face total failure he said 
in washington the arab league declared israels election plan 
dead and urged the united states to abandon support for the 
initiative 
clovis maksoud the leagues envoy said he would meet friday 
with state department officials and ask washington to support the 
convening of an international conference to bring about peace talks 
between israel and its arab neighbors 
i hope the us administration is sufficiently jolted by this 
rude rebuke of its support for its protege to undertake a 
longoverdue and profound reassessment of its support for the 
shamir plan maksoud said 
in a speech wednesday shamir ruled out several peace options 
considered to be attractive to the palestinians 
he said elections in the occupied territories for palestinians 
who would then negotiate with israel on autonomy could be held only 
after the uprising had been crushed 
he also said palestinian arabs living in east jerusalem would not 
be allowed to vote in any elections and vowed to continue building 
settlements in the territories 
shamirs new tough stance subdued a challenge to his leadership 
of the rightwing likud bloc 
abdulrahman said shamirs speech had endangered the chances 
for peace there is a complete rejection of american and 
palestinian efforts to bring about peace 
he said the palestinian leadership would meet within the next few 
days to consider their position in the light of shamirs speech 
we will be contacting the american side to hear what they are 
going to do abdulrahman said 
he also said the palestinians would ask the five permanent 
members of the un security council to take steps to convene an 
international conference on the middle east now that shamir has 
blocked the american initiative which was the only initiative going 
and which had soviet support

authorities have arrested a lebanese 
student on suspicion of plotting to bomb israeli and american 
targets in west germany law enforcement officials said today 
erwin hoesl an investigator for the bavarian criminal office in 
munich said the 21yearold suspect is a fanatical shiite 
moslem and that investigators uncovered the alleged plot just in 
time before any attacks could be carried out 
according to hoesl the suspect was apparently under contract 
with arab terrorist organizations in the middle east he was 
arrested june 22 in a raid on his apartment in darmstadt 20 miles 
south of frankfurt many american military facilities are located in 
both cities 
bavarian authorities declined to reveal the suspects name but 
said he has been a physics student at darmstadt technical university 
the munichbased sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper however 
reported the suspects first name and the first letter of his last 
name bassan m 
it said he has lived in darmstadt since 1985 and that 
investigators found instructions for making a bomb in his apartment 
police said no explosives were found 
an earlier bavarian police statement said the june 22 raid on the 
students apartment turned up evidence that bombing attacks were 
planned on certain israeli and american targets which it did not 
identify 
police said documents were found that indicate he scouted out 
israeli and american establishments for middle east contractors 
for possible bombing attacks 
the newspaper report said the suspect was allegedly helping to 
set up imminent bombing attacks in munich 180 miles southeast 
of darmstadt on the office of israels airline el al the israeli 
trade center and the citys jewish community center 
the newspaper added that an englishlanguage list of israeli 
and jewish religious establishments in the federal republic west 
germany were found during the raid in darmstadt 
the paper said the contractors are not in this country and 
therefore not reachable by german police bavarian police declined 
to say who had hired the suspect 
authorities in september 1988 intercepted several photos that 
were to be sent to beirut showing israeli offices in munich and 
accompanied by an arablanguage text officials said 
after months of work in cooperation with hesse state police 
bavarian authorities were able to identify the suspect the 
statement added

city streets have gotten a little meaner and a 
lot more dangerous in the 11 years since elizabeth swados put a 
group of young people on stage in runaways a musical collage 
about kids who ran away from home 
for the red sneaks now on view at offbroadways perry 
street theater miss swados again looks at the material seductions 
available to the lost children of the big city 
her vision is remarkably clear unsentimental and disturbing 
three qualities you wouldnt expect in a musical loosely based on 
the red shoes that faustian tale of a ballerinas obsession 
with dance but in collaboration with her young performers she has 
put together a gritty little contemporary musical that combines pop 
and rock with more traditional musical comedy 
her score augmented by two rap songs written by several of the 
actors in the show ranks among the best work she has done one 
number sad and lonely child is particularly affecting 
in this 70minute version dedre a young resident of a new york 
welfare hotel sells her soul for the red sneakers a magical pair 
of shoes dusted with red glitter she is seduced by shawn a 
devilish young man who raps his way into her heart 
their tale is amplified by a chorus of six other youngsters 
children who sing their way through a long list of urban victims and 
social ills stupid macho junkie boy and stupid little babies 
filled with babies go two of their topical chants 
these kids know the consequences of their actions but that 
doesnt stop them from experimenting with sex and drugs their world 
is shaped by the glamour of television and film what they see on a 
screen is what they want and will do anything to get 
dedre guevara is fine even touching as the doomed heroine 
seduced by shawn benjamin a strutting streetwise satan they get 
strong support from the other cast members particularly kenny lund 
who matteroffactly reduces kiddie porn and the selling of crack to 
a question of economics 
the choreography by arthur fredric is mostly of the enthusiastic 
footstomping variety but it works on gw merciers set of a 
decaying tenement miss swados who also directed moves her young 
charges around the small stage with style and speed 
the red sneaks is contemporary musical theater at its best a 
morality tale that doesnt preach but still manages to deliver a

the ordinance grants visitation rights to partners of hospital 
patients and bereavement leave for city employees whose partners 
die a task force is considering whether the ordinance also entitles 
unmarried partners of city employees to full health coverage

redefined the timehonored and hallowed nature of the family flying

mcilhenny a pastor at the first orthodox presbyterian church and 
rabbi lionel feldman the petition drive also was backed by several 
roman catholic parishes

defense minister yitzhak rabin said today 
that his labor party is considering pulling out of the government to 
protest the tough new conditions prime minister yitzhak shamir put 
on his peace initiative 
three leftwing parties filed noconfidence motions against the 
government in parliament claiming the decision wednesday by 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc had foiled chances of starting peace 
talks 
ministers of the centerleft labor party convened a special 
meeting at party headquarters in tel aviv but it was postponed 
after an israeli bus drove into a ravine killing more than a dozen 
people police said the accident occurred when a palestinian 
passenger grabbed the bus steering wheel 
avi gil a spokesman for labor leader and finance minister shimon 
peres said the partys 100member bureau would convene monday to 
decide what course of action to take 
shamir sought to soften his partys decision by announcing plans 
to do the utmost to find palestinians as partners for middle 
east peace talks 
what likud decided was about implementation of the plan not to 
prevent talks contacts or discussions with palestinians to put this 
thing on track said shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
the peace plan introduced earlier this year by rabin and later 
adopted by shamir called for palestinians in the occupied 
territories to elect representatives to talks with israel on an 
autonomy plan for the west bank and gaza strip later negotiations 
would decide the territorys final status 
in response to pressures by likud hardliners led by industry 
minister ariel sharon shamir on wednesday ruled out several peace 
options considered attractive to palestinians 
the party adopted them as a policy but shamir aides insisted 
this did not affect the formal elections proposal 
shamir explicitly ruled out a chief condition of palestinians 
the participation of 140000 arabs in east jerusalem in the 
elections 
he also rejected establishment of a palestinian state and said 
the balloting could not be held until the nearly 19month 
palestinian uprising ended the revolt has claimed the lives of 543 
arabs and 23 israelis 
what the likud has embraced first of all is neutralizing 
chances of getting the peace initiative off the ground rabin said 
on israel radio 
there are doubts about whether there will be room for a unity 
government or definitely for labors participation he added in a 
separate interview with army radio 
four other prominent labor ministers including peres also 
suggested likuds decision meant they should consider leaving the 
coalition government 
shamir responded to labors threats by telling the daily maariv 
i hope labor will remain in the government they have no reason to 
change their position but it is all up to them 
if labor leaves the cabinet shamir could be forced call new 
national elections for lack of a sound base of support in the 
120member parliament 
but israeli newspaper editorials made light of labors threats 
and analysts reasoned that both peres and rabin were not assured 
victory if elections were held 
the hadashot newspaper said israels main problem now would be 
expected us displeasure with shamirs statements shamir emerged 
unscathed from the test he faced in likuds central committee the 
american test is likely to be no easier and maybe harder 
but shamirs spokesman pazner stressed that the premiers speech 
wednesday showed no change in his attitude about what should be 
done to advance the peace process 
what happened yesterday was a reiteration of likuds position 
there was nothing new pazner added we want to make clear that 
we continue to be committed to the initiative and to do the utmost 
to find partners 
the plo which already has criticized the elections plan for 
failing to guarantee them a future independent state said shamirs 
speech closed the door to peace 
in tunis plo spokesman ahmad abdel rahman also said the speech 
closed the door in the face of president bush and secretary of 
state baker the only ones working for peace these efforts now 
face total failure 
in a related development the maariv daily said that before the 
likud meeting the united states and plo decided to upgrade the 
level of the dialogue they renewed in december and were considering 
moving the talks from tunis to cairo 
asked about the report pazner replied we hear rumors about 
the upgrade and we regret this very much

new yorks highest court ruled today that a 
partner in a longterm homosexual relationship can take over the 
couples rentcontrolled apartment when the lover who signed the 
lease dies 
in a 42 ruling the court of appeals ordered a lower court to 
reconsider its decision to evict a new york city man from a 
rentcontrolled apartment he shared for a decade with his nowdead 
lover 
in doing so the court expanded the definition of a family as 
it applies to new yorks rentcontrol laws the word is crucial 
because state law says only family members may take over 
rentcontrolled apartments when the tenant of record dies 
the court said that the definition should include adults who show 
longterm financial and emotional commitment to each other even if 
they dont fit the traditional meaning of a family 
todays decision is the first time any top state court in the 
nation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of a 
family according to american civil liberties union lawyer william 
rubenstein who argued the case 
todays decision is a groundbreaking victory for lesbian and 
gay men rubenstein said it marks the most important single 
step forward in american law toward legal recognition of lesbian and 
gay relationships 
the ruling comes amid growing fears within the gay community 
about housing discrimination because of aids its especially 
important in new york city which has the greatest number of aids 
cases in the nation and a tight housing market 
rubenstein said the ruling would also apply to unmarried 
heterosexual partners and poor families who cant afford to 
formalize their relationships 
we conclude that the term family should not be rigidly 
restricted to those people who have formalized their relationship by 
obtaining for instance a marriage certificate or an adoption 
order judge vito titone wrote 
furthermore titone said that state rentcontrol law protections 
against sudden eviction should not rest on fictitious legal 
distinctions or genetic history but instead should find its 
foundation in the reality of family life

a truly unique chance is opening for europeans to play a role 
in building a new world one that would be worthy of their past of 
their economic and spiritual potential 
it also is the specific feature of the situation in europe that 
it can cope with all this live up to the expectations of its 
peoples and do its international duty at the new state of world 
history only by recognizing its wholeness and by making the right 
conclusions 
europe experienced more than once the attempts at unification by

on europes different social systems 
the idea of european unification should be collectively thought 
over once again i know that many people in the west perceive the 
main difficulty in the existence of two social systems 
yet the difficulty lies elsewhere it lies in the rather 
widespread belief or in the political objective that overcoming 
the division of europe means overcoming socialism 
but this is a course for confrontation if not something worse 
there will be no european unity along these lines the fact that the 
states of europe belong to different social systems is a reality

fbi agents and a team of energy department 
specialists experts today entered a federal nuclear fuel facility in 
upstate new york to investigate possible violations of environmental 
and safety rules the department said 
dennis c vacco the us attorney for the western district of 
new york said the fbi agents on the site about 50 miles south of 
buffalo were looking for evidence of possible criminal violations 
of federal laws governing hazardous waste storage 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said the investigation was 
the first of 17 such probes by energy department specialists over 
the next year at federal nuclear facilities the energy department 
took over operation of the new york stateowned plant in 1980 
last month fbi agents raided an energy department nuclear 
weapons plants in colorado in search of criminal violations of waste 
storage laws doe employees were not allowed to participate in that 
raid and moore said last week that the resulting bad publicity had 
triggered a new effort to cooperate in such probes 
moore said there is currently no evidence of wastehandling 
violations at the new york facility known as the west valley 
demonstration project 
christina sankey a department spokeswoman said the plant has 
been operated since 1966 and currently is being decommissioned and 
decontaminated the facility which reprocessed nuclear fuel for 
power plants during the 1970s contains an unspecified amount of 
lowlevel highlevel and other categories of radioactive waste 
ms sankey said the investigation could last several weeks she 
said the environmental protection agency also was participating in 
the investigation

new yorks highest court ruled unanimously 
today that prisoners serving long sentences can be stripped of their 
parental rights if they fail to find a relative to care for their 
children 
put simply relegating a child to foster care until he or she 
is no longer a child is not a viable plan and more importantly 
it deprives the child of that quality of permanency found by the 
legislature to be so essential to proper growth and development 
wrote judge fritz alexander of the court of appeals 
the 70 ruling means that willie bethea serving two 25 
yearstolife murder sentences cannot block the adoption of his 
13yearold son and 9yearold daughter the ruling also affects 
another inmate identified in court papers only as gregory f and 
his sons ages 9 and 8 gregory f is serving 10to20 years for 
armed robbery 
in both cases foster parents sought to adopt the children 
i dont believe i lost said ruth cassell betheas lawyer 
youre screwed if youre an inmate 
she said she had not yet read the decision or decided whether to 
appeal 
in 1983 the legislature gave inmates a say in whether their 
children could be adopted before that they had no parental rights 
however inmates were expected to maintain contact with their 
children and plan for their futures 
while the court of appeals noted that the bethea and gregory f 
had regularly visited with their children it also said they had 
been unable to find family members to care for the youngsters

evangelicals a growing force in christianity open a global 
conference next week to refine strategies for spreading the faith 
some aiming for it to be offered to everyone by ad 2000 
that widely asserted target sometimes is considered more as a 
stimulus than a potentially accomplishable task but the fervor for 
working at it is mounting in many church quarters 
the countdown has begun goes the title on a book of 
interdenominational planning discussions held early this year in 
singapore but the missions success was seen to require some course 
corrections 
we see afresh that cooperation and partnership are absolute 
necessities if the great commission is going to be fufilled by the 
year 2000 the participants said 
up to now they said pride prejudice competition and 
disobedience have hindered our generation from effectively working 
at the task of world evangelization 
the great commission refers to christs parting instructions 
to present his message to all peoples evangelicals have a special 
passion for proclaiming that message and eliciting belief in it 
advancing that task beyond any particular time frame is the 
objective of the international congress on world evangelization 
which is meeting tuesday through july 20 in manila the philippines 
evangelist billy graham had been scheduled to give the opening 
address but canceled the manila appearance in favor of extending 
his mission 89 in london his office said 
more than 4000 evangelicalminded christians of both mainline 
historic churches and smaller evangelically oriented groups in 190 
countries are expected to make the philippines gathering one of the 
largest of its kind 
it has been dubbed lausanne ii a successor to a similar 
gathering in lausanne switzerland in 1974 which was convened by 
grahams organization and spawned a continuing interlinked movement 
the rev leighton ford of charlotte nc chairman of the 
lausanne committee taht is sponsoring the this years congress says 
the session will address new crucial issues that are affecting 
evangelization 
secularism is rampant and were suffering from a lack of 
evangelical cohesion he said 
he said the meeting will bring together the many streams of 
evangelism examine new issues and challenges and plan 
strategies for a great new thrust of evangelization in the closing 
decade of this century 
planners say participants are coming both from major protestant 
and orthodox churches in the world council of churches and also 
those outside it plus some roman catholic evangelization 
specialists 
about 200 organizations have set the timeclock at least 
symbolically on getting the christian message spread worldwide by 
the year 2000 but that is only one note in the more broadly 
concerned manila conference 
while emphasizing evangelism and cooperation in it the 
conference also is to grapple with social issues such as poverty 
racism urbanization and the challenge of other religions 
it also may set up a central clearing house for coordination and 
exchange of information in the findaldecade drives to present the 
gospel to those who have not yet heard it 
already an ad 2000 global service office has been 
established in rockville va for exchange of information 
coordination of publications and production of a newsletter 
mission researchers estimate about 13 billion of the worlds 5 
billion people have never heard the christian message 
the rev thomas wang international director of the lausanne 
committee and chairman of the singapore consultation wrote in 
christianity today 
around the world we have been hearing an international chorus 
of christian leaders crying out for a more concerted evangelistic 
effort its as though god is saying gentlemen its time to get 
more serious 
he said the manila conference and the ad 2000 emphasis could 
benefit each other like a twostage rocket 
besides the many organizations that have focused on the 
endofcentury goal including larger bodies such as the southern 
baptists various other organizations have pinpointed the final 
decade for evangelistic emphasis 
the decade of universal evangelilzation roman catholicism 
calls it the assemblies of god calls it the decade of harvest 
presbyterians and the worldwide anglican communion calls it the 
decade of evangelism 
at the recent missionevangelism conference sponsored by the 
world council of churches in san antonio about 60 evangelical 
participants appealed for better relations between it and the 
lausanne evangelism movement 
urging that the two world conferences be held jointly they said 
that acting separately strained resources and gave a divisive image 
to the world 
the rev eugene stockwell a world council official said at a 
news conference that there is an impression abroad we are at odds 
with one another but he added what unites us in common 
commitment to jesus christ is far more important than anything that 
might be a difference among us

the texas senate today voted without debate 
to repeal a threeweekold law that lets police withhold crime 
victims names from the press and public the 240 vote sent the 
bill to the house 
the law which took effect june 14 created a storm of protest in 
the news media 
republican john leedom the senate sponsor of the law also 
sponsored the repeal he said the law had been misapplied to such 
an extent that many law enforcement officers are not furnishing 
information that was not the intent 
the law amended the texas open records act to allow authorities 
to withhold information that might identify victims of felonies such 
as aggravated assault robbery and murder 
supporters had said it would protect victims from being pestered 
by alarm salesmen and security companies 
as the uproar grew against the law gov bill clements added 
repeal to the agenda of the special legislative session 
george irish publisher of the san antonio light and a 
representative of a first amendment and freedomofinformation 
coalition of seven texas news organizations argued for repeal in 
testimony submitted in writing 
he said the law creates a potentially dangerous situation for 
citizens far more devastating than the temporary harassment by 
unscrupulous sales personnel 
perhaps the most disturbing result of the law has been the 
blackout of information disclosing the identity of the victim in a 
child kidnapping case irish said it is exactly the fact that 
information is dispersed about a kidnapping which often leads to 
solving the case

thousands of tourists arrive to partake in eight days of 
aroundtheclock festivities in honor of san fermin pamplonas 
patron saint

pen along a halfmile route to the city bull ring when hundreds of 
people try to keep ahead of the six bulls and six steers that

no abnormalities have been found in samples of fish 
and seaweed taken from the area where a hydrogen bomb fell off a 
us aircraft carrier 24 years ago the science and technology 
agency said thursday 
the findings were contained in a preliminary report agency 
official kimihiko oda said the agency still was analyzing water 
samples taken from the deep sea and a final report would be 
available by the end of july 
he said samples were taken in the fishing grounds nearest to the 
area where an a4 skyhawk plane carrying a onemegaton hbomb 
accidentally rolled off the carrier ticonderoga on dec 5 1965 the 
bomb fell into the sea about 80 miles from a small island off 
okinawa in southern japan 
japan did not become aware of the accident until may when it 
began its tests 
the agency also analyzed data from annual surveys taken in many 
places in japan and offshore for the past 21 years to check on 
radioactive fallout from nuclear tests by china the soviet union 
the united states and france oda said and no abnormalities were 
found 
still to be analyzed are water samples collected from a depth of 
14850 feet by a vessel of the maritime safety agency japans coast 
guard 
oda said no samples were taken from the 15840footdeep seabed 
where the bomb sank because the surveys aim was to find whether the 
accident affected japans people and the marine environment 
last month william arkin of the washingtonbased institute for 
policy studies which released declassified us navy documents on 
the accident said there was little danger the bomb would detonate 
although the 33 pounds of plutonium it contained could threaten the 
environment as it deteriorates

china published a report thursday condemning 
prominent intellectuals who spoke out on political and economic 
issues in recent months the report indicated the government was 
intensifying its 5weekold crackdown on dissent 
the report also stepped up criticism of ousted communist party 
leader zhao ziyang and accused his aides and advisers of 
collaborating with student leaders in efforts to overthrow the 
government 
beijing mayor chen xitong read the report june 30 to the standing 
committee of the national peoples congress which meets between 
annual sessions of the full congress it was made public thursday 
after the congress approved it 
when party officials urged zhao to call a meeting in april to 
discuss the growing student movement zhao went golfing as if 
nothing had happened the report said later he encouraged frank 
press reports of the subsequent protests it said 
because he took such an attitude the party and the government 
lost a chance to stop the turmoil the report said 
zhao was sacked after being accused of trying to split the party 
and supporting the studentled demonstrators he has been stripped 
of his party and government posts but references to him in the 
official press as comrade indicate he retains his party 
membership 
the government report stopped just short of accusing zhao of 
taking part in the alleged antigovernment conspiracy by those under 
him 
it singled out not just people who took part in the protests but 
intellectuals who it said created a climate that encouraged the 
protests 
some of the intellectuals chen named are known to have escaped 
china or gone underground in the last month while others have been 
arrested by naming individuals and describing their activities in 
detail the report appeared to signal a widening purge of 
intellectuals 
although the student protests began in april intellectuals had 
become increasingly outspoken on political cultural and economic 
issues since late last year as problems in chinas 10yearold 
economic reform program became evident 
thinkers and writers held forums and published unofficial 
magazines to criticize government policy and signed petitions for 
an amnesty for political prisoners the report said this prepared 
for the turmoil that ensued 
chen singled out more than a dozen people including leading 
dissident fang lizhi who has taken refuge in the us embassy and 
political theorists yan jiaqi and su shaozhi who have fled to the 
west 
a publishing company official said authorities have banned 
publication of works by fang and people accused of ideological 
mistakes 
also thursday the national peoples congress appointed a new 
ambassador to the united states in a climate of worsening relations 
between the two countries zhu qizhen who had been vice foreign 
minister and who speaks fluent english was named to replace han xu 
who held the post for four years 
state tv said hans term was up he was recalled to beijing last 
week along with chinas other ambassadors for what the foreign 
ministry called a regular meeting western diplomats said it was the 
first such general recall in decades 
jiang zemin who replaced zhao as party chief told a visiting 
indian delegation that china would not change its policies in 
response to foreign economic sanctions it was his first meeting 
with a foreign visitor since taking office june 24 
jiang did not single out the united states which has halted 
military sales and highlevel contacts to protest chinas june 34 
army attack on the protesters 
the congress standing committee however passed a resolution 
expressing strong indignation over the us action 
also thursday the foreign ministry sharply rejected a us 
embassy protest over an army attack on foreign diplomatic housing 
the embassy had charged that the army made a premeditated attack 
on targeted apartments including those of american diplomats when 
it fired on the housing complex last month the official xinhua news 
agency said vice foreign minister liu huaqiu gave us ambassador 
james lilley a note rejecting the accusation as groundless and 
irresponsible 
leading newspapers joined the offensive with commentaries 
blasting alleged us efforts to undermine socialist countries one 
commentary by the editor of a leading party magazine seek truth 
said in an analysis that conflict is inevitable between the 
socialist and capitalist systems 
we cannot lose our vigilance wu jianguo wrote 
the standing committee approved two cabinet changes labor 
minister luo gan was replaced with a former public security 
minister ruan chongwu and chemical industry minister qin zhongda 
was replaced with gu xiulian who until recently was governor of 
jiangsu province 
it was not clear if the changes were linked to the partys 
political shakeup

sixteen years ago bunny wailer peter tosh and 
robert marley released catch a fire the album catapulted the 
reggae trio to international fame 
a world tour followed but wailer who is more at home in the 
hills of his native jamaica than the concert stage returned home 
and vowed never to go on the road again 
the mystical mountain man busied himself writing and recording 
songs on his own label solomonic and farmed the land at the same 
time 
i think i love the country actually a little bit more than the 
city wailer said it has more to do with life health and 
strength the city takes that away sometimes the country is good 
for meditation it has fresh food and fresh atmosphere that keeps 
you going 
this year he launched a tour to support his liberation lp 
which took him to 13 cities in the united states 
his recent performance at radio city music hall with the switch 
dance troupe marked his first new york appearance since selling out 
madison square garden in a solo concert nearly three years ago 
wailer was born neville oreilly livingston 42 years ago his 
career began in 1963 in a kingston jamaica slum when he and his 
childhood friend robert nesta marley teamed with winston hubert 
mcintosh later to be known as peter tosh to form the legendary 
group the wailers 
after the release of their first hit simmer down in 1964 
the wailers popularity spread throughout jamaica by 1966 they had 
five records in the jamaican top 10 but the pulsating sound of 
reggae went largely unnoticed by the rest of the world until the 
catch a fire lp 
on their first tour they met thunderous applause as audiences 
throughout the world jammed stadiums packed concert and theater 
stages and lined dance halls to catch a glimpse of those natty 
dreadlocks from jamaica 
while marley and tosh lost no time blazing international trails 
for themselves wailer headed for the jamaican countryside to be 
close to nature 
marley whose i shot the sheriff was covered by such rockers 
as eric clapton and who had become the biggest of the reggae stars 
died of a brain tumor at the age of 36 in 1981 
tosh who left the wailers in 1973 and formed his own group 
word sound and power was nominated for a grammy for the lp 
captured live in 1985 he was gunned down and killed in his 
jamaican home on sept 11 1987 at the age of 42 
toshs son andrew joined wailer on portions of the 
liberation tour 
marley and the wailers did more to popularize and refine reggae 
than any other artists they had hits with stir it up get up 
stand up no woman no cry and could you be loved 
bunny wailer considers himself just as much a farmer as a 
musician and helped provide food for victims of hurricane gilbert 
last fall 
sometimes people pay less attention to those things food but 
they turn out to be the most important things i am a farmer said 
wailer who was in the united states when the hurricane smashed into 
the caribbean island 
wailer chartered a jet filled it with food and flew to jamaica 
when wailer returned to his farm on the border of portland and st 
thomas parishes he found his home undamaged 
liberation his fourth album on the shanachi label includes 
messages on hunger drug abuse apartheid and freedom the lp also 
contains a copy of the universal declaration of human rights 
based on the history it projects its taken 400 years to 
write wailer said in an interview when i said i was going into 
the studio that only took four months but to get all these things 
together it has taken my lifetime and so many other lifetimes 
before

the states highest court today struck down a 
new york city law designed to help the homeless by forcing owners of 
oneroom apartments to rent them out 
the court of appeals ruled 52 ruled that the fiveyear 
moratorium on redevelopment of singleroom occupancy hotels was an 
unlawful taking of private property 
no one minimizes the tragic reality of homelessness said 
judge stewart hancock jr but the citys response to foist its 
responsibility on certain private property owners by requiring them 
to remain in the sro business or ransom their property rights 
simply does not meet the requirements of the city and state 
constitutions 
in a dissent judge joseph bellacosa complained about property 
rights being held more important than social policy he recalled 
that past courts struck down child labor laws because they hurt 
business 
the 1985 new york city law prevents owners from demolishing sro 
hotels unless they pay 45000 a room into a fund to try to save 
housing for the poor elderly and sick 
the city said its goal of trying to save 52000 apartments and 
not forcing residents out into the street justified such measures 
but the appeals court overturning a lowercourt ruling said the 
law requires property owners to surrender the most basic 
attributes of private property the rights of possession and 
exclusion 
the court noted that the city spent much of the 1970s trying to 
get sro owners to tear down housing it considered a blight about 
40000 rooms were demolished to make way for office buildings and 
housing for the rich

a sicilian womans malignant tumor has 
been cured following her pilgrimage to lourdes religious 
authorities said thursday declaring it the 65th miracle at the 
roman catholic shrine 
dr theodore mangiapan head of the medical bureau of lourdes 
said his panel and two other church medical commissions had 
determined that delizia cirollis cure could not be explained 
medically 
in catania sicily archbishop luigi bommarito said investigators 
had acknowledged the miraculous character of her case 
miss cirolli 24 visited lourdes in august 1976 suffering from 
a malignant tumor in her right leg doctors had said they should 
amputate the leg but soon after her pilgrimage the tumor began to 
heal mangiapan said 
delizia never received any specific treatment neither surgery 
nor physiotherapy nor chemotherapy and she had only one thing to do 
and that was to die he said 
her health was monitored closely allowing medical authorities to 
note that her cure was perfect and definitive a requirement for 
a cure to be recognized as a miracle 
the grotto at lourdes became a shrine after a girl named 
bernadette soubirous had 18 visions of the virgin mary recognized by 
the church starting in 1858 
more than 4 million people from as many as 150 countries travel 
to lourdes annually seeking the water from the grotto 
miss cirollis healing was the 65th miracle recognized at lourdes 
since 1862 although there have been more than 6000 claimed 
recoveries there are about 2500 cases waiting to be declared 
miracles

the united states and 
prowestern nations of southeast asia pressed hard for vietnamese 
withdrawal from cambodia but as it nears their nervousness about 
what happens next is almost palpable 
vietnam says all its military forces will be out of cambodia by 
the end of september after nearly 11 years what will replace 
vietnamese occupation has dominated discussions here this week among 
secretary of state james a baker iii and foreign ministers from the 
association of southeast asian nations 
the best result would be a negotiated settlement between the 
three resistance factions and the hanoisponsored government laying 
the groundwork for peace in cambodia for the first time in a 
generation 
the worst would be a power vacuum with each contending party 
trying to fill it through the use of force because the strongest 
resistance army is the brutal khmer rouge 
hundreds of thousands of people were executed or died of 
starvation while the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from the end of the 
indochina war in april 1975 to the vietnamese invasion of december 
1978 some estimates say more than 1 million perished 
france once the colonial power in indochina has taken the 
diplomatic initiative as the vietnamese withdrawal approaches 
inviting the cambodian factions to peace talks in paris in two weeks 
it plans to follow the talks immediately with an international 
conference involving the asean members brunei indonesia malaysia 
the philippines singapore and thailand 
also attending would be the united states soviet union britain 
china and france the five permanent members of the un security 
council 
the cambodian issue was the glue that kept the association of 
southeast asian nations together over the past decade and some 
delegates to the meeting in brunei wondered whether it could 
continue after a settlement 
american officials seem undecided about whether the french acted 
precipitately renewed civil war could result if the initiative 
fails but the french view that decisive action is required also 
could be a catalyst for peace negotiations 
to baker the requirements for a durable settlement are clear 
he said in a speech thursday it should include a ceasefire 
cessation of foreign military aid to all factions an interim 
coalition government led by prince norodom sihanouk the former 
cambodian head of state and an international force to monitor free 
elections 
all the delegates are aware however that the problem in 
cambodia goes beyond ordinary factionalism 
they are aware that history may not judge them kindly if the 
result of their long diplomatic effort is the return of the khmer 
rouge to power china also could be expected to share in the 
criticism because of its role in arming the khmer rouge 
baker spoke for delegates when he said thursday that the goal of 
transforming cambodia from a battlefield to a marketplace 
requires our resolve and our unity of purpose now more than 
ever

a wayward dolphin has left the east river and 
steadily moved north up the hudson river instead of heading back to 
the ocean indicating it may be sick researchers said 
the bottlenosed dolphin was last spotted near west point on the 
hudson at least 40 miles north of wards island in the east river 
where it lingered for more than a week the okeanos ocean research 
foundation said wednesday the animal was first spotted june 20 in 
the east river 
marine biologists had planned to try herding the dolphin from the 
east river to open waters by playing recorded sounds of killer 
whales underwater but those plans were canceled saturday when the 
dolphin moved north 
such aberrant movement up the east river and hudson river may 
indicate that the animal was sick prior to entering the east river 
and its condition is not improving okeanos said in a news release 
okeanos said the animal may not survive in the hudson river so 
it is considering capturing it with nets or a hoop capture line 
capture is a last resort since the stress could kill the dolphin

us governors met thursday with 
officials of the european community to learn how their states can 
gain from the trading blocs plans to create a single market in late 
1992 
were out to find markets for goods and products that are 
produced in our respective states said virginia gov gerald 
baliles chairman of the national governors association 
at the same time were interested in presenting our states as 
places to do business for other companies he told a news 
conference at the european community headquarters in brussels 
baliles and the governors of iowa washington new jersey utah 
vermont kentucky and puerto rico held discussions at the european 
commission the executive body of the 12nation common market 
the governors met with officials at the 16nation north atlantic 
treaty organization and the us mission to the common market they 
were scheduled to meet friday with members of the european 
parliament the trading blocs legislative body 
frans andriessen foreign affairs chief for the european 
commission the communitys executive body said the governors 
talked mostly about the plans to eliminate by late 1992 the many 
trade barriers separating the dozen ec nations the idea is to form 
a europeanwide market in which people goods services and money 
can move freely 
andriessen said the officials discussed the opportunities the 
single market will create for people inside and outside the 
european community and the irreversibility of the process and the 
implications it will have for external relations 
baliles said the governors want to hold further discussions with 
ec officials 
american states he said are vulnerable to foreign competition 
that was once very remote we have lost our economic 
insularity we are affected by events places and people beyond our 
borders

jobs in our respective states are very heavily dependent on 
decisions now being made and will continue to be made by the 
european community 
iowa gov terry branstad noted the united states and the common 
market are at odds over a number of agricultural issues including 
the trading blocs costly farm subsidy program 
he described the communitys ban on meat from us cattle treated 
with growth hormones as an improper and unfair barrier to free 
trade in beef 
andriessen responded that the communitys restrictions were 
nondiscriminatory applying to not only foreign meat exporters but 
also european farmers 
it is unacceptable that one country takes unilaterally 
retaliation measures which in our view are not compatible with 
international rules he said 
on jan 1 the common market imposed a ban on hormonetreated 
beef the united states refused to comply and instead slapped stiff 
duties on a variety of european products 
in may both sides agreed to allow us ranchers who want to 
export untreated beef to do so they will have to submit to a 
certification process drawn up by european officials in return the 
united states agreed to reduce its retaliatory tariffs 
arkansas gov bill clinton arrived with the delegation but had to 
return home for state business officials said

the state department today criticized the tough 
terms set by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and his likud 
coalition for an election among palestinian arabs but said it still 
supports the plan 
partisan declarations particularly if they appear to be more 
restrictive or impose conditions do not advance the process 
spokesman richard boucher said of the steps taken by the israeli 
leader wednesday in tel aviv under pressure from more hardline 
members of the political party 
but the us official stressed that the plan for elections among 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza has the endorsement 
of the israeli cabinet and the bush administration and still 
provides the most realistic way to advance the peace process 
boucher called on palestinians to accept the proposal and to open 
talks with israel to flesh out the details of the initiative and 
to make elections and negotiaqtions work 
the election would choose palestinian leaders to negotiate 
temporary local selfrule with israel after five years israel 
palestinians egypt and jordan would hammer out an overall 
settlement 
the conditions set wednesday by shamir did not represent any 
change in the israeli leaders position and the bush administration 
is in accord with one of th major terms no palestinian state to be 
established on israeliheld territory 
still approval of the terms appeared to bind them more tightly 
to any negotiations that might be held they included a statement 
that israel would not give up territory and that jews could keep 
settling on the west bank and in gaza 
ahmed abdulrahman spokesman for the palestine liberation 
organization said in tunis that the conditions approved by shamir 
and the likud closed the door to peace 
the plo official said the nearly 19monthold uprising by 
palestinians against israeli control would be escalated because 
this is the only answer to intransigence 
but the state department through spokesman boucher said it was 
basing its policies on the plan approved in may by the israeli 
cabinet and not by domestic israeli politics 
the statement suggested a us view that shamir had compromised 
with hardliners in his party without really changing the proposal 
itself

a judge should have declared a mistrial when 
a doctor accused of malpractice apparently saved the life of a juror 
in front of the rest of the jury an appeals court ruled thursday 
the jury may have been subliminally influenced by dr ho woon 
lees performance when he administered aid to the stricken juror 
even though they found lee liable for damages in a malpractice 
lawsuit the appellate division of the supreme court ruled 
unanimously supreme court is new york states triallevel court 
former patient brayno reome sued lee because a drain had been 
left in his leg after amputation surgery 
during a recess in the cortland county trial a juror suffered 
what appeared to be a heart attack or stroke lee administered aid 
including a blow to the chest according to the court 
the other jurors were removed before an ambulance arrived 
when the jurors returned the judge told them the trial would 
continue with an alternate juror the next morning the judge said 
that the ill juror had not been admitted to the hospital and that he 
was apparently fine 
the likely conclusion to be drawn by the jurors was that lee 
had competently administered emergency medical care possibly saving 
their fellow jurors life the court said in a decision by justice 
paul yesawich 
the jury awarded reome 3500 for medical expenses and 10000 
for pain and suffering reome a retired house painter had 
complained of pain for the nine months he remained lees patient in 
1983 and 1984 before the drain was discovered and removed by another 
doctor 
the appeals court said the unconscionably low award suggests 
that the jury was subliminally influenced to view lee favorably at 
reomes expense 
a judges instructions couldnt remove the favorable bias that 
lees admirably humanitarian efforts created the court said as it 
sent the case back to supreme court for a new trial

money to arm the nicaraguan contras was sentenced to two years 
probation today for illegally using a taxexempt foundation for the 
fundraising effort

independent counsel lawrence e walshs investigation of the 
irancontra affair 
they were the first defendants convicted as a result of walshs

guard down it may have been blind patriotism but thats no 
excuse caught up in a cause he believed in he said i turned a 
blind eye to the excesses of others and i crossed the line myself

the chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee says venezuelas investigation of a foreign exchange 
scandal is causing some american corporations to reexamine their 
investments in the country and to withdraw top executives 
chairman dante fascell dfla in a letter to venezuelas 
ambassador here said at a time when economic growth is a 
priority it would be a shame to see foreign corporations 
discouraged from investing in venezuela or decide to curtail their 
operations 
i do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or in 
the judicial system in venezuela nor can i comment on the merits of 
the case fascell said in his june 13 letter to ambassador simon 
consalvi 
as a friend of venezuela however i do wish to bring to your 
attention the problems this case is causing for foreign business 
he said some american corporations have removed their top 
executives and are reexamining their investments in your country 
fascell said that he has been told by executives of major 
american corporations that a venezuelan judge has issued arrest 
warrants for several people including american executives on 
charges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange 
i understand the charges involved do not permit those accused 
to be granted bail fascell said the executives involved claim 
they and their corporations are innocent 
replying ambassador consalvi said his government does not 
welcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses and 
investment and in fact welcomes them 
but he said the government operating under a system of 
separation of powers respects the independence of the judicial 
system 
he also noted that venezuela acted in march to abolish the 
multiple exchange rate system 
investigators in venezuela have been examining allegations that 
billions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a now 
disbanded office set up to distribute us dollars at favorable 
exchange rates for essential imports 
the investigators have been quoted in published reports as saying 
that some 24 billion of the 30 billion involved may have been 
touched by fraud

mikhail s gorbachevs visit to france hardly 
sparked the emotional outpouring seen last month in neighboring west 
germany although he did find sympathetic support among those lining 
the capitals boulevards 
compared to the mania that greeted the soviet president in bonn 
the french were described as more skeptical the twoday visit was 
one of long private talks with president francois mitterrand and 
intimate meals with french officials not highprofile street 
diplomacy 
as expected the high point of the trip was the speech delivered 
thursday gorbachevs last day in france before the council of 
europe in strasbourg he offered additional and rapid cuts in the 
soviet nuclear arsenal if nato accepts negotiations on tactical 
nuclear weapons 
political observers say the reserved reaction of the french 
public can be traced in part to the national character 
french crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than german 
ones said dominique moisi of the french institute of 
international relations 
politics and history also shaped the french response west 
germans view gorbachev as the source of changes that could lead to a 
reunified germany they also see the kremlin not the west as the 
best hope for getting missiles off their soil 
the french expect much less of him and are more skeptical of 
changes taking place in the soviet union moisi said 
france no longer plays the pivotal role in international 
diplomacy it did under gen charles de gaulle who took france out 
of natos unified military command and welcomed soviet courting as a 
way of irritating the united states 
in recent years france has become a defender of the atlantic 
alliance 
french intellectuals many of whom surrendered their leftist 
sympathies a decade ago gave gorbachev a lukewarm welcome when he 
spoke at the sorbonne 
nonetheless a poll published by bvaparis match before the visit 
showed that gorbachev enjoyed greater popularity with the french 
than did president bush or british prime minister margaret thatcher 
sixtysix percent of those polled had a good opinion of 
gorbachev and 59 percent believed he was sincere in trying to reform 
the soviet union 
fiftytwo percent also believed gorbachevs hold on power was 
fragile compared with 82 percent of west germans surveyed who 
said they thought the soviet leaders reforms would succeed 
the french daily le monde ran an editorial wednesday praising 
perestroika but noting the many problems gorbachev faces at home 
the success of perestroika is everything the editorial 
noted except assured from all points of view we are 
concerned and the question then is to know not if but how we 
should help democracy triumph everywhere on the common continent

the big wet currently being administered to the 
east is in the tradition of some serious drenchings of the past 
events when tropical storms got things started and then let nature 
take its soggy course 
its not a frequent occurrence but it happens said storm 
specialist bob case of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla noting that a similar situation created devastating 
floods in west virginia four years ago 
this was not anything like a onceinalifetime event but it 
wasnt a garden variety storm either added scott kroczynski of 
the national weather services office of hydrology in silver spring 
md 
the flooding in the last day or two wasnt spread over a large 
area but was severe in some localities explained kroczynski and 
coworker frank richards 
intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburban 
washington to suburban new york on wednesday they noted with 2 to 
6 inches of rain in most areas but 10 inches or more in some spots 
especially in northern delaware where at least two people drowned 
many people are blaming tropical storm allison for the intense 
rain which disrupted train service between new york and washington 
swept away a camper in north carolina and generally created 
miserable conditions along the east coast 
allisons remains however are in alabama that storm despite 
the intense rain it brought ashore in texas and louisiana more than 
a week ago isnt a direct part of the east coast problems case 
said 
but it is taking some of the blame he noted and thats 
appropriate since it helped create the mess 
the last similar situation was hurricane juan in 1985 
when severe flooding occurred in virginia and west virginia case 
said 
juan did the same thing it did not cause the flooding but 
it opened the the way he said before juan tropical storm 
agnes in 1972 brought similar devastating rains he explained 
allison came ashore in texas worked northward to reach western 
kentucky by last monday then drifted back to alabama where it is 
now a low pressure area at the same time a high pressure center is 
located off the east coast 
air around a low moves in a counterclockwise direction around 
highs it circulates clockwise 
when they meet those circulations are like two meshed gears 
turning away explained case with a low to the west turning 
counterclockwise and a high to the east turning clockwise 
that means the air flows combine between the two centers pulling 
warm moist air northward from the gulf of mexico to inundate the 
united states east of the appalachians case explained 
the real culprit is this inundation of tropical unstable 
air he added 
as it moves north the warm wet air rises pushed up by the land 
and generally lifted over cooler air already in the area rising air 
cools cooler air can hold less moisture than warm air and bingo 
the result is rain 
richards and kroczynski explained that on tuesday night and 
wednesday some cold air moved in above the warm tropical air in the 
stretch between washington and new york 
this cold air which was heavier and more dense then sank down 
that led to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air once 
it started it was almost like a chain reaction said richards 
explaining the localized deluges

for don avenson the full impact of a 
supreme court ruling on abortion hit home during a fourth of july 
parade in the little northern iowa town of humboldt 
people asked you about it as you drove by said avenson 
speaker of the iowa house and a democratic gubernatorial candidate 
obviously an issue that none of us wanted involved in the 
primary has been thrust upon us he said unfortunately it is 
such an issue that people dont want to talk about the other 
things 
in iowa as in other states the courts ruling monday giving 
states new freedom to restrict abortion has sharply altered what was 
shaping up as a runofthemill gubernatorial battle 
god its a new ball game said joe shanahan a spokesman for 
the iowa democratic party the entire scenario has changed 
the primary wont be held until june 1990 but four democrats are 
already running for the chance to oppose twoterm incumbent 
republican gov terry branstad in november 1990 
attorney general tom miller the only one of the four who wants 
to limit abortion was the early favorite in the race with avenson 
lt gov joann zimmerman and des moines banker john chrystal distant 
challengers 
miller who has held statewide office for more than 10 years 
spent months quietly raising money building an organization and 
cultivating a moderate image democratic activists hungry to oust 
branstad were viewed as willing to accept something less than 
liberal purity in their candidate 
then came abortion hours after the court decision miller called 
on the legislature to enact new abortion restrictions saying we 
should reduce and if possible eliminate abortions the same day 
avenson pledged to use his powerful legislative post to block any 
attempt to restrict womens access to abortion 
while avenson has surfaced as the most visible opponent for 
miller on the abortion issue ms zimmerman has had trouble raising 
money and chrystal has languished in polls and visibility leading 
many democrats to view the run as a twoperson race 
iowa law currently is silent on abortion because the legislature 
in 1976 removed all references in the wake of the supreme court 
decision legalizing abortion thats precisely where it will stay 
pledged avenson and thats also good politics in a democratic 
primary 
i believe that activists democrats are by and large 
prochoice said avenson they are comfortable with the status 
of the situation now 
for his part miller accuses avenson of being irresponsible and 
divisive damaging the partys chance in the general election 
i dont think it will be a referendum on abortion said 
miller when this case is digested people will see the debate is 
about regulation of abortion not prohibition of abortion 
while the candidates have heated up their rhetoric since the 
courts decision there have been other signs the abortion issue is 
now deeply rooted in the campaign 
abortion rights activists heavily populated by liberal 
democrats picketed millers campaign headquarters and feminists 
have taken to launching antimiller chants at rallies 
my gut reaction is a fairly sizable majority of activists are 
prochoice said shanahan activists tend to be opinionated 
they are perhaps a little more on the prochoice side than the 
general public conceded miller i do note that i have three 
opponents to carve up the prochoice side 
whats important is what the 60 percent to 80 percent of iowans 
in the middle think said miller they are not going to be 
induced to vote singleissue 
spicing the debate between avenson and miller is a sharp 
difference in campaign styles 
avenson is a burly outdoorsman who owns a toolanddie business 
and has built a reputation as a legislative wheelerdealer miller 
is a harvardtrained lawyer who cultivates a polished image working 
to broaden his appeal beyond the partys traditional base to include 
young professionals and others who have deserted democrats in recent 
elections

on tuesday that his wife and their two daughters moved to columbia 
sc last august because my ordeal changed things 
i could never overcome the fears i had geter 31 said 
there were always strange things that were happening for the most 
part people greeted me real well 
but those who showed no remorse to what happened to me became a 
threat to me and my family 
geter now a social worker in south carolina declined to be more 
specific he will become chairman of the advisory board for the new 
foundation 
james humphreys jr a dallas private investigator given much of 
the credit for geters release from prison will examine many of the 
cases foundation officials said 
the 1983 conviction of jerry wanzer for aggravated sexual assault 
on an 8yearold girl will be humphreys first case 
a civil rights group described wanzers conviction and 25year 
prison sentence in 1986 as an example of gross racial injustice 
but the us supreme court refused to hear wanzers appeal in april 
1987 
the one thing i hope the foundation would do would be to 
exonerate a person or persons who are incarcerated unjustly geter 
told the newspaper 
geter said the foundation will seek cases in which substantial 
evidence can be obtained to prove applicants innocence with 
emphasis on defendants who could not afford thorough investigations 
and whose courtappointed attorneys mounted an inadequate defense 
oftentimes when an indigent person enters the judicial system 
he goes in with the minimum investigation and is later convicted

bush said he was untroubled by gorbachevs rejection of the 
american call for the withdrawal of soviet troops from poland

just as when he goes to france and germany i dont think hes 
trying to make things more difficult for us he said 
my trip over there is not to try to drive wedges between 
the sovuiet union and eastern europe bush said that is not 
what 1989 diplomacy is about

added of his trip to poland 
he said he wanted to extend to them whatever help we can and 
help that country move toward more reform and more openness 
he noted he could not impose his wishes on the internal affairs 
of the governments of poland and hungary but made clear that he 
hopes his visit there will assist a trend toward openness 
both countries have undergone dramatic political reforms in 
recent months including the admission of solidarity union leaders 
into the polish parliament under unusually open elections 
in poland and hungary our strong support for the democratic 
course these nations have chosen will be clear he said their 
efforts are not only a new beginning in their own countries but can 
be the beginning of an historic process of european reconciliation

democratic alternative and help create a europe that is whole and

a catholic priest who was suspended for 
establishing a temple in defiance of church authorities said 
thursday he wants to establish a separate rite for black americans 
but is content to let someone else lead it 
we dont want one imani temple the rev george a stallings 
said thursday three days after cardinal james a hickey suspended 
him for holding the renegade church service at howard university law 
school we want several hundred of them several thousand 
but despite his determination to fly in the face of his church 
authorities and his sudden national celebrity stallings says he 
views himself a parish priest at heart 
the only role that i see for myself is pastor of a local parish 
community that is under the heading of an africanamerican catholic 
rite said stallings who is black 
stallings 41 says a new rite is needed with a black leadership 
and clergy because the roman catholic church is hopelessly mired in 
its own white european perspective its a charge that church 
officials deny 
most other rites are ethnic churches within the eastern rite 
such as maronite and ukrainian churches they have considerable 
autonomy in ritual and discipline but still accept the pope 
stallings also says that the church has has put its emphasis on 
maintenance rather than mission missing the opportunity to fill 
many of the innercity churches that were once filled with white 
ethnics who have fled to the suburbs 
i have been to cities where the church was closed said 
stallings black protestants came in and took over and now 
theyre packed to the gills 
stallings proved sunday he could pack a church although critics 
say he many of those were curiosity seekers and the crowds will 
dwindle at imani swahili for faith 
the service combined the traditional catholic mass with african 
ritual and the footstomping handclapping style of the traditional 
black protestant church 
stallings public act of defiance means he is now banned from 
performing sacraments according to a spokesman for hickey 
stallingss decision to ignore the cardinals authority is hindering 
his own stated effort to establish a new rite under church rules a 
request for a new rite would first go to hickey 
the difficulty is not that he tried those channels and is 
blocked said rev william lori hickeys secretary the 
difficulty is that he has spurned those channels 
but stallings says the church hierarchy despite a number of 
black bishops is institutionally blind 
it is difficult if not almost impossible for one ethnic or 
cultural group to define or to decide what is good for another 
ethnic group he says it is always necessary for those ethnic 
groups to get a seal of approval from the white male power group 
at stake in the stallings battle are 2 million black american 
catholics a minority of both black people some 30 million in 
america and american catholics as a whole 54 million 
according to church figures there are 300 black priests and 13 
black bishops of the 17000 catholic parishes 1200 are 
predominantly black 
church officials say they are gaining rather than losing blacks 
although no one could immediately provide figures 
i dont hear a hue and cry for breaking away said auxiliary 
bishop john h ricard of baltimore chairman of the bishops 
committee on black catholics of the national conference of catholic 
bishops 
the fathers argument that there is racism in the church has 
been acknowledged ricard said adding there is a crying need 
for our church to meet the social and economic needs of 
africanamericans

president bush expressed pleasure today that 
oliver north was not sentenced to jail for his irancontra 
convictions but sidestepped a question about whether he has 
considered pardoning the former white house aide 
im happy hes not going to jail bush said in answer to a 
question during an interview with a group of journalists im not 
going to comment further because this matter is under appeal and is 
in the federal courts 
us district judge gerhard a gesell sentenced north on 
wednesday to a threeyear suspended sentence two years probation 
150000 in fines and 1200 hours of community service work 
in a related case today us district judge stanley harris 
sentenced public relations consultant richard miller to serve two 
years probation and perform 120 hours of community service for 
using a taxexempt foundation to funnel private donations to norths 
aid pipeline for the nicaraguan rebels 
carl spitz channell who with miller helped raise more than 
10 million for the contras is to be sentenced on friday both men 
had pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government 
fiftyeight members of the house composed a letter to bush urging 
a pardon for north arguing it is time to put an end to the 
political persecution of an honorable man who has served his country 
with distinction 
rep robert dornan rcalif who led the effort still plans to 
forward the letter to bush even though it was written before the 
sentencing and anticipated that north would draw a prison term 
spokesman paul morrell said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had no 
comment on the sentencing and had not considered a pardon 
we havent discussed a pardon fitzwater said theres been 
no discussion it hasnt ever been discussed 
sen orrin hatch rutah said he believed bush should pardon 
north because the fine was too high and the loss of the former 
marine corps lieutenant colonels pension was too stiff a penalty 
the navy announced that as a result of the sentencing it was 
suspending norths 23000ayear pension earned in 20 years of 
service but it recommended the pension be restored by comptroller 
general charles bowsher who has the final say 
north said after the sentencing that he planned to press an 
appeal of his conviction and looked forward to carrying out gesells 
order that he devote 1200 hours to a new program to help district 
of columbia youths avoid drug involvement 
i welcome the chance to work for these folks and anybody in the 
fight against drugs north said 
gesell said he believes north still lacks understanding of how 
the public service has been tarnished by his activities adding 
jail would only harden your misconceptions 
the judge told north your notoriety has caused many 
difficulties but it also has made you a rich man you can 
continue to flame the myth by which you have supported yourself 
during these recent difficult years or you can turn around now and 
do something useful 
north is free to continue the 25000aspeech tours that have 
occupied his time since his conviction for aiding and abetting in 
obstruction of congress for destroying or altering government 
documents and for accepting a gratuity a security fence around his 
home 
the shredding conviction bars north from holding federal office 
north had asked the judge for lenience 
i have devoted nearly two decades to the service of our country 
and i would never knowingly do anything to hurt it or any of its 
institutions he said in a soft voice i grieve over what 
has happened and i truly pray about it every day 
north was convicted on may 4 for his role in the irancontra 
affair in which the government secretly sold weapons to iran and 
funneled some of the proceeds to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
during the trial north argued he was merely following the orders of 
superiors in the reagan administration 
lawmakers on capitol hill generally applauded gesells sentencing 
decision 
rep lee hamilton dind the chairman of the house irancontra 
committee called the sentence good and wise and said judge 
gesell balanced difficult facts recognizing colonel norths 
distinguished military record and his devotion to family with the 
fact the jury convicted him on three counts and his difficult 
position with regard to his superiors 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the senate irancontra 
committee said i am certain that judge gesells sentence is 
appropriate in light of the unique circumstances of this case 
rep don edwards dcalif said i dont think that anybody 
or very few people wanted all of the additional chaos in the 
country the additional hard feelings that we have too much of right 
now of having oliver north trundled off to jail waving the american 
flag 
rep henry hyde rill a north supporter said on abctvs 
good morning america that the sentence was a little milder 
than i had come to expect we had been told gesell was a hanging 
judge and i think he really tempered justice with mercy in a 
sentence which all things considered was pretty fair 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio interviewed with hyde sounded a 
note of dissent he called the sentence a disappointing surprise 
and said it makes it much more difficult for the special 
prosecutor to go after other irancontra cases and get a 
conviction

president bush today deflected soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs call for swift negotiations over shortrange 
nuclear weapons noting that nato leaders agreed not to entertain 
such talks until an accord had been reached on conventional forces 
i dont want to get off track by reopening the issue of 
shortrange nuclear forces that western leaders agreed to in 
brussels in may bush said 
in a nationally televised session with foreign reporters designed 
to set the stage for his european journey on sunday bush said he 
hoped to use his visits to poland and hungary to nudge both 
communistcontrolled countries toward democracy 
he insisted he wasnt trying to stir up trouble in gorbachevs 
backyard saying that is not what 1989 diplomacy is about at 
the same time bush called on east germany and other less open 
warsaw pact nations to come along with the flow 
he said he looked forward to a europe that is whole and free 
our challenge is to help create the conditions under which the 
hungarians and poles can recover economically and make the 
transition he said of his pending visits to two nations in 
the throes of extraordinary political and economic change 
bush also said he is happy that former marine lt col oliver 
north did not draw a jail term for irancontra crimes he 
sidestepped a question of a possible pardon noting that the former 
white house aide is appealing his conviction on three charges 
north on wednesday was given a suspended sentence and a 150000 
fine and was ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service in 
an antidrug program 
bush fielded questions in the executive office building across 
the street from the white house his audience consisted largely of 
foreign reporters although american journalists were permitted to 
ask questions as well 
the presidents two stops in eastern europe will precede an 
economic summit meeting in paris and a followup visit in the 
netherlands 
he said he hoped the summit would deal with worldwide 
environmental concerns and make a contribution toward 
noninflationary growth 
bushs reply to a question about gorbachevs proposal appeared 
carefully worded 
the answer is to please read carefully what happened in 
brussels he said to look at the united nato position and to go 
forward with the agenda at hand that will be the message i 
dont want to get off the track by reopening the shortrange nuclear 
forces package he said 
in a speech earlier in the day in strasbourg france gorbachev 
offered to make additional and rapid cuts in his countrys nuclear 
arsenal if nato accepts negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons 
the speech seemed designed in part to increase pressure on the 
united states to depart from an agreement with its allies on an 
issue that dominated the nato summit in may 
the nato agreement calls for negotiations to reduce shortrange 
nuclear missiles only after an eastwest agreement has been reached 
to reduce conventional forces and reductions are actually underway 
i see no reason to stand here and try to change a collective 
decision taken by nato the president said today 
in his response to gorbachev bush added we welcome unilateral 
cuts on his side certainly 
bush said he was untroubled by gorbachevs rejection of the 
american call for the withdrawal of soviet troops from poland 
were not trying to make things more difficult for him 
just as when he goes to france and germany i dont think hes 
trying to make things more difficult for us he said 
my trip over there is not to try to drive wedges between 
the soviet union and eastern europe bush said that is not what 
1989 diplomacy is about 
were not going to be there trying to raise tensions he 
added of his trip to poland

here is the text of president bushs remarks at 
a news conference thursday 
bush everybody please be seated well first i have a brief 
statement and then id be glad to take your questions 
our trip will take us first to poland then hungary two 
countries engaged in unprecedented efforts toward economic and 
political reform the next stop paris to join in the celebration 
of frances centennial bicentennial and to participate in the 
15th economic summit finally our journey ends in the netherlands 
for the firstever visit by an american president to one of our 
oldest and closest allies 
in poland and hungary our strong support for the democratic 
course these nations have chosen will be clear their efforts are 
not only a new beginning in their own countries but can be the 
beginning of an historic process of european reconciliation of 
ending the artificial division of europe we want to help these 
countries toward an alternative future a democratic alternative 
and to help create a europe that is whole and free 
certainly poland and hungary face serious economic problems and 
no amount of outside assistance can substitute for their own 
sustained efforts our challenge is to help create the condition 
under which the poles and the hungarians can recover economically 
and make a successful transition towards democracy 
and therefore immediately following this session today theres 
going to be a white house symposium on eastern europe and our aim 
is to involve american privatesector leaders in the support of 
change in poland and hungary in the long run their participation 
is essential if democracy is to succeed in eastern europe 
our efforts during the economic summit in paris are just as 
critical in helping end the economic and political division of 
europe and thats why we will propose ways to work together to 
assist economic recovery and democratic change in poland and 
hungary we believe the western democracies must coordinate their 
economic and technical assistance programs to provide real help at a 
time of historic change in these two countries and help reintegrate 
their economies into the global economy 
our key economic objective at the summit is to sustain 
noninflationary growth and in order to move the international 
trading system into the next century we need to commit to conclude 
the uruguay round negotiations with substantial results in all 
areas including agriculture by the end of 1990

weve already announced new measures to strengthen the 
international debt strategy through the brady plan with its 
emphasis on economic growth and investment and to fulfill our 
commitment at the toronto economic summit beginning october 1 the 
us government will forgive official development loans of the 
subsaharan countries 
there are other challenges that need to be met it is time that a 
summit address our natural heritage and let paris then be known as 
the summit which accepted the environmental challenge the us 
leads the world in environmental protection and research we invite 
others to join in our efforts and to support our goal of a cleaner 
healthier global environment 
our trip is going to conclude with a visit to the netherlands 
where we will discuss with dutch leaders our broad range of shared 
interests this will also be an occasion for celebrating americas 
longest unbroken diplomatic relationship and for reaffirming the 
vitality of americas routes in europe and the strength of our 
transatlantic ties 
id be glad to take questions 
q mr president mr gorbachev challenged you again today to 
negotiate to eliminate shortrange missiles in europe is the answer 
still no and always no 
bush the answer is to please read carefully what happened at 
brussels to look at the united nato position and to go forward 
and weve had encouraging sounds from the soviets on this go 
forward with the agenda at hand and thatll be the message and i 
dont want to get offtrack by reopening the snf question when we 
have a good package that has wide support the big thing the 
postnato action is to move forward in meeting our timetables and 
in fairness i should say i was very pleased that mr gorbachev made 
a comment i believe it was in germany that that timetable was 
not too ambitious 
q if i may follow up on the same question mr gorbachev is 
asking about these tactical forces who needs them and the question 
does arise what if anything nato has to fear from accepting his 
offer of unilateral cuts on his side considering that during the 
course of any such negotiations nato would presumably retain its own 
tactical capability as you have suggested pending conventional 
cuts 
bush if your question is would we welcome unilateral cuts on 
his side certainly 
q from your remarks sir 
bush maybe that wasnt the question but thats the answer 
laughter you left yourself open by leaving that part of it sure 
we would welcome that 
q from your remarks sir 
bush that wasnt what he said however 
q from your remarks sir you say you want the paris summit to 
accept the environmental challenge you want polluters to pay does 
that mean you are going with budgetary commitments and do you want 
the other six nations as well to make budgetary commitments to make 
polluters pay 
bush well im not sure were going to get into that ive given 
our proposals here in the united states for revisions of the clean 
air act and things that we feel are important domestically but we 
do support negotiations that you know on other subjects leading 
toward the framework for example the framework convention on 
global warming we can focus our efforts on reducing or preventing 
pollution at the outset rather than cleaning it up afterwards 
these are the broad questions were going to be talking about 
im concerned about deforestation and tried to show some support for 
that in a trip i took to north dakota and working with our head of 
our environment on reforestation and i think heres a question 
thats going to have enormous interest in the summit so its going 
to be on these broad tactics rather than trying to indicate to our 
european partners how they should handle their own domestic 
pollution problems

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
challenged nato unity thursday with a unilateral kremlin offer to 
scrap more nuclear missiles and made bold proposals laying a 
foundation for a common european home to end cold war divisions 
in a wideranging address capping a threeday visit to france 
gorbachev also gave his clearest assurance the soviet union might 
someday be prepared to tolerate noncommunist regimes in eastern 
europe 
the social and political order in some particular countries did 
change in the past and it can change in the future gorbachev 
told the council of europe a 23nation assembly of west european 
democracies 
to deepen allaround cooperation on both sides of what once 
was dubbed the iron curtain gorbachev proposed a list of 
paneuropean projects he called urgent these included a 
highspeed railway spanning the continent an alleuropean tv 
satellite system and cooperation to heighten safety in the 
processing and storing of nuclear waste 
after the speech daniel tarschys a liberal member of the 
assembly from sweden said gorbachev gave the green light to 
further cooperation between east and west europe 
the strasbourgbased council of europe last month granted the 
soviet union poland hungary and yugoslavia special guest 
status to encourage relations and recognize the impact of current 
political reforms taking place in the countries 
gorbachevs address to the council a separate body from the 
12member european economic community trade bloc had been expected 
to elaborate on the idea of a common european home which the 
soviets define as stretching from the atlantic ocean to the urals 
the concept was first mentioned by gorbachev in 1985 
but gorbachev told the parliament members even today i do 
not claim to carry a finished blueprint of that home in my pocket 
much of his speech dwelt instead with disarmament and security 
concerns and with specific proposals for eastwest cooperation in 
europe 
the europeans can meet the challenges of the coming century 
only by pooling their efforts he said 
gorbachevs remarks on disarmament from the podium in the 
assembly hall of the ultramodern palace of europe seemed designed to 
force a break in a hardwon compromise reached by nato members last 
month in brussels 
the compromise by north atlantic treaty organization members 
agreed to link future negotiations in tactical nuclear arms to 
results obtained at the vienna talks seeking europewide reductions 
in conventional weaponry at the brussels meeting west germany won 
agreement that bargaining with the soviets on tactical missiles 
would begin but not until conventional arms reductions wre under 
way 1992 at the earliest 
the united states and britain held fast for agreements that such 
talks would aim at only a partial reduction of the us and soviet 
warheads 
the soviets complained the agreement would cause delays in arms 
reduction and in his speech gorbachev expressed amazement at the 
logic of the compromise 
only europeans who have no intention of waging war against one 
another are threatened by those weapons he said the ultimate 
objective is to completely eliminate those weapons 
he did not specify how many rockets his country would be willing 
to destroy soviet officials have acknowledged they have 1608 
shortrange nuclear missiles with a range of about 300 miles to 
natos 136 a 12to1 advantage 
if it became clear that nato countries are ready to join us in 
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons we could naturally after 
consulting our allies carry out without delay further unilateral 
reductions in our tactical nuclear missiles in europe gorbachev 
said 
in washington president bush deflected gorbachevs call for 
swift negotiations over reductions in shortrange nuclear weapons 
noting that nato leaders said they would not entertain such talks 
until agreement had been reached on conventional forces 
i dont want to get off track by reopening the issue of 
shortrange nuclear forces bush said in a news conference before 
his trip to europe beginning sunday 
bush also said he hoped to use his visits to poland and hungary 
to nudge both communistcontrolled countries toward democracy 
the last soviet offer to scrap nuclear weapons about 500 
warheads came in may during a visit to moscow by us secretary of 
state james a baker iii and while the united states west germany 
and britain were brawling about whether to modernize natos few 
remaining shortrange missiles or trade them away 
peter hardy a member of parliament from britains opposition 
labor party called gorbachevs conditional arms cut offer a major 
step forward 
he offered olive branches hardy said 
during his threeday visit to france gorbachev held talks with 
french president francois mitterrand in paris and both leaders 
signed more than 20 agreements on trade and other bilateral matters 
gorbachev accompanied to france by his wife raisa soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and other top officials 
left strasbourg on thursday for bucharest romania where he will 
attend an annual summit meeting of the sovietled warsaw pact 
military alliance that begins friday

for three years federal housing 
officials in alabama lost track of 2 million in government money 
it was supposed to help middleincome home buyers but records 
indicate it went instead for a 50000 mercedes an 18000 speed 
boat jewelry furs and video equipment 
documents obtained from the department of housing and urban 
development by the associated press allege that montgomery real 
estate broker cy walker hid the money with the help of blank forms 
that he apparently got from an unwitting first alabama bank employee 
walker who handled sales of huds foreclosed homes in the 
montgomery area put agency money from the sales closings into a 
first alabama account that he alone controlled according to hud 
documents those records and ap interviews indicate that walker 
appeared to underwrite a highrolling lifestyle 
the documents also depict a federal agency without adequate 
controls over its multimilliondollar alabama operation such 
controls according to a hud memo finally were put in place on nov 
9 1987 that same day walker closed out the first alabama account 
withdrawing the last 13654 
by then after three years slightly more than 2 million in hud 
money had been deposited in the account but not sent to the federal 
agency the records indicate some of it appears to have been spent 
on hudrelated expenses such as maintenance on foreclosed homes and 
attorneys closing fees but hud records including canceled checks 
also show it was used by walker in part for the following purchases 
a 50000 sports car laurens pierce iii spokesman for jack 
ingram motors in montgomery said salesmen recall that walker bought 
a mercedes 560 sl convertible in all a hud audit listed nearly 
180000 in checks written by walker to car dealers including cobb 
pontiac cadillac which received 14185 on one occasion 27153 on 
another and 12595 on a third 
an 18870 speed boat from kowaliga marina the office manager 
at the marina said it was a stingray the cadillac of speed 
boats she said 
more than 31000 worth of electronics and appliances from the 
record shop some of the purchases such as stoves could have gone 
to hud houses that needed fixing however expensive video equipment 
was delivered directly to walkers home 
5246 worth of jewelry from yan neen international 
8255 worth of furs from henig furs of montgomery 
9571 worth of travel in payments to fair winds and rainbow 
travel agencies 
2200 for a saltwater aquarium and accessories from wet pets 
21000 was paid to high school video memories a business 
enterprise in which walker hoped to sell video yearbooks to all high 
school graduates in alabama 
walker did not return a phone call made to the recording device 
on his beeper telephone the number listed for his residence phone 
has been disconnected and walker has moved from the apartment 
listed in the 1989 phone book 
montgomery real estate commission records show that he still has 
a valid real estate license but it is listed as inactive status 
since he has not been associated with a real estate firm since nov 
14 1988 
hud officials declined to comment on the case because it is a 
matter under investigation 
the fbi has turned its investigative file over to the us 
attorney for possible prosecution us attorney jim wilson said he 
will meet with hud officials this month to discuss possible criminal 
indictments 
hud which completed its audit in september 1988 is trying to 
recover the money through administrative procedures 
walker won the hud contract to handle sales of huds 
singlefamily dwellings in the montgomery area through competitive 
bidding in 1984 he handled the hud work while he was an associate 
broker for ricks linddavis real estate inc the firm was sold in 
1986 to johnny m portis who folded the business last year when the 
hud trouble surfaced his attorney said portis was not aware of what 
walker was doing with the hud money 
dave gordon a first alabama executive familiar with the hud 
case said he could not comment on any specific allegations but he 
said it appears that from all the indications from hud from a 
regulation standpoint first alabama has done nothing wrong nothing 
out of the ordinary 
a nov 9 1987 memo from robert e lunsford at the time the 
acting manager of huds birmingham office told the regional 
administrator that a bank employee gave walker a blank stack of 
the wire transfer authorization forms so that walker could have 
them typed prior to his visit and thus save the bank employee some 
work 
this is a closely controlled form of the bank and it is our 
understanding that the security department of the bank is very upset 
over this action the memo said 
it said the wire transfer authorization forms sent to hud from 
walkers sales closings were all drawn on first alabama and appear 
to be signed by a nonexistent bank employee 
according to the memo the forms led huds birmingham office to 
believe that the bank had wired the money properly to the office of 
finance and accounting in the agencys central office at the time 
the agency had no procedure in place to check whether it had 
received the money or not 
such a procedure according to lunsfords memo was adopted when 
the problems with the montgomery account were uncovered in october 
1987 
before uncovering the montgomery problems wrote lunsford we 
felt very secure in following normal operating procedures which to 
some degree assumes that you are dealing with honest people

janos kadar hungarys leader from the 
repression of 1956 through the liberalized goulash communism of 
the 1970s until his removal last year as a relic of the rigid past 
died thursday at age 77 
the era kadar represented we were already burying while he was 
still alive a commentator said on state radio 
that era began in october 1956 when kadar took over the 
communist party and summoned soviet tanks to crushed the 
antistalinist uprising led by premier imre nagy 
nagy was executed in 1958 liberal new hungarian leaders reburied 
him with honors this spring and a few hours after kadars death the 
supreme court exonerated nagy of all charges completing his 
rehabilitation 
a statement carried by the official news agency mti announced 
with deep shock and profound sorrow that kadar had died thursday 
after a prolonged serious illness he was hospitalized monday 
with pneumonia and breathing and circulatory problems 
kadar was reported gravely ill in april and in may lost his two 
remaining posts honorary party chairman and member of the central 
committee which wrote him a letter criticizing erroneous 
decisions during his long rule 
he responded in a letter his last public statement that he 
always acted in hungarys best interests of his country but had made 
mistakes 
a statement from the party leadership thursday emphasized both 
kadars success with cautious reform and the later years 
characterized by economic stagnation and growing discontent over 
stalled reforms 
it said his declaration to a workers rally in 1962 that those 
who are not against us are with us led to a national consensus 
which is not to say that there were no mistakes and painful 
retreats but janos kadars name came to be synonymous with humanist 
socialism 
the four members of the communist party presidium led by party 
chairman rezso nyers were named as a committee to organize the 
funeral the official news agency mti said the date and place would 
be announced later 
nyers and premier miklos nemeth left for romania to attend a 
warsaw pact summit beginning friday prompting speculation that the 
funeral would be delayed until after president george bushs visit 
to hungary next week 
black flags flew on all public buildings in budapest and state 
radio played classical music television broadcast short 
documentaries of kadars life throughout the day 
since karoly grosz replaced kadar as party chief in may 1988 the 
former leader has come under fierce attack and the new leadership 
has moved rapidly to embrace democratic change promising contested 
elections and a multiparty system 
representatives of the party and opposition have begun 
negotiations on holding the first open elections since the 
communists consolidated power in 1948 
liberal policies put forth by the new leaders are similar to 
those endorsed in 1956 by nagy whom they describe as a forerunner 
of communist reform 
nagys official status began to change this year when the party 
declared the revolt was a popular uprising not the 
counterrevolution it had been called for 33 years 
in a serialized interview with the weekly magyarorszag after the 
reburial kadar was quoted as saying nagys tragedy is my own 
personal tragedy as well 
janos kadar was born may 26 1912 in the adriatic port of fiume 
which was renamed rijeka and became part of yugoslavia when the 
austrohungarian empire broke up he joined the illegal communist 
party in 1931 as a 19yearold of peasant stock with only eight 
years of schooling 
he achieved central committee membership in may 1942 having 
spent more than three years in prison on various political charges 
when the communists took over kadar became interior minister in 
matyas rakosis stalinist regime but it was never clear whether he 
controlled the feared political police 
rakosi had him arrested in 1951 on charges of espionage and 
treason but when josef stalin died in 1953 rakosis grip on power 
began to slip kadar was freed and rehabilitated the next year 
growing discontent led to rakosis ouster in july 1956 but 
dissatisfaction continued and a popular uprising began within three 
months tens of thousands of students filled the streets demanding 
a free press withdrawal of soviet troops and multiparty politics 
kadar became party leader a few days later on nov 3 he asked 
the kremlin to help end the revolt and the red army moved in 
less than four months after nagys death kadar embarked on 
economic reform that brought growing prosperity and increasingly 
cordial ties with the west 
he was a reticent man fond of chess reading and hunting 
of hunting kadar said once if you enter a wood even as much 
as a meter speech stops you dont make a noise you dont talk in 
the woods there is silence that is why i like it

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
today offered additional and rapid cuts in his countrys nuclear 
arsenal if nato accepts negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons 
gorbachevs proposal contained in a speech to the council of 
europes assembly in this eastern french city appeared designed to 
increase pressure on the united states to agree to the talks an 
issue that caused a deep rift in the western alliance that was 
patched over last month 
if it became clear that nato countries are ready to join us in 
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons we could naturally after 
consulting our allies carry out without delay further unilateral 
reductions in our tactical nuclear missiles in europe gorbachev 
told the assembly which contains parliamentarians from 23 western 
european democracies 
gorbachev did not say how many missiles the soviets would cut 
president bush reacted to the proposal by noting that nato 
leaders agreed not to entertain such talks until an accord is 
reached on conventional forces i dont want to get off track by 
reopening the issue of shortrange nuclear forces that western 
leaders agreed to in brussels bush said in washington 
earlier today presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the gorbachev statement had been anticipated 
we welcome any unilateral reductions in the soviets nuclear 
arsenal fitzwater said but he added that the bush administration 
would stand by its own proposal on eastwest force reductions in 
europe 
nato last month agreed to link any future negotiations on 
tactical nuclear arms to results obtained at the vienna talks 
seeking europewide reductions in conventional weaponry a step the 
soviets have said will cause delay 
gorbachevs announcement made from the podium at the ultramodern 
palace of europe seemed designed to force a break in that link 
as presented at the nato summit in brussels bushs plan calls 
for a reduction in conventional forces in europe to 275000 troops 
apiece for nato and warsaw pact nations before talks are held on 
reducing shortrange missiles 
an attempt by the soviet union to seek earlier talks was the 
reaction we expected from the soviets fitzwater said our 
position remains the same as before to do the conventional talks 
first 
nato has its posture established fitzwater said 
conventional arms reductions first i wouldnt anticipate any 
change in that 
in bonn west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
praised the speech as an impressive declaration of belief in 
europe that embraced the basic values of european culture and 
civilization 
most of natos weapons are based in west germany 
in his 45minute speech gorbachev also 
said the social and political order in europe could change the 
furthest he has gone in suggesting that the kremlin would one day be 
ready to tolerate multiparty democracies in its eastern allies 
proposed a series of projects both eastern and western europeans 
could take part in including a highspeed railway spanning the 
continent an alleuropean tv satellite system and a program for 
processing and storing nuclear wastes and improving nuclear power 
plant safety 
the soviet leader on the final day of a threeday visit to 
france said he couldnt understand why europeans would want 
tactical nuclear arms to remain on their home continent 
only europeans who have no intention of waging war against one 
another are threatened by those weapons gorbachev said 
in may when us secretary of state james a baker iii visited 
moscow gorbachev announced the soviets would unilaterally eliminate 
500 tactical nuclear warheads 
nato specialists however said the soviet offer represented only 
a fraction of the red armys tactical nuclear weapons soviets have 
acknowleged they had a 12to1 advantage in shorterrange nuclear 
missiles those with a range of 300 miles 
the announcement in may came as the north atlantic treaty 
organization was embroiled in a dispute about tactical nuclear 
forces the united states west germany and britain were brawling 
over whether to modernize or trade away natos few remaining 
shortrange missiles those with a range of up to 300 miles 
under the nato compromise west germany won an agreement that 
bargaining with the soviets on tactical weapons would begin but not 
until conventional arms reductions are under way 1992 at the 
earliest 
britain and the united states held fast for agreement that such 
talks would concentrate on a partial reduction of us and soviet 
warheads and not as the west germans wanted on their complete 
elimination 
gorbachev flew this morning to strasbourg from paris where he 
held a last meeting with president francois mitterrand he was to 
leave later today for bucharest romania for a warsaw pact summit 
in a statement issued at a joint news conference wednesday 
gorbachev and mitterand appealed for an immediate ceasefire in 
lebanon and a halt in arms deliveries to lebanese groups involved in 
the conflict 
mitterrand also said on wednesday that frances nuclear arsenal 
is so much smaller than those of the soviet union and the united 
states that it should not be included in arms reduction talks 
on another topic gorbachev said on wednesday that he is prepared 
to meet with solidaritys leaders and that he thinks democratization 
based on free elections should not be confined in the east bloc to 
hungary and poland 
he also said the soviet union would accept governments in eastern 
europe that are no longer dominated by the communist party 
the right to free election is of vital importance he 
said 
the countries moscow dominated by threat of force for most of the 
postwar period are now in transition moving toward a kind of 
socialist democracy gorbachev said 
but he rejected any suggestions that communism is in a worldwide 
crisis or decline and said no one should believe that we will 
renounce our values that we will renounce socialism

sir 
q yes mr president despite your recent success at the nato 
summit mr gorbachev seems to have enjoyed far greater popularity 
in western europe than you do why do you think that is and what 
can you do about it 
bush you know something i dont really care about that im not 
interested in that i am delighted that he enjoys popularity in 
europe i am delighted when he goes to germany i am pleased when he 
goes to france it is good for world peace that he takes those 
trips and i expect he will be delighted when i go to poland and 
when i go to hungary for we will be well received in those 
countries so we shouldnt view the relationships between east and 
west or between the united states and the soviet union on who seems 
to be popular at the moment were not going to get into the 
international poll business even though i read with keen interest 
a recent poll taken by the us information agency or somebody of that 
nature pointing out that the standing of the united states ill 
try to be modest was pretty darn good in europe following the nato 
summit but i would make a tremendous mistake as president of the 
united states if i was concerned about mr gorbachevs popularity 
visavis my own in terms of some poll its irrelevant whats 
important is how are we going to handle these major questions that 
were asked here arms control or economic recovery and freedom 
and democracy in eastern europe these are the questions 
and i might add parenthetically you mentioned those figures or 
standings i dont know whether youre accurate or not but even 
if they are it doesnt mean i ought to go to eastern europe to try 
to go one up try to establish a popularity level in poland or 
hungary thats not what sound foreign policy is about we want to 
see these countries in eastern europe move more down the road toward 
democracy down the road toward freedom and so i have to resist 
getting into into this popularity thing other than to say im 
pleased and i mean it i am very pleased that his standing is good 
in europe because that enables us then to work not only 
bilaterally but through nato and the pact to improve things for the 
people so it doesnt really concern me 
q mr president solidarity has asked for western aid of some 
10 billion over three years to fend off what they call economic 
disaster is there any realistic propect of the paris summit 
coming up with that kind of sum from the west 
bush i do not want to go into sums but i doubt that there will 
be an instant grant of any 10 billion but the summit the g7 
will be addressing itself themselves to this concept of what do we 
do to help economic recovery but i said in these countries as i 
said in my opening statement though i think there is a must be a 
recognition on the part of the solidarnosc leaders and the part of 
the government leaders from all stripes in poland that economic 
reform is essential if the west through multilateral institutions 
or bilaterally can do its do its upmost the economic reform is 
essential if were going to be able to help the way wed like but i 
havent heard the 10 billion figure that from solidarnosc but i 
dont want to raise expectations by saying i think we can achieve 
such a number something of that nature 
q may i follow up 
bush please 
more

with a soviet inspection team looking on 
the us army destroyed the last of its pershing 1a missiles 
thursday the first time an entire class of american nuclear weapons 
has been eliminated 
the ground shook at the longhorn army ammunition plant as white 
flames and smoke poured from the 169th pershing 1a to be destroyed 
under provisions of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
the treaty signed in 1987 by president reagan and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev requires elimination of 859 us 
intermediaterange and shorter range missiles and 1752 similar 
soviet missiles within three years 
the final 5500pound pershing 1a strapped on its side to 
reinforced stands was destroyed in two ignitions one for each of 
two rocket motors 
the first burn lasted about 40 seconds and consumed one rocket 
stage a halfminute later the second stage was fired for another 40 
seconds the more powerful of the two rocket motors carried enough 
propellant to hurtle a 3000pound car about 150 miles in 45 seconds 
some of the soviet observers watched the operation from a 
concrete bunker near the firing site another contingent was about 
1000 feet away in a second observation area 
gen maj vladimir medvedev director of the soviet nuclear risk 
reduction center watched the firing through binoculars this has 
been possible due to the new political thinking he said this 
is a major step in the direction of peace 
the general presented american officials with a small sculpture 
of a soviet missile destroyed under the treaty 
we all should be mindful that the completion of the destruction 
of the pershing 1a system is proof positive that we have moved 
forward in our relationship with the soviet union said maj gen 
marvin d brailsford commander of the us army armament munitions 
and chemical command in rock island ill 
the spent missile sections were crushed after they cooled 
the missiles marked for destruction which have a range of 300 to 
3400 miles are not armed nuclear warheads and electronic guidance 
systems were removed with the warheads stored by the department of 
energy 
thursdays operation 10 months after the first pershing 1a was 
destroyed at longhorn was conducted by utahbased thiokol inc 
which built many of the pershing motors at longhorn 
the pershing program began in 1958 with the upgrade to the 
pershing 1a 11 years later larger pershing 2 missiles will continue 
to be destroyed under terms of the inf treaty officials say nine of 
the complete missiles already have been scrapped at longhorn with 
another 234 heading to the junk heap 
the soviets began destruction of several classes of similar 
missiles a year ago

a federal judge has struck down a 1987 
minnesota law requiring dignified and sanitary disposal of aborted 
or miscarried fetuses saying the law could interfere with a womans 
right to have an abortion 
by elevating the status of a fetus to that of a person or a human 
body the law creates a psychological burden similar to those found 
unconstitutional in other states judge david doty said in a 
decision released last friday 
doty also said the law was unclear about how to dispose of fetal 
remains 
it appears substantially likely that the statute is so vague 
that persons charged with enforcement of the statute are left free 
to react to their own preferences thereby trapping those who desire 
to be lawabiding and acting without fair notice of the conduct that 
is considered unlawful doty said 
the judge noted that lawmakers drafting the law had been unable 
to agree on what type of disposal would be considered dignified 
some legislators stated that group burial or cremation would 
not be dignified while others assumed that a dignified burial or 
cremation need not be individual he wrote 
disposal of fetal remains became an issue after fetal parts 
allegedly were found in a dumpster behind a clinic and displayed by 
antiabortion activists 
the law was scheduled to go into effect aug 1 1987 but planned 
parenthood of minnesota and dr mildred hanson filed a lawsuit in 
july of that year attempting to block it restraining orders 
previously issued by doty kept the law from being enforced 
planned parenthood argued that the law suggested to women that an 
abortion is to be equated with taking a human life which would 
interfere with their right to an abortion by making the abortion 
decision psychologically more disturbing 
the state said the law would not unduly interfere with a womans 
abortion decision 
the state argued that it was not equating fetal remains with a 
dead person but was acknowledging that a fetus is different from 
other human anatomical tissues because it has the potential to 
develop into a human being doty rejected that argument 
he also said that requiring individual treatment of fetuses could 
increase the cost of an abortion by at least 40 
although to many seeking an abortion a 40 increase may seem 
insignificant but for a woman on welfare or for an unemployed 
teenager this additional cost may put the cost of an abortion 
beyond reach and become a direct burden doty said 
minnesota attorney general hubert h humphrey iii said wednesday 
that a decision on an appeal has not yet been made however he 
said i assume we will appeal that

angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi said thursday his forces and government troops both have 
violated a june 24 ceasefire but he said this should not stop 
talks to end the war 
savimbi leader of unita the national union for the total 
independence of angola signed an agreement with the luanda 
government june 22 in gbadolite zaire to begin peace negotiations 
the agreement included a truce in the 14year guerrilla war 
but angolan president jose eduardo dos santos has suspended the 
peace talks because of guerilla violations of the ceasefire 
that there have been attacks froavimbis decision to accept the gbadolite 
agreement has earned 
him a legitimacy he did not know during the war he was photographed 
at the zaire summit with several african leaders whose governments 
had called his guerrillas puppets of south africa 
and although ivorian president felix houphouetboigny had quietly 
supported savimbis calls for national reconciliation in the former 
portuguese colony the angolan guerrilla leader had never appeared 
publicly in the ivory coast before thursdays news conference 
in the past the guerrilla leader arranged to fly reporters into 
his stronghold in southeastern angola 
savimbi agreed to absent himself from direct participation in the 
peace negotiations but he made it clear suggestions he go into 
exile are out of the question 
he said if exile had even been suggested he would not have 
attended the summit 
i do not think there are any grounds for discussing exile or 
integration because it is not going to happen at all savimbi said 
he said his movements goal remains free national elections 
which dos santos rejects and suggested africa learn from the 
democracy process in some eastern european countries 
we do not think that the oneparty system is good savimbi 
said africa also is going to make progress you see what is 
happening in poland and hungary let us just do it now he said

christians and syrians broke a twoday 
lull in their long artillery war thursday and traffic dissolved in a 
din of blaring horns as shells rained on beirut during the morning 
rush hour 
police said five people were killed and 13 wounded bringing the 
total to 402 dead and 1551 wounded since the battle began march 8 
between christian army units and a moslem alliance of druse 
militiamen and syrian soldiers 
panicky motorists sped away in all directions and pedestrians 
rushed to bomb shelters to escape shells and rockets that began 
falling at 8 am on moslem west beirut and on the citys eastern 
sector where christians live 
vegetable vendors abandoned their stalls and sought refuge in 
building entrances when a shell crashed into the main street of 
karakon a druse district of west beirut 
the whoosh of rockets thunder of shells and wail of ambulance 
sirens filled the air across the battered city steel shutters 
slammed down on shops and banks 
as abruptly as it began the battle subsided at 930 am and 
settled into what has become a daily pattern the intermittent thud 
of shells fired by the syrians at the christianheld coast north of 
beirut 
lakhdar ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the arab league 
drove into west beirut from syria just before the shooting stopped 
to meet with lebanese leaders about how to end one of the worst 
episodes in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
he spent 90 minutes with acting premier salim hoss who heads a 
moslem cabinet vying for power with that of gen michel aoun 
commander of the christian forces fighting the syrians and druse 
ibrahimi an algerian refused to speak with reporters after 
conferring with hoss and crossed the citys sectarian dividing line 
to meet with aoun in the shattered presidential palace at baabda a 
christian suburb 
police said syrian howitzers in north lebanon opened fire briefly 
at about noon on a small freighter carrying food supplies to byblos 
a christianrun port 19 miles north of beirut but the ship docked 
without damage 
a spokesman for aouns command said the syrians provoked 
thursdays battle by firing before dawn at towns in the 
310squaremile christian enclave north and east of beirut 
before the latest artillery duel began presidents mikhail s 
gorbachev of the soviet union and francois mitterrand of france 
urged that both sides observe a ceasefire and said arms deliveries 
to warring lebanese factions should be halted 
they issued a joint statement during gorbachevs visit to france 
on wednesday press reports said syria had demanded aoun remove 
mediumrange missiles capable of reaching damascus that his forces 
were said to have received from iraq 
asked whether such missiles had been delivered aouns spokesman 
said thursday if so then their withdrawal is linked to the 
syrian pullout from lebanon he refused to elaborate 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate 
issued by the arab league in 1976 the year after the civil war 
began early in the 4monthold artillery war aoun said the syrians 
were an occupation force and he was fighting a war of liberation

about 30 americans are planning to participate 
in a peninsulawide peace march in korea according to organizers 
who said thursday the event could spark retaliation from south 
korean government leaders 
the americans will meet 100 people from 16 countries then divide 
up for simultaneous marches through south korea and communist north 
korea according to organizers 
we feel a special responsibility to participate in this 
historic march because it is the presence of 43000 us troops in 
south korea that is the primary obstacle to overcoming the cruel 
division of korea which is a legacy of world war ii and the cold 
war that followed said channing liem former south korean 
ambassador to the united nations and now a us citizen 
jihoon lee of the young koreans united said many fear that those 
marching through south korea may be violently suppressed given 
the current repressive climate 
lee and liem pointed to the recent arrest of hundreds of leading 
student and trade union activists after a visit by south korean 
clergyman moon ik hwan to north korea 
the peace march is part of the international peace and 
reunification study tour of korea participants will travel through 
many towns villages and cities to talk with residents and visit 
their workplaces schools and community centers 
besides the estimated 30 americans other participants will come 
from australia the philippines latin america africa europe and 
the asiapacific region for the july 20 event 
a demilitarized zone dividing korea originally was created as 
part of a temporary truce agreement organizers said marchers will 
call for a permanent peace pact 
in the past the south korean government has mobilized prevented 
marchers supporting reunification from reaching the zone lee said 
whit hutchison a methodist minister and educator said the march 
should call attention to the international power politics being 
played in that country 
for the entire period of my life americans have been deeply 
implicated in a divided and militarized korea said hutchison 
susan bailey of the peoples antiwar mobilization also 
criticized the role of the united states in korea last year bailey 
was arrested during a visit to south korea and deported

a senior government official said 
thursday that stalled talks with south korea cannot resume unless 
seoul frees a dissident clergyman who was jailed for visiting north 
korea 
the south korean authorities must release the rev moon 
ikhwan chon kum chol vice chairman of the commission for the 
reunification of the fatherland said at a news conference if he 
is released all the talks will be resumed between the north and the 
south 
chon also said future talks could be jeopardized if south korea 
arrests im sukyong a 20yearold student who also defied a seoul 
ban on travel to north korea to attend an international youth 
festival 
he said that if miss im like moon is arrested upon her return 
it will b will be a great challenge and we will regard it as a 
great obstacle to northsouth dialogue 
moon a leading critic of the south korea government of president 
roh taewoo was detained after a visit to north korea in march in 
which he held lengthy talks with north korean president kim il sung 
on possible korean reunification 
chon said the south korean national security law which bans 
unauthorized trips to north korea is the worst evil law 
the two nations divided since 1945 resumed direct talks last 
fall with seven meetings of lawmakers discussing steps toward a 
nonaggression pact and other tensioneasing measures 
talks also were held early this year on preparing for a meeting 
of the two nations prime ministers and on organizing a joint team 
for the 1990 asian games in beijing 
but north korea suspended the parliamentary talks in february to 
protest the annual ussouth korean team spirit military 
maneuvers and the other talks were called off in april after moons 
arrest 
chon accused the south of raising a frantic anticommunist 
antinorth clamor after the moon trip and said the roh government 
had made no proposals for reunification 
confrontation between the north and the south is now quite 
acute he said 
chon said north korea had proposed red cross talks on aug 15 on 
reuniting divided families he did not list the red cross talks 
last held in 1985 among the dialogues that will be affected by the 
moon case 
chon also indicated that north korea would be willing to hold 
meaningful talks with the united states if the joint military 
maneuvers are suspended 
everything depends on the united states he said if they 
show a change in attitude we may be willing to reciprocate 
north korea says the presence of 43000 us troops in south 
korea is the main obstacle to easing tensions it has proposed a 
phased withdrawal of us troops by 1991 to be accompanied by a 
reduction of both north and south korean forces

exhaustive research has failed to 
clear up the mystery of a home movie found under a seat in john 
lennons psychedelic rolls royce 
as a result officials at the transportation museum of british 
columbia have released the uneven heavily spliced film shot in 
1970 in the beacon hill area of boston 
what we can do now is let it go to the public said museum 
development officer fred davies with positive identification of 
people in the film then maybe well get some more information 
the biggest mystery is how did the film get into john lennons 
rolls royce davies said wednesday that is the magic question 
the 28minute home movie shows several young men and women in 
their late teens or early 20s smoking a hookah or water pipe 
followed by several surreal images of a church a television cartoon 
show and numerous wine bottles 
maybe theyre trying to depict what happens after you smoke 
this thing who knows davies mused while showing the film to 
reporters 
another highlight is footage of a total eclipse of the sun as 
seen in new england on march 7 1970 along with a peace 
demonstration attended by the young people and boston police 
equipped with riot gear 
the 8mm color movie was found in november under a passenger seat 
in the late beatles 1965 phantom v rolls royce which lennon had 
painted with flowers scrolls and zodiac signs 
vancouver millionaire jim pattison bought the car for 23 
million at an auction in 1985 and brought it to british columbia for 
display at the expo 86 worlds fair pattison later donated the 
vehicle to the province and it has become the top attraction and 
publicity generator for the museum 
museum researchers have failed to turn up more information on the 
film and davies suggested that the filmmaker and participants might 
be keeping quiet to preserve their reputations 
weve had a few dead ends he said maybe 20 years later 
they might be senators or presidents of corporations

pact consultative committee 
while turning down gusev the legislature approved the 
nominations of two junior members of the supreme court aleksandr m

the latest victims of the militant leftwing extremists are seven 
people killed wednesday including three men accused of supporting 
the government and two moslems whose bodies were left hanging from a 
coconut tree police said

3500 people in southern sri lanka where they have fought for two 
years to overthrow the government most victims are government 
officials or supporters of prime minister ranasinghe premadasas 
governing party 
we will not allow the government to be displaced by guntoting 
criminals wijeratna told reporters our armed forces and police 
have been given wide powers to deal with all forms of subversion in 
the most ruthless manner

violence or putting up antigovernment posters

front also instigated a fourweek strike by transport workers that 
is crippling the economy 
on censorship wijeratna told reporters i will cancel your 
visas and deport you if you violate the censorship

reports on the radical sinhalese movement that went into effect 
thursday morning

country without being censored if you cannot conform to that 
please leave the country 
local journalists who violate the laws will be jailed he said

discriminated against by the sinhalese who are mostly buddhists and 
comprise 75 percent of this island nations 16 million people

month to a truce 
however the rebels continue to fight 40000 indian soldiers 
deployed on the island to end the insurrection new delhi has 
refused colombos request to withdraw its troops saying the rebel 
truce is a ruse and that they will continue fighting once indian 
troops withdraw 
new delhi also says a hasty pullout would lead to greater 
bloodshed in the northeast where 9000 people mostly sinhalese 
have been killed 
on tuesday indian prime minister rajiv gandhi offered to discuss 
a timetable for a gradual withdrawal 
wijeratna told reporters thursday that his government will not

q mr president mr gorbachev has rejected your call for a 
soviet military withdrawal to withdraw from poland as purely 
propaganda how do you plead to that is it a dead letter now or 
where do you go with it 
bush i didnt know that he rejected it i just thought he said 
it was propaganda 
q you dont take that as a rejection 
bush well as a lack of enthusiasm perhaps laughter he 
didnt say rejection i mean hes just taken trips out of hungary 
and who would have said two years ago that that would happen we 
salute that we think that is good and so im not trying to 
exacerbate problems for him in poland i think i was asked the 
question would you like to see the day when there are no troops in 
poland or something of that nature and i said yes but i and he 
viewed that as political its not political its a visceral 
feeling i have on the question i think it would be nice to aspire 
to that kind of a situation where troops he wouldnt feel troops 
were necessary put it that way 
and i would have a feeling that at some point the polish people 
might feel that way but were not trying to as i say make things 
more difficult for him just as when he goes to france and germany i 
dont think hes trying to make things more difficult for the united 
states were in a very interesting period of change and i have 
said we want to see perestroika succeed and i want to see glasnost 
succeed and ill repeat it here and my trip over there is not to 
try to through that statement or anything else drive wedges 
between the soviet union and eastern europe thats not what 1989 
diplomacy is about hes talking about a european home and im 
saying thats a good concept but lets be sure a guy can move 
from room to room lets be sure its open lets be sure people can 
move around in this home 
so we can discuss all these things and im sorry he 
misinterpreted or elected to characterize my view as what you say 
political but that doesnt change my view and i dont expect it 
changes the views of the people of poland but were not going to be 
there trying to you know raise tensions were going to be there 
trying to help the polish people to encourage poland towards 
reform to express the friendship and affection for poland that 
exists in a tremendous quantity here in the united states and we 
will be carefully very carefully discussing these other 
relationships mainly i might add with our european partners as 
we did at the nato summit so but well see eye to eye on that 
its going to take a little while

a public relations executive who testified 
against oliver l north was placed on probation thursday for 
illegally using a taxexempt foundation to raise donations for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
richard r miller was sentenced on his 1987 guilty plea to 
conspiracy to defraud the treasury by using a taxexempt foundation 
to raise 32 million for the nondeductible purpose of buying 
armaments for the contras 
us district judge stanley s harris placed miller on twoyears 
probation and ordered him to perform 120 hours of community service 
harris noting that miller had already suffered many adversities 
as a result of his guilty plea said i need not impose more for 
justice to be served 
miller who cooperated with independent counsel lawrence e 
walshs investigation of the irancontra affair could have been 
sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to 250000 
i let my guard down it may have been blind patriotism but 
thats no excuse miller told harris helping the contras was a 
cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor i turned a 
blind eye to the excesses of others and i crossed the line myself 
prosecutors made no sentencing recommendation but noted in court 
pleadings that miller had cooperated with their investigation of the 
private foundation that raised some 10 million for the contras when 
us military aid was banned by congress 
after the sentencing associate independent counsel david zornow 
said miller came forward at a very early stage of the 
investigation to admit his wrongdoing pleaded guilty to a very 
serious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government 
he lived up to his agreement with the government zornow 
said this closes the chapter on mr miller 
miller and carl r spitz channell who is scheduled to be 
sentenced friday for his guilty plea to the same tax conspiracy 
charge both testified that north was part of the conspiracy to 
raise money through the taxexempt national endowment for the 
preservation of liberty 
north was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that 
convicted him trying to cover up the irancontra affair and 
accepting a home security system 
on wednesday north was fined 150000 placed on twoyears 
probation and ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service 
miller who raised money and helped move it to offshore bank 
accounts for distribution to the contras testified that north let 
him take a 10 percent of the money he handled as his cut 
alluding to norths sentence defense attorney earl c dudley jr 
said imprisoning miller would be unfair because of the treatment of 
others more seriusly involved in the irancontra affair 
in another reference to north dudley said that during the 
lengthy investigations of the irancontra affair miller never 
once turned to a paper shredder he never once turned to the option 
of lying 
miller is the third person to be sentenced for his involvement in 
the irancontra affair 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane was placed on 
probation on march 3 after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges 
of withholding information from congress about the secret 
armssupply network 
still pending are cases against john w poindexter mcfarlanes 
successor as national security adviser who is awaiting trial on 
felony charges of obstructing congress and making false statements 
also awaiting trial are arms dealers richard v secord and albert 
hakim who are charged with conspiring to pay illegal gratuities to 
north 
they are accused of arranging to install a 13800 security 
system outside norths house and setting up a 200000 swiss bank 
account for norths family 
former cia agent joseph f fernandez is scheduled to stand trial 
july 24 on charges he lied to the cia and the presidential 
commission that investigated the irancontra affair about his role 
setting up an airstrip on costa rica for the arms resupply operation 
no trial dates have been set for poindexter and hakim secords 
trial is tentatively set for nov 13

this is the last one the moving last question yes 
q mr president dont you feel that there is a problem because 
the president in poland has not been elected yet and you arrive 
without meeting a chief of state there 
bush slight complication but no thats a polish affair thats 
a matter for poland to decide thats not a matter for the united 
states to say im not going there until you have this all 
ironclad worked out its not our business we will deal with the 
polish leadership and it complicates it i think your questions a 
very good one and knowing what mr jaruzelskis plans may be with 
finality but well have good discussions there with whoever our 
interlocutors are because we are not trying to sort out those 
internal developments thats not the role of the president of the 
united states my role is along the lines of my answer to my last 
question to extend to them whatever help we can to tell them we 
identify with reform and political openness to salute the fact that 
solidarnosc which was outlawed when i was in poland not so many 
months ago is now legal and to see how we can work with them as 
they move forward toward more reform and more openness so i have 
to deal with whats there with who is there and do it with 
respect and not look like well if you dont have all your 
internal political matters sorted out as you begin this march down 
democracys road well we wont come to poland i mean im going 
to deal with whos over there and i salute them 
it takes these are difficult changes that they sort out whos 
going to stand for president and whos not weve got to understand 
that in this country i mean weve taken a long long time to get 
to where we are in terms of the stability that comes from elections 
every four years but we cant impose or say if you dont agree 
with us on this formulation that were going to hold back or be 
reluctant to discuss with you the political situation with whoever 
you tell us say is going to come meet me or deal with it i 
really am looking forward to that im looking forward to our trip 
to hungary very very much 
and for those of you who may be new here the affection for 
poland and the affection for hungary in all our communities in the 
united states is really high its really strong and if i can do 
nothing else but explain that and say we want you to succeed in 
these changes that visit will be worthwhile even if they havent 
sorted out their internal political situations with every t 
crossed and every i dotted its going to be a good trip 
thank you all very much

president robert mugabes socialist party 
won a parliamentary byelection by a clear margin and trounced a new 
political party committed to westernstyle democracy official 
results indicated thursday 
but the loser said a low voter turnout reflects apathy toward the 
government 
we have given zanu pf a big fright the low poll shows zanu 
pf has no support people are disenchanted businessman fibion 
mutikori candidate of the zimbabwe unity movement told reporters 
after results were announced 
herbert ushewokunze election director for mugabes zimbabwe 
african national union patriotic front said his partys victory 
was a vote against disunity and destabilization 
harare city councilor ephraim masawi 39 polled 7254 votes 
against 3125 for mutikori in dzivaresekwa a sprawling constituency 
stretching east from suburban harare to peasant and commercial 
farmlands 
there were 500 spoiled ballots 
only 16 percent of the 64000 registered voters took part in the 
tuesday and wednesday poll compared to 80 percent at the last 
elections in 1985 election officials said 
mutikori 34 described the results as an encouraging test for 
the zimbabwe unity movement which fought its first election on an 
anticorruption ticket 
the new party wants to keep this southern african nation a 
multiparty democracy mugabe says he will make it a oneparty state 
we are only 67 days old we have not been allowed to campaign 
but we still captured 28 percent of the vote mutikori said 
in the 1985 elections mugabes party polled more than 90 percent 
of votes in dzivaresekwa 
the zimbabwe unity movement was formed on april 30 by renegade 
politician edgar tekere the former secretarygeneral of mugabes 
party who was no 3 in the governing party hierarchy 
tekere has accused the government of intimidating his party 
officials and cites the arrests of several party workers for 
suspected subversion as evidence of state interference in the 
election 
in may tekere said police invoked public order laws to ban a 
political rally in harare the capital 
on june 11 the new party canceled a second rally when it found 
itself locked out of a stadium where the meeting was to take place 
tekere 52 was fired last october from the party he helped found 
after he denounced official corruption and criticized mugabes aim 
to establish a oneparty state 
this weeks byelection was to fill a seat in the 100member 
house of assembly held by the late maurice nyagumbo a senior 
cabinet minister who committed suicide after he was named in a 
judicial inquiry investigating corruption 
four other ministers resigned their seats after it was found they 
used their influence to buy cars from a stateassembly plant and 
resold them at inflated prices 
new cars are in short supply in zimbabwe and can fetch up to four 
times the price fixed by the state 
mugabes party last year merged with the main opposition party 
joshua nkomos zimbabwe african peoples union patriotic front 
giving the new combined ruling party all but one of the seats in the 
national assembly the lone opponent is a member of the exiled rev 
ndabaningi sitholes zimbabwe african national union

the chief prosecutor sought a life 
sentence thursday for christer pettersson in what he described as 
the coldblooded execution of prime minister olof palme 
summing up the state case in the monthlong trial anders helin 
alleged pettersson followed palme from a movie theater on feb 28 
1986 and shot him in the back from a distance of 4 inches to 8 
inches 
pettersson a 42yearold swede who has served a jail term for 
manslaughter and who is a known drug and alcohol abuser denies 
killing the swedish leader 
palme was a fourterm prime minister who dominated swedish 
politics for more than a decade and earned his country its 
reputation as an international mediator and champion of world 
disarmament 
helin recounted the testimony of palmes widow lisbeth and five 
others who testified they saw pettersson at the scene of the 
assassination 
mrs palme he said had pointed out pettersson at a videotaped 
police lineup and again in the courtroom after studying pictures of 
647 other possible suspects during the threeyear manhunt 
he said the verdict could only be firstdegree murder when 
considering that he waited for olof palme that he to quote the 
witness inge morelius executed him in cold blood with a shot in 
the back 
if the district court decides it was murder that means a life 
prison sentence helin said 
a life sentence in sweden usually is remitted to a term of 14 to 
20 years and prison authorities routinely grant paroles even for 
serious crimes after twothirds of the sentence has been served 
the verdict and sentence will be decided by two judges and six 
lay jurors each with an equal vote their decision is expected 
later this month 
earlier the court canceled its morning session when defense 
attorney arne liljeros asked to check new evidence he said he got 
overnight 
liljeros said the information is intended to give more 
credibility to the only witness who supported petterssons alibi 
the defendant said he was at a suburban train station 17 miles from 
the scene at the time of the killing liljeros said he would address 
the issue in his summation monday 
recreating the night of the killing helin said no one knew in 
advance of palmes lastminute plan to go to a movie with his wife 
the couple also decided on the spur of the moment to walk home 
he said pettersson waiting to make a drug contact saw the 
palmes enter the theater left to get a gun and returned to wait 
for the swedish leader to emerge 
he followed the couple down sveavagen street passed them and 
waited in ambush at a street corner the prosecutor said 
after the shooting mrs palme saw pettersson twice helin said 
once when she looked up for help when her husband fell fatally 
wounded and again a few minutes later when he was farther away 
although she did not see a gun other witnesses testified that 
only the palmes and one other person were at the corner 
the state contends pettersson is hostile to any authority and 
cites this as a motive

president bush spurned a call thursday from 
mikhail s gorbachev for swift negotiations on shortrange nuclear 
missiles and challenged the soviet leader anew to withdraw red army 
troops from poland 
conceding gorbachev had described the idea of a troop pullout as 
propaganda bush said i didnt know he rejected it a lack of 
enthusiasm perhaps 
bush said it would be nice to aspire to a situation where 
gorbachev wouldnt feel troops were necessary i would have a 
feeling that at some point the polish people might feel that way 
hes just taken troops out of hungary bush said who would 
have said two years ago that that would happen we salute that we 
think that is good 
bush used a nationally broadcast news conference to set the stage 
for a trip beginning sunday to poland and hungary he also will 
visit paris for a sevennation economic summit and make a oneday 
stop in the netherlands the first visit there ever by an american 
president 
in his first comments on the sentence imposed wednesday against 
former white house aide oliver north bush said im glad hes not 
going to jail he refused to comment further 
north was fined 150000 and put on probation for two years for 
his role in the irancontra affair 
bushs news conference came on the same day that gorbachev 
winding up a visit to france offered to make additional and rapid 
cuts in soviet nuclear forces if nato agreed to hold negotiations on 
tactical or shortrange nuclear weapons 
bush noted that nato leaders at a summit in brussels had agreed 
to begin negotiations on tactical weapons only after an eastwest 
agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forces and 
reductions were actually under way 
the answer is to please read carefully what happened in 
brussels he said to look at the united nato position and to go 
forward with the agenda at hand that will be the message i 
dont want to get off the track by reopening the shortrange nuclear 
forces package he said 
i see no reason to stand here and try to change a collective 
decision taken by nato the president said adding we welcome 
unilateral cuts on his side certainly 
bush declared himself untroubled by gorbachevs visit to france 
and an earlier tour of west germany saying it was good for world 
peace that he takes those trips he added i expect he will be 
delighted when i go to poland and when i go to hungary for we will 
be well received in those countries 
he also said he wasnt bothered by gorbachevs popularity in 
western europe 
i dont really care about that im not interested in that 
bush said adding that a usgovernment commission poll after the 
nato summit in may demonstrated that the united states standing was 
pretty darn good 
questions about his visit to eastern europe dominated the 
halfhour question and answer session 
the president said his stops in poland and hungary were not 
intended to stir up trouble for gorbachev or drive wedges 
between the soviet union and eastern europe 
thats not what 1989 diplomacy is about bush said 
were not going to be there trying to raise tensions bush 
pledged were going to be there trying to encourage the polish 
people to move toward reforms 
while saying he wasnt trying to make things more difficult 
for gorbachev bush urged east germany and other less open warsaw 
pact nations to come along with the flow 
he said he looked forward to a europe that is whole and free 
our challenge is to help create the conditions under which the 
hungarians and poles can recover economically and make the 
transition he said of his pending visits to two nations in 
the throes of extraordinary political and economic change 
he noted he could not impose his wishes on the internal affairs 
of the governments of poland and hungary but made clear that he 
hopes his visit will assist a trend toward openness 
later bush told a white house symposium on eastern europe he 
would press for an international effort to aid the polish and 
hungarian economies when he is in europe 
they face enormous and political problems they need our 
support in their efforts simply showing our sympathy and 
encouragement is not enough bush said 
both countries have undergone dramatic political reforms in

a backyard fisherman reeling in a bluegill 
stepped into a lake to free the fish from a clump of weeds and was 
nearly hauled in himself by a 7foot alligator 
i punched him on the top of the head punched him real hard 
and he let go in fact my fist is swollen said william barger 
who suffered two gashes in his left thigh 
i think when i stepped down in the water he had just been 
laying there and the first thing he saw was my leg said the 
6foot2 230pound barger the gator just popped up out of the 
water and grabbed me by the leg if he had grabbed my ankle or 
wrist he probably would have taken it right off 
after tuesdays attack three florida game and fresh water fish 
commission officers and a trapper went to the mobile home park

federal investigators made a surprise 
visit to a former nuclear fuel plant thursday as part of a 
nationwide probe of environmental and safety problems at nuclear 
facilities officials said 
fbi agents and the federal department of energys tiger team 
of environmental specialists descended on the upstate new york plant 
looking for evidence of possible violations of federal laws 
governing hazardous wastes according to dennis c vacco the us 
attorney in buffalo 
they would probably be at the site for several weeks officials 
said 
vacco said the investigation was not specifically concerned with 
nuclear wastes which is the main type of waste handled at the west 
valley demonstration project 
there is no current information of any problem in handling 
nuclear wastes he said were looking at pure hazardous 
wastes 
pure wastes are nonnuclear chemical wastes 
vacco would not elaborate on possible problems or the nature of 
the wastes but people familiar with the plant said the 
investigation may involve the storage of chemicals used when the 
plant was still operating in the 1970s 
west valley about 50 miles south of buffalo is a former nuclear 
fuel reprocessing facility that is currently being decommissioned 
and decontaminated thousands of gallons of liquid radioactive waste 
stored in decaying underground tanks are being solidified into 
cement drums and glass logs 
raymond vaughn of the west valley committee on nuclear waste a 
citizens group that opposes the storage of wastes at the site said 
he was not familiar with any chemical waste problems 
it must be the old chemicals that were used in reprocessing 
he said the chemicals they use now are relatively innocuous 
he said toxic chemicals were used in reprocessing in the past 
and some may have been stored at the site 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said thursday in washington 
that the west valley investigation was the first of 17 such probes 
by energy department specialists over the next year at federal 
nuclear facilities 
the energy department took over operation of the new york 
stateowned plant 50 miles south of buffalo in 1980 the government 
is spending 800 million to clean up the facility 
energy secretary james d watkins announced last month that he 
had created tiger teams of specialists to assess environmental 
compliance at all energy department nuclear facilities including 
the nuclear weapons plants 
the west valley investigation is the first assignment of that 
special team according to christina sankey a department 
spokeswoman 
in addition to reviewing the handling of wastes the team will 
also assess administrative and managerial procedures ms sankey 
said 
it was a surprise to us said micki andrus a west valley 
spokeswoman we knew of admiral watkins plan but didnt know they 
would be coming here first 
ms andrus said several investigators met with project managers 
thursday afternoon and that more members of the investigating team 
were to arrive friday 
she said operations at the facility were not affected by the 
investigation which is expected to take four to six weeks

known in roman times asbestos was for many 
years was one of the most welcomed of natural products its strength 
and resistance to heat made it ideal for many construction and 
insulation uses 
it had a stength 10 times that of steel yet could be woven like 
cotton into a fabric that resisted flames and acids it was tough 
enough to brake a speeding locomotive and flexible enough to be 
sprayed onto school building walls and ceilings for insulation 
during the first 80 years of this century more than 30 million 
tons of asbestos found various uses in this country most was 
imported from canada 
but its widespread use began to decline in the 1970s after 
pioneering research by dr irving selikoff of the mt sinai school 
of medicine in new york made it clear that exposure to microscopic 
breathable asbestos particles can cause lung cancer and other severe 
illnesses such as mesothelioma an incurable cancer of the chest and 
abdominal membranes and asbestosis a chronic diseas of the lungs 
that makes breathing progressively more difficult 
the word asbestos actually is a generic term for a variety of 
minerals with tightly woven structures that provide unusual strength 
and flexibility 
the most commonly used asbestos is chrysotile a white magnesium 
silicate mined mainly in quebec canada other commercial forms of 
asbestos are crocidolite a blue tinged compound and amosite which 
is brown both are mined in south africa 
asbestos was used most extensively from the end of world war ii 
until the early 1970s 
in 1972 the environmental protection agency listed asbestos as a 
harzardous air pollutant and in 1978 it restricted its uses banning 
sprayon asbestos insulation 
in recent years asbestos use in the united states fell from 
240000 metric tons in 1984 to 85000 metric tons in 1987

the state department on thursday discounted the 
contention of american scientists that they had succeeded in an 
experiment to detect the presence of a nuclear warhead aboard a 
soviet warship in the black sea 
the department also said the only way to find effective 
verification methods for the presence of nuclear warheads on 
sealaunched missiles was through governmenttogovernment efforts 
and not by private organizations 
the joint experiment was conducted wednesday by the soviet 
academy of sciences a statesponsored body and by the natural 
resources defense council a washington environmentaladvocacy 
organization 
the experiment sought to address claims by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev that the presence of nuclear weapons aboard 
ships and submarines can be effectively verified 
deputy soviet foreign minister viktor karpov said after the trial 
that this method is regarded by the ussr to be useful at 
creating a comprehensive system for verification 
karpov speaking on the evening television news program vremya 
agreed other means were necessary in any verification system and 
said he hoped the experiment would lead to further cooperative work 
on the subject by american and soviet scientists 
the united states has treated the soviet claims very cautiously 
saying effective verification continues to be one of the most 
difficult obstacles on the way of concluding the strategic arms 
reduction treaty which would cut superpower atomic arsenals by 30 
percent to 50 percent 
negotiations on a start agreement resumed last month in geneva 
but the united states citing problems of verification has rejected 
the soviet demand that the pact include a curb on nucleartipped 
cruise missiles aboard submarines 
us navy officers say they will not allow soviets aboard 
american submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed to 
determine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional or 
nuclear warhead 
in the black sea experiment the scientists used a variety of 
radiationdetection devices to measure the emission of neutrons and 
gamma rays from a nuclear wearhead on an ssn12 subsonic cruise 
missile aboard the soviet missile cruiser slava 
the us scientists from princeton and stanford universities 
made their measurements with portable detectors placed alongside the 
deck launcher less than a yard from the warhead 
simultaneously soviet scientists from the academys institutes 
of geochemistry and earth physics used radiationdetection devices 
carried in a military helicopter and a troop transport 
but deputy state department spokesman richard boucher said the 
operation was not conducted under operational conditions it does 
not take into account the possibility that the effectiveness of 
radiationdetection equipment could be undermined or circumvented by 
shielding concealment or other countermeasures 
boucher said the experiment could create unwarranted 
expectations on the part of the soviet union at the start talks 
he noted that the american physicists had also conceded their 
experiment would not provide fullproof verification against 
cheating 
despite our extensive efforts the state department spokesman 
said the united states has not yet found ways to effectively 
verify limits on nucleararmed sealaunched cruise missiles we 
believe that issues such as slcm sealaunched cruise missiles 
verification can be dealt with effectively only in a 
governmenttogovernment context 
but tom cochran one of the physicists said all the systems 
tested successfully during the measurments 
among the observers on the soviet carrier were three demcoratic 
members of the house they are reps john spratt a member of the 
house armed services committee from south carolina bob carr from 
michigan and james olin of virginia

a chemical storage tank along the houston ship 
channel exploded thursday killing one worker and sparking a fire 
authorities said 
investigators were still trying to determine the cause of the 
explosion in the upper level of a 50foot metal storage tank no 
other injuries were reported and no evacuation was necessary fire 
department spokesman mike warnke said 
the oxide inc tank which contained a form of glycol monomer 
exploded while the victim was working on the tank warnke said 
he was working near the top of the tank and was blown off by 
the explosion warnke said its possible that the explosion 
could have been related to his work but we dont know yet there 
was also a thunderstorm moving through the area at the time 
warnke said the tank was partially filled with liquid chemicals 
and the remainder was filled with vapor but the level was not known 
the name and age of the victim were not immediately available

the navy has put off until early august the 
second submarine launch test of its newest and most powerful nuclear 
weapon the trident 2 missile pentagon officials said thursday 
the first such test ended in failure on march 21 when the 
missile selfdestructed four seconds after it was launched by the 
submarine uss tennessee off the coast of cape canaveral 
although a second test had been anticipated for midjuly 
pentagon spokesman pete williams announced that the navys analysis 
of tests involving the missiles rebuilt nozzle control system would 
not be completed in time to meet such a schedule 
therefore the test has been rescheduled for early august 
williams said 
the delay will not affect the navys plans to meet its deadline 
for putting the submarine missile in full operation by march 1990 
the spokesman said 
in the first attempt to launch the missile from the submerged 
tennessee the weapon popped to the surface as planned and the first 
stage ignited properly but the missile then began spinning like a 
burning pinwheel and exploded 
afterwards pentagon officials said they suspected a mechanical 
fault in the part of the missile that swivels the rocket nozzles 
from side to side thereby directing the missiles angle of flight 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the trident 
1 the new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to 
individual targets up to 4600 miles away 
the trident 1 experienced some test failures but was deployed on 
schedule pentagon officials said after the trident 2s first test 
failure 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it is 
launched from a submerged moving submarine 
the tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 
24 of the missiles 
navy spokeswoman lt janet mescus said in may that analysis of 
data and parts recovered from the failed test indicated the missile 
went out of control for two reasons 
one problem originated in the mechanical link that transmits 
direction commands to the first stage exhaust nozzle which pivots 
to control the missiles direction the second involved the timing 
and degree of the nozzle position commands as pressure was building 
in the motor early in the missiles flight 
instead of commands directing the missile to go up and out it 
went up and over mescus said 
the missile also known as the d5 is built by the lockheed 
missiles amp space co and costs 265 million each

on the day it was scheduled to take effect 
the citys new domestic partnership law was suspended because a 
petition to take the issue to voters appeared to be valid city 
officials said thursday 
two conservative clergymen submitted a petition with 27122 
signatures to the registrar of voters on wednesday in an effort to 
block the law and put it on the november ballot 
they need 18800 certified signatures to succeed and have a 
5050 chance of qualifying for the nov 7 election according to 
registrar of voters germaine wong 
the law which recognizes gay and lesbian couples as well as 
unmarried heterosexual unions was unanimously approved by the board 
of supervisors in may mayor art agnos signed it into law june 5 
making san francisco the first major metropolitan city to adopt such 
legislation 
the new law permits livein lovers to register with the city for 
35 in a procedure similar to filing a marriage license the law 
grants hospital visitation rights and bereavement leave to city 
employees and a provision to extend health care benefits to city 
workers is being studied 
no one actually signed up with the city as domestic partners 
before the law was suspended said assistant county clerk la vergne 
keppard 
supporters expressed annoyance at the repeal effort but were 
confident that the challenge will be defeated if it qualifies for 
the ballot 
weve got more than 60 percent of the voters support for 
domestic partners said jean harris an aide to supervisor harry 
britt who authored the legislation 
although wong said it will take her office several days to 
validate the signatures the city charter requires suspension of the 
new law because the petition appears to contain the requisite 
number of signatures deputy city attorney buck delventhal said 
after a meeting with city officials 
if the referendum qualifies for the ballot the board of 
supervisors would have the option of repealing the domestic 
partnership ordinance or sending it to the voters for approval 
if the petition is ultimately rejected the new law will 
automatically take effect 
proponents heralded the law as a symbol of the validity of gay 
relationships opponents led by the catholic church said the 
legislation weakened the sanctity of marriage 
the up side of this whole repeal thing is that we will have 
four months to educate the public and to really get the issues out 
there and to help people really understand what domestic partnership 
is about said larry brinkin of the citys human rights 
commission which was responsible for implementing the new law 
brinkin who had planned to register with his lover as domestic 
partners at a mass signin party in august said he was 
disappointed but not surprised by the repeal effort 
its not that i dont think people should have the right to 
vote but i dont think its necessary he said thats what i 
hire supervisors to do i want them to make the laws 
leaders of the catholic church did not sanction the repeal 
effort but archdiocese spokesman deacon norman phillips said 
obviously we are in sympathy with its being taken off the books 
the petition was submitted by the rev charles mcilhenny a 
pastor at the first orthodox presbyterian church and by rabbi 
lionel feldman who is not affiliated with a synagogue according to 
the board of rabbis of northern california 
reached at his church mcilhenny refused to comment feldman also 
declined to talk to reporters on wednesday

irans new supreme leader ali khamenei 
on thursday urged moslems to demonstrate and defy saudi arabias ban 
on political activity during the annual pilgrimage to the holy 
cities of mecca and medina 
this is the second year iranians have stayed away from the 
pilgrimage in protest of a saudi limit on participants 
but pilgrims from other nations should protest all 
conspiracies facing islam especially salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses said khamenei who was chosen on june 4 to 
lead iran after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
his 18page message was carried by irans state radio and the 
official islamic republic news agency both monitored in nicosia 
an estimated 18 million pilgrims from 80 countries are making 
the annual pilgrimage or hajj to mecca the birthplace of the 
prophet mohammed pilgrims also travel to medina to visit the tomb 
of the 7th century founder of islam 
last year saudi arabia began limiting the number of pilgrims 
based on a countrys population at that time iran was allowed 
45000 people or onethird the number it planned to send 
the pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since 
irans islamic revolution in 1979 in that year religious 
extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca and held it for two 
weeks before saudi forces stormed it 
more than 250 people were killed including 100 of the 
extremists saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more 
the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary guards posing 
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives 
the next year 402 pilgrims mostly iranians were killed in 
riots in mecca that the saudis say were instigated by 
fundamentalists 
saudi interior minister prince nayef said wednesday that if the 
rulers of iran are still bent on offending the hajjis we reject and 
will resist this we will not allow anyone to undermine the safety 
of the hajjis or the homeland 
saudi arabia cut ties with iran in april 1988 tehran since has 
been campaigning to strip king fahd of his title as custodian of 
the two holy shrines and place mecca and medina under 
international supervision 
khamenei told iranians the hand of the enemy has again 
deprived you of your certain right to make pilgrimage to the house 
of god and the grave of the prophet 
he said the saudi limit on pilgrims has added another dark page 
to its black file our memory of history will not forget these 
hostilities 
khamenei urged pilgrims to gather in large numbers to express 
their opposition and hatred toward the cultural conspiracies of the 
arrogant against islam 
he said khomeinis death sentence against rushdie still 
stands and applies to any one else who insults islam 
rushdie has been in hiding in britain since feb 13 when 
khomeini accused him of blaspheming islam in the satanic verses 
and ordered his death 
khamenei also suggested pilgrims debate the palestinian uprising 
against the israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip and 
the civil wars in lebanon and afghanistan

net deposit withdrawals from savings and loan 
institutions slowed by more than 50 percent in may to 24 billion 
the federal home loan bank board said thursday 
two west coast thrifts that lost a total of 14 billion in 
deposits during the month accounted for more than half of the net 
withdrawals the sampl industrys chief regulator said 
after counting interest credited to depositors accounts total 
deposits in the nations 2934 sampls grew by 587 million during may 
to 9552 billion it was the first increase since last december 
james barth the bank boards chief economist attributed the 
slightly improved deposit balances in thrift institutions to a 
normal seasonal resumption of savings after april withdrawals to pay 
taxes 
barth also said the spread between interest rates offered by 
money market mutual funds and sampls also narrowed modestly in may 
the may decrease in net deposits the 13th in a row was the 
smallest since savers began pulling their money out of sampls more 
than a year ago as concern about the health of the industry 
heightened 
passage of legislation permitting troubled thrifts to be 
resolved should lessen depositor concerns and thereby enable the 
industry to better manage its deposits barth said 
withdrawals from accounts of 100000 or smaller the amount 
insured against losses by the federal government declined from 57 
billion in april to 300 million in may the board said 
however holders of deposits exceeding 100000 pulled a total of 
22 billion out of sampls in may compared with a 400000 increase 
in their deposits in april

new yorks highest court ruled thursday that 
a partner in a longterm homosexual relationship can take over the 
couples rentcontrolled apartment when the lover who signed the 
lease dies 
in a 42 ruling the court of appeals ordered a lower court to 
reconsider its decision permitting the eviction of a new york city 
man from a rentcontrolled apartment he shared for a decade with his 
lover who died 
in doing so the court expanded the definition of a family as 
it applies to new yorks rentcontrol laws the word is crucial 
because state law says only family members may continue to live 
in rentcontrolled apartments saving hundreds of dollars a month in 
rent in many cases when the tenant whose name is on the lease dies 
the rentcontrol laws date from the housing crunch of world war 
ii they limit the rent increases landlords can charge in apartments 
with longterm tenants 
the court said the definition of family members should 
include adults who show longterm financial and emotional commitment 
to each other even if they dont fit the traditional meaning of a 
family 
the new york decision is the first time any top state court in 
the nation has recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of 
a family according to american civil liberties union lawyer william 
rubenstein 
todays decision is a groundbreaking victory for lesbians and 
gay men rubenstein said thursday it marks the most important 
single step forward in american law toward legal recognition of 
lesbian and gay relationships 
also this week a law was scheduled to take effect in san 
francisco permitting unmarried couples to register as domestic 
partners giving them certain rights such as the right to 
bereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies 
the law passed last month is strongly supported by gayrights 
groups but some clergymen waged a petition campaign seeking to 
repeal the measure and put it on the november ballot on thursday 
the day the law was scheduled to take effect the law was suspended 
pending certification of signatures to put the repeal measure on the 
november ballot verification of the signatures which were 
submitted wednesday was expected to take several days 
in the new york case judge vito titone wrote we conclude that 
the term family should not be rigidly restricted to those people 
who have formalized their relationship by obtaining for instance a 
marriage certificate 
the case involves miguel braschi 33 who wants to live in the 
desirable manhattan apartment he shared for 11 years with leslie 
blanchard the two men were considered a lifetime couple and spouses 
by their friends 
blanchard the owner of a manhattan beauty salon died in 
braschis arms in september 1986 leaving braschi almost 5 million 
soon afterward the landlord stahl associates attempted to 
evict braschi on grounds that he had no right to continue living in 
the belowprice apartment because he wasnt related to blanchard by 
blood marriage or adoption 
braschis lawyers said the rent on the apartment is about 700 
several hundred dollars per month less than it would cost on the 
open market but they argued that he and blanchard were a family and 
so he had rights under the rentcontrol law 
a trial court said braschi should be allowed to keep the 
apartment at the rentcontrol price but the appellate division of 
state supreme court a firstlevel appeals court reversed that and 
said braschi had to leave 
in thursdays ruling the court of appeals said the appellate 
division had failed to consider all the factors that should be 
considered when determining whether a person is a family member 
it ordered the appellate judges to consider braschis case again 
considering such factors as the fidelity and longevity of the 
relationship the level of emotional and financial commitment and 
the way the participants presented themselves to society titone 
said 
david picon an attorney for stahl associates said he would have 
no comment on the decision 
rubenstein and other lawyers for activist groups said the ruling 
would also apply to unmarried heterosexual partners and poor 
families who cant afford legal fees to adopt children or obtain a 
divorce 
this court is stating that gay couples lesbian couples as 
well as other couples that dont fit the ozzie and harriet mold 
should be recognized as the families they are in reality said 
evan wolfson a lawyer at the lambda legal defense fund a national 
gay rights group 
in a dissenting opinion judge richard simons said the court was 
too broadly interpreting the state legislatures intent in drafing 
new yorks rent control law the court majoritys decision he said 
produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse

the government said troops supported by 
aircraft and heavy artillery advanced toward a major moslem 
guerrilla base near the pakistani border thursday on the second day 
of an offensive 
the sovietsponsored government said the soldiers killed at least 
287 guerrillas wounded 238 and captured tanks armored personnel 
carriers and ammunition it gave army casualties as only four dead 
each side in the 11yearold war customarily exaggerates the 
others losses and minimizes its own 
this is our biggest offensive since the soviet troop 
withdrawal completed feb 15 said presidential spokesman sarwar 
yourish our aim is to push the rebels toward the pakistani 
border 
he said the army drove the insurgents back on the south and 
southeast of jalalabad capital of nangarhar province which has 
been under guerrilla siege since march 7 
jalalabad is 75 miles east of kabul and 45 miles from pakistan 
where most of the guerrillas are based 
afghan air force jets bombed rebel positions in and around 
jalalabad for a second day and guerrilla rocket attacks on the city 
continued yourish said 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said soldiers 
advanced toward a guerrilla base at torkham six miles from the 
pakistani border after overrunning insurgent positions around 
jalalabad 
the torkham base at the foot of the khyber pass a major route 
for supplies from pakistan is a staging area for attacks on 
jalalabad 
in pakistan the guerrillarun afghan information and 
documentation center acknowledged the loss of some positions near 
jalalabad 
an afghan pilot landed his sovietmade ground attack fighter in 
peshawar pakistan and sought asylum thursday pakistani officials 
said 
a pakistan air force official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the pilot of the sukhoi22 jet refused to bombard 
mujahedeen positions and fled to pakistan afghan guerrillas call 
themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
on monday two afghan helicopters landed in pakistan and their 
crews sought political asylum 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1968 and soviet forces intervened in december 1979 an estimated 
115000 red army soldiers were in afghanistan when the unmediated 
withdrawal began on may 15 1988

a horse trainer a postal clerk a cab driver a sewage plant 
operator and a retired chemical engineer are among those helping 
researchers excavate fossils on a farm about 30 miles west of here 
the program bones from bats to beardogs may not take them 
far from home but it sends them 20 million years back in time so 
far they have found threetoed horses rhinoceroses and other 
creatures from the miocene era 
its thrilling to know that youre digging in soil that is 
millions of years old and youre finding part of an animal that 
lived at that time gloria driggers a secondgrade teacher in 
orange springs said thursday

we have some bright people but that doesnt mean we always 
have the best common sense were about three degrees off plumb 
said hartman 
intertel members range in age 11 to 80 and must score 99 percent

prison authorities thursday hanged a 
pakistani convicted of smuggling 5 pounds of heroin into egypt 
implementing for the first time a longstanding threat to execute 
drug dealers 
the interior ministry made certain the message got out 
journalists for egyptian and foreign media were invited to talk with 
anwar hussein kasser hussein 27 before his walk to the gallows 
very unusual in a country where executions generally are done in 
private 
the government is cracking down hard on narcotics smuggling a 
practice that experts say has increased greatly in recent years 
twentyfive convicted smugglers including five women remain on 
death row nine have exhausted their appeals 
a group of prison and prosecution officials a forensic doctor 
and a moslem clergyman witnessed the 815 am execution 
i am not a drug dealer im a student hussein protested at 
the end 
i was trapped he told reporters somebody gave it the 
heroin to me when i came into the country i found out about the 
drugs 
visibly shaken and wearing the red uniform of prisoners on death 
row hussein spoke in a small room at cairos central jail which is 
equipped with an execution chamber 
a slight bearded man from peshawar hussein said he had five 
brothers and four sisters nobody from his family was present and 
hussein said only one brother knew about the death sentence 
there is no justice in egyptian law if you have money you can 
do anything in this country he said bitterly i could not 
afford a good lawyer 
a prison guard embraced hussein before he entered the gallows 
room and the moslem clergyman asked him to repeat tenets of islam 
this execution is meant to show that egypt is not a market for 
drugs said the ministry of informations mohammed agami who 
accompanied reporters to the prison 
if we hand out lesser sentences it will encourage the drug 
mafia to deal in egypt 
a pakistani diplomat said prison authorities telephoned the 
embassy on tuesday to advise of the execution 
i think the notice was too short and the information was not 
complete said the diplomat speaking anonymously under embassy 
rules 
in pakistan a person to be hanged is allowed to see his family 
hours beforehand to give his last will at this short notice 
it was almost impossible for husseins family to come 
husseins hanging came a month after parliament enacted a new 
drug law providing stiffer punishment for offenders and widening the 
scope of the death penalty president hosni mubarak has approved the 
law which awaits official publication before it is implemented 
the new law calls for a mandatory death penalty for smugglers and 
people who illegally grow or prepare narcotics encourage youth to 
use drugs or provide a place for the use of drugs the government 
first recommended mandatory death for smugglers four years ago 
under the current 1960 law the death penalty is left to the 
discretion of judges and was applicable only to smugglers and 
traffickers in most cases judges convicting under the law opt for 
long prison terms of up to life which in egypt is 25 years 
there has been a sharp rise in the seizure of hard drugs in egypt 
since the early 1980s foreign experts value the narcotics trade in 
egypt at several billion dollars annually 
since 1985 the government has invoked an emergency law passed 
after the 1981 assassination of president anwar sadat to arrest drug 
dealers on suspicion and hold them in custody without trial the 
emergency law gives the government wide powers of arrest including 
socalled preventive detention of people considered security risks 
hussein was caught on march 16 1987 at cairo international 
airport where according to the indictment he was trying to bring 
in 5 pounds of heroin valued at about 1 million

the army announced thursday that its fleet of 
ah64 attack helicopters could begin flying again after an 
investigation showed a fatal accident last week was caused by a 
piece of improperly stored sheet metal striking the tail rotor 
the army has 486 apaches its newest and most sophisticated 
helicopter gunship 
the fleet was grounded monday for the investigation into the june 
29 crash in northern florida of a national guard apache the 
copilot was killed and the pilot seriously injured when the tail 
rotor came off the helicopter 
in a statement at the pentagon the army said the investigation 
into the florida crash revealed that the tail rotor damage was 
caused by a foreign object striking a rotor blade 
physical and chemical evidence found that a piece of sheet metal 
used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and that the 
piece of metal became dislodged and flew into the ah64s tail 
rotor system the statement said 
army spokesman lt col john chapla said the rectangular piece of 
metal is about six to eight inches long and is supposed to be 
securely stored during flight 
it blew free and struck the rotor chapla said 
the investigation was conducted at the army safety center in fort 
rucker ala 
the apache fleet was last grounded in august 1987 when 
investigators studied the failure of one component of the tail 
rotor it was also grounded twice in 1986 for relatively minor 
problems 
the choppers built by mcdonnel douglas corp cost roughly 13 
million each 
the armys fleet was dealt a blow last month after dozens were 
put out of service because of damage they suffered during a freak 
wind storm at fort hood texas 
the gunship is designed to replace the cobra helicopter as the 
armys primary attack helicopter the twinengined machine which is 
designed to destroy enemy tanks carries hellfire and hydra 7 
missiles and a 30mm cannon

the new conservativecommunist government 
will not negotiate an agreement on us military bases but will 
leave it up to the government formed after elections in october the 
premier said thursday 
premier tzannis tzannetakis told parliament that meantime 
relations with the united states will be kept at the level 
indicated by the traditional friendship of the two countries 
the previous agreement on the four us bases expired in 
december greece gave the united states 17 months to negotiate a new 
one or close the bases 
tzannetakis did not say if his government would decide whether to 
extradite a palestinian mohammed rashid who is wanted by the 
united states for his alleged involvement in a bomb attack on a pan 
am jetliner in 1982 
the conservative premier outlining his program to parliament 
said his top goal was a promised cleanup of greeces scandalridden 
politics 
parliament is expected to give tzannetakis a vote of confidence 
on saturday 
the people are relieved to see that the time of cleansing has 
come tzannetakis said in promising to investigate all scandals 
especially if there were indications that former socialist officials 
were involved 
the panhellenic socialist movement with 125 seats in the 
300seat unicameral parliament failed to win a third term in office 
in the june 18 general elections charges that officials of former 
premier andreas papandreous government were involved in banking 
financial and arms scandals contributed to their defeat 
the conservative new democracy party with 145 seats and the 
communistled coalition of the left and progress with 28 forged an 
unprecedented alliance when no party won an absolute majority in the 
elections 
party leaders say the coalition will govern only for three months 
with the purpose of investigating allegations of political 
wrongdoing and that new elections will be held in october

a soviet officer said thursday radar operators 
handling many military flights failed to notice the pilotless mig23 
fighter zooming halfway across europe before it crashed in belgium 
to control every plane when there are so many is not economical 
or practical said air force lt col anatoly s balikin speaking 
at a news conference 
the pilot of the mig col nikolai skurigin ejected in poland 
after reporting that the aircraft was smoking and heading into the 
baltic sea but the plane sped on and killed an 18yearold man when 
it struck a house in wevelgem belgium 
skurigin appeared before reporters thursday and apologized 
profusely to the victims family 
soviet helicopters were still searching the baltic sea when they 
were surprised by western reports that the jet had crashed 560 miles 
away in belgium said gen yevgeny shaposhnikov deputy 
commanderinchief of the soviet air force 
the plane flew over poland east germany west germany the 
netherlands and belgium before running out of fuel and crashing into 
the house near belgiums border with france 
the west european countries protested the incident to the soviet 
union for failing to inform them about the wayward plane 
the soviet government has offered to pay compensation to the 
victims family in an apparently unprecedented gesture by the 
kremlin but has not yet spelled out details of the payment 
at least one eastbloc radar facility picked up an unidentified 
plane crossing the border into the west balikin said but 
authorities believed the report erroneous because they counted their 
planes and found none missing 
this all took place under difficult conditions balikin said 
over the city of kolobrzeg there were training flights of east 
german soviet and polish planes 
there were also training flights over east germany he said 
the flight paths were parallel or very close to the flight 
paths of this flight or in the opposite direction he added 
a us official who declined to be further identified said the 
soviet explanation calls into question their command and control 
of their own aircraft its like saying they had an accident because 
there was a lot of traffic 
skurigin said he had written a personal letter of apology to the 
victims family but nothing can compensate for the death 
i must tell you frankly if i knew or could have foreseen such 
tragic consequences of this pilotless flight i would have stayed in 
the plane to the end said skurigin a stocky blond officer his 
hand was bandaged and he said received only a minor finger injury 
despite ejecting just 330 feet from the ground shortly after takeoff 
shaposhnikov made a similar statement when asked whether the 
soviet offer of compensation would cover the death as well as 
material damages 
the offer of damages and the news conference with six apologetic 
senior soviet officers departed from previous soviet responses to 
military incidents 
soviet officials refused to consider compensation when they shot 
down a south korean airliner in 1983 or when a sentry killed a us 
major in east germany in 1985 said richard pipes a soviet expert 
at harvard university soviet authorities did apologize for the 
death of the officer maj arthur d nicholson jr but not until 
three years later 
responding to a reporters questions shaposhnikov said tuesdays 
incident was not a test of combat readiness of north atlantic 
treaty organization air defenses 
two us air force jets intercepted the mig over west germany but 
did not shoot it down for fear it would fall on a populated area 
officials at nato said nothing to soviet authorities about the 
jet until after it crashed shaposhnikov said calling for a system 
for nato and warsaw pact forces to warn each other of such accidents 
last month the us and soviet governments signed a pact on 
avoiding dangerous military incidents but it apparently was not 
applied tuesday 
the pilot said he took off normally tuesday on his second flight 
of the day then felt a sharp jerk at the left air intake and his 
airspeed dropped abruptly 
i radioed the tower that 132s engine was out he said and 
turned its nose toward the sea my commander told me to eject and 
i bailed out 
skurigin said he did not aim the jet straight down because it 
would have crashed into a town near the kolobrzeg airfield 
as he parachuted he saw the jet heading down with black smoke 
pouring from the engine i did not see any flames or any 
indication it had crashed he said 
the mig flew onward using an automatic lockon navigation system 
that kept it on the same course against the horizon said air force 
maj gen abrek ayupov western sources said it reached an altitude 
of more than 36000 feet over western europe 
the wreckage was taken to a brussels military depot thursday to 
await soviet investigators belgium has said the soviets can take 
the wreckage home nato officials have said the mig23 first shown 
in public 22 years ago is wellknown in western intelligence 
circles 
on wednesday a soviet fighter jet crashed in poland after a 
collision with a polish civilian glider whose pilot was killed 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said it appeared neither 
pilot was flying at his assigned altitude in the accident near 
lublin

defense minister yitzhak rabin said 
thursday the labor party will consider quitting the government and 
the plo said premier yitzhak shamir closed the door on peace by 
hardening israels peace plan 
us ambassador william brown met the prime minister head of the 
rightwing likud bloc on thursday and a shamir spokesman said 
later that washington sees israels peace initiative as firm and 
abiding 
but the state department in washington criticized the tough new 
terms 
spokesman richard boucher declared partisan declarations 
particularly if they appear to be more restrictive or impose 
conditions do not advance the process boucher added however 
that the israeli plan still provides the most realistic way to 
advance the peace process 
three parties on the left shinui the citizens rights movement 
and the communists filed noconfidence motions against the 
government in parliament claiming likuds wednesday decision mired 
chances of starting peace talks 
in a speech wednesday shamir ruled out several peace options 
considered to be attractive to the palestinians 
he said elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip could 
be held only after the 19monthold palestinian uprising there was 
crushed palestinian arabs living in east jerusalem would not be 
allowed to vote and jewish settlements would continue to be built 
in the territories 
in washington the arab league declared israels election plan 
dead and urged the united states to abandon support for the 
initiative 
the palestine liberation organization which had criticized the 
elections plan for failing to guarantee palestinians a future 
independent state said shamirs speech closed the door to peace 
plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman also said in tunis tunisia 
that peace efforts by president bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii the only ones working for peace now face total 
failure 
abdulrahman said the uprising would be escalated because this 
is the only answer to intransigence 
israels peace plan introduced this year by rabin and later 
adopted by shamir calls for palestinians in the occupied lands to 
elect representatives to talks with israel on an autonomy plan for 
the west bank and gaza strip later negotiations would decide the 
final status of the territories 
ministers of the centerleft labor party convened a special 
meeting but it was postponed after officials learned that a 
palestinian forced an israeli bus off the road and into a ravine 
thursday killing 14 people 
shimon peres the party leader and finance minister in the 
coalition cabinet said the disaster tears the heart apart the 
entire nation is unified in sorrow 
energy minister moshe shahal who had urged labor to leave the 
government because of likuds action said such political moves were 
made pale by the events 
todays disaster only stresses my belief that at these times we 
need the unity government he said on israel tv 
peres spokesman avi gil said labors party bureau would meet 
monday to decide what course of action to take 
in jerusalem shamir reiterated at his meeting with ambassador 
brown that israels political initiative continues to exist in its 
framework such as accepted by the israeli government and that there 
were no changes made in it spokesman avi pazner told the 
associated press 
pazner said brown expressed washingtons stand that as long as 
the government is not introducing changes into the peace initiative 
washington sees it as firm and abiding 
shamir sought to soften likuds decision by announcing plans to 
do the utmost to find palestinian partners for middle east peace 
talks 
he told the daily maariv i hope labor will remain in the 
government they have no reason to change their position but it is 
all up to them 
israeli newspaper editorials made light of labors threats to 
bolt analysts reasoned that labor was not assured victory if 
elections were held

a lawsuit accusing rob lowe of enticing a 
teenager into an erotic home video was cut in half when a judge 
ruled the girls mother cant claim emotional distress but can 
contend the actor seduced her daughter 
us district judge g ernest tidwell ruling wednesday on lowes 
motion to dismiss the lawsuit said lena arlene wilson can sue under 
georgias law forbidding the seduction of a daughter if she alleges 
that lowe and her daughter jan parsons had unlawful sexual 
intercourse 
we will have a witness to that ms wilsons attorney j hue 
henry said after the ruling was made public thursday 
henry said he will file an amended lawsuit to that effect friday 
and well get ready for trial 
the lawsuit stems from a videotape which lowe purportedly made in 
his hotel suite while visiting atlanta last summer for the 
democratic national convention that videotape widely circulated 
on atlantas party circuit and shown electronically censored on tv 
news shows a man who looks like lowe in a hotel room with the girl 
and another woman 
it shows him seeming to stagemanage a sexual encounter between 
the two but does not show him having sex with ms parsons henry 
says however that he has witnesses who will testify that lowe did 
have sex with the girl 
ms wilson sued under the daughterseduction law and also 
accused lowe of intentionally committing acts that caused emotional 
distress to the family 
this is a case of wanton willful intentional misconduct 
henry told the judge last week 
in his ruling tidwell dismissed the emotional distress claim 
saying the suit does not allege sufficient facts under georgia 
law to press the claim that lowe intentionally inflicted emotional 
distress on ms wilson 
tidwell however rejected lowes motion to dismiss the claim for 
damages on the basis of seduction the judge noted that under 
georgia law such a claim requires proof that unlawful sexual 
intercourse took place he gave ms wilson 10 days from wednesday to 
amend her lawsuit to that effect 
lowe attorney richard north told reporters the ruling was very 
favorable in that it narrowed the allegations against mr lowe 
by 50 percent 
ms wilson filed her lawsuit in may in state court in fulton 
county contending that lowe enticed her daughter then 16 into 
having sex with another woman while he videotaped them attorneys 
for lowe succeeded last month in transferring the case to federal 
court 
edgar neely iii an atlanta attorney representing lowe argued 
last week that the lawsuit should be dismissed because in georgia 
only a custodial parent has the right to take legal action on 
matters concerning a child miss parsons father john parsons has 
custody and has waived his right to act in the case neely said 
however tidwell noted in his ruling that according to ms 
wilsons lawsuit her daughter was living with her at the time of 
the alleged incident 
lowe 25 is the star of such films as st elmos fire and 
about last night 
a criminal investigation into possible charges against lowe is 
officially continuing although no charges have been brought

used mainly in control rods for military reactors aboard 
nuclearpowered vessels

air to east germany in february 1987 and an employee of his company

the conservative opposition charged thursday 
that the governing party was trying to steal the baja california 
legislature to neutralize a conservative victory in the governors 
race 
the national action party accused the institutional revolutionary 
party known as the pri for its spanish initials of setting up 
three laboratories where the alchemy of votechanging was 
taking place 
national actions ernesto ruffo won the july 2 gubernatorial 
election but the partys executive secretary francisco gonzalez 
garza said the pri would run the government 
ruffo would be governor but pri would control the political 
decisions he said 
abel vinicio tovar secretarygeneral of national action known 
as pan said at the same news conference that the pris commitment 
to democracy had been called into question 
the pri has been the governments party for 60 years but in 
recent years has increasingly maintained its hold by fraud 
president carlos salinas de gortari who has struck several dramatic 
blows against fraud and corruption since taking office dec 1 has 
promised clean elections 
the pri conceded that ruffo defeated margarita ortega in baja 
california he would become the first nonpri governor of any 
mexican state in 60 years if he takes office as scheduled nov 1 for 
a sixyear term 
the vote is counted by party representatives who were at the 
polling places on election day and the parties make claims based on 
their own counts 
the official count by the state electoral commission will not be 
released until sunday and the pan claims the pri and the government 
are using the time to cook the figures 
in the state legislature the pan says it is winning nine of 15 
seats as well as the mayoralties of ensenada and tijuana the pri is 
claiming tijuana and 12 legislative seats 
how could they lose the gubernatorial vote badly in tijuana 
then win all six of tijuanas legislative seats and the 
mayoralty asked francisco gonzalez garza pan executive 
secretary citing figures gathered by pan 
pri officials have admitted there were irregularities on july 2 
but maintain they were not large enough to affect the results they 
attribute the legislative results to ticket splitting although they 
have released no vote totals of their own 
a person who answered the telephone at a private house that pan 
alleges is one of the alleged laboratories in tijuana said the 
owner was not at home pan accuses pri supporters of taking ballot 
boxes from vote counting centers to the laboratories and 
stuffing them with pri ballots or taking out pan ballots 
its not true none of those things are happening said pri 
spokesman arturo galvan in a telephone interview from mexicali the 
state capital he accused pan supporters of harassing pri officials 
and picketing pri offices 
meanwhile in the state of michoacan west of mexico city the pri 
insisted it was winning a majority of 18 state legislative seats and 
said it would fight for every vote 
the leftist opposition democratic revolutionary party has said

soldiers surrounded the hideout of ousted 
prime minister sadek mahdi and captured him thursday when he tried 
to escape through a balcony the army announced 
an army bulletin broadcast on television said mahdi 53 had been 
hiding in the home of mohamed hassan khalifa sherif who was not 
identified further 
the house was surrounded and while a team was searching it 
sadek mahdi jumped out of a small balcony overlooking the street but 
was immediately arrested carrying a letter to the revolutionary 
council the bulletin said 
it did not disclose the contents of the letter or say what floor 
the balcony was on 
mahdi elected in may 1986 went into hiding after a military 
coup last friday soon after the coup the junta arrested at 45 
senior politicians and members of the ousted regime 
rumors circulated that mahdi was outside the capital protected 
by his followers or secretly in detention junta leader osman 
hassan ahmed bashir insisted however that he had not left khartoum 
and soon would be arrested 
hours before the arrest was announced col suleiman mohamed a 
member of the junta denied reports that mahdi had sent word 
requesting a guarantee of personal safety before turning himself in 
earlier thursday col hassan dahawy told the associated press 
the former premier had been caught in khartoum 
we have arrested mahdi he said we are geting the radio 
and televison to interview him live in a short time to show the 
people 
three hours later however only the bulletin describing the 
arrest was broadcast 
on thursday night junta leader bashir announced a decree 
establishing committees to investigate financial and 
administrative irregularities under the former regime 
in an interview conducted before mahdis arrest egypts 
staterun newspaper alakhbar quoted bashir as indicating the ousted 
premier would be treated as harshly as anyone else if convicted of 
corruption 
his corrupt practices have ruined all services of the 
country the junta leader was quoted as saying all those 
responsible for this destruction will be violently hit 
the interview was published in fridays editions of the newspaper 
bashir also said specialized courts of three military 
officers each would try people charged with violating laws 
regulating market prices customs and public order with death as 
the maximum penalty 
bashir 43 has said his priority for reform is fighting 
corruption as a first step to improving the economy and national 
security 
mahdis government was buffeted by street demonstrations against 
high prices and severe shortages of basic goods 
the new military leader accuses ousted officials of destroying 
the economy and hesitating too long to organize peace talks to end a 
ruinous war in the south that was costing the government 1 million 
a day while it ran up a foreign debt of 13 billion 
rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy and development 
in the south where a sudans minority of black christians and 
animists lives the government and military are by the dominant arab 
moslems 
the war has induced famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of 
live in the south of sudan africas largest country 
on monday bashir was quoted as inviting rebel leader john 
garang a former army colonel to khartoum for talks to end the 
rebellion the new leadership earlier canceled peace talks arranged 
by mahdis government for monday in addis ababa ethiopia 
last year army threatened to move against mahdi unless he 
speeded efforts to end the war the united states and other 
countries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason 
mahdi finally suspended harsh islamic laws which met a rebel 
demand negotiations and talks started in may 
part of mahdis problem was that he is a greatgrandson of the 
mahdi whose fervent moslem followers defeated a british colonial 
force and brought brief independence to sudan in the late 1800s the 
mantle of religious leadership caused him to avoid decisions that 
may have been interpreted as antimoslem

former gov marvin mandel was reinstated as 
a lawyer thursday in a 90second ceremony that he called the last 
step in a long journey back from his 1977 conviction on political 
corruption charges 
mandel 69 took the oath from alexander cummings clerk of the 
court of appeals as his wife and his lawyers looked on 
we got it done the former democratic governor said as he 
signed his name in a book containing signatures of other lawyers 
admitted to the bar in maryland 
asked by reporters after the ceremony to describe his feelings 
mandel replied its really an overwhelming feeling its been a 
long time coming its the culmination of many years of struggle 
mandel was disbarred after he failed to overturn his conviction 
on mail fraud and racketeering charges he served nearly 19 months 
of a fouryear prison sentence before president reagan ordered his 
release in december 1981 from a federal prison camp at eglin air 
force base in florida 
he became eligible to apply for reinstatment to the bar when the 
us supreme court overturned his conviction last month 
new lawyers normally take the oath at a session of the court of 
appeals which is on summer recess and will not return until 
september mandel got permission from chief judge robert murphy to 
have cummings administer the oath instead of the chief judge 
asked why he moved so quickly to regain the right to practice 
law mandel replied because ive been waiting eight years 
september is two months away why wait 
he was unsure whether he will practice law on his own or join a 
law firm 
those are the kinds of questions im going to take a little 
time to answer he said 
mandel who was named governor in 1969 and was elected to two 
terms said he will remain active in politics but has no intention 
at this point of running for political office because there are none 
available right now 
having his conviction overturned and regaining the right to 
practice law were the two most important steps in returning to a 
normal life mandel said 
i think this is the culmination of all of it he said i 
think its the last step on a long journey

former ptl executive david taggart bought 
100000 worth of jewelry and spent 400000 on other things the 
same year he told the irs his gross adjusted income was 107000 a 
tax attorney testified thursday 
did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase items 
worth 500000 when his income was 100000 justice department 
prosecutor david brown asked former ptl tax attorney robert gunst 
it looks like a mistake was made said gunst who prepared 
taggarts 1984 tax return 
david taggart and his brother james were indicted in december 
on charges of failing to pay 487000 in income taxes prosecutors 
say they diverted 11 million of ministry funds to their personal 
use by taking cash advances on ptl credit cards and using blank 
ministry checks to pay the credit card bills 
other purchases questioned thursday included a onebedroom 
apartment on the 57th floor of new yorks trump tower which gunst 
said the two brothers bought in 1986 for 640000 
they had previously leased an apartment in the same building 
gunst said and james taggart deducted his 2000amonth share of 
the rent because he claimed he used the apartment for business and 
while taking classes 
gunst said taggart was entitled to the deduction if he was 
staying at the apartment while furthering his education but he said 
he did not know if taggart actually attended classes in new york 
the tax attorney also said ptl founder jim bakker approved using 
ministry funds to pay 52000 in back taxes and penalties levied 
against david taggart after an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax 
returns 
gunst said he found 25 to 30 boxes of credit card receipts 
during an irs audit of the ministry and was worried that spending 
by the taggart brothers could threaten ptls taxexempt status 
i told him david taggart it was extremely important for him 
to keep good records of his travel expenses and credit card 
purchases gunst said 
he also said he never asked taggart about using ptl money for 
personal expenses 
both taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists 
within a few years david taggart 32 became bakkers top aide and 
james 35 was the ministrys interior designer both were fired 
after bakker resigned in 1987 in the midst of a sexandmoney 
scandal 
james taggarts interior design business was paid hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to decorate the hotels and other projects that 
sprang up at heritage usa ptls christian retreat in fort mill sc 
patricia harris who became bakkers executive secretary in 1984 
testified that david taggart asked her for several cash advances 
from ptls numerous checking accounts 
prosecutor joseph bender asked her if taggart her immediate 
supervisor was required to give her receipts 
no he said it was used for the bakkers she said he would 
just tell me he was keeping his own receipts he said he kept them 
at home in shoe boxes 
why didnt you demand that david taggart turn over the 
receipts bender asked 
because i considered him the same as mr bakker or mr 
dortch she said referring to richard dortch a former top bakker 
aide they were my supervisors i asked i didnt demand 
the trial of the two brothers is expected to take up to a month 
if convicted they each could face 25 years in prison and fines of 
more than 1 million

fifty percent of americans surveyed in a new 
poll say they oppose the supreme court decision making it easier for 
the states to regulate abortion the newspaper usa today said 
thursday 
forty percent of the 662 adults polled by gordon s black corp 
said they support the courts ruling 
the court ruled on monday that missouri could require certain 
medical tests of fetal viability and keep public hospitals from 
performing abortions the justices said they would hear three cases 
next year that raise the possibility of even further narrowing or 
overturning of the 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized 
abortion in the united states 
the usa today poll being published in friday editions did not ask 
respondents their positions on roe vs wade the announcement of 
results thursday did not indicate why those opposing and supporting 
mondays decision took the positions they did and spokeswoman 
sheila gibbons said she did not know if that was tabulated in the 
detailed results 
the poll found that 38 percent reported they would be likely to 
base a voting decision on a candidates stand on abortion this was 
twice the percentage 19 percent that reported basing a past voting 
decision on abortion 
asked what regulations they might support 75 percent of the 
respondents said parents of those under 18 should be notified if 
their daughter seeks an abortion 63 percent said husbands or 
partners should be notified when adults seek abortions and 44 
percent said abortions should not be performed in public health 
facilities 
the associated pressmedia general poll of 1108 people in april 
reported that 53 percent favored roe vs wade and 65 percent said a 
woman should be able to get an abortion if her doctor agrees to it 
these responses cannot necessarily be compared with the usa today 
results because the questions were different 
in a poll of 662 people the margin of error is about four 
percentage points

housing secretary jack kemp on thursday halted 
an elderlyhousing program that has lost more than 119 million on 
projects many of which government analysts had warned were not 
necessary or were too large 
the announcement marked the third time in recent weeks that kemp 
has suspended or canceled department of housing and urban 
development programs because of suspected mismanagement and abuse 
during president reagans eight years in office 
kemp said mortgage defaults under the fiveyearold elderly 
housing program totaled 250 million so far and he said it had too 
often served welltodo elderly instead of the low to 
moderateincome population it was created to serve the 119 million 
represents huds direct loss to date in payments to private lenders 
who provided financing for the projects in return for government 
backing of the loans 
as an example of the programs poor targeting kemp cited a palm 
harbor fla development he said charged 2100 a month rent for 
twobedroom apartments the audit of midwestern projects approved 
under the program found many were less than half occupied 
overall 30 percent of all the elderly housing projects in which 
hud insured the mortgages are in default as are 12 percent of 
similar projects in which hud is a coinsurer of the financing and 
liable for 80 percent of the cost of any default hud is the insurer 
or coinsurer of 150 such projects said an agency spokesman who 
could not immediately give a breakdown between the number for which 
hud is the full insurer and coinsurer 
kemp has been trying to get a handle on the agencys troubles at 
a time when congress also is investigating allegations of fraud 
mismanagement and influencepeddling at hud during the reagan 
administration 
kemp made his announcement as congressional investigators said 
they would summon former hud secretary samuel pierce to testify 
about allegations he personally ordered the agency to finance an 
unrelated project involving a longtime friend 
in earlier testimony pierce denied any direct role in such 
decisions but published reports have quoted a former hud official 
as saying pierce directed her to approve the project 
kemp in announcing he was halting new and pending applications 
for the retirement service center program said he planned to revive 
the program after its guidelines were rewritten to guarantee 
improved project selection and guaranteed targeting to lowincome 
elderly 
this is a program that should serve lowincome people but 
instead is serving upper and middleincome persons and doing it 
very poorly at that he said i plan a complete redesign of the 
retirement service center program and will require that it be 
targeted to low and moderateincome elderly 
the program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70 
who can live on their own and afford market rents the centers do 
not provide medical care but do offer such services as central 
dining and recreation 
kemps decision came six months after hud auditors completed a 
harsh report of the programs implementation in the midwest where 
investigators found that 25 percent of the completed projects were 
in default and said that hud officials time and time again ignored 
agency economists and sided with developers in deciding how many 
units should be included in the developments 
we believe the projects failed because the field offices did 
not assure adequate markets existed for the projects or did not 
assure the project sponsors had adequate prior experience said 
the internal audit released by hud under the freedom of information 
act 
the auditors said that in one case the cincinnati hud office 
approved a 254 unit development as requested by the developer 
despite an agency economists findings that the market would support 
just 125 units in may 1988 nearly three years after new england 
village opened only 67 of the 254 units were occupied and the 
mortgage was in default 
the auditors also criticized the minneapolisst paul hud office 
for approving a 208unit development overlooking a gravel pit that 
an agency economist said should be rejected only 76 of the units 
were rented as of may 1988 and the mortgage has been assigned to 
hud the project was not identified by name in the audit and 
regional hud officials did not immediately return telephone calls 
the report by thomas j bannon the regions inspector general 
for audit listed four projects in cincinnati with mortgages 
totaling 352 million and two others in the minneapolisst paul 
area totaling 179 million that were in default or considered 
financially troubled 
in less than six months on the job kemp also has suspended or 
canceled two other programs huds rental rehabilitation program and 
a loan insurance program for land development that financed such 
luxury projects as golf course condominiums 
in many of those projects hud and congressional investigators 
have determined that politically connected consultants helped win 
huds backing 
in addition to pierce among those to be recalled by the house 
subcommittee investigating hud are thomas t demery the agencys 
former assistant secretary for housing and lance wilson pierces 
former top aide 
also republican political consultant paul manafort will be asked 
to testify again because of questions about the accuracy of his 
prior testimony about the role of his firm in hudsponsored 
rehabilitation projects panel aides said 
two other former ranking hud officials janet hale and shirley 
mcvay wiseman will be asked to testify for a first time the aides 
said

thousands of union coal miners whose 
vacations are almost over must decide by monday whether to continue 
wildcat sympathy strikes or return to work for the first time in a 
month officials said thursday

processing plants 
if the 37000 united mine workers members end their wildcat 
strikes coal companies believe they can guarantee adequate 
stockpiles at the nations utility and industrial plants

your jobs are available today and i invite you back before the 
situation escalates he added 
the wildcat strikers are under orders by us district judge 
dennis knapp to refrain from encouraging strikes but the union 
workers have flouted the edict since it was issued last week the 
judge is imposing fines on the miners for each scheduled work day 
they stay out 
in virginia where a federal judge has fined the union 960000 
for impeding the flow of traffic around coal processing plants 
federal marshals and state police arrested 16 drivers in a 
slowmoving convoy 
striking miners in ohio planned to discuss returning to work when 
the national vacation period ends at midnight sunday some feared 
their employers would hire replacement workers and bust the union 
which signed a nostrike contract with the bituminous coal operators 
association in february 1988 
some of them think if this goes down the drain miners might be 
in bad shape said charlie greer president of a umw local 
representing zanesville ohioarea miners 
sentiments seemed similar in virginia said steve anderson a 
spokesman for westmoreland coal 
some people seem to think there are going to be some votes 
taken in the next couple of days anderson said the sense that 
you get is that there is a high level of interest in people going 
back it doesnt mean that they wont go back out later but thats 
just based on what our guys are picking up 
union officials in washington could not be reached thursday

president bush announced thursday the 
cancellation of the debt of subsaharan african countries to the 
united states 
beginning oct 1 the us government will forgive official 
development loans in the subsaharan countries the president told 
a news conference 
in 1987 the most recent year in which figures were immediately 
available the state department put the total of us loans to 
subsaharan africa at 43 billion including 743 million in 
development loans 15 billion from the us governments 
exportimport bank and 12 billion in us government loans to buy 
surplus american farm products 
bush did not say which of these categories would be included 
africa south of the sahara desert is usually taken to mean all of 
africa except south africa and the north african countries on the 
mediterranean egypt libya tunisia algeria and morocco 
bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision taken 
last year at an economic summit in toronto to offer different 
options to creditor governments until now the united states has 
preferred only to stretch out repayment terms 
bush did not mention latin american debt which is much greater 
than african debt but is owed in large part to commercial banks in 
north america and europe rather than to governments major examples 
are mexico which owes more than 100 billion and argentina 60 
billion 
earlier in the day treasury secretary nicholas f brady spoke to 
reporters at length about the banks current negotiations with 
mexico 
with respect to mexico they will sell those loans at less than 
100 cents on the dollar and this is the first time that has been 
recognized brady said the stumbling blocks now theyre arguing 
about are whether those loans which were borrowed at 100 should 
be 90 80 70 60 somewhere in there 
other governments notably in west germany france the 
netherlands and the nordic countries have converted many loans into 
grants when major us aid programs began with the marshall plan 
for western europe after world war ii the bulk of the money was in 
grants over the years loans became the preferred form of us aid 
as third world debt mounted and the burden of interest payments 
on debtor countries increased the pendulum has swung back to 
grants recipients of the biggest chunks of us aid israel and 
egypt now get grants and not loans 
in 1987 subsaharan africa owed 1378 billion in medium and 
longterm debt it was estimated that payments due from these 
countries had risen from 56 billion in 1979 to 21 billion a year 
for the period 1986 to 1989 
total third world debt is put at about 13 trillion

the environmental protection agency on thursday 
ordered a ban on most remaining uses of cancercausing asbestos 
forbidding its use in hundreds of products from automobile brake 
parts to water pipes 
the prohibition will be phased in over the next seven years and 
apply only to new products asbestoscontaining products already in 
use and not affected by previous restrictions are not included 
because in some cases replacement might be more hazardous than a 
gradual phaseout officials said 
the action however will end the use of asbestos by 1996 in all 
but a handful of commercial products guided missile liners 
acetylene cylinders and some sealing tapes for example for which 
no adequate substitute has been found and where concerns about 
health risks are minimal the agency said 
in the final phase of the ban beginning in 1996 an estimated 94 
percent of uses of asbestos will be prohibited said the agency 
were eliminating a known cancercausing substance from the 
marketplace declared epa administrator william reilly at a news 
conference he said that despite the known cancer threat from 
asbestos the mineral continues to be widely used 
the epa action does not affect continuing efforts to rid 
buildings including schools of loosely formed asbestos insulation 
and sprayon asbestos both of which have been banned from 
production since 1978 the epa reiterated that removal of such 
asbestos should be carefully controlled to prevent even more serious 
exposure from airborne particles 
under the new regulation the use of asbestos in some products 
including roofing material pipe wrap and sheet products will be 
banned next year its use by automakers in brake pads and linings 
will be prohibited beginning in 1993 and its use in auto 
replacement parts cement water distribution pipes roof shingles 
and a variety of other uses will be ended in 1996 
reilly said the timetable reflected the availability of 
substitute products some of which will be more expensive 
the epa estimated that the cost to consumers of the shift from 
asbestos products to substitutes will be about 460 million over the 
next 13 years during the same time the shift is expected to result 
in a saving of at least 200 cancer deaths the agency estimated 
asbestos over the years has had widespread industrial uses with 
an estimated 30 million tons of the mineral used in this country 
since the turn of the century most of it since world war ii it has 
seemed ideal for insulation and frictionproduct uses because of its 
strength and resistance to heat 
but microscopic asbestos fibers can remain in the body for 
decades and have been blamed for a variety of illnesses including 
lung cancer mesothelioma an incurable cancer of the chest and 
abdominal membranes and asbestosis a chronic disease of the lungs 
that makes breathing progressively more difficult 
reilly said the epa which first listed asbestos as a hazardous 
air pollutant in 1972 and urged its ban in 1979 has taken too long 
to remove asbestos products from the marketplace 
the first question i had was why has this thing been around so 
long said reilly who was appointed this year 
critics have accused the reagan administration of blocking 
earlier epa acton in the mid1980s a congressional investigation 
concluded that the office of management and budget held up proposal 
of a regulation for more than a year that regulation was finally 
proposed in 1986 but no final action was taken until thursday 
in recent years asbestos use has declined sharply because of 
concern about its health effects there were 85000 metric tons of 
asbestos used for a variety of products in 1987 compared to 240000 
metric tons three years earlier 
two of the most widespread and continuing uses of asbestos is in 
the manufacturer of brake pads and linings for automobiles and 
trucks although automakers have been phasing out the use of 
asbestos most new cars continue to have some asbestos brake 
products 
asbestos also is part of the nations water system there are 
more than 400000 miles of concreteasbestos pipe carrying drinking 
water to thousands of communities the epa said that while there is 
concern about health risks in the production and replacement of such 
pipes there is no risk of contamination of drinking water 
reilly urged against consumers attempting to dig up 
asbestoscement water pipes or to replace asbestos brake parts 
disturbing asbestos brakes shingles or siding already in 
place where there is no health or safety reason to do so can cause a 
much greater health hazard than leaving them in place said reilly 
the expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalists 
this is a new approach pollution prevention said 
jacqueline warren an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council 
ellen silbergeld a toxicologist with the environmental defense 
fund called the action long past due and a landmark 
development in protecting environmental quality and public health 
however the asbestos information association said that products 
now being marketed with asbestos are manufactured installed and 
used safely 
current asbestos products bind the asbestos fibers in lockedin 
or encapsulated matrices that significantly diminish fiber 
release the group said

the sandinista government has ordered 
the expulsion of a us citizen from the human rights group freedom 
house sent here to observe elections officials and the man being 
expelled said thursday 
nicaragua has said it would accept such observers to confirm that 
the process leading to general elections next feb 25 will be free 
and fair 
nicaraguanborn antonio ibarra rojas 40 a sociology professor 
at dubuque university in iowa said he came here june 11 to report 
for freedom house on the arrival of alfredo cesar and a group of 
followers 
cesar is the first active member of the miamibased nicaraguan 
resistance directorate to return home to join the political process 
the resistance is an umbrella organization of ussupported 
guerrilla and exiled political groups opposed to the sandinistas 
ibarra a naturalized us citizen who writes for freedom at 
issue the official freedom house magazine said he applied on

from his home to immigration offices and accused him of overstaying 
his 30day permit 
i showed them an approved extension for 75 more days ibarra 
said they they said i had changed addresses without notifying

independent observers 
at no time have we come to sabotage or boycott the electoral 
process 
ibarra said he was consulting his lawyer to appeal the expulsion

firefighters were gaining on the last in a series of wildfires in 
the southern part of the state 
fires also charred land in colorado georgia and alaska 
utah firefighters reinforced by fresh crews labored in the 
100degree heat to hand dig miles of fire lines on steep tinderdry 
terrain in an effort to stop blazes that have blackened 11000 acres 
of eastern forests 
most of the fires still raged out of control but an army of 200 
firefighters was slowly gaining the upper hand on the 7000acre 
diamond peak blaze the largest uncontrolled fire in the lower 48 
states on thursday said mary plumb spokeswoman for the bureau of 
land managements moab district 
the diamond peak fire located about 20 miles west of the

the fire about 40 miles southeast of pinedale and 150 miles 
southeast of yellowstone national park was 5 percent contained said

major western democracies 
thursday condemned chinas crackdown on political dissent and japan 
urged chinas leadership to heed world opinion 
the foreign ministers of australia canada the united states 
japan and new zealand denounced the chinese armys killing of 
unarmed civilians in beijing when the crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement began the night of june 34 
their speeches began three days of annual talks with their allies 
of the association of southeast asian nations where fears and 
suspicions of northern neighbor china remain deep in some quarters 
a speech on behalf of the sixth dialogue partner the european 
community did not mention china a topic that was added to the 
meetings agenda after the crackdown began 
the recent formation of a new leadership seems to indicate that 
china is in a process leading towards settlement of the domestic 
situation one way or another said foreign minister hiroshi 
mitsuzuka of japan 
japan earnestly hopes that the new chinese leadership will heed 
the international opinion and will govern in a spirit of 
reconciliation and restraint well aware of its position in the 
international community and particularly of the important role it 
plays in the asiapacific region he said 
we deeply deplore the fact tht so many lives were lost by the 
use of military force mitsuzuka said 
the chinese government has said that 200 to 300 people were 
killed when thousands of soldiers marched on beijing and drove 
prodemocracy protesters from tiananmen square chinese witnesses 
and western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been 
as high as 3000 
us secretary of state james baker iii spoke of a new order 
in east asia in which democracy and free enterprise are supplanting 
communism 
the going will not always be smooth as events in china have 
proven he said but to stand in the way of necessary historic 
change as we have seen to our revulsion in china is to turn ones 
back on the future 
foreign minister russell marshall of new zealand said the 
brutality in beijing was shocking in light of chinas progress in 
raising living standards and encouraging democratic values 
we recognize fully that there are laws and practices in other 
states that are the legitimate internal business of those states 
and none of our business he said but at the same time there 
must be a balance between the rights of sovereign states and the 
internationally recognized human rights of ordinary citizens 
japans foreign ministry spokesman seiichi kondo told reporters 
that some delegates at thursdays talks spoke strongly about human 
rights in discussing recent events in china 
he said mitsuzaka told these delegates it was not appropriate to 
isolate china and urged them to take a longer view 
we should not push china into a corner as it would be 
counterproductive kondo said

us secretary of state james 
baker iii and japanese foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka spoke of 
the risk of prolonged civil war on thursday in urging cambodias 
warring factions to share power 
mitsuzuka proposed an international body for cambodias postwar 
reconstruction 
their statements came in speeches at the start of annual talks 
between members of the association of southeast asian nations and 
their western dialogue partners 
asean comprises the noncommunist rapidly developing nations of 
brunei thailand singapore malaysia the philippines and 
indonesia the dialogue partners are the united states japan 
australia canada new zealand and the 12nation european community 
both groups support a threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting 
vietnamese troops who invaded cambodia in late 1978 and the forces 
of the hanoiinstalled government 
baker said vietnams plan to withdraw all troops by sept 30 has 
given new urgency to the search for peace the danger of a new 
cycle of civil war is very real he said 
he said prince norodom sihanouk former head of state in cambodia 
and now leader of noncommunist guerrillas is central to us and 
asean goals of a comprehensive stable settlement including 
guarantees against the return to exclusive power of the brutal khmer 
rouge 
the khmer rouge killed perhaps a million cambodians before it was 
ousted by vietnams invasion it is now the largest guerrilla unit 
in sihanouks coalition 
both the khmer rouge and the vietnamese invaders are communist 
appearing to give the provietnamese government of premier hun 
sen more stature than in previous official us statements baker 
said 
prince sihanouks efforts to work out a powersharing agreement 
with the hanoisponsored hun sen regime are crucial to the 
achievement of a viable political accord and we urge our asean 
friends to use their unity to strengthen the princes position as he 
seeks to advance the process of national reconciliation 
the main barrier is refusal of the provietnam government to let 
the khmer rouge join in a provisional fourparty government the 
khmer rouge reportedly is storing arms for a major push once the 
vietnamese soldiers leave 
baker said washington will stay engaged in the region as it 
faces these and other challenges east asia is integral to 
americas future he said 
mitsuzuka also opposed what asean officials now commonly refer to 
as an afghanistantype solution 
he said that whatever the settlement it cannot be accepted in 
such an unstable character as might prolong the civil war in 
cambodia 
mitsuzuka said it was imperative for the cambodian parties to 
work out a solution to forming a provisional politica plan for 
implementation of the future general election not only for the 
internal stability of cambodia but also for the security of all 
neighboring countries 
he said reconstruction of postwar cambodia will be a major issue 
at the international conference on cambodia in paris 
japan believes we should all now consider establishment of an 
international committee for the reconstruction of cambodia as an 
international cooperative framework he said 
he said that the very first thing this committee has to do may 
be to dispatch a factfinding mission 
edwige avice frances deputy foreign minister and chief eec 
delegate here said the international conference on cambodia 
probably will be held july 30 she said sihanouk and his guerrilla 
allies will hold talks in france july 2425 with hun sen 
japanese foreign ministry spokesman seiichi kondo said all 
participants in thursdays talks expressed support for japans 
proposal on forming the body to rebuild cambodia 
sihanouk earlier had sent the asean ministers a letter in which 
he wrote of the danger of a partial settlement

an outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections 
in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous 
strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years 
ago researchers reported today 
the newly recognized illness which doctors call streptococcal 
toxic shock syndrome can lead from a minor skin infection to death 
in a day or two 
strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor 
illnesses such as sore throats more virulent forms of the microbes 
were once frequent causes of lifethreatening illnesses including 
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever but for reasons unclear the 
dangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s 
in todays new england journal of medicine doctors describe 20 
cases of severe illness including six deaths that were seen 
between 1986 and 1988 in idaho montana utah and nevada they 
believe the illness was caused by strep bacteria that produce 
scarlatina toxin the poison responsible for scarlet fever

neptunes poles may be encircled by broad 
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on earth and 
jupiter say scientists studying a new photograph from the voyager 2 
space probe 
two dark bands each about 2700 miles wide are clearly visible 
forming a collar around neptunes south pole the photograph also 
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole said edward 
stone voyager project scientist for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
they are probably regions of clouds associated with highspeed 
jet streams said stone a physicist and vice president at the 
california institute of technology 
the planets southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees

crews have removed tainted soil near 
skagways ore terminal but eight months after the discovery of 
extremely high levels of lead in the town there is no plan for 
cleaning homes yards or skagway harbor 
its supposed to be a cleanup but its a halfhearted 
effort said susan fredricks one of about a dozen of skagways 
712 residents who in april formed get the lead out which is 
pushing for a thorough cleanup 
two anchoragebased environmental groups the alaska center for 
the environment and trustees for alaska last month asked the 
federal government to take over the cleanup they called the work so 
far patently irresponsible 
records indicate the effort has been ineffectual and marred by 
illegality and lack of agreement among the four companies 
responsible the removal of soil near the terminal and railroad 
tracks halted in may for the tourist season 
dick stokes regional supervisor of the state department of 
environmental conservation in juneau says the cleanup is going as 
fast as possible considering its complexity but has given the 
companies until july 14 to agree on a plan for the terminal 
extremely high lead levels in the terminals soil were revealed 
last fall in tests conducted by terminal operator bowhead equipment 
co which is under a federal order to stop polluting the harbor 
further tests confirmed that the gold rush towns role as a mining 
port had created an insidious byproduct 
theres lead dust in peoples carpets on their window sills 
on their door sills embedded in their beds and furniture said 
kristine benson a soil scientist with the alaska center for the 
environment 
the highest levels were at the terminal and railroad tracks 
where concentrations of 133000 parts per million have been found 
lead naturally is present in skagway soil at about 50 ppm and the 
us environmental protection has ordered cleanups elsewhere if 
levels in soil exceeded 5001000 ppm 
lead also is in residents blood although state health officials 
concluded in november that few had absorbed enough to pose a risk 
environmentalists say that conclusion was based on an outdated 
standard 
lead can cause headaches anemia colic paralysis and cramps it 
also can stunt growth in children and cause birth defects 
the symptoms are very subtle benson said i dont think 
anyone can say with any confidence that there have been no ill 
effects in skagway 
in any case the dec said a risk exists especially for children 
and promised to remove the lead officials decided to clean the 
terminal area first while testing to determine the extent of 
contamination in residential areas 
our first priority was to cut off contamination from the 
source stokes said adding that bowhead equipment has been able 
to prevent the ore from being spread through town by trucks and 
released into the air during ship loading 
meanwhile according to state records 
white pass amp yukon route violated state law twice by leaving a 
pile of contaminated soil uncovered and exposed to wind stokes in 
a letter scolded a railroad official for failing to understand 
the seriousness of the cleanup no punitive action was taken but 
stokes said the company will have to pay for the states 
investigation of the violations 
soil has been removed twice from the east side of the terminal 
but tests after each found more than the target of 1000 ppm of 
lead the area traversed by cruise ship passengers until last 
month has been sealed 
tests showed that the cleanup of a 10foot corridor along the 
railroad tracks also was insufficient 
white pass had hoped to clean up to three miles of track before 
summer but did about a halfmile because of required soil tests and 
documentation the track is being used for a tourist excursion train 
through the summer 
in a letter to the epa the two environmental groups say dec is 
illequipped to monitor the cleanup especially since the exxon 
valdez oil spill consumed much of its resources stokes doubts the 
epa which is on the steering committee will take over epa 
officials did not answer interview requests 
the environmental groups also note that the state has not come up 
with a comprehensive cleanup plan for the town about 100 miles north 
of juneau 
white pass transportation inc the railroads parent and 
terminal owner submitted a plan in january bowhead curragh 
resources inc and yukon alaska transport submitted a plan in march 
bowhead runs the terminal under contract with curragh a canadian 
mining company yukon alaska trucks the ore 
none of the plans suggests cleaning peoples yards homes or the 
harbor the four also have been unable to agree on responsibility 
for the terminal 
perhaps im a little optimistic but i think theyll find some 
kind of understanding to complete the job at the ore terminal 
stokes said 
the next question is whether they will work out among 
themselves what to do with the residential section 
a deadline for them to address residential cleanup will be set in 
the next few weeks he said that issue is the most likely to end up 
in court 
the companies are not going to volunteer to clean up indoors 
because of this unknown of financial liabilities he said the 
bottom line is were looking at no soils to remain in place at no 
greater than 500 ppm unless theres some showing that those soils 
are not likely to be redistributed 
the tentative minimum limit for inside homes also is 500 ppm but 
the residents and environmental groups want it set at 50 ppm tests 
of vacuum bag samples have shown levels up to 8210 ppm with the 
highest near the terminal 
from the studies i have read 500 ppm in the environment has 
been shown to produce lead levels in children which compromise 
neuromuscular development and red bloodcell production resident 
lynne smith wrote to dec commissioner dennis kelso please realize 
this is not some abstract concept to us it is a reality we live 
with and look for in our children every day

the medicine bow post gives folks 
pretty much what they want from a hometown newspaper but maybe not 
what they expected when the weekly was donated to the university of 
wyoming 
i think the biggest worry that they had was this was going to 
be all university news said geoff woodman last years student 
editor they were happy after they found out it was going to stay 
their newspaper 
dave roberts founded the post a dozen years ago to chronicle a 
mining boom that has since gone bust hes been keeping an eye on it 
since giving it to the school last year i think from the stories 
that i see and from letters that i get from people in medicine bow 
that theyve kept it a hometown paper 
for woodman and his staff of 11 students that meant carwash and 
church announcements news from around wyoming and updates on the 
nearby wind turbines the worlds largest without pay or the 
glamour of a bigcity paper 
its pretty bleak in the winter time there is a reason why the 
two largest wind turbines in the world were constructed in medicine 
bow said tom hacker a journalism instructor who had just 12 
applicants for the first 12 staff positions and now has to choose 
from many more 
under hackers guidance the students acting as reporters 
editors photographers and typesetters have pushed the tabloids 
circulation to 1100 with stories centered on the life and times of 
medicine bows 300 residents and their neighbors they also have 
expanded its sports and feature coverage 
the kids seem to reach out further theyre ambitious kids and 
theyre always looking for a good story said mayor gerald cook 
although admitting that some of the older residents think the 
students should stay closer to home 
i personally think the kids are doing a terrific job cook 
said 
the post averages four to eight pages and covers medicine bow 
rock river and hanna rural communities on us 30 that have 
stagnated since interstate 80 was built to funnel motorists across 
southern wyoming 
i think its as much a benefit to them as it is to the 
students roberts said 
woodman gets a semesters credit while living here to oversee the 
posts production the other 11 students live on campus in laramie 
and make several trips a week along the 60 miles of twolane highway 
to medicine bow 
they congregate in the lobby of the defunct medicine bow state 
bank on the edge of the twostreet town devoid of trees and 
fastfood restaurants dinner out means a trip to the virginian 
hotel that inspired one of the preeminent novels of the old west 
owen wisters the virginian 
inside the bank building computer terminals sit near an antique 
label printer used to address subscriptions a primitive darkroom 
occupies the vault and the teller windows provide storage space for 
back issues 
the lack of a true newsroom doesnt detract from the students 
experience or efforts hacker said i would be very surprised if 
five years from now the medicine bow post werent an even more 
important institution in that region 
cook said the students are providing a valuable service by 
keeping the paper alive and publicity the unusual program has drawn 
has boosted a sparse tourist trade we got a little national media 
and right now that helps 
the new publisher the university of wyoming is getting an 
unexpected benefit as well hacker said publicity is attracting 
more students and money to the department when there had been 
reduced emphansis on journalism 
when roberts first offered to donate the post some university 
trustees hesitated out of concern that it would draw talent from the 
student newspaper the branding iron instead i think that were 
going to do a much better job of providing people for community 
journalism jobs hacker said 
woodman who hopes the post will lead to a job on another 
smalltown newspaper has come to enjoy life in a town where you 
know everybody that you see on the street he cant drive through 
town without chatting with one of the 300 or so residents who stuck 
around after the oil and gas boom busted 
michelle kodis who takes over as editor this summer said the 
benefits of the job outweigh the appeal of having a paid internship 
with a bigcity daily id rather do this she insisted as an 
intern with a large newspaper i dont think i would get to do 
anything

thought the names went nicely together knight and daye 
that described us recalled daye i once got eleanor 
roosevelt on the show hank lifted her up to guess her weight 
wouldnt you know it an eager young station manager julia 
campbell shows up hoping to reunite the pair on klop the 16th 
highestranked station in san diego how many radio stations are 
there in san diego asks daye seventeen she says proudly 
we beat out airport information finally 
to make matter more sitcomplex the dayes live with their 
daughter a zookeeper and soninlaw an exiled cuban doctor and a 
crowd of grandtykes 
mom explains to daughter ellie lela ivey the circumstances of 
the knight and daye rift which occurred just before one of their 
radio shows and precipitated an onair fight it was an hour of 
uninterrupted vulgarity she sighs ellie is appalled worse 
than geraldo 
summer replacement shows get cut a little slack since weve come 
to expect so little from the networks in the hazy days of low 
viewing levels knight amp daye is diversionary but uneven there 
is the tiresome but apparently deriguer domestic upheaval as 
knight moves into the midst of the daye brood and the kids are too 
choreographedcute 
not enough is made of the reunion between the two basically 
incompatible egotists but knight arrives in a hilariously bad 
toupee and twotoned shoes to announce when his eyes first light 
upon daye while i am still an impressivelooking man you have 
aged incredibly 
and the pilot picks up when the dour daye sheds his curmudgeonly 
outer layer and begins to sparkle recalling their halcyon days 
together theres no need for dialogue to explain why gloria is 
adamant that he take the radio job 
of course there are some obstacles on the way to the reunion 
but the inevitable happens or we would have no series 
adams and warden are a delightful pair and their onair repartee 
is credibly amusing it is believable that people would tune in to 
hear daye complaining about the drug problem only to have knight 
gamely interject that indeed a bottle of bufferin costs 459 at 
the drugstore but at the supermarket its only 419

today on the leading edge of modern creative 
innovative financial and economic thinking old thomas gresham isnt 
always listened to although he shouts loudly from the grave 
his message is the same as it has been bad money drives out 
good and it applies today as it has since he stated it for the 
first time in the 16th century when he was an adviser to queen 
elizabeth i 
but greshams law is for the most part ignored like bad money 
a spate of experimental thinking still unproved has moved in where 
sound reasoning demonstrated over the years has departed 
ignorance of the law however doesnt mean it has no 
significance indeed its significance has been shown again as 
surely as it was in queen elizabeths day when debasement of the 
currency damaged englands foreign trade 
for evidence of the modern application you need only check what 
happens to the oncesecure bonds of sound companies after newer 
junk bonds are issued in a leveraged buyout the value of the old 
bonds falls 
james creedon president of metropolitan life insurance co a 
major holder of existing rjr nabisco bonds can attest to their 
sudden decline in market value the drop occurred when the company 
decided to undergo a junk bondfinanced leveraged buyout last year 
metropolitan has sued so far without success for reimbursement 
junk bonds are said by their supporters to be as good as any 
other even better their promoters claim that nobody can as yet 
demonstrate they are riskier they pay very high yields to borrowers 
they are issued by borrowers often to raise funds for a leveraged 
buyout of a corporation or to take over another company they carry 
high rates because those who issue them cant otherwise raise the 
money quickly 
in the rjr nabisco deal creedon claims the issuance of junk 
bonds by companies that already have older sounder bonds oustanding 
turns upside down some basic legal concepts governing the extension 
of credit 
one of the most fundamental principles of corporate law he said 
in a recent speech is that the claims of bondholders are superior 
to the claims of shareholders 
thus he said if a corporation is liquidated the assets would 
be sold and the proceeds would be used to pay first the 
bondholders and other creditors then the preferred shareholders 
and lastly if anything is remaining the common shareholders 
in the rjr nabisco leveraged buyout he continued substantially 
all the companys net worth was paid out to its shareholders and the 
bondholders received nothing 
the payment to shareholders was funded by enormous levels of 
new debt he said in effect the interests of shareholders were 
given priority over the interests of the bondholders 
analyzing the situation h erich heinemann chief economist of 
ladenburg thalmann amp co states that the result was predictable 
the value of 5 billion of existing rjr debt plunged 
questions what will future bond buyers say when salesmen ask 
them to invest in corporate bonds will they merely ask what 
protection they have from being destroyed by a sudden issuance of 
junk bonds will they decline to buy will they demand higher rates 
for assuming a greater risk 
said heineman when lbo players change the rules in the middle 
of the game to suit their personal convenience let alone their 
personal pocketbooks its time for the public taxpayers and 
investors alike to beware 
said creedon highquality secure investments were turned into 
a form of junk 
and from the grave you almost could hear sir thomas say i 
warned you bad money drives out good it always has

eighteenwheelers filled with electronic 
goods and auto parts rumble out of one of the nations busiest 
foreign trade zones and on past highproduction farms 
they roll past shiny aluminum trailer parks for retirees who pump 
millions into the economy past a busy mall and middleclass 
neighborhoods 
welcome to the nations poorest metropolitan area 
the lowest per capita income of the 318 us metropolitan areas 
in 1987 7001 was in mcallenedinburgmission in the lower rio 
grande valley where a boom is taking place amid rural slums where 
thousands live in squalor 
there are other measures of hidalgo countys poverty it has the 
states highest unemployment rate and in march it shut down its 
indigent health care program when it ran out of money halfway 
through the fiscal year 
but local promoters say the gloomy statistics are misleading 
we are a thriving little town said leonel garza president 
of the mcallen board of realtors inc i keep hearing were full of 
poverty i dont know how they figure it 
new industries especially the border plants maquiladoras are 
drawing so many people that housing values are on the rise garzas 
group in a may survey found only three houses available for rent in 
the city 
more than 1 billion in goods a year pass through the foreign 
trade zone which has had to turn away tenants since its warehouses 
filled up last year 
hidalgo county also is the no 1 destination for 80000 winter 
texans retirees who spent about 161 million last year in 
southern texas 
and retail sales in the area grew 226 percent last year faster 
than any other part of the state 
those statistics also mislead said economist j michael patrick 
director of the center for entrepreneurship and economic development 
at pan american university in edinburg just because we see a lot 
of activity in mcallen doesnt mean its being translated to the 
population in a broad sense 
the broader population he refers to is found largely in the rural 
colonias where developers have sold tiny home sites without water 
sewers or paved roads for as little as 100 down a 1986 study for 
the texas water development board found 52000 people in 366 
colonias in hidalgo county population 375000 
this time of year many colonia residents are boarding up their 
houses to travel north to harvest crops continuing a cycle of 
subsistence living 
we have to get away from migrant work so there will be 
stability in the families so our children will have a full school 
year not half a year said carmen anaya who for 39 years has 
lived south of pharr in a colonia known as las milpas 
the majority of colonia residents are us citizens said mrs 
anaya who through valley interfaith a coalition of churches won 
legislative approval this session of a 100 million appropriation 
for colonia water and sewer installations the bill was signed into 
law by gov bill clement 
nobody has sewer service here said herlinda hernandez 65 
who lives with her husband in a cinderblock house in a colonia west 
of mission her daughter and grandchildren live in a plywood home in 
the front of the same small lot on a street paved with caliche clay 
mrs hernandez has running water and a septic tank but fears 
that her grandchildren are exposed to chemicals from the 
cropdusting planes that spray a corn field behind her house 
a neighbor down the street uses an antique wringer washing 
machine while children play in the dusty street 
many colonia residents have outhouses that overflow on rainy 
days even when equipped with septic tanks many yards end up with 
contaminated soil due to poor drainage and lots too small to absorb 
the waste 
that leads to hepatitis intestinal parasites and typhoid said 
sister christine stephens chief organizer for valley interfaith 
they live on top of open sewers a lot of the time 
the working poor who have no health insurance and make too much 
for public health care simply go without resulting in undetected 
cases of diabetes and high blood pressure stephens said 
like most border areas prosperity in hidalgo county is tied to 
the maquiladoras where us products are assembled by mexican 
workers making about 1 an hour the number of maquiladoras in 
reynosa mexico across from mcallen increased from 36 to 51 
between november 1987 and november 1988 and added more than 5000 
new employees according to the mcallen economic development corp 
yet the county in april had texas worst unemployment rate 167 
percent more than double the state average of 7 percent and a 
point higher than the year before according to the texas employment 
commission 
the growing unemployment in the face of an industrial boom is 
primarily due to a high birthrate and an influx of people into 
hidalgo county said david ruelas employment commission labor 
market analyst in mcallen 
to bridge the gap the mcallen economic development corp is 
trying to attract maquiladora suppliers companies that would 
provide highly paid jobs for skilled labor said president mike 
allen 
but many local communities have high school dropout rates of more 
than 50 percent and a shortage of people with industrial experience 
that makes it hard to convince companies they can find people to 
fill skilled positions in plastic injection molding and toolanddie 
operations and most continue to send the supply orders north to 
traditionally industrial parts of the united states

this time the election returns may follow the 
supreme court onto an abortion battlefield no candidate is likely 
to escape without scars 
president bush expressed confidence that americans will handle 
the issue within the bounds of civility and our legal 
institutions 
that may be wishful confidence 
abortion is not a subject that fosters civil discourse not even 
in the chambers of the supreme court where blackrobed justices 
bitterly denounced one another in the july 3 decision permitting 
state restrictions on abortion and certainly not in the streets 
chief justice william rehnquist said dissenting colleagues had 
accused his 54 majority of cowardice and illegitimacy in angry 
dissent justice harry blackmun said the decision invites 
constitutional crisis for the nation and brutal consequences for 
women who would defy laws against abortion 
the shouting and shoving started almost at once in 
demonstrations scattered around the country with confrontations 
that can only escalate 
both sides said they would demand that every state legislator 
indeed every candidate for office take a public position on 
abortion to the rival activists that single issue overrides 
everything else in judging a candidate 
after a politically popular decision at the turn of the century 
finley peter dunne the chicago columnist wrote that the supreme 
court follows the election returns 
that observation may be reversed on abortion which blackmun 
called the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of our 
time there is no safe side for officeholders officeseekers 
even for judges 
justice antonin scalia said the court should overturn its 1973 
abortion rights ruling get out of the way and let the political 
system deal with the issue 
for 16 years since the court held that a woman has a right to 
terminate a pregnancy opponents of abortion have been campaigning 
intensively sometimes defying the law to barricade abortion 
clinics sometimes shouting down candidates 
they were on the offense demanding a constitutional amendment 
against abortion 
now the court has opened another path to their objective 
permitting state restrictions and hinting that it may eventually 
reverse its 1973 abortion decision so they will lobby and 
demonstrate for restrictive state laws and also will put the issue 
before the courts in as many versions as possible 
abortion rights organizations saw the handwriting of an 
increasingly conservative supreme court and began mobilizing in 
anticipation of court setbacks now they will try to make the issue 
central in every legislature and every election 
the first arenas will be the closely divided florida legislature 
to be summoned to special session by a republican governor bent on 
restricting abortion and the nov 7 elections in new jersey and 
virginia which are electing governors and legislators in both 
states the republican gubernatorial nominees oppose abortion the 
democrats support abortion rights 
while the issue is too personal with too much intramural dissent 
for party lines to hold clearly national democratic policy is to 
favor abortion rights while the republican party opposes abortion 
the 1988 democratic platform declares that the fundamental 
right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of 
ability to pay the republican platform tailored to the position 
bush adopted as ronald reagans vice presidential nominee supports 
an antiabortion constitutional amendment and opposes the use of 
public funds for abortion 
supreme court opinions and dissents in the abortion ruling 
forecast the coming fights scalia said the court had prolonged its 
selfawarded sovereignty over a field where it has little proper 
business 
scalia said that the answers to most of the cruel questions 
posed are political not juridical he said that by stopping short 
of reversal the court made itself the object of the sort of 
organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy 
ought to receive 
we can now look forward to at least another term with carts 
full of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators 
urging us to follow the popular will scalia said 
blackmun said in his dissent that the decision implicitly 
invites every state legislature to enact more and more restrictive 
abortion regulations in order to provoke more and more test cases 
the supreme court will consider three more abortion cases later 
this year following on what scalia scorned as an indecisive 
decision 
that probably will escalate the battle but perhaps eventually 
the political system will shape answers acceptable to the majority 
of americans

he was one of professional footballs mightiest 
men a 295pound monster who could bench press twice his weight 
now steve courson is thrilled to lift 15pound dumbbells and climb 
a flight of stairs 
the former offensive lineman now only 33 years old suffers from 
cardiomyopathy a mysterious disease that turns heart muscle into 
flab and eventually kills its victims unless they undergo a 
transplant 
though his doctors cant blame coursons condition on his long 
heavy use of anabolic steroids they cant rule it out neither can 
he 
there are so many ironies about my situation thats why i 
cant discard them as being an accident why is all this ironically 
happening to me ive had two strikes strike three youre out 
courson formerly of the pittsburgh steelers and tampa bay 
buccaneers is believed to be the first professional athlete to be 
put on the waiting list for a heart transplant after years of taking 
illegally obtained anabolic steroids 
experts fear more may follow 
i wouldnt be surprised i think its going to happen said 
transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh it might be liver disease that comes out of those 
things too 
the potential health hazard and the impact on the national 
health care system its very frightening said harvard 
universitys dr lyle micheli president of the american college of 
sports medicine 
it also raises an ethical question for transplant surgeons with 
a scarcity of organs should people who take harmful drugs be given 
lower priority 
anabolic steroids fast becoming the scourge of sports are 
derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone they stimulate 
development of bone muscle and skin admitted users include 
canadian sprinter ben johnson whose 1988 olympics gold medal was 
withdrawn after he tested positive for the drugs 
courson first took anabolic steroids in 1974 before his sophomore 
year at the university of south carolina in four weeks he went 
from 230 pounds to a solid 260 he continued the offseason habit 
after being drafted by the steelers in 1977 and playing on two super 
bowl teams 
not long after being traded to the buccaneers in 1984 courson 
boasted a 60inch chest and 22inch biceps and was pressing up to 
605 pounds anyone whos trained with weights or trained that 
seriously at worldclass level realizes those types of gains dont 
occur by eating wheaties 
at one point courson was shelling out 1500 a year for 
steroids not that big a tradeoff when youre making 300000 a 
year he said 
in march 1985 in the midst of an 1800 milligramaweek regimen 
his highest ever buccaneers doctors told him he had an irregular 
heartbeat the problem cleared up in two weeks with medication and 
courson quit taking steroids for the next year 
at the end of the 1985 season courson lost his starting job he 
took his last dose of anabolic steroids before the buccaneers 
training camp in 1986 in hopes of getting off the bench i wanted 
to maintain a competitive edge and i realize it had to do with my 
age too the wear and tear on the body 
courson was waived at the start of the season got no other 
offers and retired he lived in wyoming and florida then returned 
to the pittsburgh area in early 1988 to finish his autobiography and 
train as a professional wrestler 
on nov 23 1988 courson went to allegheny general hospital for 
what he thought was an ulcer it turned out to be cardiomyopathy 
for years doctors have warned of the immediate side effects of 
steroids acne sexual dysfunction rashes and unusually aggressive 
behavior known in the trade as roid rage less is known about 
longterm effects although animal tests suggest the drugs 
accelerate cardiovascular disease 
anybody whos used steroids and has any malady its 
immediately assumed steroids caused it we havent even done those 
studies yet said dr charles yesalis of pennsylvania state 
university 
we dont know frankly what is the bottom line said dr 
judith orie coursons cardiologist but we do know anabolic 
steroids cause high blood pressure in patients high blood pressure 
after a point in time causes the heart to fail 
also steroids can alter the immune system we dont know 
whether that has played a role and allowed a virus to affect his 
heart or not orie said 
complicating matters is the fact that doctors dont always know 
what causes cardiomyopathy 
there are many people who have cardiomyopathy and had nothing 
to do with steroids said dr barry maron of the national 
institutes of health thats the problem there is in establishing 
a connection in this one person its a very iffy kind of thing 
although im not saying its impossible 
about 40 percent of all heart transplants are performed on 
cardiomyopathy patients said dr michael kaye of the university of 
california at san diego who keeps the international registry of 
heart heartlung and lung transplants which stood at 11181 in 
late june the vast majority 10154 were straight heart 
transplants 
there were 1223 people awaiting heart transplants in the united 
states as of june 26 according to the united network for organ 
sharing 
the transplant community is concerned about steroids because 
of the tremendous need for organs and lack of donors kaye said 
courson who has been on the list since march 31 could wait a 
long time because of his body size doctors give him two years 
without a transplant 
experimental heart medication has enabled the 6foot1 courson 
to go from an alltime adult low of 225 pounds late last year to 255 
pounds it has also allowed him to stay in shape by walking 
treadmills and lifting light weights three times a week at allegheny 
generals cardiac rehabilitation laboratory 
because of the scarcity of organs some people quietly wonder 
whether former steroid users should get the same priority as 
individuals who never took illicit drugs transplant doctors 
however say they merely take into account patients current 
lifestyles and ability to maintain healthy habits 
cigarette smokers and alcoholics for instance usually are told 
they must stop before they can be considered for transplantation 
thats no guarantee however that they will stop for good 
arthur mcdonald sr 53 of schenectady ny ended a 30year 
cigarette habit before being put on the heart transplant waiting 
list at presbyterianuniversity hospital of pittsburgh about a year 
after his 1985 transplant he was smoking again he says he plans to 
quit as soon as he loses 30 more pounds 
they werent very happy im not happy with myself he said 
youve got a second chance at life and the cigarettes arent going 
to add to it 
doctors say they extract a promise and hope for the best 
we really need that commitment starzl said but just 
because someone drank in the past just because steve courson once 
took steroids so he could compete i dont believe should be 
determining factors 
i think hes been punished plenty 
courson feels no shame or guilt being on the waiting list 
everyones got their faults but when you were doing something 
that you got paid for and was glorified are you totally to be 
blamed

i woke up this morning after a night of killing pain 
i went to the practice field to deal with it again 
my coach he tells me fight hard and be a man 
but with his chalk board theories we all wonder if he can 
so knock em down block em hard and strive to win the fight 
i wonder why theyre so concerned is it economic plight 
the battle in the trenches won and lost and who does realize 
but the gladiator in its midst whose soul in anguish cries 
the battle fought the game is won and victor duly glorified 
but the sad fact businessman is the sporting soul has died 
in the end in retrospect whats glorified and gained 
but the almighty dollar not the spirit of the game

wires as thick as molecules grown 
in rocks containing microscopic channels could yield tiny 
threedimensional chips that could be tightly packed into small 
computers a researcher says 
we cannot claim yet that we have electron flow along these 
chains but we have essentially done the first step to make these 
systems said thomas bein a university of new mexico chemist who 
with doctoral candidate patricia enzel grew chains of organic 
molecules in the channels of a mineral called zeolite 
the channels in zeolite are 3 to 12 angstroms wide an angstrom 
is onetenth of a billionth of a meter etched wires on silicon 
microchips are about 1 micron one25000th of an inch or one 
millionth of a meter 
crystals of zeolite greek for boiling stone are believed 
to form in volcanoes under high heat and pressure bein said they 
seem to boil because they contain water in their channels in 
nature 
synthetic zeolites are used as filters in such industries as oil 
refining because they have a large surface area and their channels 
can either absorb or reject differentsized molecules he said 
i think hes made a substantial advance here said mark 
ratner a northwestern university chemist who had heard about but 
had not read beins research he described it as growing a wire 
in a mineral 
one of the problems has been how to get these things to 
structure properly because they are floppy kind of like boiled 
spaghetti ratner said the advantage of using zeolites is they 
are stones theyre hard rigid welldesigned structures with 
pores in them 
if molecular wires can be grown in zeolites you would be 
solving the addressing problems telling the wire where to go he 
said 
bein said he and enzel used synthetic zeolite crystals each 
about 1 micron in diameter in their research which was presented 
during an april meeting of the american chemical society in dallas 
thousands of crystals in the form of a powder where placed in a 
quartz reactor the size of a large cigar and heated to 400 degrees 
celsius to remove water vapor from the channels the crystals were 
cooled in a vacuum to keep the channels empty so vapors of an 
organic substance called aniline could be used to coat the interior 
walls of the channels an oxidant caused the aniline to link into 
chains of polyaniline which is known to conduct electricity 
other conducting polymers also have been encapsulated in the 
crystals including polypyrrole and polythiophene bein said more 
research is needed to determine the length of the linked molecules 
so a current can be hooked up 
some zeolites contain parallel channels while others contain 
networks of channels like hallways and rooms bein said we have a 
whole shopping list of about 200 structures with different pore 
sizes and types of networks 
a step after controlling the chemistry in the channels and 
determining electrical flow would be to introduce active 
components like storage of bits or switching and then to try 
to put information in and get information out of these assemblies 
bein said then we could create a very dense computer at a 
molecular level and thats what excites us so much

a russian fish that feasts on aquatic 
plants has made friends in america by clearing fishhook and 
propellersnagging weeds 
the white amur a native of large rivers in russia and china was 
introduced to the united states in 1963 the long slender fish 
commonly known as the grass carp has proven effective in controlling 
underwater and floating weeds said tim murphy of the university of 
georgia extension service 
they do an excellent job of cleaning a pond by eating the 
vegetation said paul williams coowner of a hatchery that 
produces the long slender fish its going to open up ponds and 
streams that are unusable 
south carolinas water resources commission plans to stock lake 
marion a major recreational area with 300000 grass carp over a 
threeyear period the agency has been able to eliminate some weeds 
with chemicals but not hydrilla which has closed large sections of 
the 110000acre lake 
grass carp are known to feed on hydrilla noted danny 
johnson director of the commissions surface water division 
the tennessee valley authority has asked congress to fund a weed 
control program for its 68000acre lake guntersville in 
northwestern alabama the plan includh 
californias long valley 
the chamber is believed to hold about 200 cubic miles of molten 
rock at temperatures as high as 1650 degrees fahrenheit according 
to sandia national laboratory researchers who plan to drill 2500 
feet in 60 days during the first phase of the experiment scheduled 
to begin aug 1 
phase two next summer will extend the hole to 6500 feet the 
third phase in 1991 will go to 14000 feet and the final phase 
in 1992 will go to 20000 feet or until the temperature hits 930 
degrees the final step is to bore through molten and partially 
molten rock with a bit that sprays some sort of liquid to clean the 
bit and cool the rock to drillable consistancy 
fluid would continue to be flushed through the well and through 
fractures in the solidified magma possibly generating highpressure 
steam that would be used to drive turbine generators at ground level 
scientists dont know if magma is a practical source of energy 
the us geological survey estimates magma bodies buried within six 
miles of the surface contain up to 500000 quads of energy each 
quad a guadrillion british thermal units is equal of 172 million 
barrels of oil 
one of the big unknowns is at what depth does magma reside 
under long valley said sandia project manager james dunn seismic 
readings suggest the top of the magma chamber is about 4 miles deep 
the long valley caldera is a collapsed 700000yearold volcano 
in inyo national forest in eastcentral california the well will be 
drilled within the caldera on top of a low rounded hill that has 
bulged up from the caldera floor because of the magma pressing from 
below

patrick a virginia polytechnic institute biologist uses 
salamanders to study the effects of acid rain because their skins 
arent waterproof he said acid rain goes right into them unlike 
most other vertebrates that makes them much more sensitive to acid 
rain than say a bird or a mammal 
some 40 species of salamander live in the central appalachians 
more than anywhere else in the world patrick has dyemarked or 
photographed 3000 of the amphibians over six years so he can 
identify and track them in the wild 
ireland who travels the streams springs and mountains of

ive found that for salamanders its the sulfur that is equally 
bad or worse than the hydrogen the acid part the hydrogen is 
easily neutralized by a lot of components in soil my work is 
showing that the sulfates are a big problem and there is nothing in 
soil to get rid of that 
acid rain in bodies of water often is gauged by ph levels which 
test their acidity and not sulfur he said very often you find 
that the hydrogen might not be too high but you can still have a 
lot of sulfates

a laser beam that vaporizes pockets of tooth 
decay treats cavities without drilling anesthesia or pain a 
researcher says 
when it was used on 100 teeth with cavities or shallow decay 95 
percent of the patients reported feeling nothing said dentist 
richard klein the others reported a brief warmth or tingle that was 
not uncomfortable 
klein of madison heights mich spoke at a recent news 
conference for a dental laser developed by sunrise technologies inc 
of sunnyvale calif the device has been sold in other countries 
since december but is not approved by the food and drug 
administration for general use in the united states said company 
chairman arthur vassiliadis 
another alternative to standard drilling called caridex gained 
fda approval five years ago that system uses a liquid to dissolve 
decayed tissue greatly reducing the need for drilling its 
developers say 
klein who has used caridex said the laser works faster 
the laser beam is aimed with a handpiece that resembles that for 
a drill its rapid pulses are absorbed by decayed tissue which 
vaporizes but healthy tissue does not absorb the light and so 
remains unaffected 
the process takes longer than regular drilling said klein who 
charges an extra 5 to 20 depending on how long it takes he also 
said the current model could not replace the drill completely 
because it cannot penetrate fillings or crowns nor get through 
tooth enamel to reach cavities between teeth 
robert m pick assistant clinical professor of periodontics at 
the northwestern university dental school in chicago said more 
research is needed on the lasers potential for treating cavities 
it may not be as effective as the drill for deep cavities although 
it will be with further development 
pick said the laser should be helpful in other applications 
because it sterilizes tissue so it may lower the chance of 
infection after root canal surgery and promote healing after a gum 
disease treatment called curettage 
the fda has approved another type of dental laser that can remove 
benign tumors and other soft tissues without bleeding and with 
minimal or no pain after surgery he said

148 million to allow the agency to retain 179 workers it is slated 
to lose 
current plans call for osha to lose the employees next fiscal 
year when california returns its workersafety protections to the 
supervision of a state agency which will get 50 percent of its 
funds from the federal government 
the federal share of the cost of the california program will be 
roughly 148 million and osha is to lose the 179 positions now 
assigned to work that will be taken over by the state 
but labor secretary elizabeth dole proposed boosting oshas 
budget by the amount needed to pay for the california program and 
allow osha to relocate the california positions elsewhere in the 
country 
osha should retain and redeploy the 179 positions mrs dole 
said wednesday in a statement she said oshas jurisdiction and 
responsibilities have expanded in recent years without corresponding 
boosts in staff size 
mrs dole made the request in letters to sen tom harkin diowa

capital citiesabc inc has been granted a 
permanent waiver to federal communications commission rules that 
could have forced the company to sell multimilliondollar radio and 
television stations in new york los angeles chicago and san 
francisco the commission said 
the commission announced wednesday that it granted capital 
cities request that it be allowed to own wabctv wabcam and 
wpljfm in new york city wlstv wlsam and wytzfm chicago 
kabctv kabcam and klosfm los angeles and kgotv and kgoam 
san francisco 
in march the fcc loosened crossownership rules that prohibited 
a company from owning both a radio station and a television station 
in the same television market such as in the new york or los 
angeles metropolitan areas 
the commission said it would look favorably upon waiver requests 
involving radio and television station combinations in the largest 
25 television markets in the country 
it would grant waivers if there were more than 30 separately 
owned operated and controlled broadcast licensees or voices 
after the proposed combination the commission said 
in a 30 ruling made june 30 and issued wednesday the commission 
said capital cities had shown the stations were located in four of 
the five largest markets in the country the commission said cap 
cities had shown there are 94 separate broadcast owners in new york 
city 79 in los angeles 105 in chicago and 57 in san francisco 
the fcc in 1985 had granted capital cities and abc an 18month 
waiver to the socalled onetoamarket rule when the two media 
companies proposed a 35 billion merger 
the commission had anticipated that the two companies would sell 
off radio and television stations to meet fcc requirements which 
also stipulated that one company could own tv stations that reached 
no more than 25 percent of the viewing public 
the two companies owned 12 tv stations and 24 radio stations and 
before the merger was completed in january 1986 they sold four tv 
stations eight radio stations and capital cities cable television 
division for a total price of about 1 billion 
among the sales were wtnhtv new haven conn sold for 170 
million wxyztv detroit and wftstv tampa fla 246 million 
and wkbwtv buffalo ny 65 million 
but before the 18month waiver period expired the commission 
announced it was considering allowing common ownership in the larger 
tv markets capital cities requested another extension of the 
temporary waiver and then the request for a permanent waiver its 
holding in the four large markets 
granting capital citiesabcs request clearly meets the 
standards adopted in the multiple ownership proceeding the 
commission said adding that permitting radiotelevision 
combinations in the top 25 markets with many competing voices 
generally would not undermine the benefits derived from the fccs 
traditional procompetitive and diversity policies

an economic recession in israel is taking a 
heavy toll on jobs sparking angry protests from laidoff workers 
and a rising chorus of calls for government help 
but the hardpressed finance ministry already grappling with a 
widening budget deficit and higher army spending to deal with the 
palestinian uprising has been hesitant to come to the rescue 
the nations unemployment rate has climbed to 86 percent and 
rabbi moshe zeev feldman the deputy labor minister says it could 
hit a 20year high of 10 percent by years end if no action is 
taken feldman says more than 132000 israelis are out of work 
the most dramatic protest involved 20 mayors from development 
towns who chained themselves to the gate outside prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs office last weekend to demand relief for unemployed 
residents and their own cashstrapped municipal coffers 
they later set up tents across from the prime ministry and 
threatened to camp there until their demands were met 
the development towns were set up to attract jewish immigrants to 
rural areas but many of their local factories have been closed or 
forced to cut workers in the economic downturn 
yehiel zohar council leader from netivot in the southern negev 
desert said unemployment was twice the national average declining 
tax revenues and rising costs have pushed the town budget 35 
million into the red he said 
people are desperate and we have nowhere else to go zohar 
said 
about 140 workers including many recently demobilized soldiers 
blocked streets in the northern town of beit shean this week to 
protest losing jobs on archaeological sites employees laid off by 
electronics and defense contractors also have picketed there 
and in tel aviv tax men raided the tel aviv museum which owes 
nearly 1 million in back taxes the jerusalem post said the tax 
squad planned to confiscate 100 paintings but settled for 
televisions typewriters and other office equipment after museum 
officials said a court order was needed to take the artwork 
the city has said it cannot rescue the museum and 30 percent of 
the museum staff may be laid off 
israeli analysts predict a slow economic turnaround 
the recession seems to be bottoming out now said yacov 
sheinin of economic models inc in tel aviv it will be a slow 
comeback but i think by the beginning of 1990 the performance will 
be much better 
he predicted the economy after two lackluster years could grow 
about 4 percent next year but he said factories would be slow to 
rehire meaning well probably face a high rate of unemployment 
through 1990 and into 1991 
the unemployment rate in israel was 56 percent of the work force 
at the start of the recession in late 1987 
the economic downturn coincided with the start of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation 
tourism and foreign investment declined sharply an arab boycott 
cut the sale of israeli goods to the west bank and gaza strip one 
of israels leading export markets and tax collection in the arab 
sector remains at a low level thousands of arab workers also left 
jobs in israel hitting industries such as construction and textiles 
particularly hard 
the army last month asked for an additional 210 million to cover 
the cost of fighting the uprising and finance minister shimon peres 
warned that it may have to be balanced with cuts in nonmilitary 
programs 
peres has been trying to hold to the economic austerity program 
he put in place on jan 1 to stem the rising budget deficit 
he has devalued the shekel three times against the dollar from 
16 to 2 shekels cut government subsidies on food and fuel and 
resisted ministry calls for higher spending 
but in an economy that traditionally has turned to the government 
to get it through rough times peres has been forced to make 
concessions to help ailing statesupported institutions 
he has agreed to a 26 billion bailout program for the nations 
ailing kibbutz collective farms and a 50 million loan to the 
histadrutcontrolled koor industrial conglomerate which was 
threatened with bankruptcy 
earlier this week the parliament passed a 9 million 
loanguarantee program to assist more than 130 recessionweakened 
companies a proposal put forward to assist the development towns 
has been estimated by the finance ministry at 150 million

strikebound eastern airlines has won a twoweek 
reprieve for finishing a reorganization plan before competing 
proposals may be filed 
at a hearing wednesday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
granted the joint request by eastern and its major creditors for an 
extension of the companys exclusivity period through july 21 after 
they indicated they were nearing agreement on a restructuring plan 
were making progress although were not there at the 
moment said joel zweibel the attorney representing easterns 
major creditors 
in granting the request lifland said there have been few 
windows of opportunity in this case i certainly view the present 
period as a real window of opportunity 
miamibased eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from 
creditors on march 9 five days after the start of a crippling 
strike by the machinists union that has been supported by most 
pilots and flight attendants 
a company seeking chapter 11 protection has the sole right to 
submit a reorganization plan to the court during the first 120 days 
of its case after which other parties may propose plans easterns 
exclusivity period had been due to end friday 
eastern wants to rebuild as a smaller carrier and pay off 
creditors with the proceeds of about 18 billion in asset sales 
including several that already have been approved by the bankruptcy 
court 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp said 
friday that only technical differences regarding the plan remained 
between the company and its creditors 
but zweibel said after the hearing that two substantive 
issues which he declined to identify still were unresolved 
we hope that theyll be resolved within two weeks zweibel 
said in an interview he said the speed of eastern and the creditors 
in devising a reorganization plan was unprecedented for a large 
complex bankruptcy case 
also at the hearing david i shapiro the courtappointed 
bankruptcy examiner for eastern said contract negotiations were 
continuing in washington between the airlines management and its 
striking pilots as ordered by lifland 
for about a week shapiro has been trying to get the two sides to 
reach an agreement that would end the pilots walkout he did not 
disclose details of the talks saying only that they would be 
broadened monday to include easterns other two striking unions 
but sources close to the talks speaking anonymously said little 
progress has been made and only minor issues have been addressed so 
far 
pilots union officials insist that jobsecurity provisions are 
necessary for an agreement eastern recently sought bankruptcy court 
permission to cancel its contract with the air line pilots 
association and to impose about 50 million in wage and benefit 
concessions the airline also is seeking changes in work policies 
that would allow it to increase pilots flying hours

opec nations boosted their crude oil 
production in june to its highest level so far this year surpassing 
the cartels selfimposed output ceiling according to estimates 
the international energy agency said wednesday in its monthly oil 
market report that the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries pumped about 213 million barrels of crude a day last 
month up 200000 barrels a day from may 
the rise lifted secondquarter production to about 21 million 
barrels a day topping opecs selfimposed 185 millionbarrel daily 
production limit it also was the highest for the apriljune period 
since the 232 million barrels a day produced in that quarter of 
1981 
the opec nations last month set their production ceiling at 195 
million barrels a day for the last six months of the year up 1 
million barrels from the firsthalf quota in an attempt to support 
an 18 benchmark price for a basket of middle eastern crude oil 
the basket price is a composite of seven different crudes 
opecs argument is that by giving member countries higher quotas 
they will be less likely to cheat and exceed the limits 
the ministers agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionately 
among all members angering kuwait and others that wanted a bigger 
share of the increase kuwait has stated it would not be bound by 
its individual quota 
the energy agency a body of the multination organization of 
economic cooperation and development predicted demand for opec oil 
would be about 209 million barrels a day in the second half of the 
year about the same as the may forecast 
michael rothman senior energy analyst at merrill lynch capital 
markets in new york predicted opec in july would produce 205 
million to 21 million barrels a day 
he said oil stocks already were high and demand was likely to 
slow which could keep prices under downward pressure 
the average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
was 1762 a barrel at the end of june sharply up from 1234 at 
the end of november 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude closed at 2079 a barrel wednesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange up 52 cents from fridays close the market was 
closed monday and tuesday for the independence day holiday 
opec has said data from nearly all its members shows they 
generally are adhering to their targets the organization measures a 
nations quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oil 
put into or drawn out of stocks 
the energy agency estimated saudi arabia the worlds no 1 crude 
exporter produced 48 million barrels a day in june compared with 
its opec quota of 45 million barrels a day 
the major increase was in iran which was up 300000 barrels a 
day from may to 28 million barrels a day in june the report 
stated 
iraq like iran pumped about 28 million barrels a day compared 
with a quota of 264 million barrels 
kuwait produced an estimated 16 million barrels a day and the 
united arab emirates 17 million barrels compared with their 
targets of about 1 million barrels a day 
nigeria produced an estimated 16 million barrels a day 
venezuela 17 million barrels ecuador 300000 barrels indonesia 
12 million barrels algeria 700000 barrels gabon 200000 
barrels and libya 1 million barrels

cablevision systems corp has been mentioned as 
another possible bidder for time inc further complicating the 
media giants plan to merge with warner communications inc 
time attorney lawrence hamermesh told delaware chancery court 
judge william allen in a letter dated july 3 that cablevision is 
actively considering a bid for time the letter was disclosed 
wednesday 
a cablevision spokesman david carey said the cabletv company 
had no comment on the letter time spokesman edward adler said his 
company which is trying to fend off a 122 billion hostile bid 
from paramount communications corp also would not comment 
the letter was filed with the delaware court which is 
considering suits brought against time by paramount and a group of 
time shareholders that includes cablevision and texas investor 
robert bass 
the time board has rejected paramounts 200ashare bid as 
inadquate and too dependent upon contingencies to be viable the 
company is trying to preserve its planned merger with warner and has 
launched a 14 billion tender offer for that movie and publishing 
concern 
paramount sued time in delaware to force times board of 
directors to consider its offer 
time stock rose 125 a share to 15525 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading wednesday warner was up 87 cents to 
6125 a share and paramount slipped 87 cents to 5937 a share 
also in nyse trading 
cablevision which is based in woodbury ny was off 87 cents 
to 4175 a share on the american stock exchange 
some analysts who have followed the threeway struggle for time 
were skeptical about a bid from cablevision one of the nations 
largest operators of cabletv systems and a provider of cable 
programming 
fred anschel of dean witter reynolds inc noted that 
cablevision already has a heavy debt burden and likely could not 
handle the high leverage needed to complete a buyout of time 
but frederick moran an analyst who follows cablevision for moran 
amp associates inc said if they do it i would expect them to be 
a very tough player 
moran acknowledged that cablevisions debt load was a concern 
but said the company likely would have a partner if it does make a 
bid that makes the situation doable he said 
it was not immediately known whether bass was considering joining 
cablevision in a possible bid david bonderman a bass spokesman 
did not return a telephone call seeking comment and bondermans 
secretary said it was the companys policy not to comment on 
possible bids 
however anschel said any new bids for time would be academic 
before the delaware court ruled on the paramount suit 
paramount is seeking to force the time board to seriously 
consider its offer on grounds that the board effectively put the 
company up for sale when it agreed to merge with warner in a 
stockswap earlier this year 
under delaware law if a company has put itself up for sale it 
must consider whatever bids will give shareholders the maximum 
value if the court rules in paramounts favor time will be 
hardpressed to ignore paramounts bid which is 74 higher than the 
price at which time stock traded before paramount announced its 
original 107 billion or 175 a share bid june 6 
allen the delaware judge will hear arguments in the case 
tuesday and is expected to rule shortly afterward however any 
decision undoubtedly will be appealed to the delaware supreme court 
meanwhile wednesday paramount extended the expiration date of 
its offer for time until july 28 the offer had been scheduled to 
expire friday

the federal aviation administration has ordered 
rigorous inspections of the 47 oldest boeing 727s following the 
discovery of an unusual 20inch crack on a united airlines jet 
officials said wednesday 
united inspectors found the crack june 26 during a routine 
maintenance inspection and notified boeing co and the faa 
immediately said united spokesman rob doughty in a telephone 
interview from chicago 
the crack started inside the plane and broke through the surface 
the trijet has been repaired and is back in service officials said 
the cracked portion was removed for examination by boeing 
specialists preliminary indications suggested the cause was metal 
fatigue faa officials said 
the 727 no longer manufactured was the alltime bestselling 
commercial jet before being supplanted by the boeing 737 boeing 
spokesman tom cole said there are 1765 of the 727s in service 
structural problems in older aircraft usually can be anticipated 
often through computers but the one in the united jet was found 
in an unexpected place cole said 
the faa order requires the removal of some of the seats and 
removal of sidewall linings and insulation to gain access to the 
inside of the fuselage skin cole said 
without corrective measures cracks in the fuselage skin could 
result in rapid decompression of the airplane in flight officials 
said 
the faa issued an airworthiness directive friday for internal 
inspection of the fuselage skin lap joints and for repair of cracks 
as needed by july 15 for the 47 oldest boeing 727s with findings to 
be reported back to the agency 
the directive was distributed by telegram a method used in cases 
considered urgent 
the crack is a serious discovery and we responded to it in a 
serious way steven b wallace acting manager of the faas 
transport airplane directorate told kiro television 
inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the 
skin was made thicker on later models cole said he added that he

as the 1989 automotive model year begins its last 
three months analysts are wondering what manufacturers will do to 
get rid of inventories before the next model year gets under way in 
october 
its obvious that incentives arent working analyst kathleen 
heaney of nikko securities co international inc of new york said 
wednesday after automakers reported a 20 percent decline in vehicle 
sales last month compared with june 1988 
but the comparison was colored by strong sales last june that 
helped 1988 become the secondbest year in automotive history 
because june of 1988 was such an exceptionally strong sales 
month unfavorable yeartoyear comparisons were anticipated said 
ford motor co sales vice president robert rewey we continue to 
be encouraged by the underlying strength of the us economy 
consumer confidence remains strong buoyed by record employment 
levels and moderating inflation 
ford led the way in late march with a new incentive package that 
featured financing as low as 29 percent general motors corp and 
chrysler corp followed the move to new consumer enticements and 
since then the big three have expanded their programs 
but it appears that the incentives designed to spark car sales 
this spring and summer didnt do the trick 
the average sales rate among the eight automakers with us 
plants for the june 2130 period this year was 26811 vehicles a 
day down from a daily rate of 33495 during the same time last year 
among the big three chryslers car sales were off 286 percent 
gms were down 234 percent and fords declined 225 percent 
for the month with imported automakers figures included car 
and truck sales were down 114 percent going to a daily rate of 
49635 vehicles from a rate of 56032 during june of last year 
for the first half of 1989 sales of all domestic vehicles were 
off 68 percent with car sales falling 76 percent and truck sales 
declining 53 percent 
for months analysts have predicted a downturn in sales however 
automakers with some adjustments have kept up production meaning 
inventories have remained above usual levels 
its too late in the year for them to do anything other than to 
say gee the market is very weak and we have to get the cars out 
the door said analyst jeannette garretty of the bank of america 
in san francisco i think they are at a loss at what to do there 
there can only be more financing deals more rebates or giveaway 
option packages 
heaney agreed adding that the next few months as the model year 
begins to draw to a close will be worth watching 
i want to see what they are going to do what type of 
incentives are they going to use to clear out these 89 models she 
said 
added garretty although consumer confidence is holding up the 
message is clearly being sent that the economy is slowing down and 
thats got to be on peoples minds a bit 
something that is not showing up in the numbers directly is 
that holders of adjustablerate mortgages have seen a major increase 
in their payments and that has eaten at their pocketbook 
when it comes between the house and the car the house is going 
to win out

here are sales results for the eight major us 
automakers for third period of june 1989 
percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales 
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals there 
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days 
last year 
for the month there were 26 selling days this year and 26 
selling days last year and so far in 1989 153 selling days 
compared with 154 selling days last year 
cars and trucks made in the united states by honda nissan 
toyota mazda and mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in 
this table 
cars and trucks imported for sale under the gm ford and chrysler 
names are counted as foreign because of the independence day 
holiday some lowvolume imported car and truck makers said they 
would report sales thursday

retirees of wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 
will continue to receive payment of supplemental pension benefits 
under a federal court ruling 
us district judge paul simmons on wednesday approved a request 
to extend the payments which expired last month for 965 retirees 
the request was supported by the united steelworkers the company 
and its major bankruptcy creditors it was opposed by pension 
benefit guaranty corp 
at issue were monthly payments for 965 retirees and beneficiaries 
that have been paid for about 2 years under an agreement between 
the company and the pbgc the federally established insurer of 
private pension plans 
simmons agreed with union and company contentions that the 
elimination of the supplemental payments would cause severe and 
irreparable harm to retirees those payments average about 230 a 
month said company spokesman ray johnson 
wheelingpittsburgh and the union argued that not paying the 
benefits would damage labor relations at the company during a 
critical point in its bankruptcy reorganization efforts 
the pension issues and the labor issues are the last big hurdles 
to the steel companys emergence from chapter 11 protection of the 
bankruptcy court said peter shinevar an attorney for the union

japanese investment in hawaii real estate in the 
first six months of the year was down about 20 percent from the same 
period last year according to a study by a honolulu newspaper 
the honolulu advertiser reported wednesday that japanese 
investors bought or announced purchases of at least 809 million 
worth of hawaii real estate during the first six months of 1989 
that was down from more than 1 billion in property bought by 
japanese investors in the same period last year 
real estate experts and local economists have said foreign 
investment in the state was bound to decline considering the huge 
amount of money that has already been poured in here and because 
the japanese are being lured by perhaps more lucrative investments 
elsewhere 
since 1986 japanese investors spent more than 44 billion on 
hawaii real estate buying mostly luxury hotels golf courses 
office buildings shopping centers and residential homes 
the 1989 sixmonth figures showed most investment in that period 
went toward buying hotels and resorts the advertiser said 
the sales of two maui resorts accounted for nearly half the total 
investment in that period the wailea resort was sold for nearly 
200 million while the newlyopened embassy suites resorts at 
kaanapali fetched 1512 million 
however the advertiser study indicated that more japanese 
investors were acquiring raw land for development rather than 
buying existing assets 
thousands of acres of land have been purchased on the islands of 
hawaii maui and molokai it said

spalding sports worldwide has won a golf ball 
patent lawsuit against rival acushnet co that could have 
industrywide ramifications 
us district court judge edward harrington ruled that acushnet 
and its titleist division infringed on spaldings patent for a 
surlyn blend used in the companys top selling ball top flite 
the ruling wednesday could affect the rest of the golf ball 
industry because spaldings attorney george mcandrews said that 
the company intends to move ahead with patent lawsuits against 
virtually all the golf ball makers in the country 
spalding filed the lawsuit against acushnet in 1981 the two 
companies control about 80 percent of the golf ball market with 
spalding the leader 
mcandrews refused to tell the boston herald the amount of damages 
spalding would seek from acushnet but he did say that it would be 
a significant portion of acushnets profits on balls that 
infringed on spalding patents 
they had hundreds of millions of dollars in sales on those 
balls he said well now try to determine what portion of that 
was profit 
a spokesman for acushnet said the decision would not affect the 
companys daytoday operations 
were disputing the decision and well appeal it said wally 
uihlein president and chief executive officer of acushnets 
titleist division 
uihlein told the newspaper that the company stopped using the 
surlyn blend four years ago 
this decision has no effect on our daytoday operations he 
said we converted our balls in 1985 and converted again 
recently we maintain a pretty healthy balance sheet 
spalding has six similar infringement suits pending against six 
other golf ball companies mcgregor wilson hogan mclaughlin amp 
son cayman and exim the herald said those suits were reportedly 
on hold pending the outcome of the acushnet suit

armstrong world industries inc says it is 
going to court to head off a canadian family that has expressed an 
interest in acquiring the interior furnishing company 
armstrong said wednesday it was informed that the belzberg family 
of vancouver british columbia recently bought 985 percent of the 
companys outstanding stock for 181 million through two affiliates 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission july 3 
the belzbergs said they are considering making a proposal to acquire 
the lancaster pabased armstrong which had 1988 profits of 1627 
million on sales of 268 billion 
armstrong stock closed up 437 at 4787 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading wednesday it was the most actively 
traded issue wednesday with 1723100 shares changing hands 
armstrong said wednesday it was filing suit against the belzbergs 
in us district court seeking a judgment affirming the 
constitutionality of the states antitakeover laws and the validity 
of armstrongs shareholders rights plan 
one of the belzberg companies involved in the stock purchase said 
in the sec filing that it would file suit challenging the states 
antitakeover laws and seeking to prevent armstrong from 
implementing its employee stock ownership plan 
the esop unveiled june 20 would put 12 percent of the companys 
voting stock in employees hands 
belzberg spokesman john bowles declined to specify the belzbergs 
next move but he said they would seek regulatory clearance to 
acquire 50 percent or more of armstrong common stock 
william w adams armstrong chairman and president said in a 
statement wednesday that the company is not interested in selling 
and has refused to meet with belzberg representatives 
we have no interest in meeting with the belzbergs adams 
said the belzberg familys interest in armstrong has been 
discussed with our board several times 
based on a review of among other things the belzbergs past 
record and experiences to date the board concluded that no 
interests of any of the many groups closely associated with 
armstrong would be served by meeting with them 
in the sec filing the belzbergs said that if they acquired 
armstrong they intended to keep the companys floor coverings and 
building products segments while selling others including the 
furniture and industry products segments 
the floor coverings and building products segments accounted for 
a majority of the companys operating profit in 1988 
the belzbergs through their affiliate companies frequently have 
invested in publicly held companies their flagship company is first 
city financial corp of vancouver an investment and holding company 
which is 72 percent owned by the belzbergs 
the belzberg family is headed by three brothers hyman 63 
samuel 61 and william 56 the family originally was in the

the nuclear regulatory commission rejected a 
staff recommendation that protective containment shells on 24 
commercial nuclear power reactors be modified to lessen the risk of 
rupture in the event of a severe accident 
the commission said there was no need for a blanket requirement 
for the changes although it ordered a plantbyplant study of 
whether hard pipe vents should be added to the containment 
buildings known as mark i and made by general electric co 
the vents would relieve severe pressure that would build up if 
the reactor core were damaged a containment failure could lead to 
the release of dangerous amounts of radioactivity into the 
atmosphere 
antinuclear groups have urged the nrc to shut down plants with 
mark i containment buildings saying they pose too great a risk to 
public health and safety 
the nrc staff earlier this year recommended requiring the changes 
at all 24 plants about a quarter of the nations nuclear power 
stations 
the commission rejected that approach wednesday but said it 
would require the hard pipe vents at any plant deemed by nrc 
analysts to need them it said the casebycase approach should 
settle the question for all 24 plants within three years 
the 24 plants were selected because their containment buildings 
are believed to be more vulnerable to rupture during a severe 
reactor accident than other containment systems 
the commission also said it would approve vents at any plants 
that voluntarily chose to install them few are expected to do it 
voluntarily although boston edison cos pilgrim plant has done so 
as a further precaution the commission ordered its staff to 
speed up implementation of an existing nrc requirement that a mark i 
plant be capable of withstanding a total loss of electrical power 
without overheating the reactor 
kenneth boley a nuclear expert for the public citizen 
environmental group said the nrc was buying time for the 
nuclear industry by promising further study 
robert pollard a nuclear engineer with the union of concerned 
scientists today called the decision a big punt that creates 
the impression for the public that the nrc has done something when 
theyve actually done nothing 
plant owners generally opposed a blanket requirement for 
improvements to the mark i containment system saying they would not 
appreciably reduce the risk of rupture 
of the 24 reactors with mark i containments five are not 
operating they are philadelphia electric cos peach bottom no 3

the labor department is due to issue statistics friday on the

analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of about 
250000 in nonfarm payroll employment more than double the 101000 
preliminary increase reported for may 
but they also maintain that the june figure will be inflated by a 
quirk in the timing of surveys on which the data are based 
thus some argue the latest evidence may not deter the federal 
reserve from relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a 
slowdown in business activity

the canadian government will sell all its shares in 
air canada for 12 each john mcdermid minister of privatization 
announced wednesday 
the government plans to release a prospectus outlining the sale 
of 411 million shares of the stateowned airline or about 57 
percent of the outstanding shares 
the government began its sale of air canada last october when it 
sold 308 million shares or about 43 percent of the company for 8 
a share 
the sale will raise about 490 million which is expected to go 
to the government rather than the airline the 240 million in 
proceeds from the october sale went to paying air canadas debt 
there was a sixmonth period in which no sales were allowed of 
the government shares mcdermid said weve passed that now and 
the market conditions and the circumstances of air canada now permit 
the balance of shares to be sold 
the lead underwriter in the share issue rbc dominion securities 
recommended to the government wednesday what the share price should 
be and how many shares should be sold 
mcdermid said in an interview the 12ashare offering price 
represents a good return to the government although he had hinted 
in may that the price could be as high as 16 
air canada stock had been trading on the montreal and toronto 
exchanges at around 13 a share but closed wednesday before 
mcdermids announcement at 1225 
the price began to rise shortly after the stock was issued in 
october but it soared in january after pwa corp announced it was 
buying wardair that meant the number of canadian airline companies 
dropped from three to two and the reduced competition made air 
canada a darling of the financial community 
the carrier can operate in the private sector much better than 
in the public sector mcdermid said it will be allowed to 
compete on an open and free basis rather than having government 
dictate to it 
mcdermid said all shares have been committed to be purchased from 
the government by underwriters who in turn sell them to investors 
he said 33 million shares will be issued in canada and 8 million to 
foreigners 
octobers sale was restricted to canadians but foreign investors 
soon began to buy them from canadians willing to sell foreign 
investors are now edging toward the 25 percent ceiling on foreign 
ownership of a canadian airline 
mcdermid did not say when the sale will take place octobers 
sale occurred 2 weeks after the prospectus was issued

grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in 
active early trading today on the chicago board of trade as the 
markets cooled a bit following a powerful rally in the previous 
session 
wheat and oat futures were a little lower while corn and soybeans 
were mixed 
corn and soybean futures advanced by their permitted daily limits 
wednesday largely in reaction to forecasts for hot dry weather in 
the midwest through the middle of next week 
a new national weather service sixto10day outlook issued late 
wednesday predicted aboveaverage temperatures in the region for all 
of next week but it also suggested the corn belt could see more 
rain than traders had expected and that was a moderating influence 
in the early going 
extreme heat and dryness pose the greatest threat to the corn 
crop which is in the weathersensitive pollination stage 
prospects for spotty showers and cooler temperatures in spring 
wheat regions at the end of this week prompted some selling of wheat 
futures 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 402 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with july at 282 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 3 cents lower with july at 165 a bushel soybeans were 4 
cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 772 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 08 cent lower to 08 cent higher with august at 
7052 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 58 cent higher 
with august at 8082 cents a pound live hogs were unchanged to 45 
cent lower with july at 4670 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 25 cent to 175 cents lower with july at 3090 cents a pound

reports from the nations major retailers today showed uneven 
june results with sales at some big chains held back by weak 
consumer spending while department stores benefited from a 
continuing turnaround in womens apparel 
jeffrey edelman a retail analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
said industrywide sales were mixed with poorer tallies coming from 
nonclothing categories 
among the leading general merchandisers k mart corp the 
countrys second largest retailer after sears roebuck and co said 
its june sales represented an improvement after a string of 
disappointing months 
fastgrowing discounter walmart stores inc currently ranked 
third turned in another robust performance 
higher inflation and costlier instalment debt payments due to 
past interest rate increases have pinched consumers a spending 
slowdown has shown up mainly in purchases of bigticket items like 
cars and home appliances while outlays for less expensive 
merchandise havent been affected as much 
but edelman said the moderation in consumer spending the chief 
fuel for overall economic activity has more to do with the aging of 
the business cycle 
the consumer is still healthy still confident but i think a 
lot of demand has been satisfied said edelman i think the 
consumer is just tired and needs to rest a little bit 
industry analysts said general merchandise retailers results in 
june may have appeared a bit weaker than they actually were because 
they were being compared with one of 1988s better months by 
contrast results of apparel sellers may have looked better because 
last year was an exceptionally dismal one for fashion merchandising 
analysts typically look to the results of limited inc for signs 
of how the womens apparel business is doing 
limited posted an 11 percent rise in sales to 387 million in the 
five weeks ended july 1 from 3475 a year earlier besides its 
flagship womens clothing shops limited owns a number of other 
stores such as henri bendel victorias secret and abercrombie amp 
fitch 
sales at limiteds stores open at least a year rose 12 percent in 
june retailers and industry analysts say samestore or comparable 
store sales give a more accurate reading of a companys performance 
than totals that include sales at newly opened stores not every 
retailer reports samestore sales 
last months standouts included dayton hudson corp which said 
june sales rose 142 percent to 120 billion from 105 billion in 
june of 1988 and its samestore sales rose 61 percent the 
department store operator which also runs targets and mervyns 
stores reported strong gains in its apparel sales 
jc penney co also attributed its sales pickup to demand for 
summer fashions plus increased purchases of soft home furnishings 
like bedding and bath goods its june sales rose 76 percent to 
125 billion from 116 billion and samestore sales increased 56 
percent 
among the leading retailers reporting today were 
sears said its sales rose 29 percent to 32 billion in the five 
weeks ended july 1 from 311 billion a year earlier on a 
comparablestore basis sears sales increased 36 percent 
k marts sales rose 57 percent to 274 billion in the five 
weeks ended june 28 from 260 billion in the corresponding 1988 
period samestore sales went up 23 percent 
walmarts sales grew 25 percent to 203 billion in june from 
163 billion a year before and its samestore sales rose 10 
percent 
fw woolworth co said its domestic sales increased 82 percent 
in june to 439 million from the year agos 405 million and its 
samestore sales were up 36 percent 
the results reported today were from the biggest general 
merchandise chains and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail 
sales figures released by the federal government they do not 
include sales at auto dealers supermarkets or restaurants

two canadian government agencies said thursday they 
will not challenge the merger of brewing giants molson companies 
ltd and carling okeefe breweries of canada ltd 
under present market conditions the merger is not likely to 
raise concerns under the competition act in any area of canada other 
than alberta and quebec said calvin goldman director of the 
bureau of competition policy investment canada the agency that 
monitors and promotes foreign investment in canada also gave its 
blessing to the merger carling okeefe is owned by elders ixl ltd 
an australian conglomerate 
goldman didnt attach any conditions to the deal but said the 
bureau will monitor the brewing industry for three years 
particularly in the provinces of alberta and quebec the new 
company to be called molson breweries will have a total asset 
value of 15 billion canadian dollars or about 126 billion 
the merger announced in late january will create canadas 
largest brewing company and the sixth largest in north america once 
the deal is completed 
the new company will have annual sales of 23 billion canadian 
dollars or around 193 billion and a 52 percent share of the 
canadian beer market 
the deal also calls for 1400 jobs to be eliminated over three 
years as seven of the companies 16 breweries are closed both 
molson and carling okeefe are based in ontario 
john labatt ltd currently canadas no 1 brewer had called on 
goldman to force the new merged company to give up some of its 
brandname beers 
i will not hesitate to seek an appropriate remedial order if 
necessary from the competition tribunal should it subsequently be 
determined that the merger prevents or lessens competition 
substantially goldman said in a statement 
in announcing his decision goldman said the companies needed the 
merger to streamline their operations to compete with lowercost 
us brewing companies 
goldman said he has particular concern that molson breweries will 
have more than 50 percent market share in both alberta and quebec 
he said imported beer from the united states smaller independent 
breweries and the continuing strong presence of labatt should help 
maintain competition in those provinces 
goldman also said he is considering continuing talks to reduce 
interprovincial barriers to trade in beer which could increase 
competition 
the only major competitor after the merger would be labatt which 
now has a 42 percent market share 
molson and elders said in a joint statement that they welcome the 
decision to allow the merger to proceed 
the partnership will produce a stronger canadianbased brewer 
making it more efficient and thus positioning it to meet increased 
international competition the companies said

the government today ordered a ban on almost 
all uses of asbestos ending a decadelong debate over the health 
risk posed by the cancercausing substance in such items as brake 
linings and water pipes 
the regulatory action which will end the manufacture of most 
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years will 
not affect asbestos products already in use officials said 
replacing some of those products might be more hazardous than a 
gradual phaseout 
this is pollution prevention were eliminating a known 
cancercausing substance from the marketplace declared epa 
administrator william reilly he said despite government attempts to 
curb asbestos emissions the fibers continue to pose a significant 
risk to current and future populations 
reilly said the cost of getting asbestos out of most products 
would be minimal because safer alternative products are available 
the epa estimated the regulation would cost society 459 million 
over 13 years 
the regulatory action does not affect ongoing efforts to rid 
buildings including hundreds of schools of asbestos insulation 
reilly said such efforts should continue under careful control to 
minimize exposure 
under the new ban the epa will allow asbestos to be a component 
in only a small number of items such as guided missile liners 
acetylene cylinders and some types of sealant tape and packaging 
but the ban by 1997 will cover an estimated 94 percent by volume 
of all asbestos used in a variety of products currently 
manufactured the agency said 
among those products are automobile brake pads and linings 
cement water distribution pipes roofing shingles floor and pipe 
wrapping asbestos millboard gaskets and other construction 
products 
because asbestos has been singled out as a cause of lung cancer 
its use has been restricted in recent years loosely formed asbestos 
insulation for buildings and pipes no longer is used and asbestos 
emissions into the air are regulated 
school officials across the country have been directed to inspect 
for asbestos and develop plans to eliminate it from school buildings 
but asbestos continues to be used in various forms for a wide 
variety of products as recently as 1987 it was estimated that 
85000 tons of asbestos went into hundreds of products annually 
three years earlier the estimates were 240000 tons a year 
asbestos is part of the nations water system with an estimated 
400000 miles of concreteasbestos piping carrying drinking water to 
thousands of communities most automobile and truck brake linings 
and pads are made of asbestos because the product is strong and 
relatively inexpensive 
its use has continued although scientists have known for years 
that asbestos fibers when inhaled can cause lung cancer and other 
lung disorders that may not show up for decades 
but while there is widespread agreement about the health risks 
from loosely packed asbestos found in building insulation or from 
highlevels of certain occupational exposure the risks posed from 
its other uses has been debated for nearly a decade 
the government first considered a ban on asbestos use in 1979 
but epa attempts to propose a regulation covering a wide variety 
of asbestos products were stymied in the reagan administration 
because of strong opposition from the office of management and 
budget finally in 1986 the epa proposed a ban covering a variety of 
asbestos products 
the final epa rule does not affect products already in use such 
as asbestos brake pads in many cars and trucks now on the road or 
the thousands of miles of cementasbestos water distribution pipes 
found in many parts of the country 
however the ban covers 
a variety of felt products for roofing flooring and pipe wrap 
as well as construction sheet products beginning next year 
automobile and small truck brake linings disc brake pads 
clutches and automatic transmission components in all new cars 
beginning in 1994 
cement water distribution pipes in used auto and truck 
replacement parts and repairs roof shingles and paper products 
beginning in 1997 
the expected regulatory action was praised by environmentalists 
even in advance of its release 
this is the first time since 1980 that the epa has done a major 
industrywide ban on a particular toxic substance said jacqueline 
warren an attorney for the natural resources defense council 
she said the action represents a change in focus from trying to 
control emissions of certain toxic substances to halting their use 
this is a new approach pollution prevention she said in an 
interview 
in 1980 the epa directed a ban on pcbs at the insistence of 
congress

nestles carnation co has agreed to pay 
90000 to nine states to settle allegations it used misleading and 
deceptive advertising to promote a new infant formula attorney 
general don hanaway said thursday 
under the settlement carnation will pay each state 10000 and 
halt advertising claims that its good start ha baby fomula is 
hypoallergenic hanaway said 
the states include wisconsin california illinois iowa 
massachusetts minnesota missouri new york and texas 
tim f crull president and chief executive officer of carnation 
co said the claims by the attorneys general were not supported by 
the facts but that carnation agreed to the settlement to avoid a 
costly lengthy court case 
we first used the term hypoallergenic to accurately and 
concisely describe good start ha and its attributes crull said 
in a statement as soon as we became aware however that there 
was a potential for confusion over the meaning of hypoallergenicity 
carnation promptly and voluntarily removed the term from the good 
start ha label and other references to the product 
hanaway said an investigation by the attorneys general found 
carnation claimed the formula could not cause an allergic reaction 
in infants who had problems with other formulas or a milk allergy 
hanaway said the attorneys general became aware of medical 
reports on a number of infants who suffered allergic reactions 
including shock from using good start 
the settlement prohibits carnation from using the word 
hypoallergenic in promoting the product and claiming it cannot 
cause allergic reactions

boyd l jefferies who admitted to an illegal 
stock scheme with inside trader ivan boesky was spared a jail term 
thursday by a federal judge who praised his cooperation but called 
wall street greed absurd and probably obscene 
us district judge morris lasker sentenced jefferies to five 
years probation and fined him 250000 jefferies who pleaded 
guilty to two felonies provided information and testimony in the 
governments continuing securities fraud investigations in exchange 
for leniency 
jefferies 58 had faced a maximum 10 years in jail and 500000 
fine 
mr jefferies has by now earned his way through agony and 
effort to a suspended sentence lasker told a packed room at us 
district court in manhattan 
but lasker added a message he addressed to the financial 
community 
it is absurb and probably obscene for any person so engaged to 
undertake acts which will possibly bring him greater riches he 
said this country is beginning to awake i hope however to the 
morally corrupting effect of thinking of oneself only 
jefferies was fined 125000 on each of two counts for helping 
boesky conceal the true ownership of 56 million in stock in 1985 
and scheming with speculator salim b sandy lewis to manipulate 
the stock price of firemans fund corp in 1986 
i want to apologize to the court to apologize to the 
government to apologize to my friends and family who have given me 
so much support jefferies told the court his voice cracking 
in his 1987 plea deal jefferies also resigned from the los 
angeles brokerage he founded in 1962 and was banished from the 
securities business for at least five years the soonest he can 
reapply for a securities license is july 1992 
while stating he believed jefferies was aware he was breaking the 
law lasker noted that jefferies was not charged with trading on 
inside information and did not personally profit from the deals 
he said he also received letters which have really hit my heart 
and made me feel there is no question that you are a good man 
jefferies has provided the government with information leading to 
three indictments and one conviction he testified earlier this year 
that he helped gaf corp manipulate the price of union carbide corp 
stock although that case twice ended in a mistrial 
he also told a jury he illegally held stock for florida investor 
paul a bilzerian who was convicted last month in the first trial 
success of the governments threeyear securities fraud crackdown 
jefferies is to testify at the third gaf trial and the trial of 
lewis both scheduled to begin in the fall 
us attorney benito romano praised jefferies cooperation with 
the government including his testimony 37 meetings with 
prosecutors repeated trips across country and identification of 
documents 
mr jefferies cooperation has made a significant contribution 
to the governments effort to expose punish and deter conduct which 
we believe mr jefferies acknowledges undermines the integrity of 
the securities markets romano said 
he added jefferies efforts deserved substantial appropriate 
credit the government did not issue a presentencing 
recommendation 
lasker had sentenced boesky who implicated jefferies to three 
years in prison in 1987 boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count 
and paid 100 million to settle insider trading charges with the 
government 
experts said jefferies suspended sentence would be regarded as a 
slap on the wrist on wall street based on the boesky sentence 
defense lawyers and legal scholars had expected jefferies to receive 
less but some jail time 
i think it will send a message that if you are willing to pay 
the price in dollars and incriminating other people you can go back 
home said alan bromberg a securities law professor at southern 
methodist university 
after sentencing jefferies tanned and smoking a cigarette told 
reporters he had been prepared for some jail time 
i was expecting much worse he said i think judge lasker 
weighed the negatives and all the positives and i think ive really 
done a lot for the industry 
jefferies established his los angelesbased jefferies amp co 
brokerage firm 25 years ago and worked 16hour days making 
multimillionshare transactions for some of wall streets most 
important he said he would like to return to the brokerage business 
when he is permitted 
jefferies is now living in aspen colo where he runs a golf 
clinic for underprivileged children he also works with two other 
youth programs one of which was formed after his only son died in a 
car crash

coffee drinkers could be the winners of a 
possible marketing war among roasters following this weeks 
suspension of coffee bean export quotas analysts say 
the international coffee organizations decision to suspend 
quotas will enable smaller coffee producing countries severely 
restricted under the quota system to export highquality coffee 
beans to willing us customers observers say 
it also could mean lower retail prices by years end 
the agreement had put the american roaster into a strait 
jacket said bert ruiz a vice president with the new york 
brokerage firm balfour maclaine corp they were restricted in the 
types of coffee they could buy because under the agreement 
now roasters are going to go into a very strong marketing war 
to buy the best coffees they can for once in a very long time 
product will determine price 
procter amp gamble co maker of folgers coffee says it is one 
customer that will take advantage of a more open system 
the suspension of quotas does permit us wider access to a 
variety of coffee beans from all the different producing nations 
said company spokesman william dobson 
as a roaster our access to those beans were limited to the 
quotas so if we saw a trend to a particular type of coffee taste we 
might not be able to get a supply of beans to meet the preference 
now without the quotas that will change 
chock full onuts corp spokesman joseph breslin says quality 
coffee had been going to countries that were not part of the 
international agreement while member nations were losing out the 
quotas restricted exports only among ico nations 
there has been a lack of quality coffee in the united states 
we had not been getting access to quality coffee because producing 
nations were going to communist countries and selling it to them 
breslin said 
now there probably will be more quality coffee available to the 
rest of the united states than there has been in the last several 
years 
coffee drinkers also may be in for dramatically lower retail 
prices analysts predicted wednesday that supermarket prices could 
decline by more than 40 cents a pound by the end of the year 
some of the price cuts may come as special discounts on 
particular brands and higher centsoff manufacturers coupons 
we could see prices translating from wholesale to retail in one 
to two months sooner than usual said kim badenhop an analyst 
with merrill lynch capital markets inc unless the middlemen are 
going to fatten their profit along the way wholesalers should be 
able to pass along cuts of 40 to 45 cents 
the ico announced monday it would suspend export ceilings after 
member nations rejected proposals to extend the existing coffee 
pact the decision by the 74nation organization of coffee consumer 
and producernations took effect at midnight tuesday 
the decision essentially eliminates artificial supply conditions 
imposed by the ico to keep producer prices at 120 to 140 per 
pound and creates a more open market the coffee group established 
in 1963 has attempted to stabilize world coffee prices by limiting 
the sale of green or unroasted coffee beans by producers 
retail coffee prices had climbed an average of 43 cents a pound 
or about 16 percent from may 1988 to may 1989 or from 273 cents 
per pound of ground roast to 316 a pound according to the bureau 
of labor statistics 
procter amp gambles dobson said that while prices might decline 
the cuts may not match the recent drop in wholesale prices which 
tumbled more than 40 cents in june 
we would expect if things stabilize to see the price of some 
raw coffees declining but we wouldnt necessarily see a direct 
passthrough from producers to consumers because of depressed 
profit margins over the years said spokesman william dobson 
cliff sessions a spokesman for general foods which makes 
maxwell house and sanka coffees said we do not expect an 
immediate change in prices sessions said the company still had to 
move a substantial amount of inventory purchased at higher prices 
breslin said quota suspension could benefit more than just the 
consumer 
if wholesale prices remain low enough retail coffee prices 
will go down if they stay down then consumption will go up he 
said

real estate magnate donald j trump who usually 
enjoys seeing his name on things is in a legal battle with a small 
georgia company over trump cards snazzy business cards the 
billionaire says infringe on his name 
positive concepts ltd the lithia springs company that makes the 
cards contends it got the name from the term used for a suit in a 
card game that ranks above all others the companys lawyers say the 
case has escalated into a battle over the limits of money and power 
donald trump simply wants to own the word trump and anybody 
who wants anything to do with it will have to face donald trump 
said atlanta attorney kevin l ward we cant give up a word in 
the english language just because somebody has the power and money 
to do so 
but trumps attorneys say their clients name has become so well 
known that consumers are going to be confused into thinking the 
cards are backed by the businessman 
last month trump won a federal court order temporarily barring 
washingtonbased international trading and finance corp ltd from 
using the name trump shuttle for a moving and storage subsidiary 
in new york 
trump renamed eastern airlines washingtontonew yorktoboston 
air shuttle the trump shuttle after purchasing the service for 
365 million earlier this year 
attorneys now are compiling depositions for the business card 
case which ultimately will be considered by the federal trademark 
and patent board in washington 
at issue is pcls line of business cards which feature a 
photograph of the holder the suburban atlanta company has been 
making and distributing the cards since 1982 and currently has 
sales of about 2 million 
company president edward a zito said he adopted the name from a 
california company that also made the cards under the name trump 
cards zito said the california company went out of business in 
1982 and never obtained a trademark 
zito said he was unfamiliar with donald trump at the time zito 
does not play cards but said he decided to stick with the trump 
name after looking it up in a dictionary and deciding it was 
appropriate for the product 
pcl applied for a trademark registration in 1985 and trumps 
attorneys filed a notice of opposition after the government 
published the request in 1988 
in a written notice trumps attorneys alleged that pcl chose the 
trump cards name to benefit from the worldwide fame 
distribution and glamour of donald j trump and his trump name 
trumps attorneys also argued the business cards would dilute 
the value of his name as examples of the wide use of the trump 
name they cited the trump parc condominiums in new york the trump 
tower office building in new york the trump castle casino in 
atlantic city nj and the trump plaza in west palm beach fla 
a credittype card called a trump card is used by patrons of 
the casino attorneys said 
i think the fact is if you ask people when you hear the word 
trump who do they think of people associate it with donald trump 
said james david jacobs trumps attorney in new york 
pcl attorney ward however said we maintain the idea that a 
trump card is associated with a winning playing card that was here 
long before donald trump was on the scene can donald trump buy the 
word trump 
donald trump wasnt a national figure when i got involved in 
business cards zito said i hadnt heard of him anyway the 
first i heard of him was when trumps football team the new jersey 
generals recruited herschel walker in 1983

in order to chart the course of the 
fastgrowing personal computer mapping industry well youd need 
a map 
but one thing is clear even in the digital mapping maze the 
personal computer mapping industry is a multimilliondollar business 
companies are clamoring to stake their claim in the growing 
market which is beginning to attract the interest and dollars of 
such major investors as communications mogul rupert murdoch who 
this year bought a west coast mapping firm 
the business centers on software and hardware that allows 
companies to integrate their own databases with maps they buy or to 
create maps of their own software is available for less than 1000 
mapping has been around for 20 years really but the people 
involved have been in forestry land management utilities not 
profitmaking organizations said lisa thorell formerly a mapping 
industry analyst with dataquest in san jose calif with people 
moving mapping products to the pcs the whole scene has changed 
the applications are many because any company that has 
information or assets that are geographically dispersed can utilize 
a map especially if its displayed on a desktop computer and 
seeing information displayed geographically illustrates patterns 
that may not be obvious from pie charts or rows and columns of 
numbers 
thats why one san francisco outreach program now uses computer 
mapping to help fight the spread of aids 
we keep track of a wide variety of very detailed information 
about our client contacts including ethnic and sexual breakdowns 
and were keeping track of the amounts of condoms bleach and 
other diseasefighting agents were putting out on the streets and 
where said eric margolis director of research for youth 
environment study 
the information is then mapped allowing the programs workers to 
see the aids patterns each month and target their efforts 
other possible uses might be by travel agents and auto clubs for 
planning trips by clients or by any business wanting to map and 
analyze sales 
the industry is limited principally by the amount of money 
people have to buy this stuff thorell said 
people with money in the commercial and financial area are very 
interested in seeing their data in map formats 
there are more than 50 computer mapping systems on the market 
ranging from multimilliondollar systems to cheaper personal 
computerbased programs according to h dennison parker publisher 
of the trade publication gis world based in fort collins colo 
personal computer mapping is only a small portion of gis or 
geographic information systems technology that stores overlays 
and displays geographic and other types of data while the simplest 
pc software can display information the more elaborate gis systems 
have sophisticated analytical capabilities 
dataquest reports that the entire computer mapping industry was 
valued at 592 million worldwide for 1988 of which 58 million was 
personal computer software and hardware by 1992 dataquest projects 
the overall market will grow to 948 million of which 222 million 
will be the personal computer market segment 
other mapping industry observers think the business is even 
bigger and may grow even faster than that 
michael sena president of matrix consultants in boston 
estimates the mapping market totaled 750 million in 1988 and will 
expand to between 35 billion and 5 billion by 1992 sena 
estimates that pcbased software and services may account for up to 
30 percent of that market 
industry figures differ because they depend on how related 
products and services are divided up but the consensus is that the 
business is on an upswing 
i think that the industry is going to grow for another five to 
10 years easily the applications for mapping software are just 
as broad as for desktop publishing said stephen poizner 
president of strategic locations planning in san jose calif 
the 1990 census will provide an even greater boost to the whole 
desktop mapping industry poizner said because of the wealth of 
information that will become available when it is released 
charles hart president and chief executive officer of etak 
inc based in menlo park calif agreed there was a strong 
parallel between desktop mapping and desktop publishing which made 
computer publishing more accessible and sparked a boom in that 
business 
etak began in 1983 as a company geared toward invehicle 
navigation systems for cars it has since entered and now emphasizes 
fleet management systems and geographical data systems which 
include digital map databases 
etak is regarded as a leader in map digitizing that is taking 
existing maps and converting the information for computer use 
its a new emerging market people dont know what to make of 
it hart said 
earlier this year murdoch purchased etak for an undisclosed 
price said to be more than 30 million 
this is the first time a major player has gotten involved in 
the mapping industry hart said 
murdoch planned to utilize etaks extensive map database in 
projects like a worldwide reservation system hart said

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
thursday on the chicago board of trade amid conflicting weather 
forecasts for the midwestern corn and soybean country 
theres supposed to be a minor cooldown before it heats up 
again in a couple days and there could be some sporadic showers but 
it depends which forecaster you talk to said ted mao a grain 
specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
its just a very nervous weather market he said 
the day of active but unfocused trading followed a powerful rally 
in wednesdays session the markets failure to build upon 
wednesdays gains which were based on forecasts for hot dry 
weather in the corn belt next week also was blamed for its 
uncertain performance on thursday 
the corn market is especially sensitive to weather forecasts 
because the midwestern corn crop has entered its pollination phase 
a sensitive period when hot dry conditions pose a particular threat 
at the close of trading wheat was 3 cents lower to 4 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 408 a bushel 
corn was 2 cents lower to 6 cents higher with july at 281 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with july at 163 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 
771 a bushel

jo ann smith is a beef person she grew up on 
it and remains a great fan of the standing rib roast she was the 
first woman ever to head the national cattlemens association she 
is a fifthgeneration cattle raiser 
now she regulates the industry she once promoted but she rejects 
the idea that as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing 
and inspection services she might someday have to choose between 
her loyalties to beef and her responsibilities to government 
meat has been topic a all her life her husband cedric also 
comes from a cattlemans heritage both she and her husband come 
from families that have raised cattle for generations she is no 
stranger to blue jeans and hard work 
while she had to separate herself from the operation to accept 
the 80700 presidential appointment earlier this year her husband 
and son still run a 500head 4500acre ranch near wacahoota fla 
she was an equal partner i always knew what cedric was paying 
for corn she once told an interviewer 
she was a conservative democrat she underscores the 
conservative until 1988 when she campaigned for president 
bush she ran twice for the florida legislature as a democrat but 
lost both races 
then mrs smith 50 became involved in beef politics as head of 
the cattlemens association one of the most powerful agricultural 
lobbies she helped drag a reluctant industry toward feeding and 
breeding changes that produced leaner meat but it was a struggle 
we were very slow to respond she says you could see the 
train coming 
i really do enjoy beef she says and usually eats it once a 
day 
i am not a great lover of fishfish she says she has come 
to accept it but wont cook it too messy shell eat it when 
cedric cooks it which she says he does well 
her new job puts her in the midst of a dozen arguments including 
controversies over meat inspections the reagan administration 
wanted the industry to do more and the government less and over 
americas consumption of red meat 
the health side of government says americans eat too much of it 
the national academy of sciences in a study that came out last 
march concluded in the most comprehensive evaluation ever of the 
effects of diet on health that this country consumes too much fat 
and gets too much of it from meat 
the study advised eating lean meat in smaller and fewer 
portions 
no i dont think we consume too much mrs smith said in an 
interview last week 
she said the beef industry already has addressed the fat issue by 
putting leaner beef on the market 
were producing a product that does not have the fat it once 
did she said we recognized that it was the fat that was the 
culprit not the product and we have addressed that in genetics and 
breeding you can buy lean meat 
at the same time mrs smith endorsed labeling the fat content of 
meat a position that could raise hackles among cattlemen 
labeling has certain strong advantages she said the 
consumer wants to know the only way theyre going to know is to be 
able to read something that says this is what the product has in 
it 
it is a sensitive issue anne winslow director of nutrition 
policy for mrs smiths old organization the 35000member 
cattlemens association said it will be discussed at the groups 
meeting in columbus ohio this month 
proud producers might view the issue as a positive opportunity 
to highlight the nutritional density of the product beef said 
ms winslow adding that her own recommendation will be for labels 
that show how much fat remains after cooking after fat has been 
trimmed and drained away she said the stress on fat has turned 
attention away from the high iron zinc and vitamin b12 contents of 
beef 
mrs smiths prolabel stand and her support for federal 
inspection of seafood an issue on which the agriculture department 
has yet to take a stand wins applause from the evervigilant 
consumer movement 
for an industry person shes more of an activist than youd 
expect says ellen haas of public voice for food and health 
policy she has an understanding about what can be done she has 
been out front on fish inspection 
but on some other food issues in her domain mrs smith tends 
toward caution 
she is waiting for more study to be conducted before taking a 
stand on whether meat producers who give their cattle no hormones or 
other growthenhancing drugs should be able to label their product 
organic or natural 
some cattlemen who have been using a natural label and who 
have found a market among healthconscious consumers say the 
government has been trying to get them to drop the label 
mrs smith said her discomfort with the label is that we have 
never defined natural remember that every animal in order to be 
bred has hormone in it the problem that has arisen is does the 
consumer understand this you want to know that your label is 
truthful 
on veal issues mrs smith dodged questions saying she wasnt 
familiar with them the center for science in the public interest 
and other consumer groups contend that the way some veal calves are 
raised kept in dark pens so small the calf cant turn around and 
fed only a liquid diet to keep the meat lightcolored are inhumane 
high residues of antibiotics have been found in veal the 
centers dan howell told a congressional subcommittee on june 6 
mrs smith said she knows nothing about raising veal calves and will 
have to do her homework on that

sagging consumer demand and swollen inventories 
may have automakers looking at endofthemodelyear fire sales or 
further production cutbacks accompanied by layoffs industry 
analysts said thursday 
domestic automakers which assemble more than threefourths of 
the vehicles sold in the united states reported wednesday that car 
and light truck sales for the first half of 1989 were down 48 
percent from the same period last year 
that bolstered what analysts have been saying for months 
automakers have been making too many vehicles while demand was 
weaker than anticipated slower sales plus excessive production add 
up to bloated inventories 
estimates vary but industry watchers say automakers have new car 
supplies as high as 80 days at the current selling rate because 
supplies should be between 60 and 70 days something has to spur 
newcar sales or to slow inventory growth during the rest of the 
year 
the industry is going to be very hard pressed to turn the 
spigot on for the third quarter auto analyst john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co of new york said thursday youve got the 
greatest levels of incentives out there and they dont seem to be 
generating the interest 
the combination of buyer incentives in effect since april 
including cutrate financing or cash rebates on everything from 
subcompacts to luxury models and high inventories should have 
lured consumers into showrooms but that has not been happening 
furthermore increased cashback incentives or lower cutrate 
financing do not appear to be the breeze to fan a sales fire said 
bill meier general manager of ray green chevrolet in jacksonville 
ill 
its been slow and its beginning to taper off he said 
thursday i was here in 79 and 80 and it was bad back then 
well come around 
in the short run times may be getting tougher for the 
automakers their dealers and their factory workers one way to fix 
inventory problems is production cuts and that means layoffs 
i think there will be some its just a question of degree 
said analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc of new york 
im looking for some significant cutbacks 
a united auto workers spokesman who declined to be identified 
said the union was watching sales and production figures closely to 
ensure that any production cuts and layoffs are warranted under 
contracts with automakers 
during the past few months automakers have been selectively 
shutting down production at plants making a variety of cars the 
closings have been relatively brief mostly lasting for a week or 
two 
in the next few months plants will close for vacations and to be 
retooled for the 1990 models a process that usually takes two 
weeks this week and next ford motor co has scheduled no 
production at any of its assembly plants 
on thursday wards automotive reports said domestic automakers 
production levels were sharply lower during the week this year than 
a year ago the trade journal said automakers scheduled the 
production of 71167 cars and trucks in the united states during the 
week this year 426 percent lower than the 124029 vehicles they 
produced during the same week last year

all three key measures of the nations money 
supply rose in the week ended june 26 the federal reserve board 
reported thursday 
the fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose 
16 billion to a seasonally adjusted 7697 billion from 7681 
billion the previous week 
the central bank said the measure known as m2 rose 29 billion 
to a seasonally adjusted 30946 billion from 30917 billion the 
previous week 
an even broader measure m3 rose 400 million to a seasonally 
adjusted 39782 billion from 39778 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 
percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since early 
1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 30822 billion a 13

retreat grains and soybeans were mixed and precious metals were 
mixed

the selloff erased all of wednesdays gains and deepened the 
markets anxiety stemming from the suspension of coffee export 
quotas monday by the international coffee organization 
some analysts believe the lifting of quotas the result of 
longrunning discord among the 74 coffeeproducing and consuming 
nations that make up the organization will result in a flood of 
highquality coffees that had been withheld from the market in a bid 
to stabilize prices 
coffee futures had rallied wednesday on expectations for a freeze 
in brazil the worlds largest coffee producer 
but frost touched only a few areas skirting the main producing 
regions altogether said esther eskenasy an analyst with cargill 
investor services inc in new york

above 98 cents a pound but dried up at lower levels 
most of the offers to sell coffee futures below 98 cents a pound 
came from european traders who expect the availability of raw 
coffee to balloon in the near future 
i think the market will continue to be under pressure because 
of all these supplies that they have not been able to sell due to 
the quotas ms eskenasy said 
sugar futures lengthened their steep slide on the coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange analysts said the market was correcting from an 
overbought condition after making strong gains in midjune

a favorable court ruling has prompted 
spalding worldwide sports inc to seek millions of dollars in 
damages from competitors that it says have illegally copied its 
patented golf ball covering 
spalding the nations biggest golf ball maker filed suits 
against three other major golf ball manufacturers immediately after 
a judge on wednesday upheld its patent infringment claim against 
rival acushnet co robert k adikes spaldings general counsel 
said thursday 
at issue in the case was a golf ball covering spalding had 
patented and which the company claims is illegally used by 95 
percent of the industry 
spalding which filed suit against acushnet in 1981 has pending 
suits against macgregor sporting goods inc and wilson sporting 
goods co another golf ball maker ram settled for an undisclosed 
sum in 1986 
wally uihlein president and chief executive officer of acushnet 
said the company planned to appeal us district judge edward f 
harringtons decision 
its a very very complex patent issue uihlein said its 
a classic case where somebody may look at a glass of water and see 
it as half full and someone else might look at it as half empty 
acushnet agreed to stop using the disputed process on its golf 
balls in 1986 pending the outcome of spaldings suit 
adikes declined to say how much spalding would seek in damages at 
a separate hearing to be scheduled following acushnets appeal 
however he estimated that the interest charges alone would reach 
into the millions of dollars 
spalding which makes topflite balls and acushnet which 
markets the titleist line control about 80 percent of the 500 
millionayear golf ball market 
adikes said the only manufacturers not now using the spalding 
process are achusnet and ram 
robert molitor spaldings vice president for research developed 
the method of coating golf balls with a blend of plastic surlyn 
resins in 1971 
originally our aim was to make the ball more durable and 
resistent to cracking in the cold said tom mayer director of 
marketing for spalding it did that but then we discovered it 
also added increased distance and we immediately patented it 
spaldings 17year patent issued in 1974 expires in 1991 
no one could find anything that worked as well so everyone else 
started copying the process in the 1980s he said

said thursday 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate rules committee 
and rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house

the general services administraton awarded that business 
potentially worth 25 billion over ten years to atampt and us

the government ban on almost all uses of 
asbestos came as no surprise to auto manufacturers who already had 
been phasing out the cancercausing substance industry officials 
said thursday 
we have known that we should be eliminating asbestos from 
various parts of our products fred bowditch vice president for 
technical affairs at the motor vehicle manufacturers association of 
the united states said from the organizations office in detroit 
new regulations announced by environmental protection agency 
administrator william reilly will end the manufacture of most 
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years 
among the items covered by the ban are automobile and small truck 
brake linings disc brake pads clutches and automatic transmission 
components with that ban scheduled to begin in 1993 for 1994 models 
the epa rule does not affect products already in use 
some auto manufacturers have replaced the asbestos disc brakes in 
the front of many vehicles with kevlar a synthetic fabric used with 
resin or some type of metallic fiber industry officials said 
they are still in the process of phasing out asbestos in the rear 
drum brakes 
twentyfive percent of our cars are asbestos free in the rear 
brakes and more than half of the trucks said toni simonetti a 
spokeswoman for general motors corp which introduced asbestosfree 
front brakes during the 1970s 
ben dunn engineering and design public relations manager for 
chrysler said the company has proceeded cautiously because brakes 
are one of the most critical systems on a vehicle and consumer 
expectations remain high 
replacing asbestos is difficult because substitute materials 
cant be used across the board as manufacturers have been able to do 
with asbestos 
the bottom line is were working as fast as we can to get 
there dunn said 
brake producers have long expected the ban and are gradually 
replacing asbestos with other products said james murray president 
of nuturn corp of nashville tenn asbestos is used in only about 
25 percent of the companys products he said 
if asbestos was banned tomorrow we would continue to produce a 
product he said it could be converted overnight 
ilene industries of shelbyville tenn no longer uses asbestos 
to manufacture brake linings and industrial gaskets and this week 
the company is removing its remaining stock of asbestos sheet 
packing from its storeroom vice president ray smith said 
whether the switch from asbestos to other materials translates 
into sticker shock for some consumers remains an open question among 
industry officials 
although he did not have precise figures bowditch said he did 
not believe the change would mean much steeper prices 
however ms simonetti without providing exact figures said the 
substitute material is relatively more expensive 
reaction to the ban from other organizations was mixed 
im pleased to see epa has taken some action since that law has 
been in effect since 1976 and little has been done said peggy 
seminario associate director of the occupation safety and health 
department of the aflcio 
seminario expressed the hope that the epa will strictly regulate 
the asbestos substitutes used by manufacturers they may pose 
significant hazards as well she said 
dr sidney wolfe of public citizen consumer activist ralph 
naders organization said the ban is too far in the future 
forcing americans to live with a material that the scientific 
community has already labeled as dangerous 
karen florini an attorney for the environmental defense fund 
said her organization was encouraged by the epas action 
finally epa is preventing asbestos pollution by requiring 
people to switch to less dangerous materials florini said by 
banning asbestos products epa has stopped the entire cycle of 
asbestos exposures from mining to processing and from distribution 
to disposal 
but ellen silbergeld a toxicologist with the environmental 
defense fund said the ban was long overdue 
asbestos has left a wake of disease and death around the world 
due to piecemeal regulations that have failed to prevent its 
hazards she said 
the white lung association a group that represents asbestos 
victims said it fully supports the epa ban but said the agency 
is not going far enough the group said the epa should also require 
a recall of asbestos products in use and increase federal funds for 
asbestos removal from buildings 
jacqueline warren a lawyer for the natural resources defense 
council questioned why the epa is not requiring a faster phasein 
of the ban especially as it applies to brake parts where 
substitutes already are available
