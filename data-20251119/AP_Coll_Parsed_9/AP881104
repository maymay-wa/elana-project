congress never intended for the savings and loan 
industry to pay for the extraordinary losses now being generated by 
insolvent sampls the industrys top federal regulator says 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
urged congress to delve into the history of the deposit insurance 
system before deciding whether or not to spend taxpayer dollars to 
rescue the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
guarantees sampl deposits up to 100000 
wall told the us league of savings institutions on thursday 
that congress in setting up the deposit insurance system set the 
premiums charged to financial institutions high enough to cover only 
normal losses not catastrophic losses 
an actuarial study at the time showed that to cover all future 
losses premiums would have had to have been set nearly four times 
higher than they were originally wall said 
some of walls listeners concluded he was implying that congress 
should help the industry pay the bill but wall said im not 
taking that step 
im not saying what the solution is at this point im just 
trying to set a historical basis he said promising to present 
the bank boards recommendations after the election 
regulators estimate it will cost 45 billion to 50 billion to 
cover the industrys red ink 
the new chairman of the league br beeksma said healthy sampls 
cant bear the cost of bailing out their insurance fund without 
falling into insolvency themselves 
deregulation promoted by the reagan administration and sought by 
the industry allowed many sampls in the early 1980s to raise interest 
rates offered to depositors and venture into new kinds of loan 
arrangements but many underwrote highly speculative and ultimately 
disastrous loans often in real estate and as of midyear 497 of the 
nations 3048 sampls were listed as insolvent another 408 were 
solvent but losing money 
now the industry that fought so hard for deregulation in the 
early 1980s says government should have regulated it more and it is 
calling for a return to many of the controls of the past 
beeksma as part of what he called the industrys neveragain 
agenda said sampls will accept a clampdown on the kinds of lax 
regulation that contributed to the red ink 
i can promise you that the us league will be vigorous in its 
pursuit of tighter regulation and supervision he said 
beeksma chairman of interwest savings bank in oak harbor wash 
replaces theo h pitt jr a north carolina thrift executive who 
served as league chairman for the past year 
the trade group also appointed frederick l webber as its new 
president the top staff position webber is a former assistant 
secretary of the treasury in the ford administration and former 
white house aide under richard nixon he most recently was president 
of the national soft drink association 
he replaces william b oconnell who has held the post since 
1979 
oconnell in his outgoing address warned the sampl executives 
against a division that seems to be developing over the resolution 
of the problems of the fslic 
oconnell said after the speech he was referring to tension 
between healthy and struggling sampls some healthier sampls are trying 
to leave the fslic and join the commercial bank insurance fund the 
federal deposit insurance corp which charges lower premiums 
ailing institutions that cant qualify for fdic membership resent 
that

poverty among hispanics has risen at a faster 
rate than for other ethnic groups over the past nine years 
according to a study by a nonpartisan research group 
the current economic recovery appears to be benefiting 
hispanics much less than other groups hispanics are the only racial 
or ethnic group whose poverty rate remains at or close to recession 
levels of the early 1980s said robert greenstein director of 
the center on budget and policy priorities 
the groups study found the percentage of hispanics living in 
poverty grew from 216 percent in 1978 to 282 percent in 1987 
while the poverty rate for whites grew from 87 percent to 105 
percent and from 306 percent to 331 percent for blacks the 
poverty rate for all americans increased from 114 percent in 1978 
to 135 percent last year 
the center a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization 
that studies government spending programs and public policy issues 
affecting low and moderateincome americans based its findings on 
data from the us census bureau and labor department it used 1978 
as a comparison year with 1987 because national economic conditions 
such as national and hispanic unemployment rates were nearly the 
same in both years 
during the nineyear period the income of the typical hispanic 
family fell nearly 1600 after adjustment for inflation compared 
with an increase of 276 for a white family and a decline of 854 
for a black family the study said 
as a result of declines in hispanic earnings the study said the 
median income for hispanics equalled 629 percent of median family 
income for whites last year the lowest percentage on record 
hurt hardest by the increase in poverty and the earnings decline 
have been hispanic married families the study said their poverty 
rate grew by more than half with fewer than one in eight families 
below the poverty level in 1978 compared with nearly one in five in 
poverty last year 
the study also found that two in five hispanic children were 
living in poverty last year or 396 percent up from a rate of 272 
percent in 1978 
raul yzaguirre president of the national council of la raza a 
hispanic organization said the study is further evidence hispanics 
are the poorest community of people on a per capita basis yet 
latinos have the highest labor participation rate 
he blamed the failure of the educational system to keep students 
in school and an increase in job discrimination for the rise in the 
poverty rate 
greenstein blamed the increase in the poverty rate and the 
decline in earnings on several factors including the sharp erosion 
in the value of the minimum wage which at 335 per hour has remain 
unchanged since january 1981 while consumer prices have risen 38 
percent over that period 
because hispanic workers are more likely to be paid low wages 
than nonhispanics the lack of a minimum wage increase in nearly 
eight years has affected hispanics with greater severity than it has 
affected the general population the study said 
cutbacks in state and federal budget programs also have 
contributed to the increase in poor hispanics the study said only 
one in 14 poor hispanic families with children was raised from 
poverty with government assistance in 1987 compared with one in 
eight in 1979

bobbing in the big oldfashioned 
tub toes hooked over a water spout to keep from capsizing as tiny 
bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine its hard to worry 
whether this is just what the doctor ordered 
if you dont have anything wrong with you if you lead a 
strenuous life its just for relaxation says bathhouse attendant 
gertrude zorn 
otherwise says zorn who for 15 years has been drawing the water 
for the tub then coming back to wrap the client in a hot sheet when 
its time to get out the bubbly float on naturally carbonated water 
is good for arthritis rheumatism and bad backs 
the bathhouses with their white tile walls ceilingfans and 
small individual suites with the giant tubs look as though they 
havent changed from the 1930s when the state decided the areas 
carbonated waters were a natural resource 
nothing trendy here especially the price 875 for the soak 
room and attention 
but elsewhere spas are an oldfashioned idea gone yuppie and a 
multimilliondollar business for many now spa means the chrome and 
glass spot where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard it 
can mean being floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal 
wrap 
jeffrey joseph a new york entrepreneur who jumped in just as the 
water was heating up says his travel agency has tripled in both 
staff and bookings since he began specializing in spa vacations a 
year and a half ago 
joseph owner of spafinders travel arrangements ltd estimates 
that in five years the number of spas in this country has increased 
from 30 to 150 and is still growing 
about 12 million americans spend 700 million to 800 million 
annually going to spas joseph estimates the majority of his 
clients who spend about 1000 for a weeks retreat are lowlevel 
female executives in their 30s 
but is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad or 
is it really good for your health 
are you ready for this a 10003500 week at a spa can be as 
healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower 
say both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist 
does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral 
bath of course it feels good says psychologist eric margenau of 
new york city 
does it serve a medicinal purpose i havent seen any evidence 
of that 
what about stress management thats the new buzz word says 
joseph 
the experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if 
you plan for it and do it regularly if you go off once a year 
expecting an expensive vacation to be your lifeline for the next 12 
months youre in trouble 
i like spas theyre great but ive been to great dude ranches 
that ive come back from just as refreshed says margenau the 
author of a new book called sports without pressure 
dr james m rippe the cardiologist who heads the exercise 
physiology laboratory at the university of massachusetts medical 
school in worcester echoes that he says people mustnt delude 
themselves that they can go twice a year and make up for the 
excesses of the rest of the year 
joseph whose agency has sent nearly 4000 clients to spas around 
the world since march 1987 says the better resorts work on behavior 
modification in other words they dont just put you in an aerobics 
class or stick you on a diet they have a whole program on stress 
management and healthy living things to take home with you 
spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as 
the romans 
in europe and japan people have been spaminded for centuries 
one town in japan beppu known for boiling ponds that shoot mud 
into the air gets 12 million visitors each year joseph said 
in this country traditional spas with a chic clientele were 
booming before the turn of the century places like mineral wells 
texas hot springs ark white sulphur springs wva and 
calistoga calif which stands for californias saratoga 
this new york town the granddaddy of american spas whose 
medicinal springs were discovered in the late 18th century was long 
a social hot spot with its added cache of a thoroughbred racing 
season 
nowadays morgenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a 
burgeoning stress industry 
the whole business is blown up way out of proportion there is 
a whole economy built up around stress reduction the new american 
fads spas contraptions a 1000 worth of vitamins 
instead of those remedies he recommends altering daytoday 
patterns to defuse pressure slow down he says take a longer 
lunch schedule exercise 
yes stress exists it always has but most of the stresses are 
very easily remedied 
every mans spa is his shower says rippe the author of many 
medical and fitness books 
the medical school professor cites his own studies and those of 
colleagues that indicate showers and sitting in a recliner can 
reduce tension and anxiety and that blood pressure as well is 
reduced by regular programs of walking 
barbara sloan a confirmed spagoer isnt interested in hearing 
she could have stayed home and taken a shower 
it was wonderful she said of a posh florida spa a massage 
was part of every day the food absolutely out of this world 
josephs catalog says a week at the resort mrs sloan visited 
also included greens fees herbal wrap saltglo loofa scrub 
hairdo makeup manicure pedicure and lectures all for 1970 
a spa said mrs sloan president of a new jersey public 
relations firm means attention and luxury 
plush towels beautiful locker rooms pampering if you have to 
wait for an massage appointment they give you a cup of bouillon

a research firm headed by an american is being 
awarded a belgian prize for a new variety of wheat developed under 
the leadership of an indian scientist by crossing a russian winter 
wheat with a mexican spring variety 
the prize goes to the international maize and wheat improvement 
center outside mexico city known from its initials in spanish as 
cimmyt 
eight million people all over the world can get the grain they 
need from the additional production yielded by the new variety 
said donald winkelmann the american who heads the center 
he explained that veery wheat varieties produce as much as 10 
percent more grain than the wheats of the green revolution of 
the 1970s the extra 10 percent amounts to enough wheat to satisfy 
the needs of 8 million people 
the miracle wheats of the 1970s were developed by norman borlaug 
an american who won the nobel peace prize in 1970 for his work at 
cimmyt now 74 he is still active there winkelmann said the veery 
varieties were produced in accordance with his principles 
they were also named after a system he established of using the 
names of birds for new varieties in much the same way as weathermen 
use the first names of men and women for typhoons and hurricanes 
the veery is a small brown thrush wellknown to birdlovers in the 
americas 
if wed known the results we were going to get wes have named 
it something grander maybe peacock wheat winkelmann said 
cimmyt is one of 13 international agricultural research groups 
around the world they are coordinated by the world bank and are 
holding an annual meeting here this week under the banks auspices 
the award was being formally presented at todays final session 
winkelmann spoke at the belgian embassy on thursday where 
ambassador herman dehennin announced the king baudouin award which 
is given to one of the 13 research groups every two years 
work on veery wheat started in 1973 it was developed by members 
of a team at cimmyt headed by sanjaya rajaram an indian 
researchers crossed a winter wheat called kavkaz after the caucasus 
mountains in russia with a mexican spring wheat known as buho 
winter wheats are robust and resist disease spring wheats give 
bigger yields 
the cross developed into what winkelmann called a wheat for all 
seasons 
it was tested in 50 countries winkelmann said it is becoming the 
dominant wheat in mexico where it was first introduced in 1981 the 
first plantings in pakistan came the following year 
winkelmann said it is now cultivated on at least 10 million acres 
worldwide

venezuelans whose fortunes rise and 
fall with the price of oil are heading into a presidential election 
next month at a time when their oncerobust economy is in a serious 
slump 
the seventhmonth campaign for the dec 4 balloting has been rich 
in promises by candidates who have yet to explain how they would pay 
for their programs if elected 
more than 9 million people roughly half the population of the 
country are eligible to vote to elect their seventh president since 
the nations last dictator gen marcos perez jimenez was 
overthrown in 1958 
the main candidates are former president carlos andres perez 66 
of the social democratic accion democratica ad party and eduardo 
fernandez 48 of the social christian party better known as copei 
the acronym formed by its name in spanish 
recent polls give a lead of 14 points to perez who served as 
president in 197378 when venezuela was awash in oil dollars 
both candidates have made campaign promises ranging from 
modernizing the nations industries and placing computers in every 
school to new hospital beds and free milk for school children 
neither has detailed where they will get money to pay for it all 
but with the nations onceoverflowing treasury now nearly empty 
whoever wins is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign 
pledges 
despite a relative success in agriculture venezuelas economy 
has been hardhit by persistently low prices of oil the nations 
major source of export revenue oil has plunged from a high of 30 a 
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around 13 
current prices on world markets continue to slump a sharp 
contrast to the market boom during perez first term when he 
nationalized the oil industry the slide in oil prices this year 
alone may cost the nation as much as 3 billion in revenue nearly a 
third of the 107 billion originally expected 
coupled with a foreign debt of 35 billion latin americas 
fourth largest after brazil mexico and argentina a continuation of 
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the 
government to be installed in february 
according to official statistics real income for the average 
venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982 when oil 
prices began to fall 
while less than 15 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent 
of the nations income 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their 
basic nutritional needs according to a venezuelan central 
university report 
perez and fernandez agree that drastic changes must be 
implemented to reverse this trend but while perez proposes to 
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy 
fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector 
rather than emphasizing their differences both perez and 
fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each 
other 
intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when 
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from 
drug traffickers 
the exchange of accusations ceased only when the supreme 
electoral council which supervises the campaign called on perez 
and fernandez to avoid injurious attacks 
ad and copei have traditionally alternated in power with ad 
winning over copei four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian 
rule 
both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983 
elections won by the ads jaime lusinchi now the incumbent 
president 
twentyone other candidates also are in the running covering a 
wide range of the political and social spectrum 
one is a witch doctor romulo abreu duarte who professes a 
fervent belief in the legendary goddess maria lionza descended her 
devotees say from a spanish conquistador and an indian princess 
others include the former procastro guerrilla leader teodoro 
petkoff of the leftist movement toward socialism and ismenia 
villalba of the centrist democratic revolutionary union 
aware of the overwhelming strength of ad and copei the minor 
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional 
seats at stake 
both villalba the first woman to ever run for president in 
venezuela and petkoff expect to improve their parties 
congressional strength now respectively 11 and 9 seats 
the tiny venezuelan communist party is running in a coalition led 
by edmundo chirinos former rector of venezuelan central university 
ad and copei stand to lose considerable legislative power if the 
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting analysts 
say

secular israelis who are a majority in the 
jewish state fear the strong election showing of ultraorthodox will 
rekindle the sabbath wars weekly battles outside movie theaters 
and restaurants 
tensions subsided in december after the outbreak of the 
palestinian uprising in the occupied territories but have 
reemerged following this weeks parliamentary elections 
four religious parties won a pivotal 18 seats in the 120seat 
knesset and control the balance of power between the rightwing 
likud bloc and leftleaning labor party they are in a position to 
wring major concessions in exchange for their support 
nonobservant israelis fear that as a result they could be 
banned from driving to the beaches on the weekend and deprived of 
pork in restaurants and saturday afternoon soccer matches 
these ultraorthodox are dogmatic there will be no compromise 
how will we live together asked yoram kaniuk a wellknown writer 
interviewed on israel television 
he said modern zionism the movement that brought jews to 
resettle the land of israel was motivated by a rejection of the 
image of religious jews living in the ghettos of eastern europe 
zionism was a revolution against the ghetto a rebellion 
against this blind faith that god will take care of everything he 
said 
the religiously observant make up only 20 percent to 25 percent 
of israels 35 million jews 
some secular politicians have said an israel governed by 
fundamentalist rabbis would be as joyless as ayatollah khomeinis 
islamic revolution in iran 
some of the alarm seems exaggerated because orthodox parties have 
held the balance of power in israeli governments since 1981 without 
forcing major changes in the lives of the nonreligious 
however they have had some legislative triumphs such as a law 
banning the national airline el al from flying on the sabbath 
experts say the current fight is likely to center in the holy 
city of jerusalem where more than half the 340000 jews are 
orthodox and many more are observant 
jerusalem will be the battleground predicted daniel elazar 
of the jerusalem center for public affairs 
he predicted the 1987 sabbath wars that became a weekend 
ritual outside movie theaters pubs and restaurants will rsume in 
jerusalem 
in the ultraorthodox neighborhood of mea shearim slogans 
scrawled on walls denounce police and mayor teddy kollek for 
refusing to close entertainment spots on the sabbath 
elazar said the religious would probably not try to enforce such 
bans in predominantly secular cities such as tel aviv 
they will concentrate on jerusalem and leave other areas until 
later they feel they will be a majority in 40 years and do not 
want to alienate too much the people they seek to convert said 
elazar 
he and other analysts said the orthodox would likely mount a 
major campaign for jerusalems municipal elections in february in 
hopes of increasing their say in the city council where religious 
parties hold 10 of 31 seats 
the ultraorthodox are the fastest growing population group in 
israel elazar said nonreligious israelis had an average 26 
children per couple modern orthodox about four and ultraorthodox 
more than eight 
we shall grow in number because only we immigrate to israel and 
because we dont have abortions and family planning said rabbi 
menachem porush a lawmakers from the ultraorthodox agudat israel 
party which won five seats in parliament 
already orthodox power is greater than its numbers in addition 
to holding pivotal parliament seats rabbis can rule on personal 
matters such as legality of marriages and divorces 
the also have the support of a large but indeterminate number of 
nonobservant jews who respect tradition 
ultraorthodox leaders have pledged not to try to coerce secular 
israelis but they clearly are prepared to do battle over observing 
the biblically mandated day of rest 
the land of israel will maintain its jewish image its jewish 
values said porush in a jewish country the sabbath is a 
jewish value

for the second time this year the space agency 
is facing a supply shortage that could ground space shuttles in 
1990 and it is looking nervously for other potential gaps in 
critical materials 
the countrys only manufacturer of rayon yarn used in shuttle 
booster rocket nozzles avtex fibers began closing its plant in 
virginia on thursday only two days after announcing its plans to 
do so 
the national aeronautics and space administration faced a similar 
problem in may when the henderson nev plant of pacific 
engineering and production co was destroyed in an explosion and 
fire pepcon as the firm is called was one of only two producers 
of ammonium perchlorate the oxidizer in the solid fuel that powers 
the shuttles booster rockets 
at this point nasa is guaranteed enough booster rocket fuel to 
power nine flights and has enough rayon for ten that would take the 
agency through this year when only one more flight is scheduled and 
through next with seven on the calendar 
no one at nasa headquarters or at the agencys marshall space 
flight center in huntsville ala would say how many other 
materials used for shuttle flights have only a single supplier 
however sources who declined to be identified said shuttle 
program boss richard truly would probably order a thorough study to 
identify them and the potential for a cutoff of supply 
shuttle builder rockwell international corp alone depends on 
more than 250 subcontractors nationwide for various systems and 
components some are singlesource 
for example one metal narloyz is a specially developed 
alloy used by the firms rocketdyne division in the engines 
combustion chamber and it is made by only a single licensee 
similarly only one foundry makes the engine turbine blades and 
there is only one set of tooling for those 
the presidential commission that investigated the challenger 
disaster criticized the space agency for not having enough spares on 
hand which fostered a practice of borrowing parts from one shuttle 
for use on another 
that problem has not been completely solved after the flight of 
discovery last month engineers found evidence of a leak in one 
engine they had to borrow an engine from shuttle columbia to 
prepare discovery for its next mission 
rocketdynes joyce lincoln said there are 16 engines in 
existence three each on discovery and atlantis two new units 
undergoing acceptance testing one being assembled after overhaul 
and seven undergoing improvements that situation is not likely to 
ease until spring 
the impact of the fuel and nozzle problems wont be felt for more 
than a year an allocation board that included the defense 
department nasa and other government agencies met recently to 
divide up ammonium perchlorate production 
we have been allocated sufficient quantities for nine flight 
sets said rocky raab spokesman for morton thiokol in utah which 
builds the rocket boosters that flank the orbiter 
the allocation board meets again in early 1989 to make 
additional allocations so presuming pepcon gets the plant going 
again in early or mid1989 that would mitigate that situation he 
said 
only the latenovember flight of atlantis remains this year and 
there are seven more missions scheduled for 1989 
pepcon is rebuilding its plant in henderson and has broken ground 
for a new facility for finishing work in cedar city utah 
presuming everything goes as planned our concerns about the fuel 
are minimized raab said 
it is too soon to know what will be done about avtex which began 
closing its plant at front royal va on thursday and letting its 
1300 employees go production for all intents and purposes is 
stopping today said avtex spokesman nick nichols people will 
be working for the next couple of days to shut it down and secure 
it 
morton thiokol nasa the pentagon and other contractors were 
talking with avtex in hopes of finding a solution to the shutdown 
raab said thiokol had enough material for 10 flight sets 
its a possibility that rayon might be available elsewhere but 
it has to be a qualified source he said rayon is the root stock 
for what ends up as carbon phenolic a fireproof material that lines 
the inside of the booster nozzle the same cloth is used to make 
nozzles for mx missiles small intercontinental missiles and the 
trident ii system 
you cant force somebody to manufacture some product raab

toxic pcb compounds someday could be gobbled up 
by bacteria during hazardous waste cleanup operations according to 
new findings from the bottom of the hudson river 
pcbs accumulated in sediment above troy ny are being changed 
into less toxic forms by bacteria that work without oxygen 
researchers from michigan state university report these less toxic 
forms do not accumulate in living tissue 
pcbs tendency to accumulate in tissue has led several states to 
advise against eating pcbcontaminated fish new york for example 
has banned fishing for striped bass below troy all the way to the 
ocean 
the new findings raise hopes that highly toxic pcbs could be 
changed into the less toxic nonaccumulating forms in more 
locations 
if it is true it could have enormous significance said 
richard d morgenstern head of the office of policy analysis in the 
environmental protection agency 
its too early to start looking for pcbfree striped bass said 
darrell banks deputy commissioner of the states department of 
environmental conservation which plans to dredge and remove 360000 
cubic yards of pcbcontaminated sediment from the river 
the state probably will go ahead with the dredging project he 
said but the michigan state findings cause us to hope for a 
system that might be useful for hot spots we cant deal with by 
dredging 
it could in some cases make dredging unnecessary said 
environmental chemist stephen a boyd one of the michigan state 
authors reporting on the work in the issue of science magazine 
published today 
he said that for dredging and other removal projects that do go 
ahead it would certainly lessen the risktobenefit ratio that 
is make the work less risky than believed up to now 
the work of boyd and coauthors james m tiedje and john f 
quensen confirms a theory advanced in 1987 by general electric 
corp whose legal dumping of pcb waste at fort edward and hudson 
falls ny from 1951 to 1973 is the source of most hudson river 
pcbs 
there are 209 possible pcb compounds each contains one to 10 
chlorine atoms ge noted that pcb sediments in the hudson had lost 
chlorine and the proportion with only one or two atoms had 
increased over what was put in the river 
ge theorized that oxygenfree bacteria probably were responsible 
but new york government scientists said there could have been other 
causes including the possibility that sediment containing the 
highchlorine forms was washing away faster an administrative law 
judge recommended rejection of ges proposal to leave the sediments 
undisturbed in favor of a state proposal for dredging 
the department of environmental conservation expects to decide in 
early january whether to go ahead with the dredging 
steve hamilton organic chemist at ges labs in schenectady 
ny said we feel pretty good about the confirmation of ges 
theory by the michigan state team he noted that pcbladen sediments 
in harbors at new bedford mass and waukegan ill have shown 
similar changes but have not been studied in detail 
ge contributed financially to the michigan state research but 
boyd said that doesnt mean they hired us to state something they 
wanted said 
boyd tiedje and quensen said the process works best on high 
concentrations of pcbs sediment was doped to 700 parts per million 
concentration of a commercial pcb mixture containing no 
singlechlorine molecules 9 percent with two chlorine atoms 48 
percent with three and 36 percent with four after 16 weeks it had 
changed into a mixture in which 67 percent of the molecules had no 
chlorine 21 percent had one atom 8 percent had two and 3 percent 
had three 
lesscontaminated samples showed less change prompting a word of 
caution from the researchers 
since concentrations as high as 700 ppm are rare i have 
questions about the rates at which this process proceeds banks 
said the researchers noted that river samples range from 50 ppm to 
562 ppm 
congress required epa to act against pcbs because of reports of 
cancer skin disorders and reproductive damage in laboratory animals 
before the danger was widely known pcbs were valued for their 
ability to resist fire and act as electrical insulators millions of 
pounds were used before epa banned manufacture in 1977 
spills discharges into rivers and equipment renovation have made 
pcb contamination a massive headache for american industry 
utilities for example must replace transformer fluids containing 
pcbs by the early 1990s 
up to now incineration or burying in landfills had been the only 
available techniques the michigan state researchers said it should 
be possible to develop a new twostep process using oxygenfree 
bacteria to remove most of the chlorine then employing normal 
oxygenusing bacteria to remove the last one or two chlorine atoms 
the result should be substances that dontaccumulate in living 
tissues

the university of massachusetts student 
senate has barred an avowed communist and his cohort from the 
student government association offices they were elected to head 
jason rabinowitz and shari silkoff were elected copresidents of 
the student body last march but the 4744 vote by the student 
senate on wednesday prohibits them from using the title of 
copresident 
conservatives on the student senate contend that two people 
cannot not hold one office under the campus constitution 
i think the student senate sent a clear message to them that 
they arent copresidents said brian darling one of the sponsors 
of motions to oust rabinowitz a member of the young communist 
league and silkoff from office

the next us president will have his hands 
full trying to keep pace with mikhail gorbachev and finding a 
formula for mideast peace 
the fastmoving soviet leader is not only trying to restructure 
the soviet economy he is permitting a diversity of views unknown in 
his country since the 1917 revolution 
the next us president must figure out how to encourage 
democratic developments in a way that is consistent with american 
security interests if he goes too far he risks leading the people 
in russia the baltics and eastern europe to expect us help that 
might not be there in the event of a crisis 
the absence of a us response apart from angry rhetoric to 
the soviet crackdown in czechoslovakia in 1968 shows how limited 
us action might be despite cheering on democratic trends 
but there are many steps to consider on the economic arms 
control and human rights fronts that could have an enormous impact 
on living conditions 
will the united states provide easy credits to assist communist 
regimes in adopting western techniques will arms control get the 
kind of support that could take pressure off the soviet and us 
military will the united states condition its economic assistance 
on tangible improvements in soviet living standards 
four ussoviet summit meetings since 1985 have established a 
basis for better superpower relations as the reagan administration 
winds down however strains have developed over a siberian radar 
facility and new soviet missiles and warplanes in afghanistan 
when the soviets asked for a meeting in geneva to discuss 
krasnoyarsk us officials hoped they might finally agree to 
destroy the radar facility president reagan has complained the 
radar violates the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
but the soviets made no such offer and the state department 
threatened to take proportionate steps or to declare krasnoyarsk 
a material breach of the treaty 
us officials disclosed the pentagon had circulated 
recommendations within the government that include deploying a 
limited ballistic missile defense or reversing the planned 
dismantling of three poseidon nuclear submarines 
the dispute over krasnoyarsk and us retaliation could weaken 
ussoviet arms control efforts even as the two sides are within 
range of an agreement to reduce their longrange nuclear weapons 
a us declaration that krasnoyarsk breaches the 1972 treaty 
could lead to the unraveling of the accord a landmark in arms 
control 
in afghanistan meanwhile the state department every day this 
week has denounced the soviets for shipping in new weapons half the 
red army withdrew by aug 15 as promised in last springs geneva 
accord but the administration is concerned the soviets are 
imperiling a political settlement between rival factions and 
intimidating pakistan besides 
in the middle east the muddled situation in israel after 
tuesdays national elections could require a shift in us 
diplomatic tactics 
they have been based on trying to persuade israel to surrender 
territory in exchange for arab recognition and to elicit the 
promise from jerusalem even before peace talks are held 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir refused despite four trips 
to the region this year by secretary of state george p shultz if 
shamir heads the new israeli government which may take two months 
to restructure there is no reason to expect him to change his mind 
that means either letting the situation fester which most us 
analysts consider dangerous or trying another approach one would 
be concentrating us pressure on the palestinians and jordan to 
negotiate with israel without preconditions the other would be a 
joint ussoviet formula for peace talks but shamir ever 
apprehensive of moscows intervention is likely to resist

a multimillionaire who nearly died from a 
heart attack 22 years ago has spent 2 million on a crusade to 
pressure food industry giants into making healthier products but 
the companies say his criticisms are misguided 
phil sokolof 65 placed advertisments in newspapers this week 
depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods but 
are poisoning americans with saturated fats 
they include nabiscos triscuit crackers procter amp gambles 
crisco shortening kelloggs cracklin oat bran cereal pepperidge 
farms goldfish crackers keeblers club crackers sunshines hydrox 
cookies and nondairy coffee creamers coffee swirl from kraft 
carnations coffeemate and bordens creamora 
saturated fats have the effect of boosting the bloods 
cholesterol level according to scientists an excess of 
cholesterol a waxy compound can clog arteries thereby 
contributing to heart attacks 
the american heart association recommends a daily diet with no 
more than 30 percent of calories from fats and no more than 10 
percent from saturated fats 
sokolof the owner of a construction equipment company blames 
high cholesterol for the nearfatal heart attack he suffered in 1966 
at the age of 43 his father and a brotherinlaw died of heart 
attacks 
there were no warnings he said i was thin i exercised i 
didnt smoke the only thing wrong was i had high cholesterol 
in 1985 he wrote a 1 million check to establish the national 
heart savers association he has spent another 1 million to spread 
his warning about high cholesterol 
heart savers is registered in nebraska as a nonprofit 
organization sokolof has provided 99 percent of its funds and is 
the only staff member he said 
sokolof said his brush with death combined with a 1984 
government study on cholesterol prompted his effort 
it is a crusade it is from the heart he said thursday 
but the targeted companies said the advertisements that ran 
tuesday in the new york times and new york post were unfair and 
misrepresented their products 
its irresponsible joseph stewart a senior vice president 
for kelloggs in battle creek mich said thursday for someone 
to claim it is the poisoning of the american public is a gross 
exaggeration 
sokolofs biggest beef is with companies that portray their foods 
as healthy by proclaiming no cholesterol low salt 
nondairy and made with 100 percent vegetable shortening 
mcdonalds still serves 30 million people a day but when you 
eat a mcdonalds hamburger you expect to get eight or 10 grams of 
fat he said other people are selling foods that are inferred 
to be a health food 
the chief culprits sokolof said are palm and coconut oils 
which are highly saturated even though they are vegetable oils 
companies use the oils because they are the most expeditious way to 
extend shelf life he said 
particularly upsetting to him is cracklin oat bran cereal 
they kelloggs came to market with oat bran because everyone 
wants to eat oat bran to lower their cholesterol sokolof said 
but it has coconut oil in it which has 100 percent more saturated 
fat than lard it is worse than cholesterol 
he also singled out crisco advertised as an allvegetable 
shortening with no cholesterol it has no cholesterol but it does 
have palm oil which is high in saturated fat and again worse than 
cholesterol he said 
cholesterol itself is only found in animal products including 
meat and dairy items like cheese whole milk and eggs 
kelloggs stewart said sokolofs ads confuse legitimate efforts 
to educate people about the cholesterol problem fats he said 
are a necessary part of a healthy diet 
if consumers believe sokolof he said they should eliminate 
every product that contains fat including cheese whole milk beef 
chicken and pork 
they all have saturated fat he said 
sokolof counters that kelloggs is making light of the fact that 
the cereal contains 37 grams of coconut oil serving 
if you eat it for one meal of your life that would be fine 
he said but they are providing food for millions of people who 
eat it every morning you are talking about thousands of gallons of 
fat youre talking vats of fat 
ann wainright of pepperidge farm said her company recently began 
using 100 percent soybean oil in all its breads 
the elimination of coconut and palm oils in our cracker and 
cookie products is a high priority she said 
joe simrany vice president of marketing for sunshine said 
sunshine had removed coconut oil from most of its products and wants 
to eliminate all tropical oils 
national heart savers was aware of these efforts but 
apparently they chose to ignore them simrany said recently 
even in hydrox we have eliminated palm oil 
sokolof said he will continue placing ads 
kelloggs isnt going to listen to me but if they get enough 
flak from the american people they are going to change the 
formula he said

the agriculture department is proposing to get 
tougher on inspections of the most troublesome meat and poultry 
processing plants but ease up on those with good records 
the prospective changes announced on thursday were welcomed by 
the industry as an improvement in the inspection programs focus 
but consumer and labor groups assailed it saying it would be 
like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop 
thousands of plants that make hotdogs beef stew luncheon meats 
and scores of other processed items that include meat and poultry 
would be involved in the proposed program 
over time officials estimated the usdas inspection force of 
about 2200 employees at the affected plants would be reduced by 
half by retirements and resignations 
the changes would strengthen usdas inspection in the 6300 
plants that process meat and poultry by focusing inspection efforts 
where they are needed most said lester m crawford head of the 
departments food safety and inspection service 
crawford said the proposal would put into effect the processed 
products inspection act of 1986 the law allows the new targeted 
inspection program to operate only for six years at which time it 
would be reviewed by congress before being renewed 
under the proposal usda would increase inspection at 
processing plants where records indicate a need for additional 
oversight he said by the same token plants with good records 
of compliance could be visited less than daily 
the program could begin by mid1989 but it likely would take 
several years for the policy shift to be completed 
slaughter plants where livestock and poultry are killed would 
not be affected by the plan those plants still would be under 
continuous inspection 
department officials who once called the program discretionary 
inspection of processing plants changed the name in the proposal 
to improved processing inspection 
the proposal was hailed by a major industry organization the 
american meat institute and criticized harshly by spokesmen for 
consumers and labor 
in a statement the ami said the proposal would adopt the 
riskbased approach advocated by the national academy of sciences 
and would focus inspection at those critical points in the process 
that pose the greatest risk to public health 
crawford said the proposed program would use new computerized 
information gathered during plant visits by usda inspectors to 
document each plants record based on these records the agency 
would decide how often a plant would be personally checked by 
federal inspectors 
it would be like putting the fox in charge of the chicken 
coop said rodney e leonard head of the community nutrition 
institute a nonprofit washingtonbased consumer watchdog agency 
leonard said the original intent of the 1906 federal meat 
inspection program has to be considered and that was to protect the 
publics health 
the companies at that time because they were not restrained 
from selling food that would injure the public sold foods that 
injured the public leonard said in a telephone interview the 
whole idea of inspection is to put an individual representing my 
interests in plants to do for me what i would do if i was there 
which is to ensure that no one is going to be exposed to products 
that will injure or lead to an earlier death 
allen zack of the united food and commercial workers 
international said usdas proposal appeared similar to the 
occupational safety and health administrations policy of targeting 
inspections to companies with poor safety records 
what we discovered with that inspection program was that 
companies lied on their records he said and so inspections by 
osha were not done as a result weve had a tragic increase in 
safety and health problems for workers in meat packing poultry in 
particular 
zack said he feared that history would repeat itself under usdas 
proposal for targeted meat inspections at processing plants 
the danger here is that the size of the public that is going to 
be exposed to these types of hazards is much larger he said 
its not just the workers who work on the products its going to 
be all the consumers who buy them 
written public comments on the proposal can be submitted until 
feb 2 to policy office attn linda carey fsis hearing clerk

agriculture secretary richard e lyng says he 
is headed for europe later this month for one last series of 
meetings with the european economic community on a range of 
contentious agricultural trade issues 
lyng said that after jan 20 when the new administration takes 
office he hopes to hang up his government spurs and take it easy 
but for now lyng said in an interview thursday he will keep 
pushing on international trade and will be in brussels around 
midmonth with us trade representative clayton yeutter and chief 
us agricultural trade negotiator daniel amstutz 
no firm dates have been set for the eec talks however yeutters 
office said 
international trade particularly involving the eec and japan 
has been at the top of lyngs list of priorities all long he said 
and that includes trade liberalization negotiations under the 
96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade 
lyng said the difficult parts of gatt negotiations relate to 
the attitudes and problems with japan particularly on rice and 
the eec primarily concerning its common agricultural policy high 
support prices and export subsidies 
one of the most immediate and pressing problems lyng hopes to 
address in his talks with eec officials is the 12nation blocs 
determination to ban imports of meat containing growthpromoting 
hormones beginning jan 1 1989 
theyre insisting theyre going to implement that ban on jan 
1 lyng said that would be a very serious problem for us 
us livestock interests have estimated an eec ban would cost 
130 million a year in lost trade primarily in variety meats 
popular on the european market the eec says the ban on meat 
hormones is designed to ensure consumer safety 
the meat industry trade policy council which includes a number 
of farm business and commodity organizations has asked the reagan 
administration to use authority under the new trade law to cut off 
meat imports from the eec if the jan 1 ban goes into effect 
lyng said also that he yeutter and other us trade officials 
will attend the special meeting of the 96 member countries of gatt 
which will begin dec 5 in montreal 
after the next administration takes over lyng 70 said he plans 
to take it easy 
we have no plans to move from the washington area but we 
havent made a commitment to stay where we are he said have no 
plans whatsoever 
there may be some special parttime jobs that come up from 
time to time he said but added i really want to take life at a 
much slower pace

holiday shoppers will find adequate supplies of 
turkey and plenty of ham according to agriculture department 
analysts 
prices will likely be higher for turkey and lower for ham than 
last year the departments economic research service said 
thursday cold storage stocks of turkeys on oct 1 were 11 percent 
below the record level of 1987 and will be drawn down further by 
holiday demands and a fourthquarter production under last years 
level 
pork production is up about 9 percent this year the agency said 
in a new outlook report but the rise in output is slackening and 
may only average about 1 percent higher over all of 1989 
as of sept 1 there were 5 percent more market hogs than a 
year ago in the major pork states the report said farrowing 
intentions for septembernovember and decemberfebruary indicate a 
moderate production increase in firsthalf 1989

despite a steady increase in air traffic 
airlines are cutting delays and there are signs that safety is 
improving according to the transportation department 
the department said thursday the major airlines have had at least 
four out of every five flights arrive on time in each of the last 
six months including an 856 percent ontime record in september 
the best since the monthly figures became available 13 months ago 
complaints from air travelers to dots consumer affairs office 
also continued their downward trend the 1370 complaints received 
in october was 28 percent fewer than the 1897 received in september 
and 62 percent fewer than the 3635 registered in october 1987 the 
dot said 
at the same time the department said many of the safety 
indicators show marked improvements this year 
according to dot figures the number of nearcollision reports by 
pilots has dropped by 35 percent from 864 to 560 during the first 
nine months of the year compared with the same period in l987 the 
department did not say how many of the nearcollision reports 
involved commercial airlines 
the number of air traffic controller errors in which planes fly 
closer than legally allowed declined by 15 percent from 953 in the 
first nine months of 1987 to 808 during the same period this year 
the statistics indicate that our efforts to improve airline 
safety and service to consumers are reaping dividends said 
transportation secretary jim burnley in a statement they are 
especially significant given that they come at a time of steadily 
growing air traffic 
nevertheless officials acknowledge that there continue to be 
pockets of concern in some parts of the country about air traffic 
volume controllers working long hours and too many controller 
flighthandling errors 
last month the federal aviation administration clamped tighter 
traffic curbs on the chicago airports including ohare 
international because errors by chicago controllers soared to 30 
during the first 10 months of the year compared to only 12 in all 
of l987 
the reduction of flights in and out of chicago in turn has caused 
increasing delay problems at ohare as well as at chicagos smaller 
midway which has added to delays at other airports airline 
officials have said 
burnley also has said that air traffic controllers in facilities 
in new york atlanta and los angeles as well as chicago are 
still working more overtime than he would like 
but the monthly ontime statistics released thursday covered 
september before the chicago traffic curbs went into effect during 
september just over 81 percent of ohares flights arrived on time 
and 87 percent departed on time the government said 
the dallasfort worth airport had the best ontime record with 
908 percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule 
while detroit had the worst record at 69 percent 
the figures include weatherrelated delays but not those caused 
by mechanical problems the department considers a flight to be on 
time if it arrives within 15 minutes of schedule 
between april and september the 13 largest airlines reported an 
80 percent average ontime arrival rate in each of the six months 
compared with about 74 percent between october l987 and last march 
said the dot 
eastern airlines which throughout the year has ranked in the 
bottom half of the group of airlines reporting ontime statistics 
soared to no 1 among major air carriers in september with 905 
percent of its flights on time 
america west largely a regional carrier with its hub in phoenix 
had the overall best record with nearly 93 percent of it flights on 
time just ahead of eastern northwest airlines had the worst record 
for september with 758 percent of its flights arriving on time 
the airlines meanwhile reported receiving 571 reports of 
mishandled baggage per 1000 passengers carried in september down 
from 703 reports per 1000 in august the best previous month had 
been may when there were 616 reports per 1000 passengers

earthquakescarred central america and southern mexico ran into the 
streets thursday when a strong temblor rattled the region one death 
and minor damage was reported 
later thursday a strong earthquake shook buildings and sent 
people into the streets in puerto rico but an official said there 
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in the caribbean 
island 
the central american quake was felt at 847 am 
about 12 hours later at 843 pm another earthquake measuring 
42 on the richter scale rattled guatemala the national 
seismological institute there reported its epicenter was about 70 
miles southeast of guatemala city the capital in the pacific ocean 
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damages

emergency committee went on alert and to a lesser extent in 
honduras and nicaragua a 1972 earthquake killed 10000 people in 
nicaragua and caused extensive damage to managua the capital 
readings on the tremor varied the us geological survey in 
golden colo said it measured 6 on the richter scale the 
institute of seismology at the university of costa rica said it 
measured 65 
an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 on the richter scale is 
capable of doing serious damage the richter scale is an openended 
gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground 
motion recorded on a seismograph 
in guatemala city the guatemalan capital a municipal worker 
digging a ditch was buried alive when the quake dislodged a pile of 
earth police said the man was identified as jesus pitan 50

emperor hirohitos fever increased slightly today as 
palace doctors feared the monarchs continued high temperature might 
lead to further internal bleeding 
the temperature of the worlds longestreigning monarch was 1006 
f up slightly from the previous evening hirohitos normal 
temperture is about 959 f 
doctors fear the continuous high fever might lead to further 
bleeding in hirohitos upper intestinal area where physicians 
conducted a bypass operation in september 1987 news reports said 
today 
palace spokesman kenji maeda said the emperors fever could 
largely be attributed to the blood transfusions conducted almost 
daily but doctors are now also concerned that worsening 
inflammation around the upper intestine was keeping hirohitos 
temperature high 
physicians have stopped giving the 87yearold monarch 
antibiotics because continuous use of the drugs could damage kidney 
and liver functions but news reports said doctors are considering 
resuming the medication to alleviate infection and reduce the risk 
of further bleeding 
the bedridden monarch who has not discharged blood since 
thursday has received 342 pints of transfusions since he fell 
seriously ill and vomited blood on sept 19

a computer virus infected systems from mit to caltech on 
thursday afflicting major universities and federal research 
centers including nasas jet propulsion laboratory but officials 
said they were unaware of any damage 
the bug infected hundreds of computers but apparently didnt 
destroy any files or research said professor james bruce vice 
president for information systems at massachusetts institute of 
technology in cambridge mass 
were not crippled bruce said it first showed up in the 
middle of the night and spread very virulently during the day 
the virus had slowed or halted dozens of computers at the 
california institute of technology in pasadena by thursday morning 
but caused no permanent damage said bob logan systems manager of 
caltechs computing organization 
some of the institutions affected were investigating the 
incident but there was no known criminal probe underway 
viruses the communicable diseases of computers are tiny 
programs which are created in computers either as a joke or 
vandalism they can attach themselves to other programs and spread 
through shared software 
in their mildest form a message flashes on a users screen as 
malignancies they can destroy data and cripple a computer 
this virus program tries to find all the machines it can talk 
to copies itself into those machines and then it starts doing the 
same thing again logan said 
caltech experts believe the virus entered their computers through 
arpanet a network established by the defense departments advanced 
research projects agency 
arpanet is a nationwide computer network that reaches to 
just about every university in the united states caltech 
spokesman bob finn said it lets researchers communicate data and 
text very easily 
spokesmen at boston university stanford university colorado 
university and the nasaames research center in mountain view 
calif also said their systems had been infected 
this is electronic vandalism said john porter associate 
provost at boston university 
at the lawrence livermore national laboratories in livermore 
calif spokesman jeff garberson said a computer problem was 
discovered late wednesday 
we took action to contain it which means to stop it from 
spreading to other computer systems we were successful by about 1 
in the morning about five hours after it was discovered 
this is for unclassified nonsecured systems said 
garberson it did not affect our classified national defense 
system at all 
the labs work includes design of the nations nuclear weapons 
and key work in the strategic defense initiative we are now 
powering back up and should have all these unclassified systems back 
on line by tomorrow garberson said 
it was benign it that it didnt cause any damage said gerard 
newman a member of the technical staff at the san diego super 
computer center at the university of california san diego but 
it was incredibly prolific it attempted to find as many computers 
as it could to infect it slowed three systems here 
at stanford in palo alto calif the virus was mainly just 
slowing down systems and slowing data it just chokes computers 
our people are saying no data were destroyed said bob beyers 
a school spokesman 
the new york times in its friday editions said unidentified 
computer security analysts were calling the virus the largest 
assault ever on the nations computers 
the times said the virus apparently was released by a computer 
graduate student trying to sneak what he thought was a harmless 
virus onto arpanet where the program was supposed to remain 
undetected 
the times said an anonymous caller identifying himself as an 
associate of the student called the newspaper and said the virus 
went awry because of a programming error that caused it to replicate 
itself much faster than intended 
the student realized his error shortly after letting the 
program loose and was now terrified of the consequences the 
times said 
the defense communications agency set up an emergency center to 
deal with the problem the newspaper said 
this has the feel of somebody who was sitting around thinking 
one night over a beer hey i can write a virus lets see what 
happens said charley kline senior research programmer with the 
computing services office at the university of illinois at 
urbanachampaign ill 
kline said he uses the term virus to mean a selfspreading 
program though some call such a program a worm unless it does 
damage he said he knew of no damage caused by the program thursday 
kline said university officials disconnected their computers from 
outside networks about 8 am cst when the virus was discovered 
and connected them again about noon when the system apparently was 
purged of the invading program 
contact with other universities showed the virus also infected 
computers at boston university purdue university the university of 
wisconsin at madison and the university of california at berkeley 
kline said 
this is the first time that i know of that it virus infection 
has happened on this scale to larger systems kline said 
kline said the virus traveled between computer systems through a 
process in which computer operators usually send electronic mail 
to each other 
he said once the messages were received they linked up to 
command controls and told the local computer to make copies of the 
virus he said the copies then sought out other connected machinery 
he said that as far as he knows only locations using vax 
computers made by digital equipment of maynard mass or sun 
computers made by sun microsystems inc of california were 
affected 
kline estimated that about 75 percent of all national networks 
use such computers 
all of the affected computers use the same operating system or 
master program that allows a computer to run other programs logan 
said 
the operating system named bsd unix was written by university 
of california berkeley computer experts and is a modified version 
of the unix operating system produced by american telephone amp 
telegraph he said 
logan said he believes the virus came through the arpanet 
connection because at least some of the times the virus entered 
caltechs computers wednesday night it came from computers at 
nasas ames research center in mountain view calif and at 
lawrence berkeley laboratory in berkeley 
all the computers are connected by arpanet he said 
the virus also infected a network called science internet that 
serves many scientists and research labs including nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory in pasadena said jpl spokesman jim wilson 
nasas science internet office at amers research center alerted 
jpl computer specialists of the virus presence in internet shortly 
after midnight thursday wilson said in a prepared statement 
within an hour jpl has disconnected from the nasa science 
internet and also from milnet and arpanet two other research and 
development computer networks wilson said no damage to 
hardware software or data was found 
he said a software patch was developed to protect against 
this type of virus and the networks will be reconnected only after 
the patch has been installed and tested within a day 
john mcafee chairman of the computer virus industry association 
in santa clara calif said thursdays virus was rare because it 
infested computers at major institutions not just personal 
computers where most viruses are generated and duplicated 
any hacker in the world can infect personal computers mcafee 
said by telephone but in this case the person who did this would 
have had to have been physically at the site of one of the computers 
belonging to the network 
he said chances of identifying that person were extremely 
slim

a group of import car dealers is spending 
upwards of 1 million on a lastminute boost for republicans in four 
closely contested senate races and democrats say that in one case 
florida the spending is illegal 
these foreign car dealers are running a national political 
campaign complete with a web of pollsters media and directmail 
consultants time buyers and other political operatives all over 
the country charged bob chlopak director of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee 
the ads polls and directmail appeals are being paid for by the 
auto dealers and drivers for free trade political action committee 
based in jamaica ny the group described in a pac guide as 
representing mostly dealers of japanese cars says it seeks to 
promote election of lawmakers who oppose import restrictions 
the group is supporting the reelection bids of sens chic hecht 
in nevada and malcolm wallop in wyoming and is backing gop 
candidates in open seats in florida and mississippi according to 
documents filed with the federal election commission 
chlopak called it the biggest effort by a single group to 
influence senate elections since 1980 when ncpac the national 
conservative political action committee spent 1 million against 
six democratic incumbents that much money poured into tight races 
late in the campaign can take on undue importance he said 
their lastminute communications blitz is sufficient to be 
decisive he said thursday at a news conference 
specialinterest pacs by law can give no more than 5000 
directly to a candidate in each primary or general election but 
there is no ceiling for independent expenditures those made in a 
candidates behalf without coordination or consultation with the 
campaign 
the democratic campaign committee filed a formal complaint with 
the fec alleging that in the case of florida the import dealers 
blitz is not truly independent of the campaign of gop candidate 
connie mack the same media buyer and directmail consultant used by 
mack also is being used by the dealers group in other states 
robert bauer a lawyer for the democratic committee said such 
sharing of agents creates a legal presumption that independence has 
been violated and puts a burden on the dealers to prove they have 
not engaged in collusion he asked the fec for a quick decision on 
the complaint and for an injunction to remove the florida spots from 
the air 
the chairman of the import dealers group tom nemet said in a 
telephone interview that the group had adhered to the law and he 
accused the democrats of attempting to intimidate his organization 
according to fec reports the import dealers pac is spending 
382473 to support hechts effort to defend his seat against 
nevada gov richard bryan the money is buying a lastminute blitz 
of television advertising that includes positive spots for hecht and 
an attack on bryan on the issue of social security the group also 
paid for a 650000piece mass mailing for hecht in the past week 
311550 to boost mack who is locked in a close race with 
democratic rep buddy mackay for the florida seat of retiring sen 
lawton chiles the money is going for tv spots comparing macks and 
mackays votes on taxes and concludes a vote for connie mack is 
a vote for lower taxes 
319126 in mississippi to blanket the state with positive 
spots for rep trent lott who is trying to capture the senate seat 
of retiring democratic sen john stennis lott is opposed by 
democratic rep wayne dowdy 
84860 to support wallops reelection bid in wyoming 
including positive tv spots that began on tuesday and a 
150000piece mass mailing 
frank glacken the pacs executive director said the group also 
is supporting two house democratic reelection bids spending 
45000 for rep richard stallings of idaho and 85000 for rep 
david skaggs of colorado 
the group has made direct contributions to a large number of 
democratic senate incumbents as well as 15000 gifts in 1987 and 
1988 to the democratic senatorial campaign committee he said 
primarily we want to go in and support people who are free 
traders glacken said while it looks like were spending a lot 
of money labor unions give out millions he said he added that 
the giving was partly an attempt to balance the money from labor 
which he said often advocates protectionist trade legislation 
glacken said the group receives its money from about 2000 of the 
4500 people who own foreign car franchises in the united states he 
said contributors include both dealers of japanese and european 
cars and he disputed published descriptions of the group as 
dominated by dealers of japanese vehicles

an early look at a sixyear study of the 
health effects of radioactive fallout shows no strong evidence 
of a link between exposure and leukemia and thyroid disorders the 
projects director says 
the 7 million study funded by the national cancer institute is 
intended to determine whether people living downwind of aboveground 
atomic bomb tests in nevada in the 1950s and 1960s suffered an 
increased rate of cancer 
because all the data has not been tabulated it is not possible 
to say definitely there is or is not an effect said dr walter 
stevens interim dean of the university of utah medical school and 
director of the study 
however he said thursday there is no strong evidence that 
would convince me that there was a relationship between 
fallout and disease 
stevens emphasized that epidemiological findings still are being 
analyzed and that no final conclusions would be drawn until a draft 
report had been reviewed by the national cancer institute 
the draft likely will be delivered to nci by midnovember and the 
finished report released next march he said 
for years people living in southwestern utah southeastern 
nevada and northeastern arizona have feared that exposure to about 
80 openair tests at the nevada test site had increased the 
potential for leukemia and thyroid cancers 
in 1979 dr joseph l lyon an university of utah epidemiologist 
who is working on the current study published a paper showing a 
24fold increase in childhood leukemia in the areas of southern 
utah heavily dusted by fallout 
meanwhile nearly 1200 people living downwind of the tests sued 
the federal government claiming that exposure to fallout caused 
sickness and death in 1982 us district judge bruce jenkins ruled 
the government had failed to warn residents of radiation hazards 
however the 10th us circuit court of appeals overturned the 
ruling and the us supreme court concurred saying the government 
was immune from damages 
the latest study was conducted in two parts one for leukemia 
and the other for thyroid disorders and was designed as the most 
comprehensive undertaking of its kind 
researchers located the names of 1177 people from all over utah 
who had died of leukemia between 1952 and 1966 and selected as 
controls another 5600 people who had died of other causes 
the subjects were matched where possible in age residence 
health and lifestyle to ensure valid comparisons stevens said 
in the thyroid study 2829 subjects in southern utah 
southeastern nevada and southern arizona were identified as having 
been exposed and about 280 were found to have thyroid abnormalities 
scientists closely researched production distribution and 
consumption of milk thought to be one of the primary ways children 
might have ingested radioactive materials from fallout 
stevens said the research has been greatly aided by the release 
of previously classified information from the department of energy 
on the amount of radiation emitted by the tests 
stevens said the study could prove to be a milestone in research 
on the effects of exposure to radiation with particular 
significance to safety concerns at the nations nuclear production 
plants

the soviets have a clear favorite in next weeks 
us presidential election unfortunately for them his name is 
ronald reagan and the constitution wont let him run again 
as george bush and michael dukakis make their last campaign 
swings before tuesdays election soviets are waxing nostalgic about 
the outgoing eightyear tenant in the white house who once called 
their country an evil empire and joked about bombing it into 
oblivion 
they are also looking ahead to a bush victory although without 
apparent relish 
to be quite frank i cant say ive personally been carried 
away by the statements of either bush or dukakis when they spoke of 
sovietamerican relations nikolai v shishlin a spokesman for 
the communist party central committee told a news briefing 
thursday i think its president reagan who gave the best 
statement a few days ago 
reagan once caricatured by the party daily pravda as a 
missiletoting cowboy now is portrayed as a reliable bargaining 
partner who sat down with president mikhail s gorbachev and 
negotiated a nuclear missile treaty and instigated negotiations in 
geneva for a 50 percent cut in strategic arms 
but such expressions of respect dont mean soviet officials have 
fallen wholeheartedly for reagan shishlin made a point of rejecting 
outright his most recent pronouncement that the diplomatic warming 
between moscow and washington was due to the reagan administration 
policy of negotiating from a position of strength 
kremlin watchers have been hardput to find a preference in 
soviet news accounts or official statements for either the 
republican vice president or the democratic massachusetts governor 
we prefer the winner foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said thursday when asked which candidate the soviets 
wanted to see in the white house 
gerasimov said the soviets would like a prompt summit with the 
next president of the united states whoever he may be 
officials acknowledge their cautious nonpartisanship is 
motivated by fears that showing a preferance for one man could brand 
him the kremlins candidate and doom his chances for election 
rival candidates will allegedly take advantage of our kind 
words and try to discredit the opponent who merited the praise of 
the soviet press wrote commentator melor sturua does anyone 
seriously believe that the soviet press can make or break us 
presidents that is to put it mildly nonsense 
sturuas article published in the weekly moscow news blasted 
soviet media for overly cautious coverage of the us race and 
included this unusual endorsement personally i prefer dukakis 
but i think bush will win 
such candor is rare but an indication of the new latitude 
permitted for media that make no pretense of speaking with the voice 
of the party or government 
a telephone call thursday to the official news agency tass for a 
copy of its most recent commentary on the us presidential campaign 
brought this reply from an editor we have had no commentary why 
should we we dont want to interfere in another countrys affairs 
that sensitivity to interfering in the internal politics of the 
other superpower talk is a marked departure from previous practice 
in the soviet medias coverage of the race for the white house in 
1984 tass condemned reagans decision to run for reelection 
saying his claim to have made the world safer was an obvious lie 
reports showing bush and dukakis stumping are frequent fare on 
soviet television news programs and recent reports have prepared 
soviets for a bush victory by telling them that the dukakis campaign 
is in trouble 
maxim knyazkov of the daily sovietskaya rossiya wrote thursday 
it seems to me that even at the final stage dukakis campaign 
lacks solidity it resembles not a carefully worked out 
counteroffensive but a feverish race after a hat blown away by the 
wind and when explaining to americans why they should not vote for 
bush dukakis to my mind has failed to explain why they should vote 
for him 
the soviets have just had their own presidential elections which 
again highlighted the contrasting political systems of the 
superpowers 
with practically no warning the supreme soviet or parliament 
elected gorbachev president on oct 1 naming him to replace the 
retiring chief of state andrei a gromyko 
the vote was 15000 in gorbachevs favor and the communist 
party chief never had to wear a funny hat or eat a blintz

the general assembly reached unanimity 
thursday on afghanistan demanding a broadbased government and an 
end to outside interference in afghan affairs 
the consensus resolution sponsored by pakistan and the soviet 
union passed by acclaimation 
it says the war results from the violation of principles of the 
charter of the united nations and of the recognized norms of 
interstate conduct which could be interpreted as a slap at the 
soviets for entering afghanistan or moslem insurgents who operate 
from bases in pakistan 
in previous years the assembly overwhelmingly passed resolutions 
calling for withdrawal of foreign forces from afghanistan with 
the soviet union and its allies voting against 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in 
december 1979 the soviets had an estimated 115000 soldiers in the 
country and began withdrawing may 15 under a unmediated agreement 
in september soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told 
a un news conference pakistan was aiding the insurgents he said 
half the soviet troops had withdrawn but the second phase of the 
withdrawal depended on how the united nations dealt with moscows 
complaints 
ambassador dante caputo of argentina the general assembly 
president said thursday much remains to be done in order to 
achieve a comprehensive solution of the afghan question including 
the problem of the refugees and the difficulties in setting in 
motion the necessary interafghan dialogue aimed at establishing a 
broadbased government acceptable to the afghan people 
before the war afghanistans population was about 155 million 
but about onethird have fled more than 3 million to pakistan and 
nearly all the others to iran most of those in pakistan live in 
border cities and refugee camps that serve as bases and supply 
points for the guerrillas 
the united nations has begun a program to resettle the refugees 
and rebuild afghanistans shattered agricultural economy 
afghanistans government invited the insurgents discuss a 
coalition government but they refused 
burhanuddin rabbani chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance said thursday the puppet regime is the shadow of the 
russian troops in afghanistan as soon as the russian troops are out 
of the country the shadow will also disappear

iraq which acknowledged using poison gas 
in its war with iran has agreed to help investigate allegations of 
chemical warfare in the world according to a un document 
the report by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
chemical and biological weapons released thursday includes the 
responses of 17 nations that have offered the use of laboratories or 
experts in chemical warfare to develop ways of detecting use of such 
weapons 
iraq offered the services of two doctors two chemists and a 
pharmacologist but said it is not possible for iraqi laboratories 
to be used in chemical and biological warfare investigations 
last summer iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz was questioned 
about alleged chemical warfare in the persian gulf war and 
responded that iraq used such weapons only after iran used them 
first 
iran says it has the ability to make chemical weapons but has 
never used them investigations by un experts confirmed that iraq 
used chemical weapons against iran throughout the war which began 
in september 1980

between the mortality rates for black and white infants born in the 
united states is continuing to widen 
the childrens defense fund basing its study on data released by 
the national center for health statistics a federal agency said 
thursday it found a blackwhite infant mortality ratio of 202 in 
1986 the most recent year for which figures were available 
the findings mean a black baby was more than twice as likely to 
die in infancy as a white baby that compared to a 196 ratio in 
1985 and 169 in 1940 
it added that while the death rates among black and white 
infants for nonpreventable birth defects was virtually identical 
black babies were far more likely to die of preventable causes such 
as inadequate prenatal care 
they were four times more likely to die of prematurity and low 
birth weight three times more likely to die of pneumonia influenza 
and homicide and two times more likely to die as a result of newborn 
and maternal complications infections and accidents the fund said 
overall the us infant mortality rate declined slightly from 
106 deaths per 1000 live births in 1985 to 104 in 1986 
the mortality rate for black infants in 1986 was 18 per 1000 
births and for white infants 89 per 1000 births

do americans blame the president or his party 
for the weather a case could be made at least statistically 
that they do 
thats because historically droughts have tended to be followed 
by a change in the party in charge of the white house 
eight times in this century the white house has changed party 
four times in drier than normal years 
four times in moist years that happened to come at the end of a 
fouryear term of drier than normal weather 
climate thus would seem to give an edge to democrat michael 
dukakis although the polls indicate a lead for republican george 
bush 
studies of the 1800s when the nation was more economically 
dependent on the farm population show a regular pattern of 
political upheavals at the white house in the wake of drought 
this summers drought came after a dry 1987 but followed several 
relatively moist years before that 
the pattern was similar though not as severe in the dry 
season of 1980 when republican ronald reagan ousted democrat jimmy 
carter 
and carter won office in 1976 a dry year that followed nearly a 
decade of normal or above normal wetness according to records kept 
by the national climatic data center 
republican richard nixon ended eight years of democrats in the 
white house in 1968 a year when rainfall was slightly above median 
but which followed dry years in 1966 and 1967 
john f kennedy won in 1960 as three years of moist conditions 
ended and the nation slipped into a slightly drier than normal 
season 
and 1952 marked the first dry season in eight years a year that 
dwight eisenhower turned the democrats out of the white house for 
the first time in two decades 
it was the famous dust bowl years of the 1930s that saw the 
democrats take up residence there of course with franklin d 
roosevelt winning the office 
the gop had captured the executive mansion in 1920 the second 
straight moist year but following a drought in 191718 
in 1912 democrat woodrow wilson took office also in the second 
year after a drought 
in addition it may have been clearing weather in california that 
saved his second term 
the 1916 election came just a day after a major storm struck the 
pacific coast delaying results from california which wilson won by 
a narrow margin wilsons win was helped by a strong vote in the 
heavily democratic counties in the states northeast an area that 
had been blanketed by snow the day before 
while many changes at the white house have followed droughts 
there have of course been dry years that didnt see a change in 
party notably 1924 1936 and 1956 which were below normal in rain 
but which saw calvin coolidge roosevelt and eisenhower retain their 
offices

actress mary tyler moore and tv producer norman 
lear are among a wide range of celebrities financiers and others 
who gave large sums to the democratic national committee in the past 
year according to party records 
notables who made sizable contributions of less than 100000 
included california stat legislator tom hayden the husband of 
actress jane fonda 60000 miss moore 10000 miami dolphins 
owner joseph robbie 50000 and lear 25000 
the information was contained in dnc records filed in austin 
texas 
the funds were given to the national committees soft money 
account which does not have to conform to limits imposed on the 
candidates and the political parties by the federal election 
commission 
the socalled soft money accounts are largely transferred by both 
the republican and democratic national committees to state parties 
democratic national chairman paul g kirk jr has said he would 
disclose details of the committees softmoney fund raising after 
the election 
texas law however requires the parties to file either a list of 
donors or a federal election commission registration record when 
they transfer money into the state from elsewhere 
since the soft money was not raised under federal limits the 
democrats were required to submit a list of donors 
those listed as contributing 100000 were

like a military general waging a campaign far 
afield democrat michael dukakis has left a small garrison of 
trusted aides back in massachusetts to protect his home territory 
from enemy attacks 
the dukakis effort to carry massachusetts on election day has all 
the elements of the presidential nominees other statewide campaigns 
except one the candidate 
basically we are running a traditional democratic campaign in 
this state not unlike the campaigns he ran when he was running for 
governor said james mcgovern a spokesman for the dukakis 
campaign in massachusetts 
mcgovern and other dukakis aides have complained for weeks that 
they are stuck between a rock and a hard place 
if they wage a strong campaign here they are vulnerable to 
charges that the governor is so weak that he is afraid of losing his 
home state if they dont campaign hard they are open to the rap 
that they are taking the state for granted 
were in a situation where were damned if we do and damned if 
we dont mcgovern moaned 
they have decided to err on the side of caution although the 
national campaign strategists have raided the boston headquarters 
for field workers the campaign has kept 12 paid staff working 
fulltime on delivering massachusetts 
were running a campaign mcgovern insisted by contrast i 
am unaware of any semblance of a field organization put together in 
massachusetts by the bush camp in fact i am unaware of any 
campaign other than what goes on in the statehouse by a few 
republican legislators i dont see evidence of any real outreach 
in fact the bush campaign has not written off massachusetts 
at the urging of andrew card a former republican legislator in 
massachusetts and a former reagan white house aide the bush 
national campaign has used massachusetts adroitly to keep dukakis on 
the defensive 
in a state where democrats outnumber republicans by about 41 and 
where no republican except ronald reagan has won a statewide 
election since 1972 the bush forces are overmatched on the ground 
by the dukakis team 
but the republicans have run a sharper campaign offering almost 
daily press conferences to undermine dukakis standing 
the campaign also scored a major coup on sept 1 when the vice 
president toured polluted boston harbor and attacked dukakis record 
on the environment the campaign was buoyed by a second bush visit 
for a showy endorsement from the boston police patrolmens 
association 
according to published polls the bush effort has had some impact 
in the state where dukakis won a landslide reelection to a third 
term just two years ago with nearly 70 percent of the vote 
a series of surveys by krc research published in the boston 
herald indicated that dukakis enjoyed a 5137 percent lead in july 
that edge disappeared by sept 1 when the poll showed the race a 
dead heat at 42 percent 
by midoctober however dukakis had fought back to a 10point 
advantage in massachusetts leading bush by 4939 percent only to 
see bush gain three points among undecideds and close to 4942 
percent as of tuesday 
james french dukakis massachusetts campaign coordinator was 
publicly more upbeat than the figures might suggest saying were 
confident of a big victory in massachusetts 
to make sure of that the dukakis camp has mobilized its 
customarily strong field organization with 34 field offices in the 
state phone banks signholding assignments in 123 cities and towns 
and an extensive getoutthevote effort on election day 
the campaign has also dropped more than one million pieces of 
literature at homes statewide and plans to use 3000 volunteers in 
the election day operation 
the campaign also is running short radio advertisements attacking 
the bush record on the environment elderly and the economy along 
with some television ads in springfield for the most part though 
they are relying on what campaign aides call free media that 
is news coverage

president reagan asks americans to continue 
the change by voting republican and democrats hit hard on 
pocketbook issues and dan quayles qualifications in the latest 
barrage of political television ads 
the national parties launched their final round thursday with 
the republicans showcasing reagan and the democrats appealing to the 
average persons pocketbook in generic spots designed to drum up 
support for candidates from president on down 
democrat michael dukakis campaign unleashed its latest broadside 
against gop vice presidential nominee quayle a 30second spot 
featuring a wellknown excerpt from his debate with lloyd bentsen 
the democratic vice presidential debate 
onscreen appear the words before you vote remember this 
followed by the debate clip 
quayle i have as much experience in the congress as jack 
kennedy did when he sought the presidency 
bentsen i served with jack kennedy i knew jack kennedy jack 
kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack kennedy 
these words then appear president quayle 
both dukakis and republican george bush are running a varied mix 
of upbeat and attack ads in key tv markets across the country their 
themes but not their names appear in numerous generic tv and radio 
spots produced by the republican and democratic national committees 
the rnc entered the final phase of its 9 million media drive 
thursday with the tv message from reagan america is at peace and 
we are prosperous once more reagan says in the ad on tuesday 
i hope you will vote republican up and down the ticket to 
continue the change we began in 1981 
the gop also has a 60second radio ad in which reagan recounts 
his record and says our work is not yet done he contends the 
gop has become the party of the working people the family and the 
neighborhood 
the dnc contending it is the true party of the average working 
person released two pocketbook appeals designed to bolster 
democratic local state and national candidates 
one dnc ad featuring festive images of the gop convention and 
headlines about nasty campaigning says whats hiding behind all 
of this the republican tax plan if you make 200000 you get a 
tax gift of 30000 if youre a typical middle class taxpayer 
like most of us the republicans will give you a tax break too 
twenty bucks 
in the other dnc spot an announcer bemoans foreign loans and 
land purchases and the millions of us jobs he says were shipped 
overseas are the republicans selling out americas future he 
asks 
both the rnc and dnc are running numerous radio commercials as 
well dnc officials wont discuss their advertising budget other 
than to say this is the first time theyve been able to raise enough 
money for generic media 
each national party has produced six tv ads in all but while 
most of the dnc ads ran briefly and then vanished the rnc is still 
using spots it was airing as far back as july 
earlier dnc spots discussed the future of americas children 
attacked the gop record on the federal deficit and charged that gop 
prosperity hasnt trickled down to workers or the elderly 
one of the rncs longrunning spots shows a little girl who an 
announcer says has known virtually nothing but peace and economic 
growth thanks to republicans another flashes images of inflation 
gas lines and jimmy carter set to the tune i remember you 
a third republican spot on the air since oct 10 shows pilot 
chuck yeager in a defense plant alleging when liberal democrats 
talk about slashing defense spending theyre not just talking about 
america losing ground theyre talking about americans losing jobs 
the republicans also are using two hispanic television ads one 
talking about hispanic gains during the reagan years and another 
citing recently named education secretary lauro cavazos as a 
friend in washington 
the justice department meanwhile said it will investigate a 
spanishlanguage radio ad running in hidalgo county in south texas 
democrats complained gop officials in the county are violating 
federal voting rights laws by running ads that cite penalties for 
noncitizens who vote and that twice remind listeners election 
officials will be watching 
republican officials defended the ads as proper and said they are 
not an attempt at intimidation 
and in washington state the bush campaign has cut much of its 
seattle television advertising in the last days before the election 
station officials said dan cumming of the state bush campaign said 
the decision was made at the national level and did not reflect any 
decision to write off the state 
a statewide poll conducted by kingtv in seattle and released 
thursday did show dukakis with a 10point advantage over george 
bush 5141 but the survey of likely voters had a fivepoint margin 
of error

the students duel with the american 
flags instead of waving them and they cheer in the wrong place in a 
speech but george bush is spending a lot of campaign time in high 
schools 
a desire to be the education president has little to do with 
the visits bush campaign planners like the readymade energetic 
audiences that high schools particularly those in republican areas 
can provide 
the school bands and always always the rows of spangled 
cheerleaders on the stage with pompons make for a colorful rally 
to be seen by the millions more who watch snippets of the events on 
the local evening television news 
thus bush can appeal to bluecollar reagan democrats in 
pivotal industrial midwestern states without having to go into their 
neighborhoods 
we often go to schools which are familiar landscapes in the 
communities said sheila tate bushs press secretary at this 
time of the year you like to have indoor events and often in a 
community a school is the biggest facility 
we also love the exuberance of the voters of tomorrow 
there lies one of the problems when bush tells rally 
participants to go out and vote because he needs their help more 
often than not most of them arent old enough so bush sometimes 
adds an admonition to tell your parents 
and even though republican campaign workers do their best to plan 
every detail the results arent always what is expected when 
audiences are so young 
for instance at a fieldhouse rally at bloom township high school 
in this chicago suburb on thursday muscular actor arnold 
schwarzenegger got a far bigger cheer than did bush 
the vice presidents reference to the l word mostly drew a 
blank and some students in the back of the hall ignored the speech 
entirely and had sword fights with the american flags camaign 
workers had distributed 
teenagers screech scream wave flags and constantly blow 
airhorns handed out in the dozens by campaign staffers 
they cheer sometimes indiscriminately giving equally loud cheers 
to mention of the death penalty or to a mention by bush that a 
democratic congress will spend more tax dollars 
bush apologized to students at one lateafternoon rally at 
lansing catholic central in michigan this week for their being 
made to stay after school by their principal but this is one 
great rally 
bush has been hitting a high school or two a day for the past few 
weeks 
high schools are picked for bushs standard rally speech more 
serious speeches are usually delivered to college audiencies or to 
meetings of national organizations 
but with the campaign winding down most of bushs remaining 
appearances will be at rallies and that more often than not means 
more high schools 
bush isnt the only presidential candidate to use high school 
rallies as a frequent forum for campaign appearances president 
reagan did it and so does democrat michael dukakis 
this is not a campaign about prison furloughs and flag 
factories dukakis said recently at a high school in another 
chicago suburb this is a campaign about the future of america 
and especially about young people 
national public opinion polls show there is an age gap usually 
in the double digits with bush generally enjoying more support 
among the youngest voters than dukakis

republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle says michael dukakis tough talk on drugs rings 
hollow because the attorney general of massachusetts has 
complained of losing ground against narcotics traffickers 
seeking to counteract dukakis attacks on vice president george 
bushs record in the reagan administration antidrug abuse fight 
quayle used an oklahoma state university speech to label the 
massachusetts governor soft on crime 
quayle standing before a crowd of more than 4000 college 
students and citizens of this oklahoma college town sent a 
longdistance challenge to dukakis to explain a statement by the 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon a democrat 
were losing the war on drugs in the commonwealth of 
massachusetts quayle quoted shannon as saying an aide to the 
senator said that shannons statement had appeared in june 10 
editions of the new york times 
with five days to go before the election mr dukakis is coming 
out with a lot of tough talk about a war on drugs quayle said 
but as with so many other areas of tough talk the governors 
position on drugs rings hollow 
if mr dukakis cant fight drugs effectively in his own 
backyard how can he make claims to do so for america he asked 
late thursday shannon issued a statement through the dukakis 
campaign saying the reason we have a drug problem in 
massachusetts and 49 other states is because george bush blew the 
one job ronald reagan gave him and that was to spearhead the 
administrations war on drugs 
while governor dukakis led the nation in bringing early drug 
education into the schools and spending more money on drug 
enforcement george bush was asleep at the wheel 
quayle said that dukakis opposition to the death penalty and 
tough mandatory sentences for narcotics traffickers shows the 
governor is unequipped to succeed in the battle against drug 
trafficking and drug use 
quayle gave his speech to an enthusiastic crowd on the osu 
campus although there were dukakisbentsen signs and some hecklers 
in the audience as a blue balloon prematurely escaped its net and 
sailed over quayles head the senator quipped good night mike 
the indiana senator was traveling to louisiana and alabama today 
before heading back to washington for a onenight stay 
quayle will campaign in maryland and west virginia on saturday 
but no schedule has been announced for sunday he will travel to 
indianapolis on monday cast his vote and return to washington for 
tuesday nights election returns 
quayles speech here came at the end of a rocky campaign day in 
which his boeing 727 jet was grounded on an airport runway in 
owensboro ky for several hours and he had to scrub two 
appearances in the greenvillespartanburg sc area instead 
quayle flew to the greenville airport and met with reporters from 
the area shook a few hands in a small crowd and got back on the 
plane for the trip to oklahoma 
meeting with reporters from various news organizations in 
oklahoma quayle signaled what responsibilities he might have in a 
bush administration 
although he said he thought it was bad luck to talk about 
such a scenario before election day quayle did say that bush had 
talked to him about heading a space council 
he also noted previous talk of quayle heading the antidrug abuse 
effort although the senator also said that legislation passed by 
congress in its waning days would require that a drug czar be a 
cabinet officer 
quayle also said that his experience on the congressional foreign 
relations panels would make him a valuable member of the national 
security council and said he considered himself particularly well 
equipped to provide advice on education and jobtraining programs

soviet spy satellite photographs can 
now be purchased from a munich company 
we use soviet us and french satellite photographs for 
research you can get them from us but were not officially 
marketing them rupert haydn managing director of the company for 
applied remote sensing gaf said thursday 
haydn said gaf works closely with the moscowbased soyuzkarta 
company from which the satellite photographs are obtained 
the gaf staff uses modern digital processing to develop data from 
satellite photographs for environmental and climate surveillance 
forestry agriculture and other areas of research haydn said 
the company recently obtained a photograph of a 37squaremile 
area surrounding munich from soyuzkarta that had been taken from 
about 125 miles high by a soviet kosmos satellite 
it shows highways streets buildings and objects as small as 16 
feet in size 
they are of good quality haydn said he said the photographs 
were several years old and no doubt at one time they could have 
been used for military reconnaissance 
haydn said the cost of a soviet satellite photograph is about 
980 or nearly equal to the 1000 charged for a us version

a us expert on the middle east with ties to 
george bushs presidential campaign met with syrian officials in 
august in an attempt to free the us hostages in lebanon abctvs 
nightline reported wednesday 
after the us government learned of the meeting secretary of 
state george shultz told syria that the expert paul jureidini in 
no way represented the government the program reported shultz also 
told jureidini to end any such contacts 
a spokesman for vice president bush mark goodin denied that 
jureidinis meeting was in any way sanctioned by the campaign as 
late as july jureidini served as an unpaid consultant on the middle 
east to the campaign nightline said 
jureidini who has been a frequent pentagon consultant and has 
toplevel us security clearance said on the program that he told 
his syrian hosts during the meeting in damascus that he was acting 
on his own joining jureidini at the meeting was his partner ronald 
mclaurin 
nightline quoting syrian sources reported that during the 
aug 16 meeting jureidini and his hosts discussed options for 
securing the release of the nine american hostages and what the 
impact of any such release would be on the us presidential 
election 
nightline also reported that the release last month of 
hostage mithileshwar singh an indian professor who is a legal 
resident of the united states followed thirdparty contacts between 
the united states and iran 
the program said the intermediary was west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher through this channel shultz told 
iran that the us hostages must be freed if there is to be real 
progress in improving usiranian relations 
following this contact substantial pressure was exerted on the 
hezbollah the radical group in lebanon believed to be holding the 
hostages nightline reported that pressure led to singhs 
release it said 
following his release the us government sent word to iran via 
the japanese government that all the us hostages must be released 
and that there would be no deal and no negotiations nightline 
reported 
iranian officials said that response was an insult that iran was 
not trying to make a deal only start a process that would lead to 
the release of the other hostages the program reported 
from the iranian perpective the singh release was a gesture that 
could have led to more releases nightline said but the us 
response in the iranian view resulted in the door slamming shut 
it reported 
us officials told the program that the response was consistent 
with us policy on the hostages 
nightline reported that the west german contact was just one 
of many such contacts regarding the hostages between iranian 
officials and people who claimed to represent either the us 
government or the presidential campaigns of bush or michael dukakis 
spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any such 
contacts 
the number of such contacts was so great that in october the 
iranian government complained in an official message to the us 
government nightline reported iran refused to provide the 
names of those it claims made such contacts the show reported 
in early october shultz announced that such contacts were 
unauthorized and that those making them should butt out and let 
the state department handle the hostage situation

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen combined a little capitol hill politics with his 
national campaign by endorsing sen bennett johnston dla to 
become the next senate democratic leader 
campaigning in louisiana one of the few southern states where 
polls show the democrats are within a few points of the republicans 
bentsen spoke at a rally thursday night in favor of johnston 
as far as im concerned this fellow is going to be the new 
majority leader of the united states senate said bentsen 
thats a public pledge and commitment right there 
it was the first time the texas senator has taken a public stand 
on the race to replace robert c byrd who is retiring as majority 
leader this year 
johnston and sens daniel inouye dhawaii and george mitchell 
dme are competing for the powerful post the position will remain 
with the democrats if they retain a majority in the chamber 
asked about bentsens statement afterward johnston said his 
colleague had made his preference known privately but never before 
in public asked how he was doing in the race johnston held up his 
hand to show his thumb and forefinger held a little bit apart 
bentsen planned to stop in houston today before heading to 
california for a quick campaign swing 
bentsens stand on the senate leadership issue marked an abrupt 
change from the downhome east texas politics that occupied most of 
his day on thursday 
bentsen toured by bus more than 200 miles through the rural 
communities near the louisiana and arkansas borders the goal was to 
win reagan democrats to the dukakisbentsen ticket 
in speeches in longview paris and sulphur springs bentsen 
highlighted the democratic campaigns theme that he and presidential 
nominee michael dukakis were on the side of the middle class and 
were willing to stand up for american workers in international trade 
negotiations 
talking to reporters on his bus bentsen said he still thought 
the democrats could eke out a victory next tuesday but he also 
speculated on the kind of relationship george bush might have with 
congress if elected president in light of the republicans negative 
campaigning 
i dont see how a president has any kind of mandate if he 
wins by the amount of negative advertising he said 
a new president usually has a honeymoon with congress but in 
bushs case it would be an awfully short one if you had that 
he said 
bentsen drew crowds at his events with the help of actor rob lowe 
and singer gary morris who accompanied him for the trip morris a 
texan who has also campaigned with dukakis introduced bentsen after 
warming up the crowds with a few songs

the fbi agent who began a successful 
classaction discrimination lawsuit against the bureau says he and 
other hispanic agents have since been harassed and they are asking 
a judge to bar such retaliation 
a 32page document filed thursday in us district judge lucius 
buntons court contains affidavits from three hispanic agents who 
contend they have been singled out and treated unfairly since bunton 
ruled sept 30 that the fbi discriminates against hispanics in 
promotions and job conditions 
fbi spokesman gregory jones in washington denied the allegations 
saying any intimidation or retaliation would be illegal and 
intolerable and would result in an fbi inquiry 
bernardo matt perez who initiated the classaction lawsuit 
in january 1987 contended in his affidavit that many of his duties 
as no 2 man in the el paso office have been taken away and that 
his boss has intimidated another agent for talking to reporters 
about the case 
an agent in miami fernando mata said in his affidavit that he 
needs psychiatric care for a traumatic stint as an undercover 
foreign counterintelligence agent but that the bureau has refused 
to grant security clearance to a psychiatrist outside the fbi 
mata who received the fbis highest award in 1983 for his 
overseas work said he prefers to see a psychiatrist who doesnt 
work for the bureau 
james garay an albuquerque agent contended in his affidavit 
that his gun and car were stripped from him under the pretext of a 
medical condition he said the bureau claimed he was too badly 
injured in an onthejob car accident 
the three agents who submitted the affidavits testified in the 
twoweek nonjury trial before bunton in august 
the 311 latino agents who joined the suit successfully argued 
that the fbi assigned them less desirable jobs promoted them too 
slowly and didnt give them the recognition they deserved for their 
successes 
bunton will rule on damages in future hearings he implied in his 
sept 30 decision that monetary damages might be small or 
nonexistent and that he might order the fbi to change the way it 
operates 
in his affidavit perez contended that since the verdict was 
announced i have been purposely divorced from many of the 
administrative operations of the office and from my daytoday 
management responsibilities 
perez boss agentincharge richard schwein said the allegation 
is not true 
he carries out the daytoday operations in this office and 
everyone in this office reports to him except me schwein said 
thursday 
schwein said he saw a tv interview of one hispanic agent in el 
paso on the night of the decision and that he talked to the man 
about it later 
i said hey pal you didnt say you were speaking as a 
citizen and not as a special agent of the fbi schwein said 
he added that he dropped the matter when the agent explained that 
such a comment had been edited out 
schwein said he feels more hurt than angry about perez 
allegations 
i resent having my integrity challenged he said i dont 
like falsehoods and i consider these falsehoods ive had no one 
walk in the door and say boss youre retaliating against me 
this affidavit was a stunning shock to me

doctors are letting alcoholics use hospitals as 
revolving doors by ignoring their drinking problems even though 
experience shows that alcoholism can be effectively treated 
researchers reported today 
at a connecticut hospitals emergency room not a single patient 
was referred for alcohol evaluation or assistance out of 47 who were 
found to have at least double the legal bloodalcohol limit the 
researchers said 
the subjects were among 346 motorvehicle accident victims whose 
cases were reviewed at the unidentified hospitals trauma center 
said the researchers led by dr grace chang of yale university 
school of medicine in new haven 
only about onefourth of the 346 patients were even tested for 
alcohol with 53 of them testing positive the researchers reported 
in todays journal of the american medical association 
fortyseven had levels of at least 200 milligrams of alcohol per 
deciliter of blood double the legal limit for drivers in 
connecticut the researchers said levels went as high as 550 
milligrams per deciliter they said 
bloodalcohol levels of 200 milligrams per deciliter are 
unusual in the course of ordinary social drinking and are 
considered an indication that a drinker has an alcohol problem 
however infrequent his inebriation the researchers said 
while unable to generalize about all physicians the researchers 
said this study and others indicate that recognition of alcohol 
problems in hospital emergency departments is limited as is 
referral for treatment 
despite evidence that alcoholism treatment success rates can be 
as good as or better than those for many medical problems 
alcoholics are permitted to use medical centers as revolving doors 
with the witting and unwitting complicity of the institutions the 
researchers said 
studies show that when doctors advise patients that their alcohol 
consumption is dangerous there is a high probability that the 
patient will cut back on use of the drug said an accompanying 
editorial in the journal 
studies of patients treated for alcoholism show that brief 
relapse peaking around six months after treatment is common but 
longterm improvement usually is the ultimate outcome added the 
editorial by dr julian r waller of the the university of vermont 
college of medicine in burlington 
a separate study in todays journal found that people who usually 
consumed five to eight drinks per occasion were almost twice as 
likely to die of an injury as nondrinkers or those who consumed one 
or two 
that study also found that people who consumed nine or more 
drinks per occasion had more than triple the risk of the 
lowconsumption groups 
the important finding in this study is that what people tell us 
about alcohol use related strongly to their future risk of dying 
from an injury said dr robert f anda coauthor of the study 
and a researcher at the national centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
we hope that this finding will help physicians become more 
involved in asking patients about their alcohol use anda added in 
a telephone interview thursday 
motor vehicle accidents accounted for about onefourth of the 
deaths among the studys subjects 13251 adults who answered 
questions about their drinking habits and then were tracked for nine 
years 
eightyone subjects suffered fatal injuries 24 in motor vehicle 
accidents 20 in suicides nine in homicides six in falls four in 
fires three each in drownings and poisonings and the others in 
miscellaneous ways the researchers found

new york los angeles and other major cities have 
sued the federal government claiming that undercounting in the 1990 
census could cost them billions of dollars and deprive minorities of 
their political clout 
this is one of the most important civil rights issues in the 
country today said peter zimroth new york citys chief attorney 
to the extent minorities black and hispanics in the inner cities 
are undercounted their vote is diluted 
the cities contend in the suit filed thursday that the census 
bureau was prepared to make adjustments to compensate for 
undercounting particularly of minority groups but that it was 
overruled last year by the commerce department its parent body 
congressional seats and federal grants are allocated on the basis 
of population if an area is undercounted it may have fewer 
representatives in the house and lose millions of dollars from 
washington 
the census as now structured misses many members of minority 
groups and illegal aliens the suit contends because many of them 
do not respond to the mailed census forms 
the suit says they could be counted if census takers visited 
homes in selected areas and projected the results 
also joining in the lawsuit were chicago and dade county fla 
which includes miami as well as the states of california and new 
york the us conference of mayors the national league of cities 
the league of united latin american citizens and the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
the suit was filed in us district court in brooklyn with the 
department of commerce the census bureau and president reagan among 
the defendants 
the census bureau has acknowledged it undercounts the population 
although the best estimates suggest that only about 1 percent of the 
total was missed in the last 1980 census but the bureau estimates 
the undercounting of blacks is 5 or 6 percentage points higher 
since it is hard to reach the innercity neighborhoods where many 
share addresses and distrust the government 
the commerce department referred all calls to the justice 
department amy brown a spokeswoman said the department had not 
yet received the complaint and therefore could not comment 
in los angeles according to city attorney james k hahn the 
population was undercounted by 46 percent in 1980 blacks living in 
los angeles were undercounted by 91 percent hispanics by 98 
percent and asians by 73 percent 
what makes this problem of undercounting particularly 
troublesome and even tragic is that the people most affected are 
the ones in the most dire need of adequate representation and 
help hahn said 
zimroth new yorks corporation counsel said the city was 
undercounted by about 500000 people in 1980 and that he expects the 
1990 census to be even less accurate 
new york state lost five of its 39 representatives as a result of 
the 1980 census and is expected to lose three more because of the 
1990 count according to election data services inc 
in chicago officials said the undercount costs the city more 
than 10 million a year in federal aid for social programs a seat 
in the state house of representatives half a seat in the state 
senate and onefourth of a congressional seat 
new york state attorney general robert abrams said an inaccurate 
census violates the principle of one man one vote 
it would mean that states cities and in particular minority 
communities will be shortchanged on funds for housing education 
health nutrition community development drug enforcement and other 
vital services he said 
zimroth said the city based much of its case on an affidavit by 
barbara bailar the census bureaus associate director for 
statistical standards who resigned after 29 years to protest the 
department of commerces decision not to go ahead with plans for an 
undercount correction 
ms bailar was the federal governments chief witness against the 
city in an unsuccessful similar suit new york brought to correct the 
1980 census she said then that the technology to make an accurate 
count was not available but later concluded it could be done 
no date has been set for a hearing in the case

a middle east expert who advised george bushs 
presidential campaign made an unsuccessful attempt to free the us 
hostages in lebanon by meeting with syrian officials abctvs 
nightline reported 
after the us government learned of the meeting secretary of 
state george shultz told syria that the expert paul jureidini in 
no way represented the government the program reported thursday 
shultz also told jureidini to end any such contacts 
a spokesman for vice president bushs campaign mark goodin 
denied that jureidinis aug 16 meeting was in any way sanctioned by 
the campaign as late as july jureidini served as an unpaid 
consultant on the middle east to the campaign nightline said 
nightline also reported that the release last month of 
hostage mithileshwar singh an indian professor who is a legal 
resident of the united states followed thirdparty contacts between 
the united states and iran 
the intermediary was west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher the program said 
jureidini who according to nightline has been a frequent 
pentagon consultant and has toplevel us security clearance said 
on the program that he told his syrian hosts during the meeting in 
damascus that he was acting on his own 
he said he did not consider his meeting improper since he was 
acting as a private citizen joining jureidini at the meeting was 
his partner ronald mclaurin 
nightline quoting syrian sources reported that during the 
meeting jureidini and his hosts discussed options for securing the 
release of the nine american hostages and what the impact of their 
release would be on the us presidential election 
before the release of singh shultz used genscher to tell iran 
that the us hostages must be freed if there is to be real progress 
in improving usiranian relations nightline reported 
following this contact substantial pressure was exerted on the 
hezbollah the radical group in lebanon believed to be holding the 
hostages the program said that pressure led to singhs release it 
said 
afterward the us government sent word to iran via the japanese 
government that all the us hostages must be released and that 
there would be no deal and no negotiations nightline reported 
the program quoted iranian officials as saying they considered 
that response an insult that iran was not trying to make a deal 
only to start a process that would lead to the release of the other 
hostages 
from the iranian perspective the singh release was a gesture 
that could have led to more releases nightline said but the 
us response in the iranian view resulted in the door slamming 
shut it reported 
us officials told the program that the response was consistent 
with us policy on the hostages 
nightline reported that iran said it was contacted about the 
release of the hostages by numerous people who claimed to represent 
either the us government or the presidential campaigns of bush or 
michael dukakis 
spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any such 
contacts and iran refused to provide names or other details the 
show reported 
the number of such contacts was so great that in october the 
iranian government complained in an official message to the us 
government nightline reported 
in early october shultz announced that such contacts were 
unauthorized and that those making them should butt out and let 
the state department handle the hostage situation

in his five previous statewide campaigns 
bernard sanders has been called spoiler and fringe candidate now in 
his sixth political campaign hes sporting a new label contender 
the socialist mayor of vermonts largest city is running as an 
independent for the states lone seat in the us house he is 
campaigning on the theme of shaking up washington and polls 
indicate voters are buying his message 
we have reached the stage where people are prepared to vote 
their conscience and for me that is a great step forward sanders 
said this week while he held his signs and waved to motorists in 
front of an ibm plant 
his candidacys strength is showing in campaign financing 
sanders has raised 224059 less than the 309226 raised by 
republican peter smith but more than the 199577 raised by the 
democratic nominee house majority leader paul poirier 
and his strength is shown by a growing number of hardline 
democrats who are switching to sanders former attorney general m 
jerome diamond the 1980 democratic gubernatorial nominee said hes 
backing sanders over poirier 
im not willing to throw my vote away said diamond pauls 
candidacy at this point is not one in which we can give our vote and 
expect it not to be lost 
an independent poll of likely voters conducted in early october 
gave sanders nearly 25 percent of the vote behind smiths 39 
percent poirier had 17 percent 
a sanders tracking poll early last week showed sanders closing 
the gap on smith with undecided voters going to sanders and poirier 
sanders has worked in vermont as a carpenter youth counselor 
freelance writer and film maker he produced 25 films on new 
england history two television productions one on socialist eugene 
v debs and one on poverty in vermont and several radio programs on 
vermont history 
in the 1970s he was a perennial candidate of the liberty union 
a leftist party in vermont he ran for governor and us senate but 
garnered few votes 
in 1976 sanders quit the party and later began concentrating his 
political efforts in burlington in 1981 he ran for mayor as an 
independent and ousted the longtime democratic incumbent by 10 
votes an election that shocked the political establishment 
he proved his election was no fluke by winning reelection in 
1983 1985 and 1987 and gaining national acclaim for his work as 
mayor 
two years ago sanders returned to statewide politics as an 
independent winning 14 percent of the vote in a threeway race for 
governor 
if he won sanders would be one of the few socialists in congress 
and the only one to be elected as an independent other socialists 
who have gone to congress have been elected on the republican or 
democratic tickets the last time a representative won election as a 
socialist was in 1929 
sanders has campaigned on promises of shaking up capitol hill 
just as hes has made some waves in vermont and hes argued that 
hed be good for vermont precisely because he has no debts to a 
party 
though he wins widespread praise for being an effective mayor 
his style is often criticized as too confrontational but some who 
have worked with him call him an adroit politician 
the people who dont deal with him are the people who think 
hes an ineffective radical with hot matches stuck between his 
toes said stephen jeffrey executive director of a lobbying group 
representing most vermont municipalities 
youre just about to say im going to fight this guy to the 
bitter end and you find yourself linking arms with him said 
jeffrey

the general assembly has overwhelmingly 
condemned israel for beating wounding killing and deporting 
palestinans since the uprising began dec 8 in the occupied 
territories 
only the united states and israel voted thursday against the 
resolution while 130 nations voted for it sixteen abstained 
including britain and canada 
the resolution said the assembly condemns israels persistent 
policies and practices violating the human rights of the palestinian 
people in the occupied territories including jerusalem 
every year the general assembly overwhelmingly condemns israeli 
human rights practices in the occupied territories 
us ambassador herbert s okun the deputy permanent 
representative said the resolution is an unbalanced document 
condemning one of the parties for its actions without taking into 
account acts of violence by the other side 
the security of the state of israel must be assured at the 
same time the legitimate political rights of the palestinian people 
must be recognized okun said 
the resolution criticized israeli troops and settlers for 
shooting and wounding defenseless palestinian civilians the 
beating and breaking of bones deportation imposition of 
restrictive economic measures demolition of houses collective 
punishment and detentions as well as denial of access to the 
media 
it also demands that israel the occupying power abide 
immediately and scrupulously by the 4th geneva convention on 
protection of civilians in time of war 
m nasser alkidwa the plos deputy un representative said 
that since the uprising began nearly 11 months ago 411 civilians 
were killed through oct 30 and 4500 wounded 
the toll he said includes 273 people who were shot by the army 
37 shot by israeli settlers 36 killed in beatings or under 
mysterious conditions and 65 by tear gas 
he charged that 11400 palestinians were detained without trial 
other estimates place the death toll at 306 palestinians and 10 
israelis 
israeli ambassador johanan bein responded by condemning 
palestinian guerrillas for burning families alive in firebombings 
bombing civilian buses and throwing grenades at sidewalk cafes and 
toy shops full of children 
an annual un report released thursday said the human rights 
situation in israels occupied territories has deteriorated 
dramatically since the palestinian uprising began 
the report said israels occupation of the west bank gaza strip 
and jerusalem since the 1967 middle east war is itself a violation 
of human rights 
it cited shootings and abuse of civilians including women and 
children deportation of activists detention of thousands of 
palestinians under harsh conditions the bulldozing of houses 
imposition of extended curfews economic sanctions restricted 
freedom of expression religion and travel 
the report said several thousand palestinians still are detained 
and denied a fair trial 
israel does not cooperate with the special committee which bases 
its reports on interviews and reports from numerous sources 
including respected israeli newspapers

the likelihood yitzhak shamir will head a 
rightwing government increases the prospect of more confrontation 
with palestinians and promises little real movement in the overall 
arabisraeli conflict 
on thursday shamir turned down the most extreme proposals on the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip expelling palestinians from the 
land and annexing it outright 
but according to aide yossi ahimeir the prime minister promised 
potential partners in a coalition led by his rightwing likud bloc 
that he would build more jewish settlements in the occupied west 
bank 
already much of the violence in the occupied lands begins with 
stoning or firebombing of israeli cars as jewish settlers drive from 
their enclaves through land whose 15 million arab residents want as 
an independent palestinian nation 
often the settlers are armed the army also responds with gunfire 
and by tearing down palestinian homes when firebombs are thrown 
more than 300 arabs and 10 israelis have died in the nearly 11month 
palestinian uprising 
now more than 70000 jews live in about 130 settlements the 
settler movement gush emunim or bloc of the faithful said 
thursday it hopes to start 11 more this month and build a total of 
50 within three years 
in addition to the potential for violence inherent in more 
settlements shamir will be under intense pressure to forcefully put 
down the intefadeh the revolt against israels 21year 
occupation 
among those he is talking to as coalition partners are farright 
and religious parties some of which want to expel the arabs and 
take over the west bank and gaza strip as part of biblical israel 
they are not likely to be conciliatory toward the palestinians 
who are themselves angry their uprising brought no political gains 
said kenaan a proplo west bank businessman said tuesdays vote 
showed israelis dont want peace and added we will hit back the 
moderate voice in the palestinian camp is finished 
eytan gilboa a hebrew university political science professor 
said an escalated cycle of violence could grow out of palestinian 
anger and pressures on the government to end the uprising 
if the levels of violence go up if there are more firebombs 
if weapons are used israel will respond with fire he said 
much of the election campaign focused on the future of the west 
bank and gaza strip the vote was advertised as a crucial choice 
between the leftleaning labor partys plan to give up land for 
peace and likuds hardline refusal to do so 
in the end the balloting gave a boost to religious parties but 
left unanswered the question of what to do with the occupied lands 
likud and labor each got only about onethird of the vote 
analyst yosef goell writing in the englishlanguage jerusalem 
post called the outcome a recipe of continued paralysis shamir 
will likely head a rightwing coalition or bring labor in as a 
junior partner 
his ideas will dominate and they do not promise movement he has 
rejected an international peace conference urged by the arabs and 
endorsed by foreign minister shimon peres of labor 
he refuses to give up occupied land his mentor prime minister 
menachem begins way of making peace with egypt in 1979 he offers 
autonomy to the palestinians under the camp david accords with 
the future status of the occupied lands to be worked out later 
shamir said last week that his election would signal the arabs 
that peace could only be achieved if egypt jordan and moderate 
palestinians join in direct talks with israel based on the 1978 
ussponsored accords 
but hanna siniora a palestinian moderate and editor of the 
proplo alfajr newspaper said the arabs will reject shamirs 
effort to resuscitate the camp david peace formula 
when asked how palestinians would deal with a likudled 
government he replied we will have to cope with a difficult 
situation and make these parties abandon the ideas of camp david 
which are not acceptable to anyone in the arab world

the proplo daily newspaper al fajr today 
published a draft declaration of independence for a palestinian 
state 
the arabiclanguage newspaper said speaker abdul hamid al sayeh 
would present the document for approval to the 453member palestine 
national council or plo parliament in exile on nov 14 in algeria 
a map accompanying the document shows the land to be divided into 
two states one israeli and one arab on the basis of a 1947 un 
partition resolution the mainstream palestine liberation 
organization newspaper said 
israel rejects the 1947 partition plan which awards key areas of 
what is now israel to the arabs as well as the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip it also calls for international control of 
jerusalem which israel has proclaimed as its capital 
however palestinian commentators said the plos expected 
acceptance of two states would be a step toward peace because it 
implicitly recognized the right of a jewish state to exist 
al fajr editor hanna siniora said the expected formation of a 
rightwing israeli government in the wake of this weeks elections 
would discourage the plo from making a clearer statement about its 
willingness to recognize israel and make peace 
there is nothing on the israeli side to indicate there would be 
a reciprocation he said it would create dissention in the plo 
camp for nothing 
daoud kuttab a leading palestinian journalist said the 
declaration was positive because it would recognize two states one 
arab and one jewish this would be a change from the plos previous 
demand for a single secular state 
i think its very good but the problem for peacemaking is that 
you need a partner he said adding that boundaries were a 
question that could be settled by negotiation 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who is expected to form a 
rightwing government in the coming days said such a document would 
be harmful for the peace process 
it will become an additional obstacle to improving the 
situation after such extreme declarations it will become for them 
painful to retreat shamir told the associated press oct 28 
he said israel would never accept creation of a palestinian 
state which he claimed was merely a step toward the plos goal of 
taking all the land for itself

a television show on hatemongers being taped 
by geraldo rivera erupted into a brawl that left the host with a 
broken nose and what he said was a hardearned lesson throw the 
first punch next time 
the melee broke out thursday when a young white supremacist 
uttered racist remarks prompting black civil rights leader roy 
innis to grab him by the neck pushing and shoving followed 
skinheads stormed the stage and chairs and punches were thrown 
ive been in plenty of scrapes before but never in a studio 
rivera said afterward i never expected this i anticipated heated 
words but i didnt know it would boil into violence 
rivera concluded the taping and taped two more shows before 
having his nose xrayed he said his nose was broken it clicks 
when i move it he said 
during the brawl which last about a minute rivera got into a 
toetotoe fistfight with a burly man who threw a chair at some 
point he was hit in the nose by another chair he said 
it was like a benchclearing brawl at a hockey match rivera 
said about a dozen of them came out of the audience the three 
punks on stage would have been easy to handle 
the brawl started when one of the guests on the show john 
metzger the 20yearold leader of the white aryan resistance youth 
complained about kikes and called innis an uncle tom 
innis walked across the set to metzger his fists balled then 
turned to another panelist who was warning him off metzger then 
began to stand and innis put his hands around metzgers neck 
i moved on him innis said a guys gonna jump up in my 
face im not going to wait for damage he got the sharpton 
treatment 
earlier this year innis had a runin with new york city activist 
al sharpton shoving him to the floor on the morton downey show 
when metzger resisted his supporters moved toward innis punches 
were thrown several people were wrestled and pushed to the floor 
and audience members skinheads among them stormed the set 
the videotape showed 
pushing and shoving matches continued as order was restored 
it confirmed to me that these supremacists are roaches and 
the only way to get rid of roaches is to turn the lights on 
rivera said 
the show featured members of the white aryan resistance youth 
the american front and skinheads of the national resistance many 
ultra rightwing group members have adopted closecropped hairstyles 
other guests included rabbi a bruce goldman innis the national 
chairman of the congress of racial equality and bayonne nj 
resident bill stump and his wife who said they were attacked and 
terrorized by skinheads at a train station in manhattan saturday 
night 
rivera defended innis actions saying the only lesson i 
learned is to throw the first punch next time 
police spokesman janice swinney said rivera declined to press 
charges she said no one was arrested and no other injuries were 
reported 
meanwhile in tampa fla riveras syndicated hourlong program 
was tied to a murder 
jonathan cantero 19 charged in the knifing death of his mother 
told police he got the courage to kill after watching riveras 
syndicated program on oct 6 in which satanobsessed youths 
described the horrors of occult animal sacrifices 
he gave a detailed account of his own obsession with satanism and 
events leading up to the oct 12 slaying authorities said this week

savannah river plant officials checked 1400 
workers for contamination after discovering that three more workers 
had inadvertently come into contact with radioactive material 
all 1400 came up clean thursday said becky apter a spokeswoman 
for du pont which runs the nuclear weaponry fuel plant here for the 
us department of energy 
wednesdays discovery brings to 17 the number of workers who have 
come into contact with plutonium in an outside area near the plants 
chemical separations facility contamination was found on the shoes 
of the first 14 
on wednesday three construction workers discovered a very low 
level of plutonium on their hands as they left one of the chemical 
separations buildings said bill reinig du pont health protection 
superintendent 
he said officials still do not know the source of the plutonium 
contamination the plant is the nations sole producer of 
weaponsgrade plutonium and tritium 
reinig said monitors show none of the contamination was carried 
off the plant site 
since april all three of the plants reactors have been closed 
for maintenance amid safety questions 
concerns about safety increased dramatically in early october 
when it was disclosed that a number of nearaccidents and releases 
of radioactive materials at the plant over the last three decades 
were not reported to energy department headquarters or to the public 
plant and government officials say they are working to correct 
the problems

a company plans to build a storage center 
for people who want their own blood frozen and available for quick 
delivery if they need it but a doctor says the concern is preying 
on peoples fear of aids 
daxor corp of new york will store blood for individuals at the 
federal express nationwide shipping hub in memphis daxor vice 
president allen gelb said thursday 
it is aimed at anyone who wants to store their own blood or 
blood for their family because they are afraid of or reluctant to 
get blood from the general population because of the risk of 
transfusion gelb said 
but dr edward scott director of lifeblood the midsouth 
regional blood center said the odds are one in 100000 of 
contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a blood 
transfusion 
they undermine public confidence in the blood supply and 
exaggerate the risk of transfusion to promote their service said 
scott 
federal express spokesman armand schneider said he couldnt 
discuss details of his companys agreement with daxor we will 
provide some logistic services including storage and 
transportation he said 
federal express an international package courier service 
contracts with about 135 other customers to stockpile items for 
emergency shipment 
daxor says it was the first company to market individual blood 
storage opening a new york facility in 1985 gelb declined to say 
how many customers the new york center had or how many americans 
they expect will buy the service plans call for operating centers 
in new york and memphis 
the company recommends that individuals store two units each of 
red blood cells and plasma gelb said there would be a 170 
onetime fee for drawing and processing that blood it would then 
cost an additional 492 annually to store those blood components 
the person also would pay any transport costs 
lifeblood will also store an individuals red blood cells for up 
to 10 years scott said the centers total charge for two units 
would be 300 for that time period if the blood were needed outside 
memphis the center would charge 150 for transportation scott said 
the center could also store plasma and estimated that might cost 
another 80 
daxor promises federal express delivery of the frozen blood 
products anywhere in the nation within six hours less than 5 
percent of people getting transfused are transfused within the first 
couple of hours gelb said 
scott said that in an emergency a person would need and receive 
blood immediately from a blood bank

many elderly people who are fearful of adverse 
effects from flu vaccine or skeptical of its effectiveness dont get 
recommended annual flu shots which could save thousands of lives 
according to a government report 
about 60000 deaths are reported from flu and pneumonia in the 
united states each year mostly among people 65 and over the 
national centers for disease control said thursday 
although safe effective and inexpensive vaccines are available 
for these diseases only about 22 percent of people 65 and up 
nationwide receive influenza vaccine annually the cdc said 
for pneumococcal vaccine designed to prevent pneumonia and its 
complications the numbers are even lower only 10 percent have ever 
received the onetimeonly shot 
influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended by federal 
health officials for all persons 65 and over because of seniors 
increased risk of complications or death from pneumonia and flu 
one study conducted this summer in metropolitan atlanta indicated 
the reason for low vaccine use among seniors may be mistrust of the 
vaccines not ignorance 
among 716 senior citizens surveyed in fulton and dekalb counties 
90 percent were aware of flu vaccine and 53 percent were aware of 
pneumococcal vaccine but only 55 percent received annual flu shots 
and only 38 percent had received pneumococcal vaccine 
many individuals may refuse the vaccines over concerns over 
adverse effects said dr walter w williams a cdc immunization 
specialist if theres one thing that may influence someone to 
take or not take a vaccine its fear of side effects 
seventythree percent of the senior citizens in the atlanta 
survey who were aware of influenza vaccine reported negative 
attitudes about it usually the feeling that it causes illness 
doesnt work or isnt necessary the cdc said 
a lot of those fears are unfounded williams said adding 
that todays flu vaccines are much safer than vaccines of a 
generation or two ago 
the negative attitudes remained even among those getting flu 
shots half of those with such attitudes reported theyd had their 
flu shots anyway 
in the atlanta survey doctors recommendations appeared to carry 
a lot of weight with the older patients seventyfive percent of 
those to whom a healthcare provider had recommended flu vaccine 
reported getting their annual shot compared to just 7 percent of 
those who had not received such a recommendation for pneumococcal 
vaccine the percentages were similar 76 percent and 6 percent the 
cdc said 
its very very important for health care providers to 
discuss those issues with patients williams said 
while the atlanta results cannot be projected for the nation as a 
whole they are of importance to researchers because they are 
similar to other findings from more comprehensive studies 
williams said 
flu kills about 20000 americans each year while another 40000 
deaths result from pneumonia more than 80 percent of those deaths 
occur in people over 65 according to the cdc 
in younger adults flu vaccine is as much as 90 percent effective 
in preventing flu entirely williams said absolute effectiveness is 
lower in older persons between 40 and 60 percent but the 
effectiveness in preventing serious complications and death remains 
around 75 percent he said 
pneumococcal vaccine is believed to be between 60 and 95 percent 
effective in preventing pneumonia williams said

jurors in the trial of a man accused of killing 
an illegally adopted child watched in horror as a videotape showed 
extensive bruises lacerations and other injuries suffered by his 
livein companion 
some jurors put their hands to their faces and others turned 
their heads thursday as the 5minute tape revealed hedda nussbaums 
bruises open wounds patches of missing hair and a discolored left 
leg 
the tape shot at a police station by a technician from the 
manhattan district attorneys office showed the 46yearold woman a 
short time after she and joel steinberg were arrested nov 2 1987 
in connection with the death of their illegally adopted daughter 
6yearold lisa steinberg 
the tape was used to buttress testimony of police officers 
paramedics and social workers that on the morning the child was 
taken unconscious from the steinberg household ms nussbaum 
appeared battered and bruised passive and lethargic 
prosecutors believe the videotape would show jurors the allegedly 
violent conditions in the household and explain why ms nussbaum did 
not call for help for at least 10 hours after lisa fell unconscious 
steinberg totally dominated ms nussbaum both physically and 
psychologically said assistant district attorney john mccusker 
one of the prosecutors 
but steinbergs lawyer ira london objected to the tape calling 
it inflammatory and prejudicial london said there was no proven 
connection between his client and ms nussbaums injuries and even 
if there were it would be irrelevant to the murder trial 
i dont see how this tape can come in as evidence since 
there is no evidence that physical abuse had anything to do with her 
ms nussbaums behavior he said 
ms nussbaum has never said she failed to call for help for the 
child because she feared steinbergs retribution he said it was 
her mistaken belief that joel had powers to heal lisa london said 
the color videotape showed ms nussbaum raising her black 
turtleneck sweater and pulling down her jeans while a female police 
officer pointed with a ruler to show the size and location of 
bruises and open wounds 
when ms nussbaum held her head forward the tape revealed 
patches of hair were missing from her scalp her right eye was 
blackened she had an open wound over the bridge of an apparently 
broken nose her lips were swollen and one was split and she had 
other injuries on her torso 
her buttocks were bruised her left thigh was almost totally 
discolored and her left leg had open wounds and discoloration ms 
nussbaums right leg was ulcerated from the knee down to the ankle 
with bandages in various places 
charges against ms nussbaum steinbergs livein companion for 
12 years were dropped two weeks ago she is expected to testify for 
the prosecution about alleged violence that led to the fatal 
injuries of the child 
lisa was taken to nearby st vincents hospital on the morning of 
nov 2 1987 and died three days later of a head injury 
a 16monthold boy mitchell was found in the apartment sitting 
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen authortities said he 
also was illegally adopted and now lives with his biological mother 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is on trial for seconddegree 
murder he denies that he hit the child he said she choked on 
vomited food and the bruises on her chest and back resulted from his 
trying to revive her he is jailed without bail 
ms nussbaum a former childrens book editor has had several 
operations for injuries her lawyer barry scheck said she suffered 
at steinbergs hands she also has been under psychiatric care for 
nearly a year at a westchester county facility

two south african army officers were among 
six people indicted on charges that they smuggled precious 
rhinoceros horns skins of other endangered animals and ak47 
machine guns into the united states 
the six were caught in an undercover investigation that began in 
february us attorney stanley a twardy jr said thursday more 
arrests are possible he added 
twardy said he had no idea how long the smugglers had been in 
business nor was he able to say how many others did business with 
the group but those charged in the scheme indicated they had enough 
rhino horns to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars 
this is something that is unique at least in my experience 
and from what i have been unable to uncover from the justice 
department twardy said 
the rhino horns are valued by some orientals for their purported 
medicinal and aphrodisiac properties in the united states rhino 
horn powder can sell for up to 450 an ounce twardy said 
arrested were john c lukman jr 34 and russell d beveridge 
jr 32 both of newington and mary ann mcallister 33 of west 
hartford twardy said 
also named in the complaint were marius meiring a major in the 
south african defense force his wife pat meiring and waldemar 
schutte a south african sergeant major twardy said all are south 
african citizens and us officials were seeking to have the three 
extradited to the united states twardy said 
the importation of rhino horn is illegal in most countries 
including the united states because the animal is nearly extinct 
still an illicit trade reportedly worth 3 million a year 
flourishes in the middle east and eastern asia where dealers pay 
450 a pound for it 
rhino horn is not actually a horn but densely compacted fibers 
of keratin a protein found in hair and fingernails in the far 
east it is ground into traditional medicines that supposedly reduce 
fever and stop nosebleeds it is also treasured in yemen where it 
is carved into dagger handles that sell for up to 15000 each 
rhinoceroses are one of the more endangered animals in the world 
at one time 120 species lived but only five species remain 
including black and white rhinos fewer than 4000 black rhinos 
remain today about 85 percent of them live in south africa nambia 
zimbabwe and kenya 
a eugene hester the northeast regional director of the us 
fish amp wildlife service said the seizure and purchase of the rhino 
horns by undercover agents was the largest haul of its kind in the 
united states 
each defendant was charged with conspriracy to commit an offense 
against the united states a crime that can be punished by up to 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine twardy said other charges 
would be filed 
lukman mcallister and beveridge appeared thursday in us 
district court in hartford where mcallister and beveridge each were 
released on 25000 nonsurety bonds 
lukmans case was to continue today twardy said authorities want 
lukman held without bail because they think he might leave the 
country

its 10 pm do you know where your inmates 
are 
thats how allegheny county officials discovered theres a slight 
loophole in their house arrest system which uses electronic 
bracelets to monitor inmates no one is keeping tabs on prisoners 
after 10 pm 
as a result probation authorities said they didnt know that 
inmate donald e knudson jr left his suburban bethel park home 
without permission at 1156 pm friday leading police on a 
twohour car chase 
the special electronic bracelet knudson was wearing properly 
notified authorities that he had left his home but no one was 
watching the monitoring equipment said john kolesar director of 
the allegheny county adult probation office 
i have six staff and we dont have enough people to have 
someone in the office after 10 pm he said 
inmates assigned to house arrest wear bracelets on their ankles 
or wrists that send signals through a special telephone receiver in 
their homes if they leave the range of the receiver a signal 
notifies a computer in the county probation office 
kolesar said he needs two more staff members at a cost of about 
50000 to monitor housearrest prisoners 24 hours a day 
but he said the pennsylvania commission on crime and deliquency 
will not approve additional staff members under its grant to start 
the program and the county has refused to hire them

the national council of churches long 
identified with liberal protestantism is increasingly finding 
itself on the sidelines in the countrys political discourse the 
organizations board said in voting to reorganize 
the governing board also approved a statement thursday that calls 
for the council to consider joining forces with more conservative 
but growing protestant evangelical and roman catholic groups 
such a process would entail a willingness on the part of the 
ncc and its programs to die in order that new life might spring 
forth as a stronger witness to our unity in christ the statement 
said 
the ncc founded in 1950 has grown to represent 32 
protestant anglican and eastern orthodox denominations it has 
adopted a number of liberal positions including opposition to 
prayer in public schools and the death penalty and has spoken out 
against president reagans central american policies and apartheid 
in south africa 
however the rev arie r brouwer the councils general 
secretary told the board that the number of liberal protestants is 
declining that they are donating less to their churches and that 
their agenda was never less in vogue 
the councils research office reported a 53 percent decrease in 
member contributions since 1976 
today we are likely to be known as the oldline or even the 
sideline churches instead of mainline he said 
the board created a 15member panel to work out a reorganization 
plan and told it to have a report ready by may 
it also approved a 53 million budget for 1989 that officials 
said included deep cuts in staff and programs although they were 
not specified

personalities was turned into a twopart nbctv movie in 1976 
her book shoemaker about joseph kallinger a shoemaker who 
killed three people in pennsylvania and new jersey was published in 
1983 
it was intended to show its even more important to prevent the 
development of psychosis that leads to crime than to get tough with 
criminals after the event she said while researching the book 
but schreiber was sued by the family of one of kallingers 
victims under a socalled son of sam law in new jersey that required 
money owed to a criminal or his representatives as a result of his

eastern airlines says it will contest a 1 million 
fine imposed after federal agents found cocaine aboard one of its 
jets for the second time in as many weeks 
we have one of the most comprehensive programs in the industry 
to intercept drugs said spokeswoman karen ceremsak we spend 
three and a half million dollars a year 
the customs service on monday found 68 pounds of cocaine aboard a 
flight from colombia hidden in a box of ground coffee in the baggage 
compartment on thursday the agency fined the airline but did not 
impound the boeing 727 
customs at the present time is not seizing the 727 since 
eastern appears to be making serious efforts to improve its security 
measures against drug smuggling said customs spokesman cliff 
stallings 
last week customs seized an eastern l1011 and fined the airline 
896000 after finding 56 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag eastern 
protested the seizure of the plane saying its tip led to the 
discovery of the drugs but customs denied that 
the plane was released after eastern posted bond for the value of 
the fine 
ms ceremsak said that despite the recent seizures eastern has 
no plans to discontinue service to latin america and the caribbean 
the colombian national airline avianca ended all cargo flights 
after repeated drug seizures on its planes

christian an austin consultant who served as lyndon johnsons press 
secretary 
fragments of statistics and a nostalgic history of unexpected 
election outcomes keep democratic hopes alive that vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen can deliver its 29 electoral votes for 
running mate michael dukakis 
kennedy and johnson won the state by only 46000 votes and in 
1982 democrat mark white won the governorship over republican bill 
clements by six percentage points even though he was trailing in the 
polls by the same margin the day before the election 
i think were gonna do it says bob slagle the texas state 
democratic chairman 
i think its going to be a squeaker very close but were 
going to win it insists bentsen 
dukakis picked bentsen as his running mate in hopes of repeating 
the kennedyjohnson feat of 1960 but the immensely popular man from 
mccook texas has had trouble transferring some of his popularity 
to the massachusetts governor 
going into the final weekend of the campaign the closest recent 
poll puts the ticket seven points behind republicans george bush and 
dan quayle while others show a margin of more than 20 points 
democrats who have never won the white house without winning 
texas cling to the lowest number they believe a strong 
getoutthevote program can make up the difference and cite 
bentsens strong political organization in the state 
this election isnt going to be won or lost now by michael 
dukakis or lloyd bentsen its all in the turnout said ann 
richards the texas state treasurer 
tom cosgrove the dukakisbentsen campaign chief in texas even 
suggests that the opening of hunting season last weekend may help 
the democrats because some of the gun owners who oppose dukakis may 
be out hunting on election day 
when you were looking at 15 points down even nine or seven is 
a big improvement said christian who has been advising bentsen 
on the campaign 
the dismal position of the democratic campaign in texas is a 
reflection of the problems dukakis has had nationwide 
as elsewhere democrats had high hopes after their convention in 
july of carrying texas and bringing home the states conservative 
democrats who helped give ronald reagan 64 percent of the vote in 
1984 
early polls were encouraging and the party dealt with peripheral 
issues such as bentsens dual candidacies for the us senate and 
the vice presidency he says hell resign the former if he wins the 
latter 
the dual candidaciesvoters chosing to cast their 
ballots twice for texas with bush a former houston congressman and 
bentsen 
i think it probably helped him in the vice presidential race 
said dick leggitt a washington political consultant working for 
beau boulter bentsens senate opponent 
dukakis then put nontexan cosgrove in charge alienating many 
locals 
soon after texas democrats watched helplessly as the issues 
picked by bush for his broadsides against dukakis flagfactory 
patriotism gun control and crime hit at the heart of the rural 
texas voters the democrats wanted to win back 
the charges went unanswered for many weeks too long the 
candidates now concede 
both bentsen and dukakis spent precious time in texas with the 
senator spending about 40 days in the state since the convention 
the campaign got a lift after bentsens debate with quayle 
grumbling among state democrats who had been getting more vocal in 
criticizing the bostonrun dukakis campaign was replaced by a new 
spirit of cooperation 
but dukakis second debate with george bush a week later was a 
downer in texas as elsewere 
the campaign in midoctober launched a fullscale ad campaign to 
counter the republicans with bentsen and dukakis hammering bush for 
conducting a negative campaign heartened again the texas democrats 
seemed to pick up some vigor 
but the bush campaign continued its ads and the issues lingered 
especially gun control in which the bush campaign had allies such 
as the national rifle association to spread the word against dukakis 
and with just more than a week left in the contest dukakis 
acknowledged he was indeed a liberal and the texas democrats were on 
the defensive again 
its not the best word in the world said slagle who 
insisted it wasnt that bad in the context of harry truman and john 
kennedy that dukakis used it 
but the republicans were gleeful again 
i dont know what his handlers were thinking said reggie 
basher the bushquayle campaign spokesman in texas

the five atlantis astronauts poked a 
little fun at the secrecy surrounding their upcoming classified 
shuttle mission by donning lone rangerstyle masks for reporters 
were probably going to get in all kinds of trouble for this 
the mission commander robert hoot gibson said with a laugh 
thursday 
atlantis which sits on a launch pad at the kennedy space center 
in cape canaveral fla is scheduled for liftoff late this month on 
a mission during which it will send a spy satellite into orbit 
on regular shuttle flights the crews usually hold a news 
conference and give individual interviews about a month before the 
launch date 
details about the upcoming mission however are classified and 
the exact launch time wont be given until nine minutes before 
liftoff the crew members also arent allowed to discuss their 
duties on the mission and were not giving interviews 
but there were many interview requests for the second 
postchallenger mission so the air force agreed to let the five 
astronauts meet briefly with several reporters thursday as long as 
they said nothing about their mission 
when they arrived the five wore big smiles and black masks nasa 
employees at the johnson space centers public information office 
laughed and applauded their masked arrival 
the masks mission specialist william shepherd said were 
included in a press kit given to the astronauts 
gibson added that the crew also received flash cards with joke 
answers including yes no i dont know i cant tell you i can 
tell you but id have to kill you 
the other atlantis crewmen are pilot guy gardner and mission 
specialists richard mike mullane and jerry ross

dan quayles assertion that a surgical procedure 
done immediately after a rape can prevent conception is probably 
wrong experts say 
the procedure is called dilation and curettage or dandc it 
involves scraping of the lining of the uterus the procedure has a 
variety of medical uses 
the procedure which quayle described as an alternative to 
abortion may stop early development of an embryo scientists said 
thursday but conception itself can occur in less than an hour after 
intercourse 
moreover said ruth schwartz a member of the health care 
commission of the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists a dandc is done in the uterus while conception 
occurs in the fallopian tubes 
it is not preventing a pregnancy from happening schwartz 
said 
development of the embryo in rape victims is blocked through the 
use of medications which are preferable to the surgery the experts 
said 
doing the surgical procedure right after rape would be adding 
great insult and injury on an already severely traumatized woman 
schwartz said i think it would be a ridiculous notion to do as a 
routine basis she said 
surgical abortion removes an embryo after it has implanted itself 
in the uterus wall an event that occurs about a week after 
conception dandc can be used for firsttrimester abortions 
although a suction procedure is more common 
quayle who opposes abortion brought up dandc when asked 
wednesday about abortion in the case of a rape 
my position is that i understand from a medical situation that 
immediately after a rape that is reported that a woman normally 
in fact can go to the hospital and have a dandc at that time 
that is before the actual forming of a life he said 
i understand that the medical procedure a normal dandc 
right after rape that you would not even get into a conception and 
life would not even be formed he said 
w leroy heinrichs professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the 
stanford university medical center said he knew of no evidence that 
an immediate dandc would prevent conception 
perhaps there could be some effect on conception because of 
anesthetic in the blood or blood or other fluids pushed into the 
fallopian tubes he suggested but the whole idea is probably 
incorrect he said 
sperm reach the fallopian tubes within minutes of intercourse and 
can fertilize the egg in less than an hour if the woman has already 
ovulated heinrichs said sperm can remain viable for 48 hours so 
they can also fertilize an egg if ovulation occurs within that 
period after intercourse he said 
an immediate dandc would probably stop later embryonic 
development by making the uterus wall resist implantation by the 
embryo heinrichs said adding he knows of no evidence for that idea 
but women who have just been raped are generally given drugs 
rather than surgery to block that implantation schwartz and 
heinrichs said a dandc would be heavyhanded and probably not 
work as well as the drugs heinrichs said 
if a dandc done after implantation removes the embryo it 
amounts to a standard abortion schwartz and heinrichs said

the government said today that more than 
90 percent of the nations voters approved constitutional changes 
designed to shift power away from the single political party that 
has ruled for 26 years 
the referendum was held thursday one month after antigovernment 
riots shook algeria to its foundation 
the algerian people have chosen the road to reform interior 
minister hedi khediri said while announcing the results the 
algerian people are as attached to freedom as to the building of 
their country in unity 
the ministry said 9227 percent of those voting in the referendum 
said yes to changes promised by president chadli bendjedid 
the referendum shifted some power from the president to the 
premier it also made the premier responsible to the national 
assembly or parliament so daily governmental operations could be 
removed from direct control of the national liberation front the 
only legal party 
bendjedid has suggested independent candidates be allowed to run 
for seats in the national assembly until now the front had to 
approve all candidates 
kamel belkacem publisher of the proreform weekly newspaper 
algerie actualite said bendjedids ultimate goal is to open the 
country to free multiparty elections 
the large vote in support of bendjedids reforms gives him a 
strong mandate to push through other changes he hopes to make when 
the party holds its congress at the end of the month 
the front led the fight against french colonial rule since 
independence in 1962 it has controlled the countrys political 
economic social cultural and judicial life 
about 26 million people live in algeria a country roughly three 
times the size of texas 
the interior ministry said 8308 percent of the countrys 12 
million voters cast ballots the ministry said 93 million voted in 
favor of the proposals to modify 14 articles of the constitution 
the president was expected to appoint a new government in the 
next 10 days according to western diplomats and algerian sources 
close to the government who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the sources said the composition of the next government will be a 
test of the presidents sincerity in initiating genuine reforms 
they are having trouble finding people with experience to serve 
as ministers who are not contaminated by association with previous 
governments one diplomat said 
algerians took to the streets oct 4 to protest shortages of food 
and jobs and a declining standard of living blamed on the 
plummeting price of oil algerias chief source of export earnings 
the interior ministry says 176 people mostly young men were 
killed in the six days of violence that rocked algiers and a number 
of provincial towns 
the first task of the new government will be to deal with the 
crisis that spawned the riots instituting reforms expected to 
include decentralizing control of the economy and privatizing most 
nonstrategic industries diplomatic sources said 
khediri said the nations economic problems can be attacked by 
a program of austerity austerity measures taken earlier by the 
government inspired the october riots 
algeria has a 20 billion foreign debt revenue from oil exports 
has fallen 40 percent since 1981 
the naming of the new government will be followed by a party 
congress nov 27 which will consider a series of further reforms 
that could redefine the partys role algerian and western 
diplomatic sources said

city commissioners have rejected a proposal allowing 
police to arrest homeless people jail them for 10 days and fine 
them up to 100 
were catching hell for it commissioner jl plummer said of 
the proposal which was unanimously rejected thursday but will be 
reconsidered dec 15 we have existing laws that can be enforced 
the ordinance aimed at curbing the annual influx of homeless 
from northern cities would have banned sleeping on sidewalks and 
cooking and urinating in streets and parks 
after rejecting the measure the five commissioners requested a 
less harsh revision and promised to appoint a task force to help 
street people the revision should not call for the arrest of 
homeless people officials said 
thats out mayor xavier suarez said it actually can be 
viewed as an attempt to harass the homeless 
the proposed ordinance had caused an uproar among advocates for 
the homeless critics said the city was trying to clean up the 
streets near the miami arena before the citys new nba team debuts 
there saturday 
the arena is a few blocks from the citys overflowing shelter for 
the homeless whose director brother paul johnson applauded the 
commission decision 
i think the idea that miami could stop homelessness by a law 
that arrests them is ridiculous johnson said i think everyone 
realized this morning that that cannot be done 
the ordinance was proposed by the police department police said 
it was prompted by complaints from businessmen 
suarez said that despite its rejection the ordinance had a 
beneficial effect the reaction to it has actually helped the 
commission look at the problem of the homeless he said

thousands of starving cattle found along 
with more than 60 carcasses at a northern texas ranch had been moved 
there because of the drought and probably had not been fed since 
july authorities said 
their ribs were showing a lot of them were completely down 
some cant even see theyre starved so much that theyre blind 
said kaufman county sheriff robert harris he called it the worst 
case of animal cruelty he had ever seen 
the discovery of the malnourished santa gertrudis cattle 
wednesday has prompted a search for the person responsible for their 
condition 
it isnt something that happened overnight harris said 
id say they havent been fed since theyve been up here in 
july this has been progressing 
the king ranch in southern texas owned the estimated 3000 
cattle but they had been under the care of a dallas man harris 
said 
the cattle ended up in forney because of the drought in southern 
texas said ken york who operates the american livestock management 
co of marshall 
the person responsible for taking care of the cattle never 
notified the king ranch of trouble when northern texas also was 
stricken by drought york said 
the reports kept coming in and every indication was that things 
were ok he said 
feed has been brought to the site and harris said authorities 
would care for them 
some cattle were so malnourished they could not walk and feed 
had to be put in front of them 
theyre highbred cattle harris said theyre santa 
gertrudis theyre not just scrub cattle in the 1920s and 1930s 
the king ranch crossed shorthorns and brahmans to develop the santa 
gertrudis

the us unemployment rate fell to 53 percent in october the 
government said today in its last major economic report before 
tuesdays election 
the decline from septembers 54 percent returned the rate to 
junes 53 percent the lowest since may 1974 
the labor department said employers added 325000 jobs last 
month compared with average monthly increases of 240000 in august 
and september 
nearly 100000 of the new jobs were on assembly lines more than 
double the drop of 45000 manufacturing jobs over the two previous 
months the department said 
on thursday retailers and automakers reported improved october 
sales over a year ago when the 1987 stock crash was sending tremors 
through the buying public 
the sales reports had little effect on the financial markets but 
stocks and bonds were helped by a steadying of the dollar against 
major foreign currencies 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1351 points to 
217034 on thursday while advancing issues outnumbered declines 4 
to 3 on the new york stock exchange 
bond prices also rose the treasurys bellwether 30year bond 
rose point or about 5 per 1000 face amount while its yield 
fell to 874 percent from 878 percent late wednesday 
in addition to the dollars steadiness the bond market was 
helped by a decline in precious metals prices and a perception that 
the retail and auto sales were fairly weak bond traders fear the 
inflation that often accompanies strong sales which can be a sign 
of a strong economy 
but the pace of bond trading was restrained as many investors 
stayed out of the market in advance of todays scheduled government 
report on us unemployment during october 
the dollars leveling followed several days of decline in new 
york the dollar rose to 12468 japanese yen thursday from 12440 
yen the day before 
stocks have come under some pressure from the dollars persistent 
decline in recent days which has raised fears that the federal 
reserve could bolster the currency by nudging interest rates higher 
us automakers said they sold 79 percent more cars and light 
trucks in late october this year compared with the same period last 
year when the initial impact of the stock market crash was being 
felt 
analysts said the retail sales report indicated continued 
sluggishness though some predicted a healthy christmas season 
there was some gradual improvement in the pace of sales from 
august and september with particular strength noted in some of the 
apparel categories said jeffrey feiner a retail industry analyst 
with the investment firm merrill lynch amp co 
but jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the numbers were a little below expectations

hundreds of leftists burned an 
american flag outside the us embassy today to condemn the recent 
agreement extending us bases in the country and demand the 
government refuse to negotiate a new treaty in 1991 
protesters representing several labor and student groups 
carried banners reading no to us bases and us imperialism 
cause of poverty 
police estimated the crowd at 1000 but reporters said the 
numbers dwindled in half as rain fell the group dispersed without 
incident at the end of the protest 
dismantle us bases in the country now crispin beltran 
leader of the leftwing may first movement told the crowd we 
condemn the talks this is an historic sellout of philippine 
sovereignty 
beltran was referring to a usphilippine agreement oct 17 that 
reaffirmed the presence of the six bases in this country until 
september 1991 
the united states agreed to provide 962 million in economic and 
military aid over the final two years of the agreement previously 
washington paid 180 million a year for use of clark air base subic 
bay naval base and four smaller installations 
after 1991 any extension of the bases must be under a formal 
treaty ratified by twothirds of the 23member senate where 
opposition to the installations is strong 
under the agreement either the philippines or the united states 
can unilaterally terminate the agreement after sept 16 1991 with 
one years notice that could extend the bases until september 1992 
president corazon aquino however said this week the philippines 
considers the agreement void on sept 16 1991 unless the treaty 
has been ratified 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states also wanted negotiations completed and a treaty 
ratified before the september 1991 date

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc appeared to be in the best position to form a new government 
after the final vote count was announced today in israels 
parliamentary elections 
the count released by the central elections committee indicated 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member knesset or parliament and the 
leftleaning labor party won 39 seats spokeswoman sarah yitzhaki 
said 
the result of tuesdays vote means neither party has the majority 
needed to form a government and both parties have been wooing the 
rightwing religious bloc in an effort to gain control of the 
knesset 
the national religious party which has five seats in the 
knesset has pledged its support to likud israeli radio said 
shamir held bargaining meetings thursday with two other 
rightwing religious parties moledet homeland and tzomet 
crossroads whose support he needs 
tzomet and moledet which won two seats each favor annexing the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip moledets founder 
retired gen rehavam zeevi also favors the expulsion of all arabs 
from israel 
shamir said he would allow more jewish settlements to be built in 
the disputed lands but rejected the potential coalition partners 
demands for annexation and expulsion of the palestinian residents 
zeevi has asked likud to hold a referendum on the annexation 
issue as a precondition for his joining a shamirled coalition 
israel radio said 
a likud cabinet minister raised the prospect that the labor party 
might be invited to join in a government because the religious 
parties that hold the balance of power were pressing too hard for 
orthodox causes 
labor and likud now share power in a contentious coalition 
government 
the religious parties are presenting many demands and difficult 
conditions we will not be able to respond to them all moshe 
katzav welfare and labor minister told the newspaper hadashot 
the religious parties have asked to ban driving movies and 
soccer on the jewish sabbath and are demanding that conversion to 
judaism be recognized only if it is performed by an orthodox rabbi 
israeli newspapers have said that the ascension of orthodox 
legislators worried israels nonreligious jews 
the daily maariv carried a poll that showed 60 percent of 
israelis were concerned about the rising power of the orthodox the 
poll also indicated however that 65 opposed a unity government 
of labor and likud such as has governed since 1984 following an 
inconclusive election 
the liberal daily haaretz meanwhile quoted sources in shamirs 
office as saying the prime minister was seeking the ouster of labor 
leader shimon peres as a price for forming a unity government with 
the opposition party 
labor party officials who demanded anonymity said a rebellion 
against peres was brewing within his partys ranks after labors 
poor showing 
however likud minister katzav said peres could be invited to 
join the government if he dropped his endorsement of arab calls for 
an international peace conference on the middle east 
seats won by other rightwing parties in the election were 
tehiya 3 tzomet 2 and moledet 2 
seats won by leftist parties shinui 2 mapam 3 and and 
citizens rights movement 5 
seats won by the religious parties shas 6 torah flag 2 
agudat israel 5 and national religious party 5 
seats won by araboriented parties communists 4 progressive 
list for peace 1 and arab democratic party 1 
in another development the proplo newspaper al fajr today 
published a draft declaration of independence for a palestinian 
state which called for founding a state on the basis of un 
security council resolution 181 of 1947 the un resolution is an 
implicit recognition of israel because it calls for both an arab and 
a jewish state 
on thursday 11 palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes 
with soldiers in the west bank and gaza strip arab hospital 
officials said the nearly 11monthold uprising against israeli 
control of the lands has claimed the lives of 306 palestinians and 
10 israelis

prosecutors examining ptls finances have 
notified jim bakker and several former associates they are targets 
of a grand jury investigation an indication indictments may be 
imminent a newspaper reported today 
a target of the grand jury investigation is a person as to whom 
the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking 
him to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the 
prosecutor is a putative defendant federal prosecutor charles 
alexander wrote the charlotte observer reported 
the newspaper said bakker ptl chief builder roe messner and 
richard dortch bakkers former top deputy received the letter all 
three have been invited to testify before the grand jury the week of 
nov 28 
alexanders oct 24 letter to bakker cites justice department 
guidelines in inviting bakker to testify including a requirement he 
give up his right against selfincrimination and consent to a full 
examination under oath 
any and all testimony which you provide can be used against you 
by the grand jury and in subsequent legal proceedings this 
letter is not a subpoena and you are not compelled to appear the 
newspaper quoted the letter as saying 
alexander has refused even to acknowledge the grand jurys 
existence he declined comment thursday 
bakker said in a statement that he would not appear before the 
grand jury 
bakker resigned from ptl in march 1987 in a sexandmoney 
scandal the grand jury has been investigating the evangelical 
empire for possible mail and wire fraud conspiracy and tax 
violations since august 1987 
bakker has denied any wrongdoing and said in august that if he is 
indicted itll be because somebody framed us and set us up 
bakker attorney jim toms said that despite the target letter he 
doesnt think prosecutors have decided to indict bakker toms said 
he hopes to meet with prosecutors to reach a just and equitable 
solution to this distressing situation 
i do sense they are to the point where they know pretty well 
where they want to head toms said and its time to open a 
dialogue 
bill diehl who represents dortch said the letter is a clear 
signal prosecutors are going to indict the targets its a done 
deal he said 
former federal prosecutor kenneth andresen who represents 
bakkers former secretary agreed he noted the investigation has 
gone on for 16 months 
if prosecutors dont think theyve uncovered evidence of 
wrongdoing theres no need to give the targets an opportunity to 
explain their conduct he said

to cheers of support from thousands of 
workers margaret thatcher and solidarity leader lech walesa laid a 
wreath today outside the lenin shipyard to honor poles slain during 
1970 riots 
shipyard workers in hard hats their hands raised in 
vforvictory salutes chanted solidarity solidarity as the 
british prime minister and walesa placed the flowers at a towering 
monument near the shipyard 
the monument honors dozens of polish workers who died when 
security forces opened fire to quell riots over food prices 
mrs thatcher is the first western leader to meet walesa at the 
shipyard where solidarity began eight years ago 
polish media have been giving heavy coverage to mrs thatchers 
visit but have been omitting references to her private program 
the code for her visits with solidarity supporters 
however newspapers today did print the full text of her rather 
sharply worded dinner speech thursday calling for dialogue with 
solidarity 
a crowd estimated at 20000 thronged the square around the 
monument and shouted down with communism and out with 
rakowski prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski has ordered the 
shipyard closed for financial reasons 
mrs thatcher dont let the shipyard be closed read one sign 
see how many have come despite their efforts to stop them they 
have filtered through somehow walesa told reporters we will 
not be defeated this is a monument of hope 
mrs thatcher periodically disappeared into the crowd there was 
no sign of communist government officials nor of polish security 
police who have followed her throughout most of her threeday visit 
the trip to the shipyard which the government plans to close 
dec 1 was the high point of mrs thatchers visit which ended 
today the british leader has publicly endorsed the banned 
solidarity trade union federation 
after the wreathlaying mrs thatcher visited st brygidas 
church where she had lunch in the rectory with solidarity leaders 
mrs thatcher thanked the crowd for its reception i had to 
come here and see for myself the spirit of the polish people she 
said 
after meeting with mrs thatcher walesa said i am very 
satisfied we discussed all the problems that the prime minister 
wanted to hear about and we wanted to raise 
earlier crowds lined the british leaders route pressing 
flowers into her hands while she toured the old town and gdansks 
reconstructed long market whose ornate architecture reflects the 
citys wealthy past at the major baltic seaport of the 16th century 
mrs thatcher was greeted by city authorities when she arrived by 
plane from warsaw she then departed for a ceremony where she joined 
the countrys leader wojciech jaruzelski to honor polish defenders 
of the westerplatte penisula scene of the first shots of world war 
ii 
she dedicated a monument in the citys eastern praga district to 
british flyers who died trying to ferry food and weapons to the 
polishresistance movement in the failed warsaw uprising of 1944 
the rebellion against the nazi occupiers cost 200000 polish lives 
on thursday evening mrs thatcher told communist leaders they 
must negotiate with solidarity as the price for longterm western 
aid including the rescheduling of a 39 billion foreign debt 
solidarity leaders today praised her for that 
it was beautiful what she said senior solidarity adviser 
bronislaw geremek said in an interview for this speech mrs 
thatcher gets a great deal of thanks from us 
mrs thatcher said it was vital there should be a real dialogue 
with representatives of all sections of society including 
solidarity 
you will find your friends ready not just to stand and cheer 
but to help in practical ways she said 
gen jaruzelski in a guarded speech complained poland 
suffered much from western embargoes after the governments 1981 
declaration of martial law and outlawing the following year of 
solidarity 
he hinted he resented carping from wealthy western countries that 
have not shared the long history of foreign invasions and economic 
straits endured by poland

fifteen tons of heavy water that could be 
used to make nuclear weapons were illegally diverted to india 
authorities said today they fear india may have used the material 
in a secret weapons program 
india did not sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty and 
is known to have tested nuclear devices the indian government 
however has denied that it operates a nuclear arms program 
tor axel busch norways deputy public director of prosecutions 
today confirmed reports that heavy water was flown from norway to 
basel switzerland where it was rerouted via dubai to bombay 
india the reports were published last summer in the oslo newspaper 
verdens gang 
a west german firm bought the heavy water in 1982 for scientific 
use in west germany it denies any diversion 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the 
norwegian heavy water while en route to india was combined with a 
shipment of 67 tons of soviet heavy water purchased by the same 
broker 
busch was away from his office in northern norway today and not 
available for comment but his office relayed a statement to the 
associated press in which said he has heard unconfirmed reports of 
the soviet shipment but that he knows nothing about it 
the norwegian company norsk hydro sells the heavy water for use 
as a coolant in nuclear power reactors and for scientific research 
however it can also be used in the chemical process that turns 
uranium into plutonium a component of nuclear weapons 
norwegian officials say they are trying to find out who took 
delivery of the heavy water in bombay and what it was used for 
norway is also negotiating with israel to determine how 20 tons 
of heavy water exported there in 1959 and 1960 have been used 
israel also has not signed the nonproliferation treaty 
two other countries pakistan and south africa failed to sign 
and are also suspected of possessing atomic weapons

clothing would be analyzed by laboratories we will strongly

federal prosecutors have indicated that defense 
consultant william parkin will be among the first people charged in 
the massive pentagon bribery case a source says 
the source speaking thursday on condition of anonymity said 
parkin has been told he will be indicted unless he comes in and 
cuts a deal which he is not going to do 
parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws in 
running his alexandria va consulting business although the 
source would not reveal details of the plea bargain offer he said 
the terms were stiff 
last week henry e hudson the us attorney in alexandria va 
said the first indictments in the investigation into the 
150billionayear defense procurement business could come later 
this month 
the 2yearold investigation centers on allegations that 
consultants paid bribes to defense department officials to gather 
inside information that was useful to companies bidding on the 
multimilliondollar projects 
sharon dibbley a spokeswoman for hudson said the prosecutor 
would not comment on reports that pleabargain arrangements had been 
offered earlier however government and defense sources indicated 
that hudsons assistants had been kept waiting for responses from 
some potential defendants to offers of plea bargains 
prosecutors are known to be looking at a broad variety of charges 
in the investigation including bribery fraud conspiracy theft of 
government property and tax violations 
hudson is running the bribery investigation that came to light in 
june when fbi agents staged raids at more than 40 locations around 
the country justice department officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity predicted that about a half dozen people will be indicted 
initially by a grand jury hudson said indictments could continue 
over a year 
attempts to reach parkin for comment were unsuccessful no one 
answered his telephone on two occasions and his lawyer gerard 
treanor declined to comment 
in interviews with the wall street journal last summer parkin 
said he paid fred lackner a californiabased consultant more than 
15000 to obtain inside information on a navy contract for 
antiaircraft equipment 
lackner said he received some information from stuart berlin a 
navy engineer but he said the information was public knowledge 
the journal quoting unnamed sources reported thursday that 
prosecutors also would seek an indictment against lackner who could 
not be reached for comment lackner also was offered a plea 
bargaining deal the paper said 
lackners attorney william dougherty was out of the country and 
was unavailable for comment 
parkin has told reporters that he and lackner shared consulting 
fees from teledyne electronics of newbury park calif 
one source familiar with the case has said the teledyne aspects 
were the furthest along in the investigation 
this source speaking anonymously also said jack sherman a 
marine corps official was believed to have reached or be near 
reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors 
the journals sources said prosecutors have evidence that sherman 
accepted more than 40000 in cash from defense consultants and 
their associates in a oneyear period shermans lawyer louis 
koutoulakos did not return telephone messages 
in a related development the defense contract audit agency has 
found the pentagons procurement regulations are so vague that major 
defense contractors have been allowed to bill the government for 
millions of dollars for outside consultants without justifying or 
explaining their work 
in a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors the 
auditors labeled as questionable claims for 43 million out of 
the 2365 million they charged to the government over the past year 
for consultant services

the nations civilian unemployment rate fell to 
53 percent in october as the economy created more than 300000 
jobs the government said today in its last major economic report 
before tuesdays presidential election 
the 01 percentage point drop in the rate from septembers 54 
percent matched junes rate as the lowest since may 1974 
president reagan leaving the white house to campaign for george 
bush said the report was very very good news for all americans 
the future is bright and its getting brighter nothings 
going to stop us now 
employers added 325000 jobs last month more than the average 
monthly increases of 240000 in august and september but comparable 
to last springs gains of 300000 a month 
nearly 100000 of octobers new jobs were on assembly lines more 
than double the drop of 45000 manufacturing jobs over the two 
previous months 
the figures sent both bond and stock prices down in early trading 
as investors gave up hopes that the federal reserve board would move 
to reduce interest rates after the election according to analysts 
theres no chance of that now said edward yardeni chief 
economist for prudential bache securities inc but at the same 
time i dont think that the fed is going to tighten either so 
interest rates will be flat the rest of the year 
longterm bonds opened more than a point lower and the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks was down at 1159 at 10 am 
largely on the falling bond prices yardeni said 
todays figures showed 193000 more americans at work than in 
september with the number of jobless people totaling only 65 
million 
the report said that the percentage of workingage americans with 
jobs remained at a record 624 percent 
the number of women holding jobs grew by 320000 while the number 
of working men fell by 99000 according to the labor departments 
monthly survey of 58000 households 
yardeni and other private economists agreed with reagans 
assessment that the economy is picking up steam again after slowing 
from a growth rate of 34 percent in 1987 to 22 percent in the 
third quarter of this year 
a good case is developing that the fourth quarter will show 
stronger growth than the third said jerry jasinowski chief 
economist for the national association of manufacturers 
jasnowski said companies are telling him that their factory 
orders which fell 19 percent in september according to the 
government bounced back again last month 
the slowdown in growth over the summer was more droughtrelated 
than most people believed he said it was the most 
extraordinary summer in decades and it did slow the pace of things a 
bit more than the governments seasonal adjustments did 
william dunkelberg an economics professor at temple university 
who surveys small businesses said a record high 34 percent of them 
anticipate making major capital investments in the fourth quarter 
and an expansionhigh 25 percent of them reported unfilled job 
openings last month 
even if you go back to the late 1970s you dont get numbers 
that good he said the unemployment rate is more likely to keep 
going down rather than up 
food processing paced the unusually large manufacturing job gains 
with 25000 new jobs logged in october the department said 
however that the seasonally adjusted increase in those jobs 
reflected fewer fall cutbacks than would normally be the case 
because of light summer hiring caused by the drought 
after several months of droughtrelated slowdowns the one 
month pickup in manufacturing jobs may thus be somewhat 
overstated said the commissioner of labor statistics janet l 
norwood 
nonetheless she told the congressional joint economic committee 
that there are 422000 more factory jobs now than had been the case 
a year ago 
despite octobers strong growth the department said employment 
in just nine of the 20 manufacturing industries was above julys 
levels other industries showing significant gains included lumber 
and wood products steel and aluminium machinery motor vehicles 
and rubber and plastics 
the 231000 new jobs on the services side of the economy were 
paced by gains of 50000 in retail trade 47000 in health services 
and 21000 in wholesale trade 
grocery stores restaurants and bars all posted healthy gains 
department store employment however edged downward for the fourth 
straight month 
despite the large manufacturing gains and a drop in new orders 
last month factory workers continued to average four hours a week 
in overtime 
average hourly earnings rose five cents last month to 949 an 
increase of 38 percent over the last 12 months in terms of 
purchasing power however those wages were buying 1 percent less 
than they had a year earlier 
among the various population groups the labor department 
reported these unemployment rates 
men 53 percent up from 52 percent 
women 52 percent down from 55 percent 
whites 46 percent down from 48 percent 
blacks 110 percent up from 108 percent 
hispanics 77 percent up from 74 percent 
teenagers 149 percent down from 157 percent 
black teenagers 265 percent down from 322 percent 
an alternate unemployment rate including the 1687000 members 
of the armed forces stationed in the united states stood at 52 
percent last month also down 01 percentage point from september 
on the eve of todays report both economic and political 
analysts saw little chance that the new numbers would affect next 
weeks presidential election 
the last time the jobless figures had any impact was in the 1982 
midterm election at the depth of the worst recession since the 
1930s republicans lost 26 seats in the house six years ago a week 
after the government announced that unemployment had hit 104 
percent 
that was a major indicator then that what president reagan had 
led the country to expect did not come to pass said richard 
brody a political science professor at stanford university 
this year brody said the economic numbers contribute to a 
popular feeling that the president is doing a good job that 
translates into support for the candidate of the presidents party 
bush

a top foreign ministry official today said the 
soviet union has suspended its troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
because of heavy attacks by rebels and he hinted the pullout might 
not be completed by a feb 15 deadline 
heavy attacks by insurgents with arms supplied by the united 
states pakistan and other countries does not provide conditions 
for the pullout first deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh told a news conference 
the withdrawal of the troops is being suspended he said 
adding that the date at which the withdrawal is completed is not 
important 
bessmertnykh also said the soviet union is now delivering to 
the military forces of afghanistan additional and more powerful 
means of destruction 
reports have said mig27 fighter planes and ss1 scud missiles 
have been introduced by the soviet union in afghanistan in recent 
weeks and used in attacks on the afghan resistance 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
soviet actions can only increase tensions in the region and raise 
speculation that they aret going to live up to the geneva 
accords which call for soviet troops to be out of afghanistan by 
feb 15 
the soviet union says supplies of arms to the rebels violate the 
april 14 geneva agreement under which the soviet union agreed to 
withdraw its more than 100000 soldiers it has pulled out half the 
troops 
bessmertnykh criticized an unremittant flow of armaments of 
us and other origins to the rebels 
the soviet union intends to stand by its obligations under the 
geneva accords he said but in order for the geneva agreement to 
be fulfilled all four countries that signed it the united states 
soviet union afghanistan and pakistan must obey its provisions 
he said 
if none of the countries violate them the accords will be 
fulfilled by the soviet union bessmertnykh said 
he said that although the soviet union was introducing more 
powerful weapons in afghanistan the quantities of soldiers and 
weapons remained constant 
repeating an earlier warning state department spokesman charles 
e redman said if the introduction of this weaponry is an attempt 
to intimidate pakistan then moscow should know that pakistan enjoys 
our full support the use of the weapons represents a further 
escalation in the level of violence 
a senior western diplomat in moscow briefing reporters on 
condition of anonymity said new weapons were more a means of 
political than military pressure 
it is difficult to win a war against guerrillas with 
groundtoground missiles longrange bombers or even groundattack 
aircraft based close by said the diplomat some of what is 
happening is intended to convey a political message rather than 
achieve a military objective 
bessmertnykh said 230 afghan civilians were killed and 580 were 
wounded in raids by insurgents in october alone 
he said soviet forces also have suffered casualties in hundreds 
of artillery and rocket attacks by the insurgents but refused to say 
how many soviets had been killed or injured bessmertnykh reiterated 
that soviet soldiers were not engaged in offensive actions against 
the insurgents 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another they remained to fight the 
insurgency

like mad to deal with a fiscal mess in massachusetts while 
dukakis declared he is coming back in the presidential race as 
voters realize he will stand up for them 
with the election just four days away both candidates were 
hitting hard in campaign stops and in television appearances and 
advertisements polls continued to show bush with a lead but 
dukakis and his aides said the race was getting closer 
also today in an interview with the associated press bush 
criticized a private firms effort to win a public relations 
contract with the government of haiti by touting the connections of 
one of the firms partners bush fundraiser fred bush to the vice

contact with haiti was made without his knowledge 
the vice president said in the interview that voters know ive 
been in public life for 20 years and no one has ever made any 
allegations about impropriety on my part because they know how 
strongly i feel about ethics and government 
dukakis on nbcs today program said the test of a good 
president isnt who comes up with the best commercial in the last 
two or three weeks people are getting a much better sense of who 
mike dukakis is who wants to be president of the united states and 
i think thats one of the reasons frankly why were doing better and 
closing this gap 
i think they see in mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen a very 
strong team that will stand up for them and i think thats the 
fundamental issue he said 
his voice sounded improved from the previous day when it grew 
hoarse as he spoke at rally after rally 
bush meanwhile traveled to fairfield conn to take a poke at 
fiscal problems in dukakis neighboring massachusetts 
the republican nominee held up a boston newspaper labeling the 
fiscal situation a mess and he accused gov dukakis of 
borrowing like mad and kiting checks 
state officials said this week they were planning to cut state 
spending to head off a potential budget deficit after learning of a 
revenue shortfall in october 
bush said dukakis got into the situation by overspending how 
did he get out of it or try to by raising taxes a total of 180 
million this year alone now hes borrowing like mad writing 
checks that he doesnt even have enough money in the bank to cover 
dukakis was campaigning in new york and kentucky and ending the 
day with a walk in chicagos torchlight parade a traditional show 
of democratic party unity 
bush was traveling to four states today connecticut and the 
industrial battlegrounds of ohio michigan and new jersey 
according to sources in both parties republican and democratic 
tracking polls showed bush leading nationally by a margin of seven 
to nine percentage points within the range of the nationwide 
surveys released earlier this week democrats contended there was 
still opportunity for dukakis with sizable numbers of undecided or 
weakly committed voters 
by states private polls pointed to a significant republican lead 
in ohio dukakis held a narrow margin in one new york survey and a 
slight advantage in washington where he was ahead by 10 points in a 
statewide poll with a five point margin of error both illinois and 
california where dukakis will wind up his campaigning were rated 
close 
meanwhile the bush campaign announced late thursday that the 
eighth person connected with the vice presidents ethnic council had 
resigned his post following reports of ties to nazi or antisemitic 
groups 
in washington bush spokesman mark goodin confirmed reports that 
during world war ii akselis mangulis had been a member of the 
latvian legion a group which had connections to the german ss the 
quasimilitary unit of the nazi party 
mangulis had been chairman of latvians for bush 
across the country there was yet another round of new television 
commercials 
dukakis was airing a tough new ad that zeroed in on republican 
vice presidential candidate dan quayle it shows the most remembered 
moment of quayles debate with his democratic counterpart when 
bentsen said senator youre no jack kennedy on the screen 
appear the words president quayle 
the republican party aired a new ad featuring president reagan 
and the boast of good times 
america is at peace and we are prosperous once more the 
president says i hope you will vote republican up and down the 
ticket to continue the change we began in 1981 
today in remarks prepared for delivery in palos hills ill 
where he was speaking at a bush rally reagan said the last eight 
years have been good years but ive got a hunch that when george 
bush gets in the saddle we aint seen nothing yet 
the justice department meanwhile said it it will investigate 
democratic complaints that a republican ad in south texas is 
intimidating spanishspeaking voters the ad in spanish says 
voting officials will be watching closely and warns of penalties 
for noncitizens who try to vote

one in eight medical students suffers from major 
symptoms of depression because of the pressurecooker atmosphere 
in medical school scientists report 
the study documents what many medical educators have long 
assumed which is that medical school is a depressing place to be if 
youre a medical student peter zeldow associate professor of 
psychiatry at chicagos northwestern university medical school said 
thursday 
the fouryear study reported in todays journal of the american 
medical association followed a class of 121 students at rush 
medical college in chicago 
at any point in four years of medical school at least 12 percent 
of the doctorsintraining showed signs of depression at the end of 
the second year the figure rose to about 25 percent and then 
receded 
by contrast about 5 percent of the us population suffers from 
depression the researchers said 
the students symptoms of depression included sleep disturbance 
pessimism sense of failure suicidal wishes and loss of sex drive 
the majority of medical students are quite unhappy or 
miserable whether they are suffering from depression or not 
zeldow said 
the studys authors zeldow and david clark associate professor 
of psychiatry at rush pointed to medical school itself as a major 
cause of the depression 
its just a pressure cooker and if we dropped any cross section 
of the population into it they would get depressed clark said 
the curricula they provide are too dense with information 
zeldow said theres no doubt inadequate attention is paid to the 
emotional needs of the students 
the type of people in medical school is also a factor clark said 
the qualities that make you a conscientious fanatical student 
have a cost clark said 
the researchers differed on whether medical students depression 
would influence the care they give patients when they become 
practicing physicians

george bush today assailed a longtime 
associates public relations firm for trying to capitalize on ties 
to the vice president i denounce it bush said 
the vice president said in an interview that he had spoken to 
fred bush a top republican fundraiser who is not related to him 
about the solicitation to the haitian government made by fred bushs 
partner michael govan 
i denounce it i dont like it i think its wrong bush 
said giving his first comment on the matter during an interview 
aboard air force two en route to cincinnati 
asked why voters should believe he would fill a bush 
administration with people who were not intent on influence 
peddling bush replied they know ive been in public life for 20 
years and no one has ever made any allegations about impropriety on 
my part because they know how strongly i feel about ethics in 
government 
the gop presidential nominee who rarely mentions the white house 
ethics office he proposed early in the campaign said he sitll 
intends to set up one if elected 
on another matter bush said he would favor taking steps toward a 
free trade agreement with mexico along the lines of the one with 
canada but he siad he would not favor that arrangement with japan 
at this point 
mexico might be a very good place for the next major step of 
that nature japan is a little more complicated he said 
on the haiti matter fred bush has said his partner acted over 
his veto and without his knowledge in seeking a contract for bush amp 
company to represent haiti he called it a rotten rotten thing to 
happen to him and to the bush campaign 
the firms letter touted fred bushs connections to the vice 
president 
a former vice presidential staffer fred bush was deputy finance 
director of the presidential campaign and is now a fundraising 
consultant working with the republican national committee on the 
general election 
at a rally in fairfield conn earlier today bush brandished a 
headline that labeled the massachusetts budget situation a mess 
seeking to undermine rival michael dukakis support in the 
governors home territory bush accused dukakis of borrowing like 
mad and kiting checks 
bank overdraft 373000 bush said reading from wednesdays 
front page of the boston herald as he addressed a rally at 
fairfield university in neighboring connecticut the herald headline 
read what a mess 
and thats whats happening in what used to be called the 
massachusetts miracle regrettably it turns out to be a mirage 
bush said 
the news story referred to a 49 million shortfll in state 
revenue during october state officials said this week that a plan 
to slash state spending to head off a potential budget deficit was 
in the offing 
bush said dukakis got into the situation by overspending how 
did he get out of it or try to by raising taxes a total of 180 
million this year alone now hes borrowing like mad writing 
checks that he doesnt even have enough money in the bank to cover 
he may want to be on your side but i dont think the american 
people want to be on his side bush said 
bushs regional campaign director ron kaufman said the campaign 
hoped to capitalize on new polling that shows bush trailing by only 
7 points in dukakis home state all weve been doing in 
massachusetts in this campaign is holding up a mirror kaufman 
told reporters 
he said the campaign is mailing ads to democrats and independent 
voters in counties where president reagan won in 1984 focusing on 
the states economic situation 
in connecticut kaufman said bush leads by nine percentage points 
the gop presidential nominee is hopscotching back and forth among 
a handful of states where the race is close focusing on the midwest 
and going to places where we think its a little bit soft said 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller 
those places included illinois ohio and new jersey on thursday 
todays schedule calls for campaigning in connecticut ohio 
michigan and back to new jersey 
at this stage in the campaign george bush has secured a broad 
base of supporters and is trying to broaden it still further by 
indicating that his views and his values are consistent with 
mainstream america fuller said 
thus while bush spent earlier weeks painting dukakis as a 
liberal who is out of step with the mainstream he now is taking the 
next step to portray himself as the mainstream candidate 
bush uses the word dozens of times a day in rally after rally 
i represent the mainstream the mainstream views and values and 
these are your views and values and we are the change and we are the 
mainstream bush told a rally at farleigh dickinson university in 
hackensack nj 
it is the people of america who will decide what victory means 
what i am asking the people to give me on november 8 is not just a 
political victory but a mandate from the mainstream he added 
the outreach to those beyond the republican faithful includes 
invoking the names of popular democratic presidents franklin d 
roosevelt harry truman and john f kennedy 
bush told a rally at bloom township high school outside chicago 
that those presidents were talking mainstream values but that 
dukakis has too narrow a vision to encompass their mantle

subway trains rolled into the st augustin station 
this week to the tinkling of triangles while waiting commuters made 
music by waving their arms 
the strange phenomenon was the work of christopher janney an 
sound engineer from boston who installed a lightsensitive computer 
synthesizer on opposite sides of the subway platform to create an 
interactive sound environment 
this is not about playing with computers janney said in an 
interview friday the last day of the threeday show this is 
participatory art and if i could do it with rubber bands and pencil 
and paper id do it 
instead he uses the latest in computer and sound technology 
known as reach janneys creation is composed of electronic 
sensing devices placed above the heads of waiting commuters as they 
reach up they break the light beams triggering the sensors and 
activating various consonant notes recorded digitally on the 
samplersynthesizer 
janney 38 says his goal is to get people to communicate with 
each other to create an interesting experience for people waiting 
for the subway and to chip away at the old alienated crowd 
behavior 
responses from commuters have been mixed one elderly woman told 
him he had no right to smash our ears while another 
congratulated him for his genius 
currently a researcher at the massachusetts institute of 
technology janney studied piano at 11 but turned to jazz and the 
drums at 14 he later graduated from princeton university with a 
degree in architecture 
reach is the latest in a series of projects that experiment 
with sound in space in december he will pump sounds into four 
passenger elevators in miami each will have its own individual 
sound environment and certain melodic elements will change depending 
on the floor its on 
im sure some people will feel invaded but its a question of 
putting sound in spaces thats harmonious or soothing he said 
adding that there is no such thing as absolute silence 
last year janneys soundstair toured the united states and 
europe transforming the steps of faneuil hall marketplace in boston 
and romes spanish steps into musical staircases 
his work is subsidized largely by grants and his equipment 
donated or loaned by major corporations each project installation 
costs about 5000 
janney says parisians can forget about reproducing familiar tunes 
because he has grouped the instruments in unconventional groups that 
change every hour 
the project not about creating melodic forms rather its more 
about ideas of indian music drones and harmonies that somehow 
change the nature and quality of the space theyre put in he said 
janney is hoping the paris transit authority will find a 
permanent home for reach the mississippi museum of art and the 
boston museum of science have two of janneys sitespecific projects 
in their permanent collections

rent control will be on the ballot in four 
northern california communities santa cruz wants to ban it 
berkeley and san francisco want to expand it and sonoma wants to 
limit it to certain lowincome residents 
in santa cruz county voters will consider a proposal banning 
future rent control measures it would repeal an ordinance 
protecting residents of mobile home parks and a law requiring a 
percentage of new construction to be affordable housing 
in san francisco measure u would extend existing rent control to 
vacant residential units 
current law limits rent increases on occupied residential units 
to 4 percent to 7 percent annually measure u would put the same cap 
on vacant units a move supporters say is needed to stem the tide of 
wrongful evictions and massive rent hikes that have occurred 
since rent control was established in 1979 
without limiting rents on a unit that becomes vacant current law 
leaves a loophole which supporters say many landlords find 
irresistible 
critics including mayor art agnos and even some housing activists 
say measure u is drafted so strictly that it is doomed to fail they 
call it an extreme measure that would penalize landlords who have 
not raised rents for longtime tenants and would result in a loss of 
rental units 
opponents plan to spend about 800000 to defeat measure u less 
than a week before the election supporters had raised about 18000 
the sonoma county proposal would change the existing mobile home 
rent control ordinance to apply only to low income tenants if 
approved measure h would allow park owners to raise mobile home 
space rents by a maximum of nine percent per year for a period of 
two years following approval 
berkeley voters will decide among three rent controlrelated 
measures measure k the broadest would require landlords to 
register with the city listing current rents being charged for all 
units tenants would be notified when registration fees and 
penalties went unpaid for more than six months and beginning in 
1989 would let landlords set the initial rent for single family 
dwellings 
it would also tighten restrictions on allowable evictions and 
rent increases 
measure l placed on the ballot by the berkeley city council 
after measure k qualified for the ballot would make similar but 
fewer changes it contains several provisions designed to create 
incentives for rental property owners including removal of punitive 
criminal penalties and the elimination of merely technical 
violations according to supporters who include mayor loni 
a third berkeley proposal measure i would allow rent board 
commissioners who own rental property to participate in all rent 
board decisions except those involving rent adjustments on their own 
units 
if approved all board members would be treated the same whether 
they are tenants or owners critics who call measure i special 
interest legislation say the existing law prevents landlords from 
voting on issues in which they could enjoy substantial monetary 
benefits

the chief of the state board of insurance 
has been placed on leave while the board investigates allegations of 
footdragging in the largest insurance company insolvency case in 
texas history 
the board also said thursday that the travis county district 
attorneys office will review the agencys handling of the national 
county mutual fire insurance insolvency case for any criminal 
wrongdoing 
national county mutual a dallas company with 125000 auto 
insurance policyholders statewide was declared insolvent last week 
and taken over by the insurance board the company was 54 million 
in the debt 
the board said recent criticism prompted it to initiate the 
investigation into the departments delay in taking control of 
national county mutual 
several lawmakers complained the insurance boards staff knew of 
the companys problems since at least 1986 and should have moved 
earlier to protect its policyholders 
during the examination commissioner doyce lee will be placed on 
leave board members said 
board members said lee recommended doing the independent audit 
and contacting the district attorney but they said complaints by 
state lawmakers and consumer interest representatives forced them to 
put him on leave 
lee 47 commissioner since 1985 said he agreed with the 
decision 
i think it takes the pressure off of me and the board and the 
agency can go about its business of regulating the industry that 
will give time for the air to clear he said 
state rep john gavin dwichita falls chairman of the house 
insurance committee supported the boards action 
most of the problem seems to be a lack of communication within 
the agency the left hand and the right hand dont seem to work very 
well together he said 
insurance board members attribute many of its problems to a major 
reorganization of the agency and rapid expansion of the staff from 
about 850 employees to 1300 in the past 18 months

ask the vatican to reconsider a recent document that called for 
curtailing the role of such councils 
at a meeting later this month the group will consider a report 
drafted by a panel of leading bishops asking for reconsideration 
the panel has termed the document deficient and criticized it 
for making rigid and confusing distinctions without grounds in 
church law or from the second vatican conference 
a twothirds vote of the bishops will be needed to transmit the 
concerns of the group to rome 
national conferences of bishops relate the teachings of the roman 
catholic church to the people of their nations however on occasion 
the bishops in one nation take different positions from those in 
another on social or political issues such as nuclear disarmament or 
income distribution such instances cause concern in rome 
the vatican working paper sent to bishops conferences worldwide 
for comment warned of the potential for disharmony with rome and 
harm to the appearance of automomy of local bishops 
the us bishops response seeks a reconsideration of the matter 
terming the initial draft deficient enough to suggest that a new 
draft should be framed 
members of the us committee writing the response were 
archbishop john may of st louis retired cardinal john krol of 
philadelphia cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago archbishop john 
r quinn of san francisco archbishop john r roach of st paul and 
minneapolis and bishop james w malone of youngstown ohio the late 
cardinal john dearden of detroit also participated

six dud bullets may have saved the life 
of the citys public housing chief police said 
a woman who had been threatening tenants with a handgun thursday 
pointed it at housing authority executive director larry cole when 
he went out to deal with her and pulled the trigger several times 
the gun merely clicked 
cole said he figured the gun was unloaded but police discovered 
later that the sixshot 22caliber revolver was fully loaded and in 
good condition only the ammunition was bad 
thats the only thing they can see that kept the gun from 
discharging and him from getting shot said police sgt carl 
thompson each bullet had three or four dents in it from the hammer 
so the trigger had been pulled at least 18 times he said 
police knew of no motive for the incident in which cole 
confronted a woman threatening tenants standing on their balconies 
at a housing complex 
i kept telling her to put the gun down and step back he 
said she was about 25 yards away and she was drunk so i figured 
the odds were pretty good that i wouldnt get shot 
eventually he said the gun slipped from her hand 
police charged elaine harris 33 with attempted murder she was 
jailed on 100000 bail cole said the woman told him she was not a 
tenant of the housing project and had recently had been released 
from a state mental hospital 
its just part of the job it was not a big thing cole said 
youve got to get the attention away from the tenants i was more 
concerned about my tenants

russ pengelly figured the only way to protect 
public land was to get the public out there using it so he and his 
hiking buddies set out to create a hiking corridor from mexico to 
canada in the desert 
you cant see the country unless you get out and walk said 
pengelly a retired high school biology teacher who is president of 
the desert trail association which focuses on the arid eastern side 
of the cascades and sierra nevada 
he spoke while following a game trail through brush in the 
diamond craters a volcanic area about 35 miles south of burns 
along the way he kicked at a broken obsidian arrowhead pointed out 
a bleached cow bone and examined bobcat tracks 
i always quote john muir who said you cant really study 
nature rushing through the country 40 miles a day in a stagecoach 
pengelly said 
if you get people out looking at the land i think they will 
want to protect it he said 
though the desert trail association was formed 25 years ago it 
is far from its goal it has mapped out about 150 miles of trail in 
southeastern oregon 25 miles in nevada and about 50 miles in 
southern california 
much of the land along the route using existing trails where 
possible is controlled by the federal bureau of land management 
which has cooperated with the association although its trail has no 
official status 
the guide for the trail through nevadas high rock canyon hasnt 
been issued yet because the association doesnt have the money to 
produce a fullcolor brochure a blackandwhite guide for the 
latest section of oregon trail is due out soon 
the first section of oregon trail which runs from the nevada 
border at denio 25 miles north to fields is marked by stone cairns 
spaced within sight of each other 
but they never built cairns for the next five sections of trail 
which runs across the alvord desert to frog springs over the steens 
mountains to page springs past diamond craters to highway 78 near 
the malheurharney county line 
i dont think theyre necessary said pengelly and we 
havent had the manpower to do it 
unlike the wellknown appalachian trail and its western 
counterpart the pacific crest trail pengelly doesnt want the 
desert trail to be a line on the ground that people adhere o without 
question instead he thinks of it as a corridor through which 
hikers can wander 
its a trail that leads to a great deal more adventure and 
freedom than a designated tread that leads from one point to 
another he said 
the first white men to see this country were trappers from the 
hudsons bay company in 1826 
later in the 19th century cattle barons were drawn by the grassy 
hills one lasting mark of those times is the round barn near riddle 
mountain it was built in 1880 by pete french who built the p ranch 
to 132000 acres before he was shot by a competitor in 1897 
the conical roof is built around a tall juniper trunk and covers 
a stone corral 60 feet in diameter the idea was to break horses 
inside the barn during the winter but the horses wouldnt buck 
until they got outside so the idea was abandoned 
hikers through this country of grassy hills rocky buttes and 
deep gorges can see antelope and mule deer redtailed hawks and 
horned larks as well as the purple blossoms of monkey flower and 
the yellow of blazing star 
all this land you can wander over pengelly said you do 
own it the public owns it thats one of the things about when 
people talk about selling off the public lands to pay off the 
national debt they would be selling off their legacy

bill kovach editor since 1986 of the atlanta 
journal and the atlanta constitution resigned today in a dispute 
with the newspapers management 
kovachs abrupt departure came nearly two years after he left the 
post of washington bureau chief of the new york times to take over 
the newspapers his appointment was widely seen as part of an 
attempt by the papers to achieve national prominence 
publisher jay smith said an irreconcilable difference in 
management styles emerged in a discussion earlier today and 
prompted kovachs departure 
however smith said he felt he and kovach were in accord 
philosophically over the direction the newspapers have taken under 
kovach 
i am proud of the progress we have made under bill smith 
said it is my commitment that we will continue to grow continue 
to find better ways to serve readers and continue to add to the 
stature of the newspapers and atlanta 
kovach said in a statement that his resignation was the 
culmination of two years of effort to develop a set of shared values 
and mutual trust with the senior managers of the company 
unfortunately i was unable to do that it became clear this 
week that no such relationship existed he said the continuing 
challenge to realize the real potential of the atlanta newspapers is 
too great to attempt under those conditions 
kovachs plans were not immediately known 
his resignation was announced to the journalconstitution 
newsroom by assistant managing editor wendell sonny rawls who 
followed kovach from the new york times 
the news stunned reporters who in 1986 had greeted word of his 
appointment with jubilation 
kovach grew up in tennessee reading the atlanta papers then 
under the leadership of civil rights advocate ralph mcgill 
he said he took the editorship of the cox newspapers flagship to 
strengthen mcgills newspaper and to practice journalism the way i 
envisioned it 
he stressed hard news and aggressiveness and among his successes 
was a series outlining how some atlanta banks were refusing loans to 
residents of predominantly black neighborhoods 
the democratic national convention gave the newspapers a chance 
to shine to a national audience and their coverage was favorably 
commented on

president reagan registered disappointment 
friday over a soviet decision to suspend troop withdrawals from 
afghanistan 
administration officials called the move disturbing and accused 
moscow of raising tensions in the wartorn country but they 
stressed that the soviets could still meet their commitment to pull 
out by feb 15 
during a political campaign stop in chicago the president noted 
that the soviets had renewed that pledge even while announcing the 
suspension in moscow 
at the end of a week of us complaints about new soviet weapons 
shipments to afghanistan white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said soviet actions can only increase tensions in the 
region and raise speculation that they aret going to live up to the 
geneva accords 
the soviets pulled out by aug 15 half the 100000 or more troops 
they had in afghanistan the accords require the others to quit the 
country by feb 15 but it leaves the timetable up to the soviets 
in moscow a top foreign ministry official said the withdrawal 
had been suspended because of strong attacks by antigovernment 
rebels 
the soviet troops are being withdrawn due to the good will of 
the soviet government first deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh told a news conference they will be withdrawn in 
honorable conditions 
but bessmertnykh said the current atmosphere of heavy attacks 
by rebels with arms supplied by the united states pakistan and 
other countries does not provide conditions for such a withdrawal 
of soviet troops 
reagan asked about the statement said 
i think we are all disappointed by that at the same time i 
think we should recognize that this is something they have said is 
necessary and they have repledged to bring the troops out by feb 
15 
when asked if the united states planned to take any steps as a 
result of the soviet announcement the president said we havent 
had a chance to sit down and talk it over 
fitzwater who was traveling with reagan said soviet actions 
raise speculation that they arent going to live up to the geneva 
accords he added we expect them to and hope that is what 
their intentions are 
state department spokesman charles e redman called the 
suspension disturbing he also said the soviets had fired a few 
more ss1 scud missiles at rebel forces near the border with 
pakistan 
redman said the united states had urged the mujahedeen rebels not 
to launch actions that might delay the withdrawal of soviet 
forces but he said the escalation of violence was bound to 
harden the attitudes of the guerrillas 
he said bernhanuddin rabbani leader of the islamic society rebel 
group would arrive in washington on monday and meet with reagan and 
secretary of state george p shultz on wednesday 
a senior administration official meanwhile said that before the 
withdrawal suspension the soviets had discussed starting the pullout 
on nov 15 
to say they are suspending now raises a question about what 
they mean the official said are they going to resume on nov 
15 or later 
he said the united states continues to urge the soviets to 
follow the timetable they have set for themselves and to meet their 
obligations to pull out by the 15th of february 
the official added we continue to believe they will do so 
they are engaged more in bluster and efforts to persuade the 
pakistanis to rein in the mujahedeen and to buck up their own 
clients

dawn collins was taking a biology course at pierce 
college last spring when she unwittingly drank a toxic solution 
during an experiment four days later she died a tragedy that 
months of investigation have failed to fully explain 
her family blames not only the solutions manufacturer but 
healthcare workers who they contend botched the 29yearold 
womans treatment on thursday they filed a 25 million lawsuit in 
pierce county superior court seeking damages for negligence and 
outrageous conduct 
ms collins of puyallup and shellie mccallen 18 of tacoma 
were part of a 27student anatomy and physiology class at pierce 
college in the tacoma suburb of lakewood about 30 miles south of 
seattle 
as part of a urine test experiment the two women drank what was 
supposed to be a simple saline solution instead what they 
swallowed was isotonic buffered saline solution containing the toxic 
preservative sodium azide 
both soon became nauseated ms collins more so because she had 
drunk more of the liquid nearly a quart some people become ill 
from ingesting as few as 20 milligrams of sodium azide and ms 
collins was believed to have swallowed 700 to 800 milligrams 
according to pierce county medical examiner dr john howard 
ms collins lost consciousness vomited and had diarrhea before 
she was taken to lakewood hospital where she was treated and 
released the next day four days later on june 5 she fell ill and 
died in another hospital the formal cause of death sodium azide 
poisoning 
the compound according to dr bill robertson of the seattle 
poison center attacks all cells in the body and usually kills 
within six hours in ms collins case the dose was not great 
enough to do that but did fatally damage her heart said robertson 
who as medical director for the washington poison network was 
consulted in the case 
ms mccallen who recovered has joined in the collins family 
lawsuit seeking 100000 damages said the plaintiffs attorney 
vern harkins 
named as defendants are the state of washington lakewood 
hospital multicare medical center the products manufacturer 
harleco owned by em diagnostics of gibbstown nj and american 
scientific products a division of baxter healthcare corp the 
product distributor 
the college and individuals in the case including the courses 
lecturer the lab instructor and technician and a college nurse 
are named in court filings as involved parties but not as 
defendants 
harkins said ms collins survivors a mother four sisters and 
two brothers want to see recognition of liability on behalf of 
the state and other defendants that errors were made in the death of 
dawn collins there also interested in hopefully seeing that 
certain procedures at pierce collee are changed 
the college said only that it expressed regret for the tragedy 
but sandy lewis who taught the lecture portion of the class said 
the pain on the defense side is pretty bad too 
investigations by the sheriffs department the county medical 
examiner and state attorney generals office turned up conflicting 
versions of what happened according to published reports 
first there is the question of how the mistake occurred geoffrey 
fenton a spokesman for product distributor baxter healthcare corp 
of deerfield ill said the solution containing sodium azide is 
clearly marked for external use and meets federal standards 
when the women fell ill lab technician nancy bonenfant reported 
that she called the tacoma poison control center and described the 
solution as containing sodium azide and was told that the amount 
wasnt significant enough to cause harm 
but lind simonsen spokesman for multicare medical center which 
operates the poison control center said an internal review of the 
taped conversation with the lab technician proved that the solution 
had been described as isotonic buffered solution not isotonic 
buffered saline solution 
the nonsaline solution he said is nontoxic and so the 
college was legitimately advised 
then there were reports the college nurse didnt arrive on the 
scene for 45 minutes and that ms collins wasnt taken to a hospital 
for several hours in part because two of her sisters werent sure 
family insurance would cover medical care 
the college has denied irresponsible behavior and the sisters 
contend they wanted ms collins helped right away 
it also remains unclear what information lakewood hospital worked 
with in treating ms collins hospital spokeswoman genie latta said 
the hospital would have no comment 
a response to the lawsuit must be filed by instate defendants 
within 20 days and by outofstate parties within 60 days then 
formal pretrial investigations will begin according to senior 
assistant attorney general mike tardis whose office represents the 
college a trial date may not be set for two or three years because 
of court backups and a settlement could be reached in the interim 
he said

algerias only political party said 
friday the overwhelming approval of reforms in a referendum show the 
time has come for it to stop controlling everything and open 
elections to independent candidates 
the interior ministry said 9227 percent of those voting in 
thursdays referendum called after bloody riots a month ago 
approved constitutional changes designed to limit the the power of 
the national liberation front it said 8303 percent of the more 
than 12 million voters participated 
abdelhamid mehri chief of the party secretariat said friday 
responsiblities have already been given to citizens who are not 
members of the party the question posed now is that as a matter of 
theory we have to throw off this yoke which makes the front appear 
to be a party that monopolizes everything 
mehri is no 2 man to president chadli bendjedid in the national 
liberation front known in algeria as the parti unique or 
single party 
the front led algeria to independence from france in 1962 and 
since then has run every aspect of political economic judicial and 
social life it must approve every candidate for the parliament the 
peoples national assembly 
after further reforms are adopted mehri said all eligible 
citizens will be able to run for all elected posts at both the 
municipal or national levels he spoke in an interview with the 
french television network antenne 2 
bendjedid chose mehri last week to replace mohamed cherif 
messaadia as head of the party secretariat messaadia led the party 
old guard and was believed to oppose the reforms put forth by the 
presiddent 
a party congress that begins nov 27 is to consider more reforms 
not yet spelled out mehri said he believes party members will 
understand the necessary changes 
at this congress we will have tough discussions very hard but 
once the decisions are taken all the party activists will go with 
conviction into the battle for change he said 
the referendum gives bendjedid a clear popular mandate to pursue 
plans at the congress for steps toward eventual free elections and 
opening the economy to private enterprise 
one change adopted thursday gives new still unspecified duties 
to the premier and makes him answerable to parliament rather than 
the president 
bendjedid is expected to name a new premier in a few days to 
replace abdelhamid brahimi the new man would choose a new cabinet 
and begin work on economic reforms needed to pull algeria out of a 
crisis that spawned the week of riots last month 
huge crowds of young algerians protested food shortages 
unemployment and a declining standard of living the interior 
ministry said 176 people were killed most by soldiers firing into 
crowds but unofficial reports put the death toll at 400 or more 
violence ended as abruptly as it began when bendjedid promised 
reform groups of doctors lawyers journalists intellectuals and 
others have demonstrated since about the alleged torture of those 
arrested 
more than 3300 people were arrested during the riots and the 
government said thursday all had been freed 
in an interview on french tv thursday night interior minister 
hedi khediri acknowledged some cases of torture 
acts of torture were committed but i can tell you this torture 
was by individuals security agents on their own initiative and not 
in an organized fashion under orders khediri said 
the army had the task of restoring order the army restored it 
and thats that i believe that is what was most important

west germanys supreme court on 
friday upheld the conviction of a former us serviceman with aids 
who failed to use a condom during sex and kept his disease a secret 
from his homosexual partners 
in its decision the court upheld the november 1987 conviction of 
linwood boyette a former us army cook for attempting dangerous 
bodily harm but it ordered a lower court to reduce the twoyear 
sentence imposed a year ago 
in light of the deadly danger of an infection every 
intentional risk on the part of an aidsinfected person is 
punishable the supreme court in karlsruhe said in its judgment 
the conviction was for attempted bodily harm because it was not 
shown that boyettes two sex partners had in fact contracted the 
virus they have not been identified and court papers say only that 
they met the former serviceman in a club frequented by homosexuals 
west germanys aidshelp group issued a statement calling 
fridays ruling a slap in the face for victims of the disease 
and catastrophic for future counseling efforts the group had 
objected after the conviction that it would make some aids victims 
avoid counseling for fear of criminal prosecution 
karl heinz becker who represented boyette before the supreme 
court said the case would have nationwide impact but not set a 
binding legal precedent it was the west german high courts first 
ruling in a criminal case involving aids 
court sources speaking on condition of anonymity said boyette 
47 served in the us armys 1st armored division in nuremberg and 
had been living in the northern bavarian city before his arrest 
supreme court officials declined to release boyettes hometown in 
the united states 
nuremberg prosecutors spokesman gerhard holzheid said the 
conviction in bavarian state court stemmed from two cases in which 
boyette had sex without using a condom even though he was aware of 
his illness 
according to a report in the munichbased sueddeutsche zeitung 
daily newspaper the former soldier was first informed that he was 
carrying the aids virus by a us military doctor in june 1986 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly affliction in 
which a virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread mainly by sexual 
contact between homosexual men the use of contaminated needles 
among drug abusers and transfusion of tainted blood

proiranian kidnappers today accused the 
united states of delaying the release of american hostages in 
lebanon by reneging on its pledges and promises 
the charge came in a statement signed by islamic jihad or 
islamic holy war and was accompanied by a photograph of american 
journalist terry a anderson the longestheld of the 14 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
it was delivered in a sealed envelope to a western news agency 
the photo which was different from the previous 13 pictures of 
anderson released by the kidnappers showed him wearing glasses a 
white tshirt and with a mustache in a videotaped message released 
oct 30 he had no mustache 
in the photo anderson was facing a birthday cake with candles 
and looked straight into the camera his right hand appeared ready 
to clasp a knife to cut the cake the kidnappers did not say when 
the photo was taken 
anderson marked his 41st birthday his fourth in captivity oct 
27 
the only safe way to the freedom of the captives and their 
safety is the implementation of our just demands this is the 
essential cornerstone in this issue nothing else the statement 
typed in arabic said it did not spell out the demands 
the statement stressed that the release of the hostages was not 
connected with the aug 20 ceasefire that halted the eightyear 
iraniraq war 
we repeat for a thousandth time that the issue of the captives 
altogether is not in any way linked to what happens in the persian 
gulf the hope that prevailed in the past has gone forever the 
statement said 
failure to free the hostages is a result of the american 
heresy procrastination and reneging on pledges and promises the 
statement said 
it rebutted president reagans assertion that the kidnappers 
forced anderson to read his latest videotaped statement in which 
the hostage accused the us government of interfering to stop his 
release 
in that statement anderson read a message accusing reagan and 
vice president george bush of failing to do enough to secure his 
release 
it said ive been very close to being released several times 
over the past two years but each time it seems that the us 
government uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made 
and i dont understand this 
reagan denied his administration was bargaining with terrorists 
saying i dont think that was terry speaking i think he had a 
script that was given to him 
the message anderson read said reagan and bush negotiated with 
terrorists in the irancontra affair and the 1985 hijack of a twa 
jetliner to beirut 
bush has denied he was involved in the irancontra affair or in 
any negotiations with the twa hijackers who held 39 americans for 
17 days more than 700 arab prisoners were released from a northern 
israeli prison in the weeks following the hijacking 
todays islamic jihad statement said the videotape 
irrespective of its contents has been issued directly by terry 
anderson without any pressure 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman stood by 
the administrations contention that andersons taped remarks were 
made under duress anytime you have people being held hostage 
tapes letters those kinds of things are by definition under 
duress he said 
asked whether the united states had gone back on a deal as the 
kidnappers alleged for the release of the hostages redman said 
absolutely not there have ben no deals we dont make deals 
the islamic jihad statement promised that anderson will make an 
adequate answer to the denials made by reagan and bush but did 
not specify when 
the statement said islamic jihads hostages are not isolated 
from he outside world 
they see and hear the news from newspapers magazines and 
television stations they are aware of everything that happened or 
will happen about their situation 
what reagan has said in this regard is like the ostrich that 
hides her head in the sand so that the hunter will not see her 
the statement also said the us administration represented 
by its president his vice president staff and aides carried out 
all the deals concerning the hostages 
otherwise who negotiated in the twa hijack and why were the 40 
passengers and 735 prisoners in israeli jails freed who also 
negotiated in the irancontra affair who gave the weapons and took 
the money and funneled its to the contras 
the 14 foreign hostages in lebanon include nine americans

here is the full text of islamic jihads 
statement friday it was translated from arabic by the associated 
press 
in the name of god the merciful the compassionate 
to the free men of the world 
to the american people 
to the families of the hostages 
day after day the american administration is cheating lying and 
misleading the american people and the families of the hostages to 
head off any pressure on the american government to embark upon 
realistic steps to resolve the question of the hostages in order to 
preserve their government leaders posts privileges and personal 
interests after the american comment by reagan and bush about the 
contents of the videotape recorded by terry anderson we wish to 
clarify the following 
1 the videotape irrespective of its contents has been issued 
directly by terry anderson without any pressure it was made in 
response to the written and photographed messages which were sent to 
him through news agencies the tape was made after sharp exchanges 
between him and us about all the ideas he introduced which we 
considered very lacking anderson will make an adequate answer to 
these reagans claims 
2 america is constantly evading the contents of the videotape 
and the messages which form an irrefutable and incontestable 
reality by casting direct doubts about the tapes contents and by 
claiming it was issued by the kidnappers 
3 the hostages we hold are not isolated from the outside world 
they see and hear the news in newspapers magazines and television 
stations and are aware of everything that happened or will happen 
about their situation what reagan has said in this regard is like 
the ostrich that hides her head in the sand so that the hunter will 
not see her 
4 the us administration represented by its president his 
vice president staff and aides carried out all the deals concerning 
the hostages otherwise who negotiated in the twa hijack and why 
were the 40 passengers and 735 prisoners in israeli jails freed who 
also negotiated in the irancontra affair who gave the weapons and 
took the money and funneled it to the contras it is strange that 
reagan has lately declared that he does not know so far who offered 
the arms and the origin of the money in the irangate isnt it the 
american administration or are they at a cattle ranch with each 
seeking his own ends if they really knew that will be an 
undeniable calamity and if they didnt that will be an even 
greater catastrophy 
5 it has also been said that the ceasefire in the gulf will 
speed up the release of the captives with us we repeat for a 
thousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not in 
any way linked to what happens in the gulf the hope that prevailed 
in the past has gone forever failure to free the hostages is a 
result of the american heresy procrastination and reneging on 
pledges and promises 
the only safe way to the freedom of the captives and their safety 
is the implementation of our just demands this is the essential 
cornerstone in this issue nothing else

discouraged workers facing layoffs in less 
than a month had their spirits lifted friday when british prime 
minister margaret thatcher visited the birthplace of the banned 
solidarity trade union 
workers inside pressed against the closed gates of the lenin 
shipyard to get a glimpse of mrs thatcher the first western head 
of state to travel to gdansk to meet with solidarity leader lech 
walesa 
we love mrs thatcher we love mrs thatcher shouted the 
hardhatted workers who had climbed atop buildings for a better view 
of her placing a wreath at a monument near the gates honoring 
workers killed in 1970 food price riots 
mrs thatcher arrived in the midst of a struggle for the future 
of the famous shipyard where solidarity sprang to life in august 
1980 the government announced it is to be closed beginning dec 1 
the shipyard is ours lenin is yours the crowd shouted 
referring to the name of the yard mrs thatcher dont let the 
shipyard be closed one banner implored 
solidarity has said it will fight the closure contending the 
decision was made for political reasons not economic ones as the 
government says 
the officially recognized union and management have formed for 
the first time a common front with the yards illegal solidarity 
organization in order to oppose the decision 
despite various police barriers solidarity supporters were able 
to reach the front of the monument for mrs thatchers visit mixing 
with crowds that had been bused in from official organizations 
reporters estimated 20000 people turned out to see her 
inside the shipyard workers climbed on the gates and on the 
roofs of administrative buildings in defiance of a warning by strike 
committee leader alojzy szablewski not to be too aggressive and risk 
police response 
as soon as mrs thatcher emerged from her limousine the crowd 
and the workers began to shout solidarity solidarity and 
there is no freedom without solidarity 
walesa accompanied mrs thatcher to the 130foot monument 
consisting of three soaring steel crosses which solidarity erected 
in its heyday in 1980 to commemorate the scores of workers killed by 
police on the baltic coast during the 1970 riots 
workers went on a rampage in that year after authorities raised 
food prices just before christmas security forces answered with 
gunfire killing a still unknown number of people 
visibly moved at her reception mrs thatcher waved to the crowd 
around the monument and walesa helped her mount a small stepladder 
so she could reach over a metal barrier and shake hands with a few 
of the people 
the authorities had done their best to spruce up the baltic port 
and discourage unofficial crowds from forming streets were washed 
thursday night even though a light snow already had washed away much 
of the grime 
scores of police trucks and jeeps clogged the narrow side streets 
near the monument and hundreds of police patrolled the port still 
the crowd followed mrs thatchers car to st brygidas church where 
she had lunch with walesa and union leaders 
solidarity gdansk welcomes mrs thatcher said a large sign 
on the church 
spectators said they stood behind mrs thatchers position on 
human rights but they were less enthusiastic about her attitude 
toward trade unions 
she is a courageous woman she would give us nothing but we 
still have to respect her said one of the workers inside the yard 
others admired her firm will saying her style of leadership was 
needed in poland 
if poles are wise they will learn a lot from this visit 
because she is the iron lady who knows how to govern said bernard 
kowalewski an invalid and retiree 
mrs thatcher got a roar of applause for her short speech of 
thanks in st brygidas that was carried over loudspeakers 
after she departed the crowd tried to march back to the 
monument but police already had sealed off the streets they 
dispersed peacefully after several minutes

deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos 
says he feels betrayed by the american system he once admired and 
worries more about his place in history than going to jail 
i am not afraid to go to jail marcos told the associated 
press in an interview at his home thursday i would probably be 
dead by the time the trial is over im feeling in pain every day 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted oct 21 by a federal 
grand jury in new york on criminal racketeering charges accusing 
them of plundering more than 100 million from their homeland and 
funneling it into swiss and hong kong bank accounts manhattan real 
estate and fine art 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges in new york on 
monday but her husbands arraignment was delayed pending the report 
of a government physician who examined him monday 
defense lawyers contend the 71yearold marcos who remained in a 
wheelchair during the interview is too frail to make the 10hour 
flight to new york and hinted his poor health may cause his trial to 
be suspended altogether 
marcos who seemed tired but alert during the interview said he 
would comply with a federal court order requiring him to submit 
fingerprints palm prints and handwriting and voice samples to the 
fbi by wednesday or face contempt charges 
ill take my destiny whatever that may be but im going to 
fight for my dignity and my honor marcos said in his first 
meeting with the press since being indicted 
theyve offered me nothing marcos said of prosecutors for 
guidance i turn to god i pray for the best and expect the worst 
a staunch us ally during his 20 years in power marcos said he 
held no animosity toward president reagan who once hailed him as a 
valuable friend and helped him resettle here but said he felt 
betrayed by the us justice system 
its nothing personal we just feel that the worship of the 
statue of liberty was misplaced he said we feel betrayed by an 
american system that we believed to be fair and just now it 
seems that is not true 
although the manhattan grand jury indictment was handed up after 
nearly two years of investigation and grand juries in honolulu and 
alexandria va are also investigating him marcos said he was 
confident he would be vindicated 
i dont think they have any evidence said marcos offering 
the results of past investigations in the united states the 
philippines and japan that cleared him of similar charges 
the interview was held at marcos hillside home overlooking 
honolulu as he prepared to leave for an appointment with an eye 
doctor wearing a dark suit and tie marcos greeted a reporter with 
a firm handshake and smiled wanly when asked about his health 
im tired and in pain im on the way to the doctor right 
now he said 
since being exiled here in 1986 marcos has complained of chest 
pains that caused his hospitalization and of an eye ailment and 
flareups of old war injuries of the leg and the knee 
during the interview marcos face appeared puffy and his eyes 
watery an aide said early friday marcos sought medical help for 
severe headaches which his eye doctor said may be attributed to 
deteriorating vision 
defense lawyers for marcos have presented letters from two 
honolulu doctors and marcos personal physician saying marcos 
suffers from an enlarged heart and a thickening of the heart muscle 
mrs marcos visiting thursday at the new jersey home of tobacco 
heiress doris duke who posted her 5 million bail said her 
husbands health was her chief concern 
he is my biggest worry now his health has been deteriorating 
throughout these three years of stress shock and frustration of an 
injustice and a betrayal she told the starledger of newark

unemployment fell to 53 percent in october 
matching a 14year low the government said friday as employers 
added 325000 new jobs and floored the accelerator on an economy 
that had been slowed by the summer drought 
in its last major economic report before tuesdays presidential 
election the labor department said the 01 percentage point drop 
from septembers 54 percent jobless rate was accompanied by 99000 
new manufacturing jobs the biggest monthly increase in that 
employment category since february 1984 
but janet l norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor 
statistics cautioned that the october pickup in factory employment 
may be somewhat overstated because of a seasonally adjusted 
increase of 25000 jobs in canneries and other food processing 
plants 
factory jobs had declined by 45000 in august and september 
the labor department said there were fewer fall cutbacks than 
usual in food industry employment following light summer hiring 
due to the drought 
but even discounting all of the seasonal gain there payroll 
growth in october returned to the 300000 monthly rate it had 
averaged in 1986 1987 and the first seven months of this year after 
falling to 240000 new jobs monthly in august and september 
the 53 percent jobless rate in october matched junes rate as 
the lowest since may 1974 
the future is bright and its getting brighter president 
reagan said of the figures as he was leaving the white house to 
campaign for vice president george bush nothings going to stop 
us now 
private political and economic analysts agreed 
only a dramatic change in the employment numbers indicating 
some fantastic failure or crisis could have helped democratic 
nominee michael dukakis said richard brody a political science 
professor at stanford university 
instead economists said the october job numbers foretell an 
economy returning to a growth rate of 3 percent or more annually in 
the fourth quarter after it slowed to 22 percent over the summer 
a good case is developing that the fourth quarter will show 
stronger growth than the third said jerry jasinowski chief 
economist for the national association of manufacturers 
jasinowski said companies are telling him that their factory 
orders which fell 19 percent in september according to the 
government bounced back again last month 
the manufacturing employment gains plus figures in fridays job 
market report showing that assembly line workers continued to work 
on average 4 hours of overtime each week last month buttress that 
scenario 
the slowdown in growth over the summer was more droughtrelated 
than most people believed jasinowski said it was the most 
extraordinary summer in decades and it did slow the pace of things a 
bit more than the governments seasonal adjustments did 
william dunkelberg an economics professor at temple university 
who surveys small businesses said an expansionhigh 25 percent 
of small businesses reported unfilled job openings in october 
capital spending is on a tear with 34 percent of small 
businesses planning to make new capital expenditures in the next six 
months dunkelberg said even if you go back to the late 1970s you 
dont get numbers that good the unemployment rate is more likely to 
keep going down rather than up 
absent the effects of the drought and with all this capital 
spending going on the first half of 1989 is going to be very 
strong he added its hard to see how youre going to get into 
a recession until 1990 
ms norwood told the joint economic committee of congress there 
are now 422000 more factory jobs than there were a year ago even 
though the net increase over the past three months amounts to only 
54000 
manufacturing industries other than food processing including 
lumber and wood products steel and aluminum machinery motor 
vehicles and rubber and plastics showed significant gains in 
october 
retail trade and health services with 50000 and 47000 new 
jobs respectively paced a payroll increase of 231000 in october 
on the services side of the economy 
however department store employment fell for the fourth month in 
a row economists viewed that as a healthy omen that consumer 
spending may be slowing relieving some inflationary pressure while 
savings are rising to fuel even more capital investment for 
productivity improvements 
my feeling is that the economy real gnp uninflated gross 
national product is growing by 3 percent and that inflation will 
stay around 4 percent said edward yardeni chief economist for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
fridays employment figures sent both bond and stock prices down 
as investors gave up hopes that the federal reserve board would 
reduce interest rates after the election analysts said 
theres no chance of that now yardeni said but at the 
same time i dont think that the fed is going to tighten either 
analysts also attributed the decline in stock and bond prices to 
a recurring fear on wall street that continued falling unemployment 
is going to push up wages and ignite inflation 
fridays report showed average hourly earnings rising 5 cents 
last month to 949 an increase of 38 percent over the past 12 
months in terms of purchasing power however those wages were 
buying 1 percent less than they had a year earlier the government 
said

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen on friday visited a science program founded after the 
explosion of the space shuttle challenger to highlight the 
democratic tickets commitment to the space program 
but bentsen the man democratic nominee michael dukakis has said 
would head a new cabinetlevel council on space incorrectly told an 
audience of school children that the next shuttle mission would be 
unmanned 
bentsen was campaigning in houston on his way to california with 
a stop in new mexico en route 
space is big business in texas where the democrats still hope to 
pick up 29 electoral votes 
the texas senator toured the challenger center at the houston 
museum of natural science the center was founded in the wake of 
the challenger tragedy that claimed the lives of its sevenmember 
crew to boost interest in science and technology among the young 
bentsen stopped first at a mock space station to watch fourth 
graders operate robots and work on a science project with special 
gloves mounted through a transparent panel 
in a rare instance where the character issue could be 
scientifically measured a girl held wires to bentsens finger to 
measure the electric activity on his skin in what was explained to 
be a stress test he measured only 16 on a scale where five is 
normal 
that means im cool bentsen concluded 
afterward in the museum auditorium bentsen took questions from 
an audience of school children who seemed most interested in whether 
he was having a good time 
how did you get to be vice president one asked 
i havent done it yet he answered 
is if fun to be a vice president said another 
i dont know yet he replied ill tell you ive had fun 
running for vice president 
explaining the progress of the space shuttle program he said 
they tell me that later this month were going to put another one 
up in space called atlantis he said but that not going to have 
any people on it 
actually the atlantis will carry a crew of five on its 
classified military mission the next unmanned shuttle mission will 
be launched by the soviets 
bentsens press secretary mike mccurry said the error was on a 
briefing paper given to bentsen just before the event the texas 
senator was unsure if the information was correct but referred to 
it anyway mccurry said 
bentsen took a poll of the children and about half said they 
wanted to be astronauts he told them other jobs would be good too 
including public service 
he told them to tell their parents to vote next tuesday they 
must go and be part of it he said 
the kids raised their hands to indicate they would tell their 
folks to go to the polls including bentsens grandson lloyd m 
bentsen iv 
youre going to do that too thats good said lloyd m

vice president george bush said friday i 
think its wrong that a consulting firm run by a longtime 
associate used its political connections to try to drum up new 
business 
in an interview with the associated press bush also said he is 
weary of campaigning and would rather be home playing horseshoes but 
denied that americans are turned off by negative campaigning 
the idea that this campaign is so different from others i 
dont believe it i dont think the american people believe it all 
this stuff about being turned off you can always go out and find 
people to say that our people dont say that when i get off this 
airplane bush said in an interview aboard air force two 
bush expressed dismay at the disclosure that a consulting firm 
headed by frederick m bush no relation had sought business with 
the new government of haiti citing its ability to influence a new 
gop administration 
i denounce it i dont like it i think its wrong the vice 
president said 
frederick bush also disavowed the effort saying it had been 
initiated without his knowledge by his partner michael govan 
asked how frederick bush could have allowed it to happen george 
bush said ask him how he could allow it to happen 
how could the chief education adviser to mr dukakis end up in 
jail he added referring to gerald indelicato convicted in july 
of skimming money from an adult education program he ran 
bush said the lobbying episode should not be taken as an 
indication of things to come if he is elected voters he said 
know ive been in public life for 20 years and no one has ever 
made any allegations about impropriety on my part because they know 
how strongly i feel about ethics in government 
the vice president has said he would establish an ethics office 
in the white house if elected 
at rallies on friday bush attacked rival michael dukakis 
handling of massachusetts fiscal management and suggested that the 
democrat might have to seek another tax increase to finance the 
states budget shortfall 
at a speech at fairfield university in stamford and at a rainy 
downtown rally here bush held aloft a copy of the boston herald 
whose frontpage headline read what a mess in referring to the 
states budget crisis 
in the ap interview bush said he expected his gesture would get 
more attention than just talking about the issues 
this man has been claiming there is a miracle in massachusetts 
i have to hold up a little graphic to get peoples attention i 
think thats fair its factual its a little shot people can 
see does that mean i shouldnt do it not as long as its accurate 
and it is so i dont have any regrets about it 
the vice president interviewed on his plane between events in 
connecticut and ohio dismissed suggestions that his campaign was 
easing off in anticipation of victory 
we cant do any more we just cant bush said claiming he 
was still waging an exhausting campaign he said hed rather be 
home more play horsehoes i get tired you know weve been 
doing this a long time 
but its important to do he added and you learn ill be 
a better president because ive done that campaigning 
bush said he was real proud of the way his campaign has been 
conducted with the election now only four days off 
i can only hark back to when the news media were writing 
entirely different views of my chances and my character and where i 
stood i think its dramatically changed 
im just going to keep on going until election day bush 
said im reasonably upbeat but not overconfident 
also in the ap interview bush said 
if elected he would support a free trade pact with mexico 
similar to the one recently negotiated with canada calling mexico 
a very good place for the next major step of that nature but he 
said he opposes such an arrangement at this time with japan 
japan is a little more complicated and i would have to be 
satisfied that going that route that we had total access to the 
japanese markets bush said 
predicted a surprise of next tuesdays election might be 
strongerthanexpected support for him from young blacks and 
hispanics he said were disenchanted with the democratic party 
because of its treatment of jesse jackson i think they feel 
theyve been taken for granted he said 
asked why he wasnt spending more time campaigning in areas where 
blacks and other minorities live bush said historically i think 
everybody knows this is a very difficult area for republicans to get 
a lot of votes and im trying to get a lot of votes 
praised fridays unemployent figures showing the jobless rate 
to have dropped to 53 percent a 14year low 
he said it was further evidence that a recession is not at hand 
and bush added if my programs are adopted that would be a very 
good guarantee there wouldnt be a recession

un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
friday met separately with the foreign ministers of iran and iraq 
for unmediated peace talks and said they were extremely useful 
discussions 
the separate meetings follow a facetoface session of technical 
experts of both countries thursday which he praised for doing some 
excellent work in terms of clarification of details 
perez de cuellar did not elaborate on his talks with irans ali 
akbar velayati and iraqs tariq aziz nor on the work of the experts 
he said he planned to return to new york on monday 
a joint plenary session with both ministers and their delegations 
was set for saturday the session to consolidate the fragile truce 
in the 8yearold war is the third since the talks went into their 
third round last monday 
the talks still are bogged down over the question of the common 
border point one of the 10point un ceasefire resolution calls 
for the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized 
borders 
both sides claim patches of their territory still are occupied 
aziz told reporters his talk with the un chief was 
constructive as usual 
velayati said discussions focused on a un compromise proposal 
to break a deadlock in negotiations that started aug 25 five days 
after the unbrokered ceasefire 
that plan links troop withdrawal and the exchange of an estimated 
100000 prisoners to iranian assurances to cease searching ships in 
the persian gulf for warrelated cargo and to the dredging of the 
shattalarab 
the waterway called the arvand river by the iranians is blocked 
by ships stranded by the war unexploded shells and silt it is 
iraqs only navigable outlet to the gulf 
the waterway is also the most contentious issue between the two 
states because iraq in 1980 repudiated a 5yearold treaty that set 
the border down the middle of the shatt iraq wants to regain full 
sovereignty moving the border back to the iranian shore where it 
was before 1975 
iranian and iraqi experts friday also had separate meetings with 
officials of the international committee of the red cross to discuss 
repatriating prisoners of war 
a foreign ministry legal expert from iraq later repeated to 
reporters his countrys rejection of irans insistence that an 
exchange of all pows go handinhand with a troop withdrawal as 
provided by the un resolution 
ryad elkaisy called the iranian argument fallacious and strange 
iraq maintains that a prisoner exchange could take place 
immediately under the geneva conventions which say a prisoner 
exchange should come after the cessation of hostilities 
the iranian side made no comment after its meeting

the soviet union said friday it has suspended 
military withdrawal from afghanistan and sent in sophisticated 
weapons because of unrelenting pressure from moslem guerrillas 
witnesses have reported mig27 groundattack jets and ss1 scud 
missiles in afghanistan 
alexander bessmertnykh first deputy foreign minister repeated 
soviet accusations that the united states and pakistan violate the 
withdrawal agreement by sending a constant flow of arms to the 
insurgents 
the soviet troops are being withdrawn due to the good will of 
the soviet government bessmertnykh told a news briefing they 
will be withdrawn in honorable conditions 
he said an atmosphere of bombing mortar and rocket attacks on 
civilians government soldiers and the departing soviet forces 
does not provide the conditions for such a withdrawal of soviet 
troops and declared the withdrawal of the troops is being 
suspended 
his comments reflected soviet frustration over how the afghan 
army has handled the fight in the nearly three months since the red 
army reached the halfway point in withdrawning its estimated 115000 
men 
bessmertnykh also appeared to indicate the withdrawal might not 
be completed by the feb 15 deadline set in the april 14 geneva 
agreement mediated by the united nations the withdrawal began may 
15 
while reiterating soviet commitment to the agreement he said 
if none of the countries violate the accords they would be 
fulfilled by the soviet union 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
soviet action can only increase tensions in the region and raise 
speculation that they arent going to live up to the geneva 
accords 
president reagan was asked about bessmertnykhs comments and 
replied i think we are all disappointed by that at the same 
time i think we should recognize that this is something they have 
said is necessary and they have repledged to bring the troops out by 
feb 15 
when asked whether the united states planned steps in response 
he said we havent had a chance to sit down and talk it over 
soviet officials have repeatedly threatened the guerrillas and 
their supporters with serious consequences but have not been 
specific 
half the soviet forces were withdrawn by aug 15 under terms of 
the geneva agreement signed by afghanistan pakistan the soviet 
union and united states the insurgents were not parties to the 
negotitions and continued the war 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in december 
1979 more than 5 million afghans fled most of them to border 
cities and refugee camps in pakistan that have served as bases and 
supply points for the insurgents 
soviet generals say more than 13000 of their soldiers were 
killed and 35000 wounded 
a pause in the soviet withdrawal has been evident since aug 15 
so the immediate effect of bessmertnykhs announcement was not 
clear a senior reagan administration official said privately in 
washington the soviets had discussed renewing the pullout nov 15 
bessmertnykh said friday what is important is not the date at 
which the withdrawal will be continued but when it will be 
completed 
he said the insurgents get a steady flow of armaments of us 
and other origins in violation of provisions in the geneva 
agreement against noninterference in afghan affairs 
new troops are being rotated into afghanistan with more 
sophisiticated arms and the soviet union is now delivering to the 
military forces of afghanistan additional and more powerful means of 
destruction he said 
bessmertnykh added however that the number of weapons and 
soldiers is not increasing and soviet personnel do not participate 
in attacks on guerrillas 
soviet soldiers have been subjected to 555 shelling attacks 
including 88 with rockets and mortars he said and soviet outposts 
have come under attack 400 times bessmertnykh said the soviet 
forces had suffered casualties but he would not say how many 
insurgent attacks killed 230 civilians in october bessmertnykh 
said 
witnesses said earlier this week they saw mig27s attacking 
guerrilla positions near the southern city of kandahar and scud 
missiles were seen in kabul for the first time 
scuds have a maximum range of about 180 miles and are intended 
for use against concentrations of hardware and arms used against 
soviet military units and towns in afghanistan not against 
pakistan bessmertnykh said 
a senior western diplomat in moscow said privately it is 
difficult to win a war against guerrillas with groundtoground 
missiles longrange bombers or even groundattack aircraft based 
close by some of what is happening is intended to convey a 
political message than achieve a military objective

final election results issued friday gave 
yitzhak shamirs likud bloc 40 parliament seats and the prime 
minister pressed ahead to form a majority coalition with rightist 
and religious parties 
his aides brushed aside calls for a new version of the 4yearold 
national unity coalition with the centerleft labor party of 
foreign minister shimon peres which won 39 of the 120 knesset 
seats the fractious likudlabor arrangement was made after the 
indecisive 1984 election 
al fajr a newspaper that supports the palestine liberation 
organization published a draft declaration of independence for a 
palestinian state in the occupied territories which is expected to 
be approved at a meeting later this month of the palestine national 
council the plo legislature 
how to make peace with the arabs and end the 11monthold 
rebellion among the 15 million palestinians of the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip were the focus of tuesdays election in which 
the conservative religious parties gained strength 
palestinians say the draft declaration is a step toward peace 
because it implicity recognizes israels right to exist avi pazner 
a shamir aide discounted the document and said we are not asking 
the plo to recognize israel and we will not give them anything 
shamir opposes giving up land captured in the 1967 war favors 
building more jewish settlements in occupied territory and rejects 
an intrernational conference on middle east peace demanded by the 
arabs labor supports both a conference and trading some land for 
peace 
israeli soldiers shot and wounded 18 palestinians friday in the 
west bank gaza arab hospital officials reported 
since the uprising began dec 8 1987 more than 300 palestinans 
and 10 israelis have been killed at least 7000 palestinians have 
been wounded 
traditionally israels president asks the leader of the largest 
party in the knesset to form a government shamir has held 
preliminary coalition talks with four religious and three farright 
parties that won a total of 25 seats likud must add 21 seats to its 
own 40 to obtain a majority 
peres also courted the religous parties but his chances of 
forming a majority are seen as slim some in his party said he 
should end negotiations and accept an opposition role because 
competition for support of the religious parties strengthens their 
bargaining position without benefiting labor 
among the demands of religious parties which have a total of 18 
knesset seats are changes in the law defining who is a jew for the 
purposes of granting automatic citizenship and banning driving 
movies and soccer games on the sabbath 
a likud member of the cabinet moshe katzav also expressed 
concern about religious pressure 
the religious are presenting many demands and difficult 
conditions the newspaper hadashot quoted him as saying we will 
not be able to respond to them all 
katzav raised the prospect of inviting labor into a likud 
government as a junior partner to weaken reduce the clout of 
religious parties but said labor would have to drop its support of 
an international peace conference 
peres appeared to dismiss the possibility of another coalition 
with likud we will not join any government that has no peace 
plan he said on israel radio 
pazner the shamir aide said such a government is not 
something realistic right now labor would not agree to join as a 
junior partner 
a poll published in the daily maariv indicated 65 percent of 
israelis opposed another national unity government and 60 
percent were concerned about the rising power of the orthodox 
religious 
al fajrs report said the palestinian declaration of independence 
will be presented to the palestine national council on nov 14 it 
calls for a palestinian stat based on un security resolution 181 
of 1947 which calls for both a jewish and an arab state 
israel rejects the 1947 partition plan which gives the occupied 
lands and key areas of what is now israel to the palestinians the 
plan also calls for international control of jerusalem which israel 
has annexed and declared to be its capital

prosecutors ordered the arrest of a man 
convicted of nazi war crimes by the soviet union after they learned 
through news reports he had fled to west germany from the united 
states a prosecutor said friday 
boleslav maikovskis is in investigative custody in a prison in 
bochum although no charges have been filed in west germany 
we heard the news reports on the weekend and the investigation 
was started the next monday said klaus schacht the dortmund war 
crimes prosecutor handling the west german investigation of 
maikovskis 
until then we didnt know he was here schacht told the 
associated press in a telephone interview 
maikovskis 84 was picked up at his muenster apartment on oct 
19 two days after the investigation began schacht said he had 
lived in mineola ny and west german authorities say he came here 
in november 1987 
the soviet union in 1965 sentenced maikovskis to death in 
absentia for his role in burning down a village and participating in 
the murder of more than 130 men women and children in his native 
latvia the charges say the deaths occurred while he commanded a 
pronazi police force during world war ii 
on thursday west german officials defended issuing an entry visa 
to maikovskis saying he had valid travel documents and had not been 
charged in the united states bonn officials said the visa was 
issued for a threemonth stay to allow maikovskis to pursue legal 
matters 
he also applied for political asylum in west germany which 
allowed him to remain here while the case was pending 
last month the us justice departments office of special 
investigations said it had lost track of maikovskis and had just 
discovered he left the country 
the united states began trying to deport him in 1976 but the 
case was delayed by several appeals his latest appeal was denied by 
the us supreme court in 1986 
west german officials have said they would consider extraditing 
maikovskis to the soviet union if it waives the death penalty

she felt the spirit of poland 
crowds shouted slogans against communism and polands premier as 
mrs thatcher the first western leader to meet walesa at the 
shipyard came to gdansk after telling the government it must 
negotiate with the banned trade union solidarity before it can 
receive longterm western aid 
mrs thatcher later returned to warsaw for a final round of talks 
with polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski at the end of a 
threeday visit she then boarded a royal air force jet for london 
her emotional reception in gdansk was heightened by her tough 
attitude to jaruzelski and by the governments annnouncement this 
week that it will close the lenin shipyard the birthplace of 
solidarity on dec 1 as part of an economic austerity program 
i came to see and to have a long talk with mr walesa i 
knew that i had to come and feel the spirit of poland for myself 
said mrs thatcher referring to the port city of gdansk that is the 
heartland for the long struggle by workers for a free trade union 
at a farewell news conference mrs thatcher said if the 
government recognizes solidarity britain will respond we shall 
not be found wanting when poland makes the progress toward freedom 
and democracy its people clearly seek she said 
government spokesman jerzy urban said officials were not 
convinced we are skeptical of such attempts to define conditions 
and of such promises he said 
polish leaders have told mrs thatcher the country is crippled by 
a 39 billion foreign debt but she has said poland must show 
evidence of real economic and political reform before it gets more 
aid 
shipyard workers in hardhats climbed on surrounding rooftops and 
crowds burst into deafening chants of solidarity solidarity as 
mrs thatcher laid a wreath with walesa at a towering monument to 
scores of workers slain here in 1970 price riots 
as security police trucks ringed surrounding streets mrs 
thatcher had lunch with walesa his roman catholic confessor the 
rev henryk jankowski and 14 other leaders of the union at st 
brygidas parish church near the shipyard 
crowds poured into the streets around the church and shipyard and 
shouted viva thatcher to the british leader who has curbed the 
power of trade unions in her own country 
at the shipyard and monument a section of the crowd yelled 
down with communism and out with rakowski the new polish 
premier mieczyslaw f rakowski who announced the closing of the 
yard monday 
walesa said security police tried to stop the crowds by clogging 
streets with police trucks and stopping solidarity leaders from 
getting to the monument until shortly before mrs thatcher arrived 
see how many came despite the efforts to stop them said 
walesa they have filtered through somehow we will not be 
defeated 
at a service in st brygidas after lunch the high redbricked 
church and its nearby streets echoed with chants of solidarity 
supporters 
with walesa standing beside her in the sacristy his arm raised 
in a vforvictory sign against a background of red white and gold 
solidarity banners mrs thatcher was visibly moved as the 
congregation broke into a traditional national hymn god watches 
over poland 
thank you for coming out and giving me and everything i believe 
in such a warm welcome said mrs thatcher her eyes glistening 
a british official who declined to be identified by name said 
that at the lunch in the rectory with the priests bedroom turned 
into a bar walesa and mrs thatcher joked often in between serious 
political discussion 
and at the end she wished him success in his historic 
endeavors the official said 
before the meeting with walesa mrs thatcher visited the 
westerplatte monument on the bay of gdansk scene of the first shots 
of world war ii accompanied by jaruzelski the solemn wreathlaying 
ceremony recalled the polishbritish wartime alliance 
mrs thatchers evident doubts about the pace of reforms by 
jaruzelski and government attempts at setting up talks on polands 
future her public support for solidarity and her huge welcome in 
gdansk cast doubts over the success of the visit for her communist 
hosts 
official media in poland gave the visit heavy coverage but 
pointedly omitted any mention of mrs thatchers contacts with 
walesa on the national tv news friday night 
at a state banquet thursday night she told jaruzelski that it was 
vital he negotiate with oppostion groups including solidarity 
the solidarity leadership responded with gratitude 
it was beautiful what she said said historian bronislaw

an opposition lawmaker resigned friday in a 
burgeoning stock scandal that reaches as high as prime minister 
noboru takeshita and taints others in the governing party 
takumi ueda became the first politician to give up his seat in 
the japanese diet or parliament because of the scandal his 
resignation increases pressure on implicated leaders of the 
governing liberal democratic party including former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone he led the government when the stock profiteering 
took place in 1986 
the affair involves top ruling and opposition party members who 
purchased unlisted shares of recruit cosmos co a real estate firm 
they reaped massive profits after they began trading them publicly 
in october 1986 
i accept responsibility resign from my parliamentary seat and 
apologize deeply to the people said ueda of the leading 
opposition group the japan socialist party 
he is the 15th legislator linked to the scandal including 
takeshita and finance minister kiichi miyazawa of the ruling liberal 
democratic party 
uedas party has led opposition parties in demanding a 
parliamentary investigation of the scandal despite reluctance by the 
governing party 
ueda like many others implicated denied knowledge of the 
transaction in which a former aide was said to have used his name to 
purchase 5000 shares in september 1986 just one month before they 
were listed on the overthecounter market in tokyo 
in japan public share offers usually rise substantially in the 
first few days after trading begins people can be legally invited 
to purchase prelisted shares and often make hefty profits 
the government has said the trading of the shares was legal under 
japanese securities laws but opposition parties have raised ethical 
questions anyway 
socialist party chairwoman takako doi hailed uedas decision to 
resign and described the recruit scandal as worse than the 
lockheed scandal in which the us lockheed corp allegedly gave 
millions of dollars in bribes to japanese politicians for aircraft 
sales 
the lockheed scandal broke in february 1976 and led to the 
conviction of former prime minister kakuei tanaka

sen dan quayle on friday cited a nearly 190 
million overdraft in massachusetts current bank account as evidence 
that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis is illequipped 
to manage the federal government 
campaigning for support in louisiana where the energy industry 
has been beset by hard times in recent years quayle pounced on the 
revelation that massachusetts tax receipts had fallen considerably 
below expectations causing the multimilliondollar shortfall 
we thought it was bad when massachusetts had to borrow another 
600 million in the first months of the fiscal year just to stay 
afloat the republican vice presidential candidate told a 
flagwaving crowd gathered in a park here 
quayle said that despite the totally false denials made by 
governor dukakis in his last debate with george bush we knew the 
fiscal situation was bad 
the american people are not only just beginning to find out how 
bad it really is but they are finding as we are that the fiscal 
situation in massachusetts is a time bomb set to explode in the 
faces of its citizens he said 
dukakis questioned about the states fiscal problems told 
reporters at new yorks laguardia airport we dont have deficit 
what we have is 10 balanced budgets in a row 
quayle delivered the broadside a day after accusing dukakis of 
making phony tough statements about cracking down on drug 
abusers saying the government had been disengenous because dukakis 
opposes such anticrime measures as capital punishment for drug 
kingpins and mandatory prison sentences for drugrelated felonies 
this week the citizens of massachusets awoke to find out that 
their states bank accounts have been overdrawn up to 190 million 
for the past 30 days he said so it turns out that governor 
dukakis has been writing hot checks to keep his states finances 
afloat 
the state constitution of massachusetts requires a balanced 
budget but the amount of tax receipts coming into the states 
coffers have been considerably less than anticipated by the office 
of state treasurer robert crane consequently the balance in the 
current accounts fell into arrears by nearly 190 million 
governors faced with less than expected state tax revenues often 
issue what are called revenue anticipation bonds meaning they 
borrow money against revenues they expect to come in subsequently 
and thus close such gaps in bank accounts 
but in the massachusetts situation state officials evidently 
opted to pay the interest on the 190 million overdraft rather than 
face a higher prevailing interest rate on the floating of such bonds 
the state has over 1 billion in separate accounts but these 
monies are untouchable they involve funds raised through other bond 
issues for such things as highway and capital improvement projects 
sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice presidential candidate 
had used a hot checks charge against quayle during their oct 13 
debate in omaha neb saying the reagan administration had allowed 
the federal budget to fall more than 200 billion in arrears 
you know if you let me write 200 billion worth of hot checks 
every year i could give you an illusion of prosperity too he 
told quayle 
under the reagan administration the federal debt has more than 
tripled to more than 263 trillion 
quayle said that dukakis likes to talk about a massachusetts 
miracle but the only miracle involving massachusetts will be the 
one he needs to get out of the mess hes created for his state 
en route to the airport from the louisiana rally quayle stopped 
at a predominantly black elementary school and visited with several 
children engaging in light banter and talking about opportunities 
for americans under republican rule 
he was traveling on to alabama later to address a rally on the 
campus of auburn university before returning to washington quayle 
will make campaign appearances saturday in maryland and west 
virginia but no schedule had been announced for sunday

cambodias prince norodom sihanouk and 
vietnamesebacked prime minister hun sen meet in france next week to 
try to agree on how to organize a future cambodia without the khmer 
rouge 
main absentees at the new talks scheduled for monday in 
fereentardenois 70 miles northeast of paris will be the khmer 
rouge the movement caused the deaths of a quarter of cambodias 8 
million people in an agrarian form of communist revolution that 
began 1975 
in 1978 vietnam invaded cambodia and ousted the khmer rouge 
the sihanoukhun sen meeting the third of its kind here in the 
past year was to begin saturday in paris hun sen asked for the 
delay according to a spokesman for sihanouk who volunteered no 
reasons 
the noncommunist international community refuses to recognize 
the vietamesebacked regime that has run cambodia for 10 years 
but sihanouk who ruled 19411970 has made little headway in 
arranging an acceptable coalition excluding the khmer rouge he has 
resigned once and for all as leader of the antivietnamese 
coalition because it included a khmer rouge element 
the hun sen regime has the backing of the soviet union while the 
khmer rouge the biggest and most effective force fighting the 
vietnamese retain the backing of china 
hun sen and sihanouk first met in fereentardenois last december 
and in stgermainenlaye in the new year they came closer than 
ever to agreement said son sann prime minister in sihanouks 
resistance government 
in reality the three parties remain far apart not even a meeting 
between highlevel chinese and russian diplomats broke the deadlock 
sihanouk has met most western leaders including president 
reagan british prime minister margaret thatcher and french 
president francois mitterrand they see in him the main hope for 
agreement on an acceptable cambodian government which he would lead 
sihanouk is demanding the hun sen government step down before 
free elections while hun sen wants the elections to come before any 
change to his regime neither side has realistically tackled the 
khmer rouge problem 
the khmer rouge are believed to have at least 40000 wellarmed 
men in the field compared with sihanouks 15000 when vietnams 
120000 regular soldiers leave cambodia as promised by 1990 the 
khmer rouge surely will try to make a comeback 
to prevent this the united states gives sihanouk open and covert 
aid of 20 million a year though reluctantly because it is afraid 
of upsetting china southeast asian countries including malaya and 
singapore also help sihanouk 
the khmer rouge are the only crucial pawn china still holds in 
the struggle for cambodia to abandon them the chinese leadership 
expects concessions from moscow

announcing hamadis parents arrived from their home in beirut and 
were expected to testify tuesday 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 when

opposition to the alternate license plate scheme newspapers 
reported friday 
twelve years of only promises lamented the rome daily la

a freeforall with white supremacists that left 
talk show host geraldo rivera with a broken nose will be civil 
rights leader roy innis last television brawl innis said friday 
let me say that i in relation to my wife i have retired from 
fighting on television innis said on the wwortv program 
people are talking 
the latest episode the second time a television interview 
involving innis turned violent occurred thursday during the taping 
of riveras talk show 
racist remarks prompted innis chairman of the congress of racial 
equality to grab a young white supremacist by the neck other 
supremacists stormed the stage and chairs and punches were thrown 
earlier this year innis had a runin with new york activist the 
rev al sharpton shoving him to the floor on the morton downey show 
i dont want to use the term culprit but you have the same 
person making the first move on both programs said bill boggs 
executive producer of the downey show 
i surely didnt need a confrontation after the sharpton 
situation innis conceded ive had two incidents because of a 
new phenomenon that is hitting america in the last couple of years 
increased public indecency 
there are certain racist types blacks and whites who feel 
they have a constitutional right to verbally abuse and physically 
abuse people innis said i think it is immoral for decent 
people to acquiesce to that 
riveras show featured members of the white aryan resistance 
youth the american front and skinheads of the national resistance 
the latter named for their closecropped hair 
other guests included innis rabbi a bruce goldman and a 
bayonne nj couple who said they were attacked and terrorized by 
skinheads 
the brawl started when john metzger 20 leader of the white 
aryan resistance youth complained about kikes and called innis 
an uncle tom 
innis got up from his seat and began choking metzger innis said 
he gently massaged his neck 
the result rivera said was like a benchclearing brawl at a 
hockey match about a dozen of them came out of the audience 
rivera was first struck on the back of the head with a chair 
said his spokesman jeff erdel his nose was broken either when he 
fell or when he was struck by a second chair while lying on the 
floor 
afterward rivera called for calm concluded the show with a 
smaller panel and then taped two more shows he was examined by a 
doctor and may undergo surgery erdel said 
the skinheads had been isolated from the audience by burly armed 
guards erdel said 
no one wanted violence on the program and we took every 
precaution imaginable to ensure that erdel said but once the 
violence happened geraldo fought back and he fought well he got 
in some terrific punches 
innis said that violence notwithstanding programs featuring 
controversial guests should be allowed to continue 
to have these kinds of people spew their hate out in the gutter 
and in the basement is more dangerous i think thats how the brown 
shirts in germany got started innis said you need to expose 
those guys quickly the sharptons the maddoxes the masons the 
skinheads the klan 
the program will be broadcast late this month on 178 television 
stations around the nation the exact date has not been chosen 
no question its big ratings people are going to want to see 
the show when it airs boggs said but i can assure you geraldo 
and his producers did not set out for geraldo to get his nose 
broken

a sevenman team of british bobbies friday 
climbed 1575 steps to defeat their american counterparts in a 
stairclimbing race at the empire state building but neither team 
ever left the 86th floor 
they promised the people in england that they would climb the 
stairs of the empire state building if they contributed to a 
hospital fundraising drive and they did said robert udowitz a 
spokesman for the event 
members of britains west bar police station in sheffield 
competed against officers from brooklyns 67th precinct in a race 
that fulfilled a fundraising obligation 
well sort of 
instead of actually climbing the steps to the top of the 
102story landmark the officers raced on a stairmaster 
computerized stairclimbing machine that simulated the same number 
of steps 
the machine was on the 86th floor deck of the empire state 
building so udowitz figures that was nearly the top of the building 
the bobbies won the race in just under 30 minutes completing all 
131 flights of stairs while the brooklynites finished 128 
during the contest team members passed a baton shaped like the 
empire state building to their successor after approximately 225 
steps 
the sheffield force has raised more than 10000 in england for 
the rotherham district hospital the drive was started by an officer 
whose daughter was born with cerebral palsy and is being treated in

president reagans decision to pocket veto a 
wilderness bill that would have released 41 million acres of land 
for development could backfire against state gop candidates say 
hopeful democrats 
but republicans who sought the veto claiming the bill did not 
free up enough land are looking to harvest votes from reagans 
action only the second such veto in his eight years in office 
reagan announced wednesday he would not sign a bill designating 
143 million acres of roadless national forest land in montana as 
federally protected wilderness it was only the second time he has 
vetoed a state wilderness bill he has signed more than 30 
more than 6 million acres of montana wilderness have been closed 
to development because of federal court decisions in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s a wilderness bill from congress is needed to 
release any of this land for other use the bill vetoed by reagan 
by protecting 143 million acres would have freed up the remaining 
land 
the white house denied the veto decision was political but first 
word of the veto came not from the white house but from conrad 
burns the gop challenger to sen john melcher dmont who 
sponsored the wilderness legislation 
polls show burns in a close race with melcher and burns 
campaigned heavily in recent days on what he said would have been 
the legislations negative impact on montana jobs 
as our next senator i will hold hearings across montana on 
this critical issue and work to pass wilderness legislation that is 
in the best interest of all montanans he said in a statement 
released with the veto announcement 
burns and the republican candidates for the states two 
congressional seats all asked reagan to veto the measure saying it 
would cost jobs by locking up too much land as wilderness and 
wilderness study areas putting miners and loggers out of work 
reagan offered the same explanation in his veto message and also 
noted the bill designated almost twice the amount of wilderness 
recommended by the us forest service 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday the veto 
resulted from a variety of economic and environmental reasons 
not politics 
but democrats and environmentalists said the move was political 
manipulation pointing out that nearly all wilderness bills signed 
by reagan have had more wilderness acreage than recommended by the 
forest service 
this whole veto is simply part of an effort to reduce the 
possibility that there might be more democrats in the us senate 
next session said sherm janke of bozeman chairman of the montana 
chapter of the sierra club the real reason is to embarrass the 
candidacies of those who have supported the wilderness legislation 
some democrats predicted a backlash noting the issue of 
wilderness preservation in montana has been debated for a decade 
with this years bill the first potential resolution 
were looking at a process thats been going on for 13 years 
and with a lack of a stroke of a pen ronald reagan has just dumped 
all that in a dumpster said ron richards a melcher aide i 
would think theres going to be some resentment among some folks 
democrats say releasing the 41 million acres is needed to 
stabilize montanas mining and timber industries which are 
recovering from recession in the early 1980s 
tom daubert press secretary for the dukakisbentsen campaign in 
montana expressed hope that the veto might convince more montanans 
to vote against vice president and gop presidential nominee george 
bush who democrats say advised reagan on the veto 
george bush has added insult to injury here daubert said 
weve had eight years of voodoo economics and the icing on the 
cake is prolonged instability in the mining and timber industries i 
think montanans know that jobs are at stake here

tests on dust and soil in the southeast 
alaska town of skagway show lead levels 560 times above normal and 
officials are offering free blood tests for all residents 
officials stressed thursday there was no cause for alarm and no 
evidence that any of the towns 790 residents were poisoned 
the lead is believed to be linked to an ore terminal at skagway 
harbor operated by bowhead equipment co of seattle and owned by 
white pass transportation ltd 
bowhead stores and loads ore concentrates mostly lead and zinc 
sulfide that are mined in the yukon by curragh resources inc of 
canada the powdery ore is shipped from skagway to japan korea 
europe and australia 
the normal level of lead in skagways soil is about 50 parts per 
million said dick stokes southeast regional supervisor for the 
state department of environmental conservation the tests showed 
lead levels as high as 28000 parts per million said jim cronin a 
consulting engineer with a company hired by bowhead 
however officials said they did not know what level of lead in 
soil poses a threat 
its very dependent upon the form of the material the location 
of the material and the potential pathways to human exposure said 
carl lautenberger of the us environmental protection agency 
until 1982 the ore was transported to the terminal by rail since 
1986 when the terminal reopened the ore has been taken through 
town on trucks 
terminal employees have undergone tests for several years to 
comply with federal safety rules 
children pregnant women and families of workers at an ore 
terminal at skagway harbor are most at risk of lead poisoning said 
dr katherine kelly of the state health and social services 
department 
lead poisoning can cause headaches anemia colic paralysis and 
cramps it also can stunt growth in children and cause birth defects 
cronin said soil tests also revealed high levels of zinc which 
is less of a health concern and lower levels of mercury cadmium 
copper and silver

months behind her 
i ask that you return me to my children as soon as possible so 
i can raise them because they are without parents right now mrs

an ohio congressman on friday asked the us 
environmental protection agency to add the fernald uranium 
processing plant to the nations superfund cleanup program of toxic 
waste sites 
democratic rep thomas luken a persistent critic of the fernald 
plant said putting it on the cleanup list may be the only way to 
pressure its owner the us department of energy into cleaning up 
radioactive contamination at the plants 1050acre site in fernald 
18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
the plant formally known as the feed materials production 
center processes uranium for the governments production of nuclear 
weapons which are produced elsewhere 
nearly 13 million pounds of uraniumcontaining waste have been 
dumped into the environment since the plant opened in 1951 
according to the ohio environmental protection agency the doe has 
admitted the dumping and says it plans to clean up the area 
to make fernald a superfund site may be the only way we can get 
the ball rolling on cleaning up the fernald site luken said 
the request will be directed to epa administrator lee thomas 
in washington energy department spokeswoman gail bradshaw said 
her department was unaware of lukens request she said other energy 
department sites have already been added to the superfund list 
i dont think wed have any comment other than it is our intent 
to bring them all into compliance ms bradshaw said of lukens 
proposal 
residents near the fernald plant and the state of ohio have 
separate lawsuits pending alleging that the plant has polluted its 
environment with radioactive materials and created a public health 
threat

prime minister margaret thatchers huge reception 
from the polish people and her outspoken calls to recognize 
solidarity and pull down the berlin wall won praise and frontpage 
headlines in britain 
mrs thatchers boldness and in particular her statement that 
economic cooperation with the west would come only when basic human 
rights were a way of life in poland surprised even her supporters 
in the media 
the prothatcher times of london called her statement in warsaw 
on thursday remarkarble saying it showed greater boldness 
than expected the daily telegraph called it forthright and 
the independent said it was a remarkably hardline speech to the 
polish government 
the tabloid daily express which supports mrs thatchers 
conservative government had a frontpage headline saying 
thatcher freedom speech is censored 
it said by the time her speech was beamed to the polish people on 
television out had gone all the references to the berlin wall 
the helsinki agreement human rights solidarity and warsaw pact 
chemical weapons 
the daily mirror which supports the socialist opposition labor 
party had a brief story on page 2 focusing on mrs thatcher 
shopping in a warsaw market it then reported here comments on 
western aid 
the times said mrs thatchers words were clearly aimed at a 
much wider audience it was an important address on eastwest 
relations significantly timed at the moment when the us 
presidential election leaves her as the dominant voice in the west 
under the headline thatcher preaches polish pluralism the 
liberal guardian said mrs thatcher has decided to deliver a 
magisterial lesson to both sides in deeply divided poland warning 
the government that it must give its people freedom but preparing 
to tell lech walesa that strikes offer no solution 
the tabloids focused more on her reception the conservative 
daily mail said in its frontpage headline thousands cheer maggie 
on her polish pilgrimage the independent daily today under the 
headline poles sob as maggie calls for freedom said 
cheering crowds mobbed premier maggie thatcher yesterday as she 
made a triumphant visit to warsaw 
the british broadcasting corp quoted neil kinnock leader of the 
labor party as saying friday that mrs thatchers exhortation for 
the polish government to talk with solidarity was insincere because 
mrs thatcher herself did not talk to any sections of society 
the guardian said in an editorial friday that the department of 
trade and industry had suddenly postponed an expected announcement 
about the future of a british shipyard under threat of closure 
a department spokesman unidentified in keeping with british 
practice said only that discussions were under way with the 
shipbuilders 
the paper said the alleged delay was likely a political move to 
avoid embarrassment for mrs thatcher when she went to gdansk 
where the government has announced it is closing the lenin shipyard

an air force logistics center in georgia paid 
an estimated 104 million for spare parts that did not meet contract 
specifications amounting to 89 percent of its inventory according 
to a pentagon audit 
a draft copy of a pentagon inspector generals report concluded 
the air force did not receive the quality parts it paid for 
a spokesman for air force logistics command at wrightpatterson 
air force base in dayton ohio took sharp issue with the draft 
report which was obtained from the pentagon and distributed by the 
project on military procurement a private watchdog group in 
washington 
the figure is very misleading said air force spokesman ken 
perrotte they tested a sample and made projections he said 
challenging both the methods and the calculations used by the 
inspector generals office 
he was unable to offer an alternative estimate of the percentage 
or value of the spares that did not conform to contract 
specifications he said that detailed calculations were likely to be 
included in a report that was being prepared at air force 
headquarters at the pentagon in response to the draft inspector 
generals report 
to make their estimate auditors from the inspector generals 
office visited the warner robbins air logistics center 18 miles 
south of macon ga and checked samples of 46 inventory items 
ranging from a bolt costing 695 to more complicated hardware 
costing thousands of dollars per item 
the center is one of five maintained by the air force around the 
country together the five employ 20000 people and warehouse spare 
parts and components worth 209 billion the report said 
the total value of the items checked was 1144 million of which 
484 million worth were found to have major nonconformances 
which made them unfit for service and 55 million had less problems 
known as minor nonconformances 
the auditors checked 1027 samples of 46 different items and 
projected their results against a total of 685925 spare parts 
calculated to have been at the center those projections showed that 
89 percent of the spares did not meet contract specifications 
we projected that the logistics center paid about 1038 
million for spare parts that had major nonconformances and minor 
nonconformances to contract specifications the inspector 
generals report said 
since the same acquisition and quality assurance procedures 
used to purchase spare parts at the logistics center are also used 
other air force logistics centers the same probability exists that 
the other centers have acquired nonconforming spare parts in supply 
classes that we audited it said 
perrotte the air force spokesman also challenged that finding 
saying that the inspectors classified as nonconforming many items 
which had only slight defects and were fully serviceable 
the inspector generals report was the first to deal specifically 
with air force spare parts 
however the report listed seven previous audits dating back to 
1983 which indicated widespread quality control problems in the 
military those audits found that 
a contractor shipped 3 million in defective spare parts to an 
army depot in corpus christi texas in 1983 
defective parts on navy helicopters were not always reported 
or investigated in 1984 
more than 50 percent of the quality deficiency reports sent to 
the defense logistics agency were inaccurate or inadequate in 1986 
defense department field offices did not always ensure that 
supplies and services conformed to contract specifications in 1986 
the number of known defective items going unreported was small 
in 1987 
the air force was experiencing problems with the quality of 
fiber optic cables but failed to follow through in 1988 
four classes of navy missiles failed to conform to contract 
specifications in 1988 
the latest audit showed that contractors that supplied the 
parts failed to satisfactorily control quality the department of 
defense did not identify the quality control problems and 
nonconforming parts were accepted by the government and not 
identified for corrective management actions the inspector 
generals report said

the captain of a philippine ship that 
sank in typhoon ruby with 500 people aboard did not heed repeated 
weather warnings an official told a hearing on the oct 24 disaster 
juanito lirios deputy director of the philippine atmospheric 
geophysical and astronomical services administration gave the 
testimony at the opening of a government hearing on the sinking of 
the dona marilyn 
the maritime industry authority which conducted the hearing 
said it would order owners sulpicio lines to show cause why it 
should not lose its franchise because of the disaster the second 
within 10 months involving a sulpicio passenger ship 
officials say 161 passengers and 39 crewmen have been rescued so 
far from the dona marilyn at least 76 people are confirmed dead 
on wednesday president corazon aquino said she was suspending 
sulpicios passenger service indefinitely 
but sulpicio vice president vicente gambito said friday he had 
received no such order and service was continuing philip tuazon 
chief of maritime authority said the suspension meant all sulpicio 
vessels would be held in port until they and their crews passed 
inspection 
lirios said the weather center issued 21 advisories on the 
approach of typhoon ruby starting oct 23 the day before the dona 
marilyn sailed from manila to tacloban on leyte island 
the first bulletin warned the typhoon was threatening the eastern 
visayas islands where the vessel sank he said 
the advisories go to the centers 64 coastal radio stations 
which relay them to ships at sea 
it is the duty of the captain to monitor the weather lirios 
said 
coast guard officials said they cleared the dona marilyn for 
sailing because weather in manila was good 
on thursday shipowners appealed to mrs aquino to reconsider 
suspending sulpicio the countrys largest domestic shipping 
company it operates 22 passenger and cargo ships which carry 20 
percent of domestic traffic among the countrys 7200 islands 
we would like to caution the government against taking hasty 
decisions said pacencio balbon president of the conference of 
interisland shipowners and operators 
figures on the dona marilyns casualty toll vary widely because 
of conflicting reports on the number aboard the skipper capt 
eliodoro salgado is among the missing

more than 500 nicaraguans fleeing the 
hurricanedevastated atlantic coast have sought refuge in costa rica 
in recent days the government said friday 
immigration officials are expecting a landslide of new 
nicaraguan refugees in the next weeks and that concerns us because 
all the refugee camps in costa rica are already filled with 
nicaraguans said luis alberto cordero an aide to president oscar 
arias 
hurricane joan destroyed the port of bluefields as it blasted 
into nicaragua on oct 24 killing more than 100 people leaving 
another 200000 homeless and striking another blow at nicaraguas 
already devastated economy 
cordero said the new arrivals are mainly from the bluefields 
area which is about 200 miles north of the costa rican port of 
puerto limon he did not say whether they came by land or by sea 
more than 10000 nicaraguans live in costa rican refugee camps 
run by the un high commissioner for refugees but there are 
actually more than 200000 nicaraguans in costa rica according to 
carlos jose arce chief of the costa rican immigration office 
we are facing one of the strongest floods of inmigrants and we 
are not prepared to receive them because we have our own 
problems cordero said 
hurricane joans torrential rains also hit costa rica destroying 
at least 1500 towns and villages and flooding many more

the shooting of kirsten kischnick 31 on oct 25 1987 
prosecutors said the murder was committed to collect more than 1 
million in insurance 
riechmann had claimed that a pedestrian shot ms kischnick in the 
head with a 38caliber pistol after the two stopped their car to 
ask directions in downtown miami 
he said he then drove frantically around miami and finally to 
miami beach looking for a policeman but police and prosecutors 
doubted the story 
the state noted that a 38caliber weapon similar to the one used 
in the killing was found in riechmanns luggage 
on aug 30 by a 93 vote the jury recommended the death penalty 
in a plea for his clients life attorney edward carhart said 
that in the penalty phase of the trial evidence was presented that 
the motive for the crime was insurance but there was no proof that 
there was cold calculation and premeditation and that there was 
a question that he did it for the insurance 
carhart also said he was troubled by the fact that the jury 
didnt realize the serious possibility that a mistake has been 
made 
he then asked the judge to overrule the jurys recommendation and 
sentence riechmann to life imprisonment with no possibility of 
parole 
in sentencing riechmann to death solomon said he had carefully 
considered the testimony 
i find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the 
mitigating circumstances he said and that the crime was 
committed in a cold calculating and premeditated manner

and furniture has forced a family to flee their home and has baffled 
hazardousmaterials investigators officials said friday 
yesterday the furniture started falling apart and their 
clothing started falling off their body said ray hughes chief of 
the dayton fire departments suppression bureau the clothing 
you could run your fingers through it 
were worrying about longterm health effects said lt 
thomas whipp of the citys hazardous materials team 
hughes said firefighters spent about five hours at the home of 
ethel back on thursday he believes the problem is caused by an acid 
or a caustic but thats about all investigators know 
we cant figure out where its coming from or how it got in 
there said hughes right now were stymied

about 200 demonstrators gathered outside 
viennas famed burgtheater on friday to protest the premiere of a 
play critical of the nazi past and austrias treatment of jews 
police increased security around the theater but the 
demonstration was peaceful and no incidents were reported 
the tumult over austrian playwright thomas bernhards new play 
heldenplatz or heroes square has grabbed headlines for 
weeks in a nation that takes its culture at least as seriously as 
its politics 
the title heldenplatz is the name of a large vienna square 
where adolf hitler appeared in triumph to an estimated 1 million 
jubilant fellow austrians after the nazi annexation in march 1938 
newspapers and staterun television have indulged in debates 
about the freedom of the arts which are heavily sponsored by 
austrias 75 million citizens in a country that sees subsidized 
worldclass opera music and drama as part of the national heritage 
during the first two acts of heldenplatz friday night some 
people in the theater called out outrage but the interruptions 
were immediately drowned out by demonstrative applause in support of 
the performance spectators said 
outside protesters conducted heated discussions about the 
freedom of art 
police officials said security has been stepped up inside and 
outside the burgtheater a 100yearold structure at the edge of the 
hofburg palace complex from which the hapsburg family once ruled 
controversy over bernhards play first erupted when two popular 
tabloids published what they billed as excerpts from his tale of a 
jewish family that emigrated in 1938 the year the nazis annexed 
austria to the third reich and returns to vienna 50 years later 
in austria you must be either national socialist or 
catholic one jewish character was quoted as saying nothing 
else is tolerated everything else is destroyed 
another widely attacked quote said to be from bernhards script 
depicted austria as a stage where everything has run to seed 
turned bad and decayed a collection of 6 million abandoned extras 
who hate one another 6 million feeble angry people who 
continually shout for a director 
the storm of protest that ensued did nothing to hurt ticket 
sales fridays premiere sold out in half an hour and tickets for 
the next 10 performances are hard to get 
president kurt waldheim whose own record as a german soldier in 
world war ii has sparked fierce debate about the nazi past 
denounced bernhards play as a crass slander of the austrian 
people 
according to an excerpt from rehearsals broadcast thursday on 
austrian radio the play at one point brands waldheim himself as a 
cad 
joerg haider head of the conservative freedom party first 
attacked bernhards play then reputedly ordered tickets for the 
premiere sparking a running public argument with burgtheater 
director klaus peymann over who got the coveted firstnight seats 
peter sichrovsky a respected jewish author who has read 
bernhards unpublished play wrote a long article attacking the 
drama in fridays issue of der standard 
it is a terrifyingly bad play wrote sichrovsky banal 
polemical onesided falsifying stupid and dangerous he added 
attacking bernhards use of a synthetic jew to attack austria 
neither bernhard nor peymann are strangers to controversy in a 
city that savors scandal in its worldrenowned arts 
bernhard an awardwinning author in west germany and his native 
austria has been shocking his compatriots since 1955 when he wrote 
what was considered a scandalous article criticizing the hallowed 
musical scene in salzburg native town of wolfgang amadeus mozart 
peymann a german became embroiled in fierce controversy this 
summer after he denounced the historic burgtheater its actors and 
austrian politicians and cultural figures in a long interview with 
the hamburg weekly die zeit 
the actors in his troupe split into two embittered camps whose 
divisions were barely healed before scandal erupted anew over 
bernhards play

president reagan accused the 
democrats friday of a new lack of civility and portrayed michael 
dukakis as an inept governor who runs a state that is getting 
sloppier and sloppier by the day 
the president campaigned for votes on behalf of the gop ticket in 
the battleground states of illinois and new jersey mixing 
getoutthe vote pitches with a chicago billsigning ceremony making 
genocide a crime 
in an afternoon stop at the main street mall in this suburban 
southern new jersey community reagan bemoaned the mudslingling 
that has marked the senate campaign between sen frank r 
lautenberg who is seeking a second term and his republican 
challenger pete dawkins 
the match has been one of the most rancorous in the nation 
dawkins has accused the senator of being a leftwinger with a record 
of little achievement while lautenberg painted his rival a onetime 
army brigadier general as a carpetbagger 
reagan described both dukakis and lautenberg as farout 
liberals who oppose a strong defense tough judges and budget cuts 
reagan added weve seen a lack of civility creeping into the 
way the opposition in congress operates 
reagan made no mention of the charges voiced repeatedly by 
dukakis and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen dtexas that bush 
has pursued a campaign based on distortions and lies 
in the same speech reagan did not mention dukakis by name but 
he charged the massachusetts governor with allowing his state to 
rank an abysmal 30th in the annual rate of job growth in 1986 
and 1987 and with overdrawing his states bank by as much as 190 
million for a month 
the massachusetts mess is getting sloppier and sloppier by the 
day reagan said you tell me whos on your side that 
liberal governor or george bush 
earlier in the day reagan turned one of dukakis favorite 
slogans to gop use in a speech to several hundred gop partisans at 
moraine valley community college about 20 miles from downtown 
chicago 
the democrats reagan argued say theyre on your side but 
thats just an empty promise they promise but you know we 
deliver 
if you want to know whos on the side of the little guy well 
ill tell you its the big guy the big guy from texas reagan 
said 
in his prepared remarks about the genocide treaty reagan made no 
mention of the fact that us participation in the pact had been 
held up for nearly 40 years primarily by a group of hardcore 
conservatives unwilling to submit as they argued to a treaty that 
sublimated american interests to an international pact 
others argued the language of the pact contained uncertainties 
that could undermine the constitution 
while the united states signed the genocide convention in 1949 
legislation implementing the pact didnt pass the us senate until 
last month 
the bill makes genocide a crime punishable by life in prison 
and defines it as the intentional destruction of national ethnic 
racial or religious groups in whole or in part 
we gather today to bear witness to the past and learn from its 
awful example to make sure we are not condemned to relive its 
crimes reagan said at an impromptu signing ceremony staged at 
chicagos ohare international airport 
instead of holding the ceremony in washington on thursday as 
white house officials had once indicated might be the case reagans 
schedulers opted for the chicago site only miles from the suburb of 
skokie ill the community rocked by turmoil when rightwing nazi 
enthusiasts won the right to march in the streets of heavily jewish 
neighborhoods 
the treaty marked a triumph for sen william proxmire dwis 
who had given more than 3000 speeches over the past 19 years in 
favor of the treaty fitzwater said the white house invited proxmire 
to the ceremony but the senator was unable to attend 
on saturday reagan travels to the detroit area for a bushquayle 
rally at macomb community college and to mesquite texas near 
dallas for a gop gathering in a rodeo arena 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president also 
will make a oneday crosscountry trip on monday for two events in 
southern california a state with the largest electoral prize of 47 
votes the locations have not yet been announced fitzwater said

ptl founder jim bakker was not surprised 
when prosecutors sent him a letter telling him he was the target of 
a 15month federal grand jury investigation into the television 
ministrys finances an attorney said friday 
obviously when youre notified in writing its a cause of 
concern ryan hovis said when asked for his clients response to 
the oct 24 letter from federal prosecutor charles alexander 
this is not news to us its been known for the better part of 
a year that bakker was a target he said adding it was not a 
foregone conclusion that he would be indicted 
the grand jury has been impaneled since august 1987 to 
investigate allegations of mail and wire fraud conspiracy and 
criminal tax violations 
since that time prosecutors have subpoenaed thousands of 
documents to try to learn how bakker operated the ptl and how he and 
his aides spent millions of dollars in contributions from 198087 
bakker resigned as ptl president in march 1987 in the midst of a 
sexandmoney scandal 
prosecutors are trying to determine whether bakker and his 
associates raised money on television and through the mail for one 
purpose and spent it on another they also want to know whether any 
of the money was used for personal benefit 
the charlotte observer reported friday that ptl chief builder roe 
messner and richard dortch bakkers former top aide also received 
letters informing them too were being investigated bakker messner 
and dortch were invited to appear before the 23member grand jury 
later this month the letters said they were not compelled to 
appear but if they did their testimony could be used against them 
hovis said he advised bakker not to testify 
alexander who has repeatedly denied the existence of the grand 
jury investigation was in washington dc on friday his 
secretary said he did not return phone calls 
bakker also did not return phone calls friday 
after careful review with my lawyers i am respectfully 
declining the invitation to appear before the ptl grand jury he 
said in an earlier statement 
in august bakker denied any wrongdoing and said he doubted he 
would be indicted 
if i am ill be shocked he said if there is an 
indictment itll be because somebody framed us and set us up 
attorneys for messner and dortch did not return calls friday 
afternoon

the group holding terry anderson captive 
said friday the reagan administration is blocking the release of 
hostages by ignoring its messages 
a statement delivered to a western news agency said washington 
would not take realistic steps to end the ordeal of the 14 
foreigners held hostage in lebanon nine of whom are americans it 
said president reagan was like the ostrich that hides her head in 
the sand so that the hunter will not see her 
the typewritten statement in arabic signed by islamic jihad a 
shiite moslem group loyal to iran was in a sealed envelope with a 
blurry instant photograph of anderson the longestheld captive 
it was the 14th photograph released of anderson chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press since his abduction 
march 16 1985 he is shown with a mustache wearing glasses and a 
white tshirt 
he is behind a twotier birthday cake with candles and appears 
ready to cut into it oct 27 was andersons 41st birthday his 
fourth in captivity 
the picture apparently was made before a videotape released 
monday in which anderson said reagan and vice president george bush 
had not done enough to win his release 
anderson was cleanshaven in the videotape in which he said the 
date was sunday 
islamic jihad arabic for islamic holy war also says it holds 
thomas sutherland 56 acting dean of agriculture at the american 
university of beirut who was kidnapped june 9 1985 
it said in the statement delivered friday the only safe way to 
the freedom of the captives and their safety is the implementation 
of our just demands this is the essential cornerstone in this 
issue nothing else 
no demands were given but the group has said in the past that 
israel must free arab prisoners and withdraw from a security 
zone it maintains in south lebanon 
another demand previously made is the release of 17 people 
convicted and held in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies dec 3 1983 
fridays document said the release of hostages is not connected 
with a truce that began aug 20 in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
between iran and iraq 
it has been also said that the ceasefire in the gulf will 
speed up the release of the captives it said we repeat for a 
thousandth time that the issue of the captives altogether is not in 
any way linked to what happens in the gulf failure to free the 
hostages is a result of the american heresy procrastination and 
reneging on pledges and promises 
the statement denied reagans assertion that the kidnappers 
forced anderson to read the videotaped statement in which the 
journalist accused washington of interfering to stop his release he 
also said reagan and bush negotiated with terrorists in the 
irancontra affair and the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner to 
beirut 
reagan denied bargaining with terrorists and said i dont 
think that was terry speaking i think he had a script that was 
given to him 
state department spokesman charles redman said anytime you 
have people being held hostage tapes letters those kinds of 
things are by definition under duress he said 
bush denied involvement in irancontra or negotiations with the 
twa hijackers who held 39 americans for 17 days and killed a us 
navy diver israel released more than 700 arab prisoners after the 
hijackers freed the americans but denied a link 
on friday islamic jihad said the videotape irrespective of 
its contents has been issued directly by terry anderson without any 
pressure the tape was made after sharp exchanges between him 
and us about all the ideas he introduced which we considered very 
lacking 
the hostages are not isolated from the outside world it 
said they see and hear the news from newspapers magazines and 
television stations they are aware of everything that happened or 
will happen about their situation 
hostages released previously reported having limited access to 
news reports 
anderson will make an adequate answer to reagan and bush the 
statement said but did not say when 
islamic jihad accused the reagan administration of cheating 
lying and misleading the american people and the families of the 
hostages to head off any pressure on the american government to 
embark upon realistic steps to resolve the question of the 
hostages

policymakers at the federal reserve viewing 
evidence that us economic growth was slowing decided at their 
september meeting to leave interest rates unchanged according to 
minutes of the session released friday 
the federal open market committee which establishes monetary 
policy for the central bank voted 120 to make no further moves to 
tighten credit conditions 
but officials let it be known that the central bank still 
considered higher inflation a greater threat to the economy than a 
possible recession 
the fed whose main economic job is to guard against inflation 
began a series of credittightening steps late last march that 
culminated in august with a onehalf percentage point increase in 
its discount rate the interest it charges to make bank loans the 
discount rate now stands at 65 percent 
but since that increase many economists believe the central bank 
has been willing to sit back and see if the credittightening moves 
already initiated would be enough to dampen demand and cool any 
dangers of overheating 
the minutes of the sept 20 minute showed that fed officials were 
still taking a waitandsee approach the fed officials said they 
were encouraged by indications that economic growth was slowing from 
the robust pace in the first half of the year 
indeed the government has since reported that the overall 
economy as measured by the gross national product expanded at a 
modest 22 percent annual rate from july through september down 
from a 32 percent rate in the first half of the year 
but even with signs that the economy was slowing fed officials 
argued that it was too soon to declare a victory in the fight 
against inflation 
all of the members indicated that the balance of risks in the 
economy were such that they favored or could accept a market 
directive that would more readily accommodate a move toward firming 
than an adjustment toward easing in the weeks ahead the minutes 
said 
the fomc minutes are used to direct the open market operations of 
the federal reserve bank in new york through the purchase of 
government securities from banks the fed influences the amount of 
reserves the banks have to make bank loans and thus the price of 
those loans interest rates 
while the vote for leaving monetary policy unchanged was 
unanimous the minutes indicated there was some dispute over just 
how much further the fed should go in fighting inflation 
some members of the policymaking group were less persuaded that 
inflationary pressures would intensify especially given the degree 
of policy restraint that already had been implemented over the past 
several months the minutes said 
these officials argued that the troubled condition of many banks 
and savings and loan institutions could be adversely affected by 
further increases in interest rates 
many economists expect that the fed will begin pushing interest 
rates up again sometime after tuesdays election they said the 
report friday that unemployment dropped to 53 percent in october 
matching a 14year low would renew concerns at the central bank 
concerning tight labor markets and rising wage demands 
because the employment report was clearly strong there is 
little reason to believe that the fed will back off any time soon 
from its current policy of monetary restraint said thomas 
carpenter chief economist for asb capital management a washington 
dc investment firm 
fed officials met again this week to discuss monetary policy the 
minutes of that meeting will not be released until after the next 
fomc meeting on dec 1314

the nations largest defense contractors are 
routinely billing the pentagon for hundreds of millions of dollars 
spent on outside consultants frequently without justifying or 
explaining the work they perform a special audit has found 
the defense department is itself partly to blame because its 
procurement regulations are so vague according to the report 
released friday by the defense contract audit agency 
but the internal business discipline one would expect at a large 
company for hiring outsiders is in most cases nonexistent 
the auditors added 
in a review of 12 of the top 100 defense contractors the 
auditors labeled as questionable claims for 43 million out of 
the 2365 million charged to the government over the past year for 
consultant services 
if anything the total for questionable claims is 
understated the audit adds 
the 12 companies picked by the auditors included the boeing co 
general dynamics corp hughes aircraft co ibm inc litton 
industries inc lockheed corp martin marietta corp mcdonnell 
douglas corp northrop corp raytheon co unisys corp and the 
united technologies corp 
at five locations we encountered specific facts which caused us 
to suspect irregular activity and referred the matters to the 
appropriate investigative agencies the audit said it did not 
identify the five sites 
an ibm spokeswoman suzanne garvey said the company had been 
told by the auditors that ibm is not among five companies facing 
criminal investigation over use of consultants 
often contractors simply could not explain what work their 
consultants had performed the auditors wrote and in some cases it 
appears the consultants performed lobbying or publicity work that 
should not have been reimbursed 
the dcaa audit spawned by a massive fraud investigation at the 
pentagon paints a picture of a clubby atmosphere in which major 
contractors rarely ask that consultant contracts be put in writing 
and frequently hire consultants without soliciting competitive bids 
the dcaa also expressed concern about the number of consultants 
it encountered who were former highlevel military and 
civilian personnel at the department 
we found that contractors were spending considerable sums 
supplementing and complementing virtually every inhouse activity 
with professional and consultant services the auditors wrote 
under existing regulations the auditors continued a defense 
contractor may bill the government for its expenses on outside 
consultants as long as it can show evidence of the nature and 
scope of the service furnished 
that standard is so loose that it does not force contractors to 
truly document what they are paying for or to demonstrate how the 
work benefits the military the audit concluded 
the pentagon in releasing the audit announced it had already 
written new regulations to address the dcaas concerns a public 
comment period on the new regulations will end dec 5 at which 
point they can be made final the pentagon said 
the dcaa audit was ordered last july 25 by defense secretary 
frank c carlucci in the aftermath of disclosures that federal 
prosecutors were conducting a wideranging fraud investigation 
focusing on contractors and their outside consultants along with 
selected pentagon employees 
the 2yearold investigation centers on allegations that 
consultants paid bribes to defense department officials to gather 
inside information that was useful to companies bidding on 
multimilliondollar projects 
while no charges have been filed as yet indictments are now 
expected later this month

air marshal sir harold martin one of the daredevil 
pilots who made the famous dam buster raid on germany in world 
war ii has died at age 70 his family announced friday 
his family said the war hero whose decorations included three 
separate awards of the distinguished flying cross the highest royal 
air force honor died thursday at his home in london no cause of 
death was given 
martin and his comrades all experts at lowlevel bombing flew 
into a wall of enemy fire at a height of only 60 feet in 1943 and 
dropped bouncing bombs in a night raid intended to breach dams and 
flood the industrial ruhr valley 
their exploits were recorded in the 1954 movie named the dam 
busters for the nickname of raf squadron 617 
martin was born in australia and as a young man was ruled unfit 
to fly in that country because he suffered from asthma 
he came to britain and became a bomber pilot first with a 
squadron of australian hampden bombers operating with the raf then 
with an raf squadron flying lancasters martin quickly realized the 
value of flying low to evade enemy fighters and set about perfecting 
lowlevel skills 
in 1943 he joined squadron 617 the dam busters team assembled 
by the late wing commander guy gibson to attack the heavily defended 
mohne eder and sorpe dams 
martin helped train the team in dangerous maneuvers that included 
dodging power lines and treetops and on may 15 1943 flew one of 
the 18 lancaster bombers that made the raid 
the planes carried bombs invented by scientist barnes wallis that 
were designed to be dropped exactly 60 feet bounce across the water 
to avoid antimine nets then sink against the dam and explode 
in the attack on the mohne dam martins bomb struck accurately 
but german gunners hit his plane two shells exploded in a wing fuel 
tank but it was empty and the plane flew on 
despite repeated attacks the mohne dam appeared to have held 
but then water began pouring through a widening breach and martin 
was heard shouting hell its gone its gone 
the mohne and eder dams were breached and the sorpe dam damaged 
causing widespread destruction but not the hopedfor mortal blow to 
power and water supplies 
later in the war martin became a master of lowlevel night raids 
on airfields and of lowlevel marking dropping flares to indicate 
targets for heavyomber attacks 
martin was raf commander in west germany and chief of natos 2nd 
allied tactical air force in 197073 and retired in 1974 
his wife and two daughters survive

fairfield 
 
dukakis has led his state into what the boston herald headline 
on wednesday called an economic mess 
thats whats happening to what used to be called the 
massachusetts miracle regrettably it turns out to be a mirage 
he got into it by overspending how did he get out of it or try 
to by raising taxes a total of 180 million this year alone 
now hes borrowing like mad writing checks that he doesnt even 
have enough money in the bank to cover 
he may want to be on your side but i dont think that the 
american people want to be on his side 
 
cincinnati 
 
my pitch to democrats in ohio and independents and republicans 
is vote for the mainstream do not vote for the extreme 
vote for the mainstream and i represent your values your 
neighborhoods your families and so i am asking the american people 
in these four days before the election give me a mandate for the 
mainstream 
 
livonia 
 
this national election has got the clearest philosophical 
choice of any in modern times and the differences between me and 
the governor are deep as the great divide 
i figured it out on the plane weve got about 72 hours more of 
campaigning before the campaigning part ends and the pundits talk 
about whos going to win but let me tell you something its the 
people who decide 
youre looking at three tired people here barbara my wife and 
me and our daughter dorothy and weve been going all over this 
country but it has been a tremendous experience we have a 
wonderful country and its heart beats true and it is still a place 
of wonder and i love this country and i want to stand beside her

hotel into a blazing battleground the second such incident this 
week in what was seen friday as a dramatic sign of struggle inside 
mexicos weakened governing party

injured thursday night in a huge brawl and shootout at mexico citys 
37story hotel presidente chapultepec that left the lobby a sea of 
shattered glass and broken palm trees 
authorities said 189 people were arrested they estimated up to 
600 unionists took part in the fracas 
hotel officials and police said no guests or employees were hurt 
the workers movement is trying to enhance its political 
position using disorder and violence jose maria alverde a 
leading businessman in the capital was quoted as saying by the 
excelsior news service 
witnesses and officials said gangs from rival union factions 
charged into the hotel lobby through separate entrances at about 
930 pm thursday 
the unionists lobbed firebombs fired shots broke plate glass 
rampaged through offices and struggled with police 
guests ran for their rooms hotel employees took cover or tried 
to barricade the shattered entrances with furniture 
there was a lot of screaming we heard gunshots we looked up 
and the lobby was filled with white smoke said paul gregory a 
lighting designer from new york city 
police and red cross officials had said thursday that two people 
had died but on friday the official toll from the prosecutors 
office was revised to one dead and the number of injured was put at 
seven

after the national mexican workers federation tried to replace a 
local union leader

july 6 election the workers federation lost strength in congress 
and union leaders fear that reforms promised by presidentelect 
carlos salinas de gortari who takes office dec 1 will further sap 
their power 
jockeying for power and membership within the unions was viewed 
as one result 
it is a sign of deterioration that the confrontation is 
worsening said analyst aguilar in a telephone interview from 
washington where he is on a carnegie foundation fellowship 
fidel velasquez 88yearold head of the workers federation 
denied his group was at fault saying the union had abolished its 
programs of violence he did not say what those programs were 
we will reply blowforblow to anything they want to dish 
out said isidoro mendoza de la cruz a congressman and member of 
the revolutionary federation 
cesar garcia lara a spokesman for the national confederation of 
chambers of commerce called on salinas to curb the unions before 
they hurt mexicos vital tourism industry and tarnish the countrys

a virginia photographer jailed in spain on 
cocaine trafficking charges that us officials say stemmed from his 
set up by drug smugglers will be transferred to the us on monday 
us and spanish officials said friday 
helga soto spokeswoman for the spanish embassy said conan owen 
of nearby annandale va would be released from a barcelona prison 
and turned over to us authorities she could not provide any 
further details on the release 
a us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told 
the associated press on friday that monday is the expected date of 
transfer for owen to the united states 
we do not discuss prisoner transfers at this time said john 
russell a justice department spokesman russell said it is the 
departments policy not to discuss such matters until the transfers 
take place 
family members were not immediately available for comment 
spanish embassy officials announced oct 28 that owen 24 would 
be transferred to the united states to complete his sixyear 
sentence us officials have the authority to parole him after he 
serves onethird of his prison sentence 
the owen family has waged a campaign to convince us authorities 
that their son had been duped into acting as a drug courier 
their efforts eventually led a federal prosecutor in alexandria 
va a drug enforcement administration agent in madrid dea 
administrator john c lawn and ultimately thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii to conclude that owen was innocent of the 
trafficking charges 
an alexandria resident george barahona admitted in february 
that he and others without owens knowledge hid four pounds of 
cocaine in a false bottom of a suitcase that they then asked owen to 
take to barcelona 
in april 1987 however a court in barcelona found owen guilty of 
drug trafficking sentencing him to six years and a day in prison 
and imposing an 18000 fine in a written opinion the judges said 
they rejected barahonas confession because it was obtained as part 
of a plea bargain which is illegal in spain 
owen became eligible to return to the united states under an 
international treaty governing exchanges of sentenced prisoners

diplomats in london have been more careful about 
paying their parking tickets since the government launched a 
crackdown that led to the expulsion of a tunisian envoy in august 
the foreign office said friday that the diplomatic corps held 42 
percent fewer unpaid parking tickets in the first half of 1988 
compared to the same period last year 
but some offenders have been slow to clean up their act 
a foreign office spokesman said egypt still leads the list for a 
second year although it had fewer unpaid traffic tickets this time 
368 in the first half of 1988 compared with 426 in 1987 
he said the soviet union ranks second with an increase from 271 
to 324 tickets and poland is third with an increase from 150 to 
213 tickets 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said britain 
would be underlining our concern to the 10 worst offenders who 
accounted for 35 percent of the total unpaid tickets 
he said diplomats had 5838 unpaid tickets in the first six 
months of 1988 compared with 10096 in the same period in 1987 and 
nearly 67000 in 1984 
the drop follows a foreign office campaign against lawbreaking 
diplomats in august britain expelled a tunisian envoy who failed 
to pay hundreds of dollars in parking fines a standard parking 
ticket in london costs 21 
three diplomats cubas ambassador a cuban attache and a 
vietnamese envoy also were expelled during one week in september

the narrow hallway that leads to the today 
show studio is suddenly filled with guys in blue suits 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis is swept down 
the hall within a phalanx of advance men advisers and secret 
service agents trailing slightly behind the group is his makeup 
woman 
dukakis live appearance friday morning capped two full days of 
nbcs today show devoted to the presidential election fridays 
show was on the the massachusetts governor thursdays on the 
republican nominee vice president george bush 
when its close to time for dukakis interview with host bryant 
gumbel the candidate comes into the studio during a commercial 
break and chats with weatherman joe witte then he settles into a 
chair opposite gumbel somebody hands him a cup of coffee in a 
today show mug he and gumbel exchange small talk while witte 
does the weather helpfully describing conditions for dukakis later 
appearance at a rally in queens as if i remember my tourist 
greek kala which is good 
underdog dukakis has been blitzing the talk shows in the waning 
days of the campaign though bush has often been matching him show 
for show live interviews with the two took up the last half hour of 
the respective thursday and friday today shows 
its something we felt we had to do as a service to the 
voters said today executive producer marty ryan all the 
campaign rhetoric that has gone on we felt it was important to do 
something specific for the voters not for political junkies or 
anything else but just for voters you know what the issues are 
what these people would do so they had a clear idea of who they 
were and what they stood for and what their vote really meant 
these were shows not just for the voters but by the voters who 
asked their own questions of the candidates via videotape they 
wanted to know what bush would do about the deficit and daycare 
what dukakis would do to combat terrorism and what job would jesse 
jackson have in his administration 
television has been accused of accentuating style over substance 
in its campaign coverage but the today shows were a lesson in 
how television can stick to its style and still offer substance 
there was plenty for political junkies on the today shows 
and whos kidding its more fun to hear pundits poke fun at 
campaign ads than to listen to theories about the deficit 
for the interviews dukakis was in new york bush was in a hotel 
room in columbus ohio typically the candidates were mostly vague 
with their answers but not for gumbels lack of trying 
gumbel asked tough followups and couched most questions in the 
accessible i am a voter interested in x why should i vote for 
you 
bush said he would reduce the deficit by cutting spending if 
you wont tell me what youll cut why should i vote for you 
gumbel insisted 
gumbel asked dukakis if i sit there and dont think you have 
managed your campaign competently why should i vote for you 
dukakis said that being a good president is more than coming up with 
good campaign ads but it goes beyond ads gumbel insisted 
dukakis was left speechless for a beat 
but within the comfy confines of the toprated morning show with 
an audience mostly in houseshoes and breakfast nooks the toughest 
question for dukakis came from a woman in atlanta my first 
question would be is he going to stop kitty from smoking 
dukakis grinned sheepishly and shook his head no campaign 
promises here 
ive been trying for a long time he said somebody asked 
me the other day whether or not i was going to have a smokefree 
white house and i said not and maintain the kind of domestic 
tranquility ive had with my wife for 25 years

in a major victory for the reagan 
administration a federal judge ruled friday that a conservation 
organization was not entitled to challenge the removal of use 
restrictions on federal land in the west 
us district judge john pratt decided that the national wildlife 
federation had not shown enough injury to members to give it 
standing to sue 
the bureau of land management an arm of the interior department 
in 1981 began revoking restrictions called classifications or 
withdrawals that govern almost all the 174 million acres it 
administers in the 17 westernmost states of the lower 48 
classifications and withdrawals generally amount to the same 
thing they can ban a single activity on a federal parcel such as 
mining may keep the the parcel in question from being sold or 
exchanged or may impose several restrictions at once 
the federation filed suit in 1985 alleging among other things 
that the department was violating federal law by proceeding without 
recommendations to congress and the president without preparation 
of plans to guide its actions and without public involvement 
its members recreational use of the land would be irreparably 
injured if the government were allowed to proceed the federation 
said 
pratt subsequently granted an injunction that froze all 
restrictions pending further consideration of the case on friday 
he dissolved that injunction and dismissed the case 
we are ecstatic said bob johnson a spokesman for the 
bureau he said officials would immediately began a review of 
decisions held up by the injunction 
norman dean the federations staff lawyer handling the case 
said he had not seen the decision and could not comment on details 
he added this is not the end of it its back to the court of 
appeals for us 
the lifting of the injunction means the government is free to 
sell or trade whatever parcels have no restrictions on them and 
miners may stake claims on millions of acres dean said 
in december 1987 the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia upheld the injunction against an attempt to 
dissolve it by the mountain states legal foundation a 
conservatively oriented advocacy group based in denver and the 
department 
in so doing the appeals court ruled that the federation on 
behalf of its members was entitled to seek the injunction the 
federation need not be as specific in its allegations at such a 
preliminary stage as an injunction as it might have to be when a 
judge reached the underlying merits of the case the appeals judges 
said 
to prevail on the merits the federation must allege facts 
showing that one or more of its members is among the persons injured 
by the challenged agency action 
according to pratts ruling the federation faied to make such a 
showing 
affidavits aimed at establishing standing of the federation to 
sue submitted by members peggy peterson and roger erman whose 
hometowns were not given were vague conclusory and lacked 
factual specificity pratt wrote 
they do not and cannot show injury in fact with respect to the 
two specific areas in wyoming and arizona in the vicinity of which 
these affiants claim to be located 
more important standing alone these two affidavits do not 
provide any basis for standing to challenge as violative of the 
law the legality of each of the 1250 or so classification 
terminations and withdrawal revocations 
the peterson affidavit covered land in the green river area of 
wyoming and the erman affidavit concerned land near grand canyon 
for example there is no showing that petersons recreational 
use and enjoyment extends to the particular 4500 acres covered by 
the decision to terminate classification and to the remainder of the 
2 million acres affected by the determination all she alleges is 
she uses lands in the vicinity the affidavit on its face contains 
only a bare allegation of injury

nationalist groups in estonia and latvia on friday 
denounced president mikhail s gorbachevs plan for reforming the 
soviet government human rights activist andrei sakharov called for 
guarantees of human rights 
in estonia the ruling presidium called a special session of the 
legislature for next week to consider complaints that the reform 
would weaken the selfadministration of the 14 nonrussian 
republics according to an editor at the newspaper sovietskaya 
estonia 
the estonia peoples front declared that the reform which would 
create a new national parliament and a powerful presidency leaves 
the republics with fewer rights than a province of czarist 
russia sovietskaya estonia said 
the estonia peoples front is a political organization created 
last spring in an effort to oppose domination of the baltic republic 
by the kremlin it claims to have 60000 members 
complaints in latvia also centered on the loss of local control 
said janis dinevich a leader of the latvia peoples front in a 
telephone interview from riga 
the constitutional reform is a key part of gorbachevs attempt to 
drive out members of the old guard and replace them with supporters 
of perestroika his plan for economic restructuring and glasnost 
greater openness in some areas 
but the reform is drawing strong opposition from some republics 
under the present constitution the 15 republics have their own 
constitutions governments and selfadministration not expressly 
reserved to the central government 
sakharov who won the nobel peace prize in 1975 said the revised 
constitution should provide clear guarantees of human rights 
society needs dissidents sakharov said in an article in 
fridays edition of new times magazine he also suggested greater 
public involvement in overseeing the government 
for example without the sympathy of the people we could not 
have made decisions like sending troops into afghanistan sakharov 
wrote 
he had condemned the soviet decision to send troops into 
afghanistan in 1979 and that criticism was one reason he was forced 
to live in internal exile in the closed city of gorki for several 
years 
sovietskaya estonia said in editions earlier this week that the 
estonia peoples front sent a telegram to gorbachev saying the 
reform drafts are a step backward in the development of electoral 
democracy 
their adoption undoubtedly will lead to unforeseen consequences 
for the strengthening of the unity of the ussr and the 
democratic development of perestroika in our country the telegram 
said according to the report 
the newspaper said the front called for removing the reform 
propoosal from the agenda of the nov 29 session of the national 
supreme soviet or parliament which was called to pass the 
amendments 
the duty editor at the paper said the estonian presidium on 
friday called for a special session of the republics legislature 
for nov 16 to consider the reform plan 
the editor said estonian prime minister bruno saul offered his 
resignation friday it was not known if any action was taken some 
estonians have accused saul of being promoscow 
an estonian journalist speaking on the condition he not be 
identified said estonians and latvians fear the reform would shift 
control over the republics economies and many other critical areas 
to the central government 
he also said under the reform the number of seats the russian 
republic would have in the national parliament would increase from 
32 percent to 43 percent 
the representative of the latvia peoples front said the reform 
issues are too complex for only a months consideration and the 
front wants discussions of the plan in the republics legislatures 
and then a national constitutional convention

the editor of the atlanta journal and the atlanta 
constitution resigned friday citing a lack of shared values and 
mutual trust with the newspapers senior management 
bill kovach who left the top post at the washington bureau of 
the new york times to take over the papers in december 1986 was 
welcomed enthusiastically then as he set a goal of making the 
journal and constitution essentially one newspaper with different 
editorial pages into worldclass journalism 
the news of his resignation came suddenly in a brief story at 
the bottom of page one in late editions of the afternoon journal 
publisher jay smith said an irreconcilable difference in 
management styles surfaced in a discussion friday morning 
according to the story smith said that while he and kovach were 
in accord philosophically over the direction the newspapers have 
taken the management difference caused him to accept the editors 
resignation 
kovach in a statement said his resignation brought to an end 
two years of effort to develop a set of shared values and mutual 
trust with the senior managers of the company it became clear 
this week that no such relationship existed 
exactly what precipitated friday mornings developments was not 
clear neither the journals story nor kovachs statement went into 
detail about the discussion and representatives of smith and kovach 
said the men would not discuss the matter with reporters 
likewise there was no word on kovachs plans or replacement 
the resignation was announced to the journalconstitution 
newsroom by assistant managing editor wendell sonny rawls who 
followed kovach from the times the news stunned the staff 
a petition signed by 119 staffers in the five hours it was 
posted in the newsroom urged smith and other senior newspaper 
executives to reconsider their acceptance of kovachs resignation 
and persuade him to stay 
many of us have worked here under previous management led by 
former editor james g minter and perhaps we have an even greater 
appreciation for his kovachs ability his sound news judgment and 
his enthusiasm the petition said 
minter who became a senior editor when kovach was hired retired 
earlier this year 
in addition to the petition a group of atlanta newspaper 
employees purchased a fullpage advertisement in saturdays combined 
editions to protest kovachs resignation 
his appointment had been seen in journalism as a sign that cox 
enterprises inc wanted more from its flagship newspaper which some 
felt had been coasting for almost two decades on the reputation of 
ralph mcgill the editor of the morning constitution whose civil 
rights crusades won a pulitzer prize in 1959 
kovach stressed hard news and aggressiveness among the successes 
under his leadership was a series outlining how some atlanta banks 
were refusing loans to residents of predominantly black 
neighborhoods 
the journalconstitution had five pulitzer finalists in kovachs 
first year more than any other newspaper in the country

four local television stations have refused 
to broadcast a political commercial that shows a boy being placed in 
the foster care of two homosexual men 
the commercial was produced by supporters of ballot measure 8 
which would repeal gov neil goldschmidts 1987 executive order 
prohibiting discrimination by state executive agencies on the basis 
of sexual orientation 
the spot is extremely inflammatory and distasteful said 
steve currie manager of broadcast operations at koin 
the commercial also was rejected by katu kgw and kptv 
a chief sponsor of the initiative mike wiley called the 
rejection of the advertisement outandout censorship 
measure 8 needs a simple majority to pass a statewide poll 
released friday of 400 registered voters commissioned by the 
oregonian in portland and koin showed 50 percent were against the 
ballot initiative and 44 percent in favor the poll conducted by 
griggsanderson research of portland from oct 28 to nov 1 has a 
49 percent margin of error 
the 30second commercial shows a young boy with a social worker 
who says well ryan shall we meet your new parents 
the camera briefly shows two men sitting on a bench together and 
the spot ends with the boy asking but where is my mommy 
the governors order removes any discretion state agencies have 
in refusing to place foster children with homosexuals a voice in 
the ad says 
goldschmidt has said his order has been distorted from its 
original intent and that it doesnt give special treatment to anyone 
station officials saying they did not believe the executive order 
had a direct bearing on the states fosterparent program nothing 
in the language of the order deals with foster care 
the spot implies that if measure 8 were to pass gays would no 
longer be able to be foster parents in the state and thats not the 
case said elizabeth fetsch operations manager for kgw 
station executives said they were generally required to 
broadcast without editing political spots from qualified 
candidates but they said they had a greater obligation to review 
ballot measure advertising for inaccuracies 
skip hinman general manager of katu said attorneys for his 
station began looking into the accuracy of the advertisement because 
we just looked at it as a very inflammatory piece 
wiley said the commercial was running on some stations in 
southern oregon 
officials at portlands other tv station kpdx said they had not 
been asked to run the ad

a state law limiting people to 10 minutes 
in the voting booth was struck down friday by a federal judge who 
citied a long and complex ballot 
a fundamental constitutional right is being denied to a large 
part of the california voting population and the 10minute limit 
is unreasonable given the size and the complexity of todays 
ballot said us district court judge robert p aguilar 
civil rights activists won the temporary restraining order after 
three counties announced that due to usually lengthy ballots they 
would attempt to enforce some measure of the 67yearold law for the 
first time in memory 
the mexican american legal defense fund the northern california 
chapter of the american civil liberties union and the legal aid 
society of santa clara argued that the time limit violated the 
federal voting rights act 
they said it effectively discourages people with languages from 
voting 
aguilar agreed saying the time limit served as a virtual 
literacy proficiency test which is specifically outlawed by the act

britain on friday criticized 
czechoslovakia for using police to break up a banned rally in prague 
a week ago and for its treatment of two activists 
peter summerscale deputy head of the british delegation told 
the 35nation conference on european security and cooperation that 
the police action contradicted the purposes which guide the work 
of this conference 
hundreds of helmeted riot police used tear gas water cannon 
batons and dogs to scatter a peaceful crowd of 5000 on the 70th 
anniversary of czechoslovak independence on oct 28 
the fact is that the police brutally dispersed peaceful 
citizens summerscale said in his address why i must ask was 
force deemed necessary why also were 87 people arrested 
he also singled out the cases of ivan polansky a czechoslovak 
activist who published underground literature and augustin 
navratil who organized a petition that collected 500000 signatures 
for religious freedom this year 
a district court in slovakia sentenced polansky in june to four 
years in jail for subversive activity against the czechoslovak 
republic the supreme court in bratislava upheld the sentence in 
august 
what books could have been so horrifying so dangerous as to 
merit the attentions of the czechoslovak authorities in this way 
summerscale asked in his speech 
navratil a roman catholic activist was removed from his home in 
central czechoslovakia on oct 28 by two policemen and two doctors 
and taken to a nearby psychiatric clinic where he previously had 
been ordered to report 
navratil was confined no matter that his wife a psychiatric 
nurse until her retirement believes him to pe perfectly sane and 
that a swiss psychiatrist did not find him mentaly ill 
summerscale said 
the conference nations reviewing compliance with the 1975 
helsinki act are the united states the soviet union canada and all 
european nations except albania 
the conference opened in november 1986 to discuss security 
economic and cultural cooperation and human rights in europe 
broad agreement has been reached on a mandate for new eastwest 
talks on reducing conventional arms but disagreement persists over 
human rights particularly over political prisoners in the soviet 
union and a kremlin proposal to hold a conference on human rights in 
moscow in 1991

a soviet official said friday his 
government very much wants to meet the feb 15 target for withdrawal 
of all soviet troops from afghanistan 
the official who spoke on condition he not be identified was 
asked about the soviet announcement earlier friday that the 
withdrawal had been suspended 
alexander bessmertnykh first deputy foreign minister told 
reporters in moscow the reason for the suspension was that 
anticommunist rebels continued to attack civilians government 
troops and withdrawing soviet forces he also accused america and 
pakistan of keeping up a constant flow of weapons to the rebels 
burhanuddin rabbani a rebel leader who was in new york for the 
annual un meeting on afghanistan said 
we believe that the new threat by the russians that they will 
postpone the withdrawal of their troops is only an excuse the 
russians knew from the beginning that with the withdrawal of their 
troops the puppet regime of afghan president najib would fall 
down so it is not something new 
rabbani is chairman of the sevenparty islamic unity of afghan 
mujahedeen alliance he was interviewed in a new york city hotel 
room 
the mujahedeen holy warriors have announced that if the 
russians do not bombard the villages on their withdrawal the 
mujahedeen will not create any obstacle for their troops he said 
as a matter of fact the mujahedeen gave permission to the 
russians to leave certain areas in security 
he was asked about the soviets moving mig27 groundattack jets 
and ss1 scud missiles into afganiistan he said such actions are 
all indications that the russians are continuing their dangerous war 
policy in afghanistan which is not only a threat to afghanistan but 
to the region as a whole and they want to find an excuse for their 
war policy 
the soviet official in new york commenting on the new soviet 
arms shipments said the kremlin was sending more powerful weapons 
to afghanistan because soviet troops and civilians were being 
attacked by afghan rebels some using usmade stinger rockets 
now unfortunately our troops are attacked and also the 
peaceful population of afghan cities is also attacked and so we have 
to do something specific in this military field he said 
the stinger attacks against our troops required some reaction 
from our side 
he said the soviet union was taking strong measures in hopes of 
improving the situation so all of its troops would be out of 
afghanistan by feb 15 that is the date stipulated in the 
unsponsored acords signed in april in geneva by afghanistan 
pakistan the soviet union and united states the afghan rebels were 
not included in the negotiations 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help the marxist government battle the guerrillas 
moscow had an estimated 115000 military personnel in afganistan 
and began the withdrawal may 15 the soviets reported half of the 
force had been removed by aug 15 
the official did not define what the soviets meant by the word 
suspended 
he said the first phase of withdrawal was completed by aug 15 
and the second phase has not started but that does not mean we 
are not aiming for the date of feb 15

archbishop desmond tutu said friday that 
black south africans would be disappointed by a republican victory 
in next weeks presidential election 
we would rather see a democrat in the white house than a 
republican tutu said we have suffered a great deal from the 
reagan administrations policy of constructive engagement 
tutu leader of the anglican church in southern africa and winner 
of the 1984 nobel peace prize made the comments in nairobi while 
attending the annual conference of the allafrica council of 
churches 
he is council president and chairman 
tutu did not mention either democrat michael dukakis or 
republican george bush by name he also did not single out policies 
advocated by either candidate that would be harmful or helpful to 
blacks in south africa 
the reagan administration preferred a policy on south africa that 
became known as constructive engagement dialogue with the 
whiteled pretoria government rather than the diplomatic and 
economic confrontational tactics pursued by former democratic 
president jimmy carter 
tutu said president reagans policy had failed 
we are now virtually being ruled by martial law he said 
the archbishop said south african authorities had declared a 
state of emergency three times during reagans tenure at the white 
house during that period he said more than 2000 people were 
killed many by security forces 
tutu is a key activist against apartheid the policy of racial 
segregation under which south africas 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

zookeepers hoping for little gorillas 
have brought big gorillas colossus and muke together but so far it 
seems that the primate couple is still in the dating phase 
colossus at 6foot2 and some 570 pounds is said to be the 
largest gorilla in captivity but hes inexperienced in the gorilla 
mating game he hadnt seen another gorilla since infancy until he 
was introduced to muke 
muke pronounced mookey is one of the largest female gorillas 
in captivity at 4foot8 and she knows how to throw her 274 pounds 
around she has a reputation for being ornery said pat quinn 
director of the zoo 
hes exerting his male dominance but she takes care of 
herself quinn said thursday he gets a scratch or a snitch from 
muke everytime he gets hold of her shes not too intimidated by 
him 
both gorillas are about 22 and began sharing the large gorilla 
yard at the zoo last month muke is on breeding loan from the st 
louis zoo 
if the two dont mate colossus keepers wont take it to heart 
the main purpose of mukes visit is to socialize colossus to gorilla 
ways said quinn if they appear unlikely to mate a known breeding 
female will be obtained he said 
it may just be a matter of time 
its a good sign said quinn that colossus herds muke into her 
separate sleeping quarters and he pointed out both animals have 
become slimmer and trimmer since meeting 
they say when youre in love you lose weight he said

but friday at a rally after the chicago parade his voice came back 
he was also responding to a cbs poll that showed george bushs lead 
narrowing to seven points 
in 1960 john kennedy and lyndon johnson went into that last 
weekend down eight points in the polls he told an audience that 
went to its feet more than a dozen time were doing better than 
that you can feel that surge and you can feel that excitement 
dukakis aides say that state polls show the race is tightening in 
the key battlegrounds of the midwest and that dukakis also has drawn 
within striking distance in new jersey a state he had all but 
written off until this week 
dukakis campaign vice chairman john sasso said dukakis likely 
would add a second campaign stop in texas on saturday and was 
considering returning to ohio 
his new york rally in the citys forest hills section was a bid 
to block recent bush inroads among white middleclass voters in 
traditional democratic areas 
dukakis who has dedicated the closing month of the campaign to a 
populist appeal with the rallying cry im on your side 
ridiculed bush for borrowing the line in a speech thursday 
yesterday if you can believe it mr bush took a furlough from 
the truth by saying that he was on the side of working american 
families can you believe that an indignant dukakis told a crowd 
of several thousand people four days before the election after 
all the symbols and slogans four days before the election he tells 
you hes on your side whos he kidding 
the massachusetts governors derisive use of the word 
furlough also was a slap back at bush the word has figured 
prominently in bushs speeches and advertisements in references to a 
convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a 
massachusetts prison and attacked a maryland couple 
dukakis also criticized bushs call for a capital gains tax cut 
calling it an unfair windfall for the rich 
he wants to help people who already have it made dukakis 
said were going to help every american family make it 
dukakis resumed that criticism before a crowd of about 1500 
people who braved a steady rain and gusting winds to attend and 
airport rally in lexington ky 
we know whose side hes on dukakis told the enthusiastic 
crowd hes for a 30000 tax break for the wealthiest 1 percent 
of the people in this country 
and in new york dukakis listed as well his proposals for health 
care economic development and a higher minimum wage and assailed 
bushs record on deficit spending the environment and the drug war 
they want the american people to forget that they stole from 
our children in piling up the biggest debt in history dukakis 
said of the republicans they stole from our future by trashing 
our environment 
he also said it was time for a democratic administration to 
take back our government from the influence peddlers and sleaze 
merchants 
dukakis invoked the legacy of harry truman and kennedy in 
predicting a close win tuesday 
twentyeight years ago another son of massachusetts challenged 
us to win the race to the moon and we did dukakis said as 
president i want to challenge the people of american to one 
fundamental goal drugfree schools in the 1990s 
he repeated his promise to halt foreign aid to countries refusing 
to cooperate in international efforts to curb drug trafficking 
again using the strong rhetoric he began on wednesday 
ill be damned if im going to let them send that stuff into 
our country and poison our kids and destroy our neighborhoods 
dukakis said 
in an interview friday with abctv dukakis again brought up 
drugs when answering a question on why he thought bush was running a 
negative campaign 
the real question is why has he done this and i think its 
to divert attention from a failed record on the war against drugs 
from the kind of sleaze and corruption that weve seen in 
washington he said i think thats whats going on

next four years and increase unemployment benefits for those likely 
to lose their jobs as a result a spokesman said 
the plan was approved at a meeting of the council of ministers 
under the chairmanship of vice premier peter medgyessy but only 
after sharp debate the official news agency mti quoted a 
spokesman as saying without elaboration 
zsolt bajnok editorinchief of the government daily magyar 
hirlap acting as spokesman told hungarian journalists that the 
ministers decided to cut subsidies from the present 26 billion a 
year to 800 million over the next four years 
bajnok said that in 1989 subsidies to the mining industry 
agriculture consumer goods and other economic sectors would be cut 
by 580 million 
beginning jan 1 an employment fund is to be doubled to 48 
million in an attempt to buffer those who will lose their jobs if

universities and research centers turned computers back on friday 
after purging a virus from infected machines across the country 
and the new york times reported that the rogue program was written 
by a 23yearold graduate student 
the fbi said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determine 
whether federal law had been violated 
the times reported that the virus program was created by a 
cornell university graduate student whose father is one of the 
governments most respected computer security experts 
the times saturday editions quoted two sources with detailed 
knowledge of the case as saying that robert t morris jr 23 wrote 
the program as an experiment that went haywire and jammed more than 
6000 computers nationwide 
the elder morris is chief scientist at the national computer 
security center in bethesda md the arm of the national security 
agency devoted to protecting computers against outside attack 
morris 56 told the times that the virus has raised the public 
awareness to a considerable degree he said it is likely to 
make people more careful and more attentive to vulnerabilities in 
the future 
the younger morris could not be reached for comment friday the 
times said 
at government and university computer centers across the nation 
the big systems were up and running friday after their operators 
finished purging the virus instructions from their machines 
everything seems calm this morning said bob logan systems 
manager at the california institute of technology in pasadena 
its just a lot of aggravation right now we want to look and 
make sure that besides doing what it the virus did it didnt leave 
some little time bomb thats going to go off 
the virus a sort of rogue program that reproduced in computers 
and apparently instructed them to send copies of itself to other 
machines through a research network arpanet slowed computers and 
used up memory space but most operators said the biggest problem 
was the time wasted while eliminating it 
about 1000 hours of staff time was spent cleaning up some 200 
computers at the university of colorado said public relations 
director pauline coker 
there was no real damage the program is not the big deal the 
big deal is that it happened said hans werner braun chief 
programmer for the university of michigan 
the times reported friday that an anonymous caller to the 
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a 
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it 
got out of hand 
once caltechs computers were disconnected from arpanets 
electronic mail system and turned back on thursday night we could 
watch the virus trying to spread from infected machines on the 
network logan said 
arpanet established by the defense departments advanced 
research projects agency is used by researchers and defense 
contractors to share data at high speed 
the virus also spread into some government computers from nasas 
langley research center at hampton va to the los alamos national 
laboratory in new mexico computers used for classified work are 
separate from those affected by the virus 
computers at the lawrence livermore national laboratory one of 
the nations nuclear weapons design centers were shut down late 
wednesday but turned back on and reconnected to arpanet friday 
morning said spokeswoman bonnie jean barringer no data was lost 
but research was disrupted for the day she said 
dr raymond s colladay the director of the advanced research 
projects agency told a pentagon briefing the virus had been 
defeated in roughly 24 hours time 
colladay said the computer experts and researchers who use the 
system had concluded the virus program while fairly sophisticated 
did not contain any trojan horse bug that could crop up again at 
a later time 
he also said he thought computer experts ultimately could 
pinpoint the general geographic location from which the bug was 
delivered but would probably be unable to pinpoint a specific 
individual user as the perpetrator 
in washington fbi spokesman william carter announced the 
preliminary inquiry and said a criminal investigation ultimately 
would be launched if it is determined federal law was violated 
the bureau will review the computer fraud and abuse act which 
deals with unauthorized access to government computers or computers 
in two or more states 
if records within the computer systems that were infected are 
found to have been destroyed or harmed the fbi could conduct a 
fullscale investigation carter said 
purdue university computers also were restarted friday but 
slowly we hope there are no trojan horses hidden said steve 
hare research facilities manager of purdues computer science 
department 
boston university computers were back on friday but had not been 
linked back up with the network said mary riendeau coordinator of 
user services for the computer science department 
many institutions didnt discover the virus until thursday but 
los alamos scientists detected it wednesday evening and isolated 
their computers from the network 
it was noticeable but not catastrophic said los alamos 
computer security officer jimmy mcclary he said there was no damage 
but a few hundred scientists suffered delays in their work 
we were warned yesterday morning to board up the windows and 
protect ourselves said leslie maltz director of computing and 
communication resources at stevens institute of technology in 
hoboken nj he would not say who gave the warning 
well keep systems removed til all clear is sounded several 
days at most i would think maltz said 
carnegie mellon university computers in pittsburgh were 
inoculated five years ago with programs that recognized the virus 
and tried to send the messages back to their return address when 
that proved to be an improper format the system channeled the virus 
messages to a file to be examined by humans said bob cosgrove 
director of computing services at cmu 
but at the university of illinois the virus was still causing 
trouble friday 
we went home last night thinking it wouldnt come back because 
we had closed the hole it was coming in through but it apparently 
has multiple ways of attacking the system and we got hit again 
said charley kline senior research programmer at the university 
it appeared that most infected machines were either digital 
equipment corp vax or sun microsystems computers and all used bsd 
unix operating system the master program that lets a computer run 
other programs said logan at caltech 
it was one of the most complex viruses weve seen said john 
mcafee director of the computer virus industry association in santa 
clara a group of 11 computer companies that market antiviral 
programs 
its been a royal nuisance but of the spectrum of things 
that could have happened it was the least destructive thing that 
could have been done said bill johnston a computer scientist at 
the lawrence berkeley laboratory part of the university of 
californiaberkeley 
mcafee said the virus took advantage of a littleknown flaw in 
the sendmail feature of the unix operating system as modified by 
ucberkeley the perpetrator was an extremely sophisticated 
individual he said

thousands of moths are dying daily 
inside australias new parliament house after being attracted by its 
powerful lights causing a terrible stench and distracting lawmakers 
from their work 
the moths are blocking windows and doorways littering corridors

legislators complained that the tiny flying creatures make it 
hard for them to concentrate 
minister for science barry jones believes the insects are drawn 
to a brightly lit flagpole on capitol hill and that the buildings 
stonelined walls and recessed windows provide a perfect environment 
for the moths who are killed when they fly into the lights 
the moths are en route to their summer breeding grounds but

researchers today tried to trace a virus that infected 
computer systems nationwide slowing machines in universities a 
nasa and nuclear weapons lab and other federal research centers 
linked by a defense department computer network 
by thursday night the virus had infected hundreds of computers 
on what one expert said was the largest scale ever but authorities 
said it apparently destroyed no data even though it temporarily 
halted some research 
viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as a 
prank or vandalism they can attach themselves to other programs and 
spread through shared software or electronic mail systems that 
link computers 
mild viruses may flash a message on a users screen while 
deadly forms can destroy data or cripple a computer this virus 
apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself thereby 
slowing computers processing speed and taking up their memory space

the smokestack of detroits planned trashburning 
incinerator is but another protrusion among the steeples and water 
towers rising in an area just north of downtown 
but in neighboring windsor ontario the smokestack ranks high on 
a growing list of irritants straining relations between the border 
cities 
fear that the 438 million incinerators smokestack will send 
clouds of acid rain over canada troubles windsor but its far from 
the only problem for the city across the detroit river from the 
sixthlargest us city 
in the last several months the cities ability to get along also 
has been challenged by the behavior of americans in windsor concern 
about a spill over of drugs and crime from detroit and the expansion 
of detroit city airport 
even so windsors 200000 residents acknowledge the benefits of 
being detroits foreign neighbor 
the two cities celebrate their friendship every year with the 
freedom festival which coincides with canadas dominion day july 
1 and the fourth of july 
it was shortly after last years festival that the incinerator 
issue ignited 
numerous protests including one at the construction site in 
which 19 demonstrators were arrested have kept the attention high 
the province of ontario has sued detroit to force the city to add 
10 million to 20 million worth of pollution controls including 
lime scrubbers which remove acidic gases produced when plastic bags 
and table salt burn 
the legal challenge was dismissed in us district court in 
february but the canadians appealed to the 6th us circuit court 
of appeals in cincinnati and jim bradley the provinces 
environment minister said ontario will appeal to the us supreme 
court if necessary 
detroit mayor coleman young has predicted defeat of the action 
which he calls illconceived he said the demands would require 
spending money on pollution equipment that is yet to be proved 
effective 
obviously when and if its proven well be willing to take a 
hard look at it because whatever falls in windsor falls first in 
detroit young said 
said windsor mayor david a burr we recognize that when he 
young makes up his mind on something its very difficult to get 
something changed 
burr cited the expansion of detroit city airport as another 
example of youngs stubbornness 
the windsor mayor concerned about increased air traffic and the 
potential for a collision over windsor said he asked for a joint 
meeting of the two cities governing boards to discuss the airport 
issue and other concerns but never received an answer young notes 
that planes heading for windsor fly over detroit too 
detroit does not seem to be exporting its violent crime across 
the border the three homicides in canadas city of roses last year 
translate to about 15 per 100000 people that compares with 645 in 
detroit or about 54 for every 100000 people 
i dont really think at this point we can see an increase in 
crime said staff sgt john abbey of the windsor police department 
earlier this year when windsor police began setting up roadside 
stations friday and saturday nights where randomly selected drivers 
are tested for alcohol consumption the crackdown raised complaints 
but not from the us side 
canadian bar owners said it would scare off young american 
patrons who cross the border because they can legally drink at 19 
two years younger than in michigan 
a us customs service program to tighten control over the 
crossborder transport of illegal drugs has resulted in scores of 
arrests and seizures of vehicles most of those arrested have been 
americans returning from canada 
in general the crossborder passage is cooperative and now 
theres a proposal for a pedestrian ferry 
alexander pollock an architect for detroits community and 
economic development department said the ferry would make access to 
windsor hotels easier for people attending conventions in detroit 
its a welcome idea in windsor where two large hotels are being 
built 
canada bought 192 billion in merchandise in 1986 from michigan 
and four other great lakes states said paul bondy director of the 
windsor and essex county development commission 
in turn michigan indiana illinois ohio and wisconsin bought 
16 billion worth of goods from canada bondy said 
windsor being a lot closer to downtown detroit than the suburbs 
makes us a direct beneficiary of overflow from conventions said 
sergio grando general manager of windsors visitors bureau adding 
that windsors shops and restaurants especially the outdoor cafes 
along ouellette avenue draw americans with their european style 
the detroit mayors response our prosperity reflects itself in 
windsor and so cooperation would be to me what we ought to be 
about

theres a place i can go the songs come out of that she said 
her first single is called marc anthonys song 
marc anthony lives in that world paris lives there i imagine 
that its true that they are there 
nelsons romantic streak dates back to her childhood in northern 
minneapolis when she would watch shirley temple and barbra 
streisand movies music runs in the family her father john nelson 
was a pianist and composer while mattie nelson her mother was a 
singer 
then of course there was her older brother prince 
mom was singing and daddy playing she recalled my mother 
would play her music i got to listen to lots of different things 
dionne warwick and nancy wilson daddy would listen to top 40 songs 
on the radio he would have to learn those songs 
nelson recalled seeing her brothers first feature movie 
purple rain 
i cried through the whole movie she said it was him on 
film like elvis presley it was one of the first times it hit home 
that he was really doing something i just saw his face and tears 
started running down my face 
nelson has settled down a bit since purple rain when sign 
o the times princes latest film was released she didnt even 
see it 
i dont want to be influenced he sent me the tape and i 
decided i was going to wait she said 
nelson also declined to make use of paisley park princes 
10 million recording studio outside of minneapolis in fact she 
wouldnt even let prince help at all 
prince didnt hear the album until it was finished they look 
and have an idea then you start doubting yourself 
given her obvious connections some resentment might have been 
expected among the studio personnel but nelson said she had no 
problems 
everybodys been very receptive she said i did it away 
from him and that was intentional ive got a lot of pride i wanted 
to know i could do it on my own 
her greatest obstacle was singing with other people in the 
studio as soon as people walk in my heart flutters a little bit 
i turn out all the lights so thats fine i have to remind myself 
they cant see me the hardest thing is a bunch of eyes peering at 
you 
five of the nine tracks on royal blue were produced in 
minneapolis by david rivkin aka david z who has worked with 
jody watley and sheila e 
the remaining songs recorded in los angeles were produced by 
preston glass who has worked with aretha franklin and earth wind amp 
fire and larry graham the bassist for sly and the family stone 
the songs on royal blue cowritten by nelson and jimmy 
matherly are a mixture of pop soul and princely funk nelson calls 
it a different kind of blues 
i wanted it to be soothing she said i wanted someone to 
be able to put it on and write a letter and talk on the phone and it 
wouldnt interfere 
nelson wrote her first song when she was 9 years old and found it 
natural to enter the music business 
i thought everywhere around the world kids when they got into 
their teens got into bands 
but she doesnt feel like a celebrity i havent accepted a lot 
of things she said its hard to accept that i can go into a 
store and get my album 
and theres still the matter of performing live nelson will have 
many eyes on her when she begins her tour this fall her experience 
on stage is limited 
i sang at the hollywood palace the day after the purple rain 
premiere she said its fine while youre singing but 
afterwards everyones touching you saying oh youve got such a 
beautiful voice 
thats the only time ive sung in my adult life in front of 
people 
but in her own private way nelson is a show business veteran 
ive been doing this for years in my room with my bed as my 
audience she said i talk to the people i dance i dont stand 
still i look at them but i look through them 
i cant wait to tour

after the redgraves the 
carradines and the douglases what acting clan could be next 
try the ironses as the british star jeremy irons joins his son 
and his fatherinlaw onscreen in a new film 
its like a professional home movie he said during a break 
in filming danny the champion of the world a 3 million 
feature due for release in britain next easter and in the united 
states at a time yet to be decided either in theaters or the disney 
channel on cabletv 
the movie is based on roald dahls bestselling childrens story 
about a father and son bonded together in a morality tale which sees 
good winning out over evil gavin millar directs from john 
goldsmiths screenplay 
the movie brings together for the first time three generations of 
thespian talent tenyearold sam irons in his film debut plays 
the resourceful and protective danny who lives with his father 
william in a gypsy caravan in the country 
jeremy irons sams reallife father plays his onscreen one 
the veteran irish actor cyril cusack sams grandfather and irons 
fatherinlaw plays the eccentric village doctor spencer who 
tends williams foot after it is injured in a trap for pheasant 
poachers 
on the set the young irons scampers about in baggy gray shorts 
demonstrating a pocket calculator to his standin simon spaull and 
asking excitedly whether its lunchtime yet 
the boy seemed outgoing and voluble but his 40yearold father 
adamantly shielded sam from the press he prefers to leave all 
dynastic queries to the senior family members who are accustomed to 
such questions 
the 77yearold cusack said he disliked the term dynasty to 
describe a family almost universally smitten with the desire to 
perform 
but with four daughters all of whom are actresses he 
acknowledged such career decisions are often inevitable 
i think its not so much an inheritance from the genes but an 
environmental influence that persuades children cusack said in an 
interview at twickenham studios in the west london suburb of st 
margarets 
his daughters are seen regularly on the british stage 
nineteenyearold catherine is touring england in a theater 
adaptation of emile zolas novel geminal niamh 28 is 
appearing in londons west end opposite rex harrison in jm 
barries the admirable crichton 
sorcha 38 ended a onewoman show baglady in london on 
oct 1 sinead 39 irons wife appeared on broadway in 1985 with 
the royal shakespeare company and this summer in an acclaimed london 
production of brian friels aristocrats 
cusack spoke fondly of his grandsons entry into the profession 
which technically began in stratforduponavon in 1986 with a bit 
part alongside his father in shakespeares the winters tale 
to begin with i thought well what are we going to have here 
on the film cusack said then i noticed the way sam reacted 
to everything he seems to take acting quite in his stride without 
any stress 
jeremy irons said acting opposite his son afforded a kind of 
shorthand the emotions are unspoken unplanned in everything you 
do together that is the plus i think 
he hopes the movie will be a little jewel the kind of family 
film too rarely seen nowadays 
i know as a parent its pretty hard to find films to take kids 
to said irons who is winning raves in the current psychological 
drama dead ringers a movie distinctly not meant for children 
with its themes of gynecology sex emotionally disturbed twins and 
drug abuse 
weve been through the spielbergian fantasies and certainly my 
lot are getting bored with them said irons referring to the 
movies of steven spielberg 
danny is that rare film i think parents will enjoy as much as 
children he said 
irons said he hoped danny wouldnt push sam toward being a 
fulltime actor i dont think you ever wish upon a child a life 
that requires you to cope with so many rejections so many 
uncertainties 
he wont do any more of this until hes 17 if he even wants 
more of it then 
and might sams 3yearold brother max get bitten by the acting 
bug 
his grandfather said max is splendidly spontaneous and may 
shoot into the stellar regions overnight 
but his father was more cautious 
he hasnt told me irons said wryly but he may be 
harboring it secretly

director dan curtis had his work cut out for him 
with abcs war and remembrance a sequel to one of the 
mostwatched television events of all time the 1983 epic he also 
directed the winds of war 
based on the first 18hour installment of war and 
remembrance curtis has himself a masterpiece of a war movie 
interrupted too often by tedious subplots and silly romantic 
interludes 
the 110 million budget bought a heck of a production the 
locations sets costumes cars and special effects are spectacular 
abc rushed the first 18 hours of the 32hour monster onto the 
screen this month three months early because of scheduling gaps 
caused by the summer writers strike war and remembrance 
commences sunday nov 13 the rest will air in 1989 
both miniseries were based on herman wouks epic novels the 
winds of war followed victor pug henry and his family through 
the events leading up to world war ii war and remembrance takes 
them through the war 
wouk kept control of his work cowriting the screenplay and 
restricting the number and types of commercials abc could air wouk 
wisely felt it would be inappropriate to juxtapose powerfully 
graphic material with pitches for burgers and fries 
there have been cast changes since the winds of war is your 
scorecard handy 
robert mitchum now 70 is back as pug he was too old for the 
role five years ago and although he doesnt dodder he is so 
profoundly taciturn you wish someone would take his pulse or at 
least offer him an eyelift now commander of a cruiser in the 
pacific fleet he has broken off his almostaffair with plucky pam 
played nicely again by victoria tennant who is off on a world tour 
with her bbc commentator uncle alistair tudsbury robert morley 
polly bergen is also back as rhoda pugs ditsy wife she has 
resumed her inexplicable affair with the remarkably dull palmer 
kirby peter graves their romantic scenes qualify as high camp 
palmer take me to your apartment is that what you really 
want what do you think you fool 
steven berkoff is a kitschy fulltilt hitler blood vessels 
popping ralph bellamy does his impression of franklin roosevelt as 
cheerful nitwit 
its hard to imagine pining for the screen charisma of ali 
mcgraw but jane seymour is boring as natalie the jewish older 
woman married to pugs son byron byron is now played by the 
capable hart bochner replacing janmichael vincent natalie and her 
famousauthor uncle sir john gielgud replacing john houseman 
traipse tediously about europe trying to escape the nazis bill 
wallis is wonderfully oily as the german official who poses as their 
protector 
michael woods successfully replaces ben murphy as son warren 
leslie hope replaces lisa eilbacher as daughter madeline but 
doesnt have much to do this time around david dukes returns as 
leslie slote the state department drone who yearns to prove the 
rumors of nazi atrocities 
although the miniseries is fraught with too many comings and 
goings and sonicetomeetyous curtis has managed to keep things 
apace with spectacle in just about every episode the battle scenes 
are stunning the first episode includes some of the best submarine 
scenes since das boot barry bostwick gives a firstrate 
performance as byrons buddy and commanding officer cigarchomping 
carter lady aster 
in the third episode pug and warren fight in the battle of 
midway again the scenes are worthy of a theatrical film even in 
the rough cut given to reviewers the scenes should be even more 
spectacular in the final version 
the concentration camp scenes are the most powerful such 
depictions television has ever seen they are so graphic abc will 
run advisories before episodes 2 and 7 warning viewers adding to 
the palpable evil is the knowledge that curtis filmed at actual 
concentration camp sites 
although they are rather rotund for concentration camp internees 
topol and john rhysdavies are compelling as berel and sammy 
relegated to a dwindling work detail that is forced to dig up 
decaying bodies from a mass grave so the nazis can burn the evidence 
of the massacre 
at the end of seven episodes viewers are left in 1943 with 
natalie and her uncle in peril pug reunited with pamela in moscow 
hitlers generals considering assassinating him berel making a 
desperate escape and byron a reflective war hero 
tune in next year

youve never heard of jim bergthold 
transformed into an angry bully hes punched his wife and 
threatened everyone in sight including his bosses it was either 
leave his last job or risk jail for hurting someone he hasnt 
worked since 
you have heard almost certainly of robert tsouvas two months 
ago he died the most pitiable of deaths shot in the head under a 
pittsburgh bridge after arguing with his girlfriend over a bottle of 
vodka he was 39 and a bum 
twenty years ago bergthold and tsouvas were among thousands of 
young americans sent halfway around the world to fight a war 
bergthold was a 21yearold laborer from niagara falls tsouvas a 
19yearold dropout from san jose calif 
chance propelled them into the vietnamese village of my lai with 
charlie company on march 16 1968 there they took part in the 
frenzy that resulted in the slayings of more than 400 vietnamese 
men women and children bergthold and tsouvas were among 25 men 
originally charged in the barbaric attack although only six stood 
trial and just one lt william l calley jr was convicted 
the massacre when exposed a year later brought home to 
americans the horrors of the distant war and gave a surge to rising 
sentiment against it bergthold tsouvas and other veterans in my 
lai that day were damned and doomed forever 
official army records list only one american casualty at my lai 
a man wounded by his own rifle but many more suffered emotional 
wounds in the aftermath of a raid made in the mistaken belief that a 
viet cong battalion was lying in wait 
some like bergthold now 41 came home walking wounded drunks 
and addicts for whom the booze acid hash grass and speed couldnt 
blot out the shame and guilt shunned by the public they took 
refuge within themselves becoming suspicious and secretive 
the memory that most haunts bergthold is of the vietnamese woman 
he shot pointblank she was already wounded and lay bleeding and 
moaning 
i put her out of her misery bergthold said i can see her 
lift up off the ground after i shot her it bothers me knowing what 
i did and then have kids of my own why did the government train 
me to kill people 
bergthold has not worked since august 1985 because of post 
traumatic stress disorder the delayed shock of combat nothing 
seems to help he said i cant concentrate i have no respect 
for authority little things set me off 
he and his wife nancy and two daughters 16 and 13 live in a 
rundown rented house on 698 a month from disability and social 
security checks a 20yearold son lives on his own 
he has stopped the drugs and drinking now tranquilizers keep his 
rage in check the last time he threatened his wife was seven years 
ago when he had a flashback and fired a shotgun at her the pellets 
hit the wall 
he kept calling me his enemy she recalled he yelled to 
some of the guys in his platoon to look out when he shot at me 
six months later he tried to stab his son tim then 12 a big 
man at 257 pounds bergthold has awakened in the middle of the 
night shoving his wife out of bed he was screaming at the guys 
to hide mrs bergthold said 
life had been downhill for tsouvas since he was charged with 
killing two children at my lai the children were already wounded 
and tsouvas wanted to end their suffering according to his 
attorney from the hearings 
while awaiting courtmartial he lived in an atlanta commune and 
married he then drifted working fitfully as a cook baker painter 
and laborer he spent eight months in a birmingham ala jail for 
marijuana possession his wife and son now 13 left him seven years 
ago because of his drug and alcohol abuse 
after that tsouvas hooked up with a carnival worker named 
kathlynn who uses his last name and has been charged with his 
murder police say the couple arrived in pittsburgh late in the 
summer of 1987 with tsouvas hoping for construction work but the 
offer fell through and he and kathlynn lived under a bridge fished 
in the rivers sold their blood for spending money and worked part 
time in a food kitchen for the homeless 
some veterans saw my lai as a curse a jinx 
i got a permanent reminder said paul meadlo of terre haute 
ind i got my foot blowed off the very next morning by a mine 
it must have been gods plan 
the 41yearold meadlo who testified under immunity at calleys 
courtmartial that he helped calley shoot villagers because he 
considered them viet cong is bitter when he left the army he says 
his missing foot made him unemployable he eventually found work in 
a factory that makes plastic film but was recently laid off 
four my lai veterans all officers came home in coffins even in 
death they were dishonored accusations in an army report ranged 
from supervising the systematic killing of civilians to allowing 
their men to rape vietnamese women 
for some who survived the my lai horror crushed careers even 
though they were acquitted or never tried 
ernest medina commander of charlie company was acquitted of 
murder and having overall responsibility for the massacre yet was 
forced to resign his commission after 16 years service now 52 
medina owns a real estate company in marinette wis 
kenneth schiel 41 given an honorable discharge under the 
condition that he not reenlist or join the reserves says he 
probably would have made the army a career he is a police patrolman 
in corunna mich 
the stigma of my lai made a drinking problem worse for kenneth 
hodges a squad leader who had 10 years service before he was 
forced out unskilled and alcoholic hodges said he had to fight 
just to get a drivers job with the veterans administration in his 
hometown dublin ga alcoholism led to two divorces he has married 
a third time and says he has been sober since 1985 
charles hutto now 39 says he also overcame a drinking problem 
that developed as he struggled with the burden of my lai he repairs 
televisions in monroe la 
bergthold tsouvas meadlo medina schiel hodges and hutto 
were among the 25 soldiers first charged with my lai crimes ranging 
from premeditated murder to assault and rape six were eventually 
tried including medina and hutto 
calley the one man convicted was a platoon leader he served 
three years under house arrest for the firstdegree murder of at 
least 22 villagers including a boy he tossed into a ditch and shot 
now 45 he works in his fatherinlaws jewelry store in columbus

people who race todays thinskinned kneehigh solarpowered 
vehicles dont expect the sun to propel commuter traffic anytime 
soon 
but two of michigans corporate giants say other benefits make 
solar cars worthwhile 
dow chemcial co has been the primary sponsor for the last two 
years of a massachusetts institute of technology program that built 
the winner of the america solar cup race in september in california 
general motors corps sunraycer won the worlds first 
transcontinental solar car race held in november 1987 in australia 
dow and gm arent talking about mass solarpowered transit any 
more than the wright brothers with their fragile sanddune flyer 
envisioned cargo and passengercarrying jumbo jets 
at todays efficiency levels solar cars are fairsky vehicles 
ideal for the sunbaked australian outback or southern california 
in michigan for example the glimmer of a winter day when the 
sun is mostly a memory would scarcely move the specialized race 
vehicles let alone power the allout daily fourlane sprint to work 
or endoftheday dash home 
gm and dow are enthused nevertheless while neither company 
divulges what it spends on the special programs both said the 
benefits go beyond the advertising value of having their names on 
cars that skitter to racing wins 
mit senior james worden 21 heads the dowsupported design team 
that built solectria v a 12footlong racer that basically 
resembles a flat array of solar cells topped by a bubble canopy 
dow automotive materials group provided materials technical help 
and money for the car one of the stars of an espn television 
feature on solarcar racing 
dow spokesman rick proskow said the car represents an opportunity 
to try out its superthin chromaloy tubing carbon fiber composites 
epoxies and magnesium and aluminum components 
it weighs just 340 pounds and can travel more than 70 miles an 
hour using a power system that generates only 10 horsepower it 
finished the 1593mile california race in just over three hours 
averaging 531 miles an hour 
there is a great similarity between the car james worden drives 
and what has been done with similar materials in the general 
automotive field said spokeswoman linda water who accompanied 
the racing team 
worden is improving the car water said though james is very 
closemouthed about these things he keeps his briefcase very close 
to him 
gms teardropshaped vehicle is 20 feet long and weighs 390 
pounds it chalked up a 2day victory in a 5day world solar 
challenge race across australia in november 1987 
making it provided lessons in lightweight structures and 
materials efficient lightweight motors and aerodynamics bruce 
mccristal a gm spokesman said 
the sunraycer is the most aerodynamic land vehicle that has ever 
been tested in gms wind tunnel he said 
it has been taken on tour appearing at more than 130 different 
events and has proven a powerful lure in piquing interest among 
school children in science studies mccristal said 
a gm educational program based on the car including teachers 
manuals students workbooks and a computer game that simulates 
driving it has brought strong response from science teachers 
across the country 
there isnt really a commercial payoff proskow agreed 
were certainly not going to go out and sell thousands and 
thousands of pounds of resin for solar cars not today 
but he said dow also values the educational potential 
it gives us an opportunity to support an alternative type of 
power and to support a person in college with a good idea as a 
chemical company we are an inventive group technology is important 
to dow he said

george bush was a solid favorite to pick 
up alabamas nine electoral votes tuesday but republicans had 
little hope of making substantial gains in state and local races 
a record 274 gop nominees were running for office in alabama but 
state gop political director steve french predicted only modest 
coattails from the national ticket even in a landslide 
alabama went for president reagan in 1980 and 1984 and bush was 
the lopsided favorite over democrat michael dukakis in a series of 
polls over the past two months 
the makeup of the states congressional delegation five 
democrats and two republicans was not expected to change the 
closest race was in the 1st district between republican rep sonny

a house race called one of the nations nastiest 
came to a close tuesday with republican rep pat swindall fighting 
both to save his political career and stay out of jail 
in the presidential race republican george bush was expected to 
win georgias 12 electoral votes despite a late surge of 
campaigning on behalf of democrat michael dukakis by popular sen 
sam nunn 
swindall was expected to lose his 4th congressional district seat 
to democratic challenger ben jones a recovered alcoholic who played 
cooter in televisions dukes of hazzard series 
jones narrowly lost to swindall in 1986 this years race was 
marked by swindalls repeated references to jones arrest record 
especially an assault conviction jones who says he has not had a 
drink since 1977 said the incident dates to his drinking days and 
involved shoving his second wife in a bar 
last month swindall was indicted on federal perjury charges 
stemming from his testimony to a grand jury investigating a 
moneylaundering case he sought a trial before the election as 
polls showed jones a 21 favorite in the suburban atlanta district 
but the jury was dismissed after swindalls campaign sent out 
leaflets saying he had passed a lie detector test

a spirited fight over a statewide lottery 
dominated the attention of idaho voters who were virtually certain 
to award their four electoral votes to vice president george bush 
rep richard stallings outspending gop businessman dane watkins 
by threetoone was all but assured of becoming the first democrat 
to win three straight congressional elections in the conservative 
southern district fourterm republican rep larry craig was favored 
to hold onto the states other us house seat 
opponents of a constitutional amendment allowing a state lottery 
spent 500000 in an effort to turn the voters around from 1986 
when a lottery initiative captured 60 percent of the vote that 
measure was voided by the state supreme court on grounds as an 
attempt to circumvent the constitutional prohibition against any 
lottery 
supporters pushed the proposition on economic grounds arguing 
that idahoans were spending money on lotteries in neighboring 
washington oregon and montana that should remain in the state 
critics said a lottery would strip the poor of money they need 
for necessities and open the door to casino gambling and the moral 
ills that go with it

republican rep trent lott hoped to put 
both of mississippis senate seats in the gop column for the first 
time this century as he battled democratic rep wayne dowdy for the 
seat of the retiring john stennis 
vice president george bush appeared to have the states seven

lott stressed his links to the reagan administration and bush in 
his bid for the senate seat dowdy who like lott surrendered a safe 
congressional seat for the race tried to avoid tying his campaign 
to dukakis he spent 15 million on the election half of what 
lott spent 
thad cochrans election in 1978 made him the states first 
republican senator in more than 100 years stennis campaigned for 
dowdy by appealing to voters not to turn both seats over to the gop 
three democratic congressmen seeking reelection all were 
expected to win including mike espy the states first black 
congressman in more than 100 years voters will pick two new 
congressmen to fill the seats vacated by lott and dowdy

sen quentin burdick expected to lead a 
democratic sweep of key statewide offices tuesday even though 
republicans counted on keeping the states three presidential 
electoral votes in the gop column for george bush 
in addition to the senate seat democrats were favorites 
according to public opinion polls to hold on to the states lone 
us house seat and the governors office 
burdick maintained a 21 lead in university of north dakota polls 
over republican state legislator earl strinden despite gop 
accusations that the 80yearold incumbent isnt mentally and 
physically fit to serve a fifth full term 
rep byron dorgan and gov george sinner also had commanding 
leads in their races for reelection 
the presidential race was rated a tossup at labor day but both 
sides acknowledged that george bushs success in portraying dukakis 
as a liberal helped the republican mount a probably insurmountable 
lead

of being ineffective 
fourth district rep liz patterson a firstterm democrat faced 
a tough challenge from republican knox white a greenville attorney 
and city councilman white accused ms patterson of being too 
liberal for the district while the incumbent called herself an

sticker mentality republicans were intent on reclaiming the seat 
held by campbell until his successful 1986 run for governor

phil reibel went to vietnam a gentle man 
in a time of war he returned a violent man in a time of peace 
so began his odyssey from platoon to prison 
today the marine veteran passes his days behind gates his 
nights behind bars doing time for brutally assaulting his son hes 
not sure vietnam put him there but he has no doubts the war turned 
him inside out 
before i went to vietnam i never had any violent streaks 
said the bearded 41yearold reibel when i came back i had 
nothing but violent streaks the day i came home and the day 
before i left i was a completely different person 
reibel is among thousands of vietnam veterans in prisons 
nationwide who wonder whether their time as warriors in jungles half 
a world away helped turn them into criminals on the streets at home 
five years ago and long after he came home reibel beat his 
teenage son and pushed him over a stool the boys head hit the tv 
temporarily paralyzing him reibels sentence 6 years 8 months to 
10 years 
i had no control over myself at that time reibel said as 
far as guilt shame ill have to suffer that forever im doing 
a life sentence

like other vietnam veterans reibels war story began in a 
distant land a generation later its still being written back 
home in a prison cell 
theyre one of the forgotten legacies of the war said wayne 
smith membership services director of vietnam veterans of america 
and a former army medic who served time for manslaughter 
there are those who are missing in action and there are those 
who are missing in america the incarcerated veteran he said 
the problem is very real its one we dont look at daily because 
of the height of the walls nevertheless theyre there theres a 
key turned every day 
these men have become prisoners of war of another sort at the 
end of 1987 state prisons held 20876 veterans who served in 
southeast asia in the vietnam era justice department records show 
another survey taken in 1979 found 12957 inmates in such prisons 
federal prison officials have no such breakdown 
thousands more vietnam vets have previously served time or are on 
probation or parole experts say and a recent survey found 470000 
vets one in seven suffer from post traumatic stress disorder a 
psychological condition sometimes marked by flashbacks and 
nightmares that has been cited in criminal defenses 
that condition was linked to two vets who have been executed one 
argued that flashbacks drove him to kill a rookie policeman the 
second man who killed two people in a robbery dug foxholes beneath 
his house and locked himself in his room after he returned from the 
war 
some experts suspect a higher proportion of vietnam veterans 
ended up in prison than those who served in other wars although no 
statistics support that 
the reasons they give for the perceived higher incidence of 
imprisonment the nature of the war no clear enemy lines and 
lack of decompression time 
vietnam combat veterans were guerilla fighters and moved from 
the theater of war to their home porch often in less than 36 
hours said john wilson a cleveland state university psychology 
professor and expert on post traumatic stress 
its almost like a deep sea diver coming up too quickly and 
getting the bends explained charles figley purdue university 
professor of family therapy and psychology 
many still thought like warriors a lot of the men were walking 
around with jungletrained survival instincts wilson said they 
were prepared to react to stress incidents as they did in vietnam 
one michigan inmate jim armstrong explains you go over there 
and you kill as many of them as you can before they kill you the 
whole time in your training it was kill kill kill what 
you dont kill burn down so when you come home its no man 
dont kill no more go back and build chevrolets how can you do 
that 
some experts also point out that many young vietnam soldiers were 
poor with few job skills when they returned they had two 
strikes against them said michael boivin psychology professor at 
spring arbor college in michigan 
a lot of these guys were at risk anyway he said i dont 
blame vietnam for the criminal acts committed but for some 
vietnam pushed them over the edge 
at times vets say the war even worked against them in court 
prosecutors portrayed them as rambos trained killers adept with 
guns 
the road from combat soldier to convict is a concern to scholars 
and veterans groups who are conducting studies testifying before 
lawmakers about effects of post war stress and working to establish 
halfway houses and a clearinghouse to track these socalled 
forgotten warriors 
vetsturnedinmates do support each other of 373 vietnam 
veterans of america chapters 24 are in prisons with 3000 members 
more are being organized a missouri chapter unites inmates with 
vets who work at the prison including the warden who served five 
tours in vietnam 
here in jackson two prisons have nearly 200 members in three 
chapters they are grouped by security level 
in one group inmates at the state prison of southern michigan 
the worlds largest walled prison speak of a society they say has 
victimized them twice first branding them murderers now 
stigmatizing them as convicts 
the media and the american people felt a vietnam veteran 
was either a babykiller or a walking timebomb said inmate 
armstrong when he lost control once they said ok lets put 
this timebomb in prison where if he explodes all he can hurt is 
other criminals 
theres no thought about well did the war have anything to do 
with it should we offer this guy an alternative should we put him 
in therapy should we try to readjust him to society that he didnt 
get readjusted to from coming from vietnam no lets just lock him 
up 
we aint no criminals added armstrong who shot his wife in 
the jaw during a fight we just made a mistake we as a group 
try to figure out how did we end up doing what we did how did it 
happen everybody else in prison is trying to figure out how 
did i get caught

in some ways imprisoned vietnam vets do differ from other 
inmates they tend to be more cooperative more reclusive less 
involved with gangs said wilson the cleveland state professor 
while some are hardened convicts he said others have no 
criminal mentality but their postwar lives have unraveled wilson 
said theres a direct link between post traumatic stress and drunken 
driving disorderly conduct assault and weapons charges 
reibel who was found guilty but mentally ill of child torture 
said his anger simmered for years records show he had a history of 
assaulting his son before his arrest i thought about vietnam 
everyday for 10 years and was afraid to say anything he said 
some also say the publics intense antiwar feelings made their 
return all the more traumatic 
everybody that came back from world war ii was a war hero 
armstrong said when i come home i thought man im a war 
hero but youre one of the four horsemen youre death riding on 
a horse 
most vietnam vets readjusted well but armstrong and others got 
into bar fights drank heavily drove recklessly some called it 
their death wish others say vietnam destroyed their priorities 
things that were important before i left werent important 
anymore friends family success said george fisher who robbed 
a shoe store to support a drug habit he picked up in vietnam 
the notion of right and wrong blurred too 
when you grow up and they teach you dont hit a girl 
when you get over there what if this little 16yearold kid 
happens to be a girl and firing that mauser at you asked inmate 
ken everhart convicted of criminal sexual conduct against his wife 
from whom he was separated 
people look and say youre sick pathetic said 
everhart whos been married five times i say you beat me down 
youve got me down im tired im tired im 41 years old ive 
been fighting vietnam for 21 years now vietnam destroyed my value 
system

the karens an ethnic group in burma have been 
fighting a guerrilla war against the burmese government for four 
decades this years political upheavals in rangoon have given them 
and other rebel groups new hope for success an associated press 
correspondent recently travelled with karen guerrillas inside burma 
and filed this report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the rebel commander chewing betel nut 
and quoting the bible pulls up the pants legs of his fatigues and 
points to scars from mortar and bullet wounds he said he suffered 
when the fighting began 39 years ago 
as he remembers battles past the crunch of an exploding mortar 
shell rolls through the river valley like thunder a heavy machine 
gun opens up with short bursts nearly 1500 feet above us among 
thick jungle and jagged limestone his guerrilla unit of the karen 
national union knu is trying to dislodge some 500 burmese 
government holdouts from their last positions 
his chin studded with gray stubble a green beret on his thinning 
hair 65yearold brig gen hla htoo is leading yet another 
operation in one of the worlds longestlasting and least known 
conflicts 
the mission at hand is to retake mae tah waw an encampment 
ringed by hills the burmese troops seized from the karen rebels in a 
1984 offensive astride one of several major smuggling routes 
between thailand and burma it provided the karens with substantial 
income from taxes on the illegal flow of gems teak livestock and 
basic consumer goods 
but the ultimate objective of the karen rebels going back to 
1949 is greater autonomy from the central government in rangoon and 
the right to maintain their distinct sinotibetan language and 
culture which includes christianity in the wake of inroads by the 
burman majority which is tibetoburman and almost totally buddhist 
upheavals this past summer in rangoon featuring the rise of a 
democratic movement following 30 years of authoritarian rule has 
given the karens new hope in the wake of the disorders and 
bloodletting more than 5000 antigovernment students and others 
have fled cities in burmas heartland to the thaiburmese border 
where the karens have carved out their domain 
the karens today operate in 1350 miles of border area extending 
from northern thailand down into the burmese strip on the andaman 
sea to the border of malaysia 
merely to close with ones enemy requires gruelling effort in the 
frontier areas of eastern burma where htoos group operates 
for three hours we climb the embattled hill of mai pan le using 
bamboo ladders to scale vertical cliffs and clinging to vines and 
bamboo on hillsides turned to slick mud by monsoon rains 
on a trail hacked through the jungle we meet a line of silent 
guerrillas each hauling a single rocket that will take hours to 
deliver to frontline positions and just seconds to be fired 
barefoot porters soaked in sweat materialize from the gloomy 
humid netherworld carrying the almost naked body of a young rebel 
fighter strapped hands and feet to two bamboo poles a neat reddish 
spot marks where a bullet entered his forehead 
atop the roostercomb ridge a dozen karen soldiers crouch behind 
rocks overlooking a saddle where the burmese have dug in rifle 
bullets whine over the outpost where the soldiers have already spent 
10 difficult days 
burmese soldiers can be seen scurrying around their bunkered 
positions below and one guerrilla pops up from his cover and arches 
a shell from his m79 grenade launcher towards them from another 
karen outpost hidden from sight on a hilltop far behind us the 
heavy machine gun tries to rake the same target 
but by most standards the karens are stingy with their 
ammunition 
every mortar shell we fire costs us 1000 baht 40 says 
one officer we are poor revolutionaries 
the soldiers on the hilltop says a medic have received only 
plain rice for rations which they supplement with leaves and berries 
gathered from the stony escarpment water has to be portered from 
below in plastic cans and there is virtually no shelter from the 
alternating heat and monsoon rainbursts 
as we move along the ridgeline the young medic stops to tighten 
the shoelaces he has tied around his boots to keep the soles from 
falling off 
gen hla htoo estimated that at any one time a quarter of his men 
are down with malaria which is endemic in territory under karen 
control and strikes him almost every year 
the burmese army product of a wrecked isolated economy also 
wages war on a shoestring from the ridge we see the jungle 
stretching westwards to the horizon and through it the burmese must 
resupply their forward positions over ambushprone trails and roads 
passable by vehicles only in the dry season

whereas the karens buy their ammunition and other supplies in 
thailand across the swift flowing moei river below us to the east 
the closest burmese rear base from the beleaguered troops is 40 
tortuous miles away miles away porters who fled the burmese lines 
said they had been rounded up in rangoon threatened with execution 
and made to haul supplies without being provided with either pay or 
food the shoulders and backs of some were worn raw and bloody 
the karens say banana leaves a sign of a lack of food supplies 
were found in cooking pots when they overran several burmese bunkers 
after close quarters combat which often climaxes days or weeks of 
slow advances and preparatory fire 
on one of three hills already taken by the karens around mae tah 
waw karen officers say they had to literally pry the burmese from 
the rocks a special commando unit reportedly scaled sheer cliffs 
seeded with mines as the defenders desperately hurled grenades 
downwards later the bodies of the dead burmese were thrown off the 
hilltop 
after trapping burmese inside a cave the karens said they 
sealed off its mouth with branches and leaves and set a bag of 
chillies afire an hour later two gasping redeyed soldiers emerged 
to surrender 
there are no known statistics but thousands are believed to have 
died on both sides in what some historians call a civil war that 
erupted when the karens and later the kachins shans and other 
minority groups felt betrayed by a central government that was 
after independence from britain in 1948 to have granted them some 
autonomy under a federal union 
the karen national union set up its capital and military 
headquarters in manerplaw a quiet village set along the moei river 
with thickly forested miststreak hills as a backdrop simple 
wooden buildings housing the knus 12 administrative departments a 
jail church and the home of president bo mya ring a parade ground 
where a bugler daily sounds reveille and retreat 
nearby the young are recruited into the knu and trained there 
is a separate barracks for women soldiers with wooden rifles used 
in training stacked outside inside an girl still of the age to be 
playing with dolls sits on the wooden communal sleeping platform 
among her few possessions sadly holding a baby chick in the palm of 
her hand 
soldiers and their families receive free rice salt fish paste 
sometimes tobacco and chillies as well as the rudimentary education 
and medical care the knu can provide widows of those killed are 
helped until they remarry but there is no pay for enlisted men or 
officers 
many of the current leaders including gen hla htoo joined the 
rebellion in 1949 although enmity between the karens and burmans 
stretches back far longer 
british colonials in the 19th century found the karens able 
soldiers ever willing to help put down burman uprisings and 
banditry american baptist missionaries gained many converts among 
them descendents of whom carry names like maj aaron and col 
sampson and credit the christian god with their victories 
hla htoo himself a baptist is not yet ready to declare the 
battle won and if he does take all of mae tah waw the military 
situation will simply revert to what it was before the big burmese 
attack in 1984 
it is now evening a light rain falls but the gunfire above 
continues the dead guerrilla tied to the bamboo poles one of five 
karens killed over the past 24 hours finally reaches a ramshackle 
monastery where hla htoo has set up his command post 
there will be no retirement for me says the general 
spitting out betel nut juice and studying his campaign maps

after waging a backwater rebellion for 
four decades burmas karens hope the flight of thousands of 
students to their remote jungle bases will slot their cause into the 
broader struggle against a harsh military government in rangoon 
since the government crushed a popular uprising in september 
more than 5000 students and others have fled cities in the 
heartland to the thaiburmese border here the the karens have 
carved out a domain complete with schools tax collectors soccer 
teams and a fighting force said to number 17000 guerrillas 
the karen national union probably the strongest of a dozen 
ethnic minority rebel groups claims to control most of the 
1350mile frontier and administer roughly 1 million of burmas 6 
million to 7 million karens the knus weapons are purchased on the 
black market of neighboring thailand with income largely derived 
from taxes on massive crossborder smuggling 
the burmese population will now have a better view of the 
ethnic revolutionary groups because of the students knu president 
bo mya said in an interview together with the students and gods 
help we will win the war 
karen leaders also say the recent mass killings of demonstrators 
and other human rights violations in burma may make the 
international community and the majority burmans realize they and 
other ethnic minorities have had just cause in fighting the rangoon 
government 
the students will offer some harassment but not enough to make 
a difference against a tough battlehardened force that has shown 
itself to be unified a western diplomat based in rangoon said 
recently to date the students have received minimal military 
training and malaria has already cut a swath through their ranks 
the karens themselves have scored victories in recent months 
taking advantage of the burmese armys preoccupation with putting 
down internal revolt but the turmoil has also disrupted the massive 
crossborder smuggling which funds the knu 
knu territory is administered by 12 departments including those 
handling foreign affairs agriculture and justice the latter 
punishes adultery by 10 years imprisonment and bans all liquor 
sales 
the strict moral outlook appears to originate from 19th century 
american christian missionaries knu leaders are invariably fervent 
baptists or seventh day adventists attributing their victories to 
gods grace 
after burma was granted independence by britain in 1948 karens 
rose up in revolt feeling betrayed by a rangoon government that was 
to have granted ethnic minorities considerable political autonomy 
and the right to foster their individual cultures and languages

as a centurys soot and cobwebs are wiped 
from millions of storedaway records a preservation project is 
beginning to document the birth growth and demise of what some 
historians consider americas once most influential company the 
pennsylvania railroad 
the pennsylvania historical and museum commission has undertaken 
the project with nine other institutions around the nation to save 
the companys records from locomotive blueprints to the personal 
correspondence of executives 
their goal according to robert dructor director of the 
commissions division of archives and manuscripts is to organize 
the records into a cohesive collection accessible by computer 
the effort should also help answer questions about the 
corporation that was the united states largest until world war i 
it started in 1846 as a transportation company but steamrolled 
across the northeast and into the midwest consuming competitors 
until it eventually operated steel oil and coal companies too 
while the outlines of the pennsylvania railroads history are 
well known the old documents are revealing intriguing historical 
details that fill out the picture 
one recently discovered 1899 note to the railroad president 
threatened to sabotage the rails 
i have blackmailed the prr co for 50000 said the writer 
who signed as red mail dont put me down as a crank or insane i 
am as responsible for what i do as you i am getting old poor and 
desperate i may put a limited express over a dump any time 
dructor said archivists have yet to discover whether the 
extortionist carried out his threat 
its still a mystery he said 
the decline of industry in the northeast the growth of the 
countrys highway systems and development of the commercial air 
industry have all been identified as contributors to the 
pennsyvlania railroads demise the paper trail could help show more 
precisely how and why dructor said 
ian s fischer a mechanical engineering professor at new jersey 
institute of technology has delved into some of the documents to 
find information about rail freight cars a longtime fascination 
that he hopes someday to turn into a book 
the memoranda he says put researchers inside things that 
happened years ago one example was how freight car designers had 
to make changes to accommodate the huge demand for industrial 
goods by the warring nations of europe just before america entered 
world war i 
the volume of documents is staggering 
the first phase of the project required the appraisal of some 
300000 cubic feet of records or about 900 million pages of paper 
dructor said of that about 8000 cubic feet were identified to be 
saved and approximately 3600 cubic feet were assigned to the state 
archives for processing 
the twoyear project is expected to be completed by february 1990 
at a cost of about 260000 dructor said the national endowment 
for the humanities is providing a 100000 grant other 
contributions of cash goods and services completed the funding 
documents in the collection range from blueprints and tracings of 
pennsylvania railroad locomotives station buildings bridges and 
routes to photographs of trains warera posters and design 
sketches for conductor uniforms there are also real estate and 
accounting books as well as legal papers 
i just couldnt possibly have imagined that there was so much 
material going back as far as the 1860s still existing said joe 
acri who contacted the state archives looking for details of trains 
to help him make accurate models at home 
after viewing thousands of tracings and blueprints he said 
they made drawings of individual nuts bolts screws coat racks 
coat hooks even the layout of lanterns and tools kept in locomotive 
tenders the detail is phenomenal 
two project archivists and several fulltime commission staff 
members are sifting the records 
documents since 1968 when the railroad merged with the new york 
central to become penn central later conrail remain sealed under 
the railroads policy requiring a 25year moratorium on opening 
corporate papers dructor said 
the documents preceding that time are more than enough to keep 
the researchers busy however once completed they hope the 
collection will prove useful to genealogists archivists and 
railroad buffs alike dructor said 
jean morris editor of a magazine for the western pennsylvania 
genealogical society said the collection could help fill gaps in 
family histories of railroad workers 
you can get some insight into the men that worked for the 
railroad where they lived how they worked what jobs they had 
with the railroad mrs morris said there are very little 
traces of many of them in county records because many of the people 
who worked for the railroad moved around so much

in the eyes of some industry observers the 
nations savings industry facing an expensive internal crisis is 
trying to have it both ways more government protection and less 
government regulation 
the industrys oldest and largest trade grop the us league of 
savings institutions says congress should preserve sampls as a 
separate system because theyre important to home lending 
on the other hand sampls dont want to give up the new investment 
powers they acquired through the reagan administrations program of 
deregulation 
at the trade groups 96th annual convention in honolulu last 
week its leaders promised to push for tougher supervision 
but last month when banking regulators asked congress for power 
to levy daily fines against rulebreaking institutions the industry 
didnt support the request 
sampls say they dont want their regulator the federal home loan 
bank board merged with commercial bank agencies but neither do 
they want the government to block healthy sampls from fleeing the 
problems of the federal savings and loan insurance corp by joining 
the banks deposit insurance fund 
they want to have their cake and eat it both said h joe 
selby a dallas consultant and former top regulator in the federal 
home loan bank of dallas 
the fslic which insures deposits in the nations 3048 savings 
and loans is in deep trouble sixteen percent of its member 
institutions are insolvent and another 13 percent are dangerously 
close to it with capital levels of less than 3 percent of their 
loans and other assets 
sampl executives say they cant provide the estimated 45 billion 
to 50 billion to that will be needed to prop up the insurance fund 
without toppling the healthy institutions into insolvency too 
but they also know that if taxpayers pay congress will attach 
conditions designed to prevent a repeat of the disaster 
fearful that those conditions will spell the end of a savings 
industry separate from banking the us league is portraying sampls 
as partners in the american dream of home ownership 
theyre trying to tug on the heart strings of congress in order 
to loosen up the purse strings said r dan brumbaugh a private 
analyst who was formerly chief economist of the bank board 
but brumbaugh said the sampl organization will be handicapped 
next year by the belief in congress that it has been tacking back 
and forth somewhat erratically 
in 1986 and 1987 when the administration pushed for a 15 
billion industryfunded bond issue to provide cash to the insurance 
fund the lobby group tried to hold it to 5 billion eventually 
compromising on 108 billion 
the perception is that the us league understood the problem 
was greater but disengenously argued for less than was needed 
brumbaugh said 
while sampl leaders at the convention called for a return to basic 
mortgage lending few were willing to go back entirely to the old 
days of tight restrictions on thrifts investments 
some of these areas need to be looked at but we dont want to 
see a wholesale rolling back of what an sampl can do said roy 
green president of county savings bank santa barbara calif a 
former us league chairman 
sandra k johnigan of coasttocoast financial corp of new york 
says thrifts need power to invest in a variety of higherearning 
ventures in order to attract money from new private investors 
its not possible to get thrifts out of trouble with just 
mortgage lending she said 
us league leaders say they would accept some new restrictions 
including limits on commercial real estate lending and on 
investments in junk bonds but the better answer is strong 
supervision by federal examiners 
theo h pitt jr a north carolina sampl executive who just 
finished his term as us league chairman said the reagan 
administration in the early 1980s ignored industry pleas for more 
examiners 
however at the same time us league promotional material brags 
about newspaper stories calling it a formidably effective lobby 
m danny wall chairman of the bank board said sampl leaders are 
engaging in revisionist history if they claim they were strong 
proponents of more supervision 
if they are the lobbying power they would have people believe 
they either opposed enforcement or they failed to be effective in 
assisting us wall said in an interview 
he said the league missed an important opportunity last month to 
help regulators get an enforcement tool somewhere in between 
shooting closing an sampl down and a slap on the wrist a warning 
letter 
a bill authorizing regulators to impose fines died before 
congress adjourned 
brumbaugh who believes that sampls have closer ties with their 
regulators than perhaps any other industry said the us league is 
striving to maintain a separate thrift system because its leaders 
believe they will lose power if they dont 
however the league also defends the right of better off sampls to 
leave the fslic which charges insurance premiums 2 times the 
premium charged by the banks fund 
frederick l webber a former ford administration assistant 
treasury secretary installed thursday as the us leagues new 
president acknowledged his group has a credibility problem with 
washington 
without passing judgment on what happened before i got here 
im going to do everything i can to restore our credibility i 
along with my staff and my elected leaders are going to tell the 
truth he said in an interview 
webber also acknowledged tension within the league between 
institutions that have stuck primarily with mortgage lending and 
those who have ventured into new areas 
im not saying we dont have room for the other people who 
have diversified but they have to understand that both for 
political and business reasons we have to stick to our knitting 
he said

michael dukakis longtime support for tighter 
government controls on handguns provided ample ammunition for george 
bush and the national rifle asociation 
dukakis who supports a federal sevenday waiting period on 
handgun purchases and a ban on saturday night specials accused 
his opponent of distorting his stance on gun control 
ive always supported the right of hunters and sportsmen to own 
weapons and for people to protect themselves in their own homes 
the democrat said 
dukakis backed the socalled brady amendment to impose a uniform 
mandatory sevenday waiting period on handgun purchases in all 
states bush opposed the brady amendment which went down to a 
228182 defeat sept 13 after intense lobbying by the nra 
bush a lifetime member of the nra elicited cheers from crowds 
across the south and west whenever he declared his opposition to new 
federal gun controls 
im a sportsman im a hunter i like to do it and i dont 
believe we need the federal government going forward with gun 
control legislation bush told a rally in billings mont 
in opposing a federal waiting period bush found himself on the 
opposite side of several national police organizations worried 
about the vagaries of state laws only 22 states now bar instant gun 
purchases 
dukakis vehemently denied ever telling a gun owners lobbyist 
i dont believe in people owning guns only the police and 
military and i am going to do everything i can to disarm this 
state 
in 1976 dukakis supported a massachusetts referendum to ban 
private ownership of handguns the referendum failed 
dukakis currently favors the ban on saturday night specials as 
well as additional efforts to keep guns out of the hands of the 
criminally or mentally dangerous including background checks 
dukakis boasts that as governor he supported a law setting a 
mandatory oneyear prison sentence for those illegally carrying a 
gun and stiffened penalties for felonies commited with a firearm 
he says 22000 americans are killed each year with handguns 
at one point the dukakis campaign threatened a lawsuit against 
the nra over ads berating the democrats record on guns and crime 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas long a favorite of the nra came to 
the defense of his running mate saying i saw those ads about 
mike dukakis going to take the guns away from you i sure wouldnt 
be running with any fellow if i thought he was going to take my 
shotgun away from me 
bush said he supports mandatory sentences for those caught 
using a gun during a crime but in a letter to the nra the 
republican attacked what he called the gun control myths 
those who invent these myths threaten more than the rights of 
our 70 million gun owners and 25 million hunters bush said 
federal licensing gun registration background checks or a ban 
on firearms to name a few would only restrict the rights of the 
lawabiding leaving criminals free to commit crimes with illegal 
weapons 
dukakis told a crowd in pueblo colo that the charges he is 
against gun ownership are a lot of baloney 
what im concerned about is teenagers in major cities of this 
country running around with uzis and ak47s automatic military 
weapons and killing people in street gangs and drug deals 
dukakis said thats the kind of thing thats got to be 
controlled not innocent sportsmen who have a perfect right to 
hunt 
bush as a congressman from houston voted for the original 
federal gun control act of 1968 that law enacted after the 
assassination of the rev martin luther king jr barred convicted 
felons from buying or owning guns and banned interstate and 
mailorder sale of handguns 
but bush says he also supported the 1986 mcclurevolkmer act that 
allowed the interstate sale of rifles and shotguns 
bush in his campaign literature says i have always opposed 
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners but he added 
we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the 
rights of society we must do all we can to keep guns out of the 
hands of convicted criminals 
in a debate with other republican candidates before the gun 
owners of new hampshire last feb 2 bush said im not only a 
hunter but im a lifetime member of the nra i do have a deep 
appreciation for the second amendment rights to keep and bear arms

crime would have been a big issue in the 1988 
presidential race even if convicted murderer willie horton hadnt 
gotten out of a massachusetts jail on a weekend furlough 
the cocaine epidemic gang warfare and escalating street violence 
in big cities all helped push the crime issue onto center stage with 
an urgency unseen in a presidential race since richard nixons 
lawandorder campaign of 1968 
both george bush and michael dukakis vowed to take back our 
streets and promised new assaults against drug traffickers 
hoodlums and whitecollar criminals 
some criminologists expressed surprise that crime commanded such 
attention in the race crime rates have fallen during most of the 
1980s and despite a recent turn upward remain much lower than in 
the late 1970s 
theres just a widespread sense among the public that people 
are seriously at danger even though they are at less danger than 
they were five or eight years ago said alfred blumstein dean of 
the school of urban and public affairs at carnegie mellon university 
drug use is off among teenagers according to 
governmentsponsored surveys but the cocaine and crack trade has 
spawned violence that shocked the public like the assassination 
last spring of a new york city policeman edward byrnes who was 
guarding the home of a witness in a drug case byrnes father 
recently gave bush his sons shield 
the violence and the drug problem run together said hubert 
williams president of the police foundation and former police 
director in newark nj people have felt the sting they see a 
deterioration in our society in our ability to deal with it 
i see that violent crime is a great civil rights question of 
our time bush told students at the university of notre dame an 
old woman who is afraid to go out for a break after dark is every 
bit as oppressed as a political prisoner in some totalitarian 
country 
dukakis for his part said ive led the fight against crime 
and drugs in my own state and i intend to do so as president 
but despite dukakis boast that crime in massachusetts has 
dropped 14 percent in the past four years and the state has a 
homicide rate 50 percent below the national average the governor 
found himself under constant attack by bush on two emotionladen 
crime issues the death penalty and the horton furlough 
bushs advocacy of the death penalty for copkillers drug 
kingpins terrorists traitors and others and his pillorying of 
dukakis over the furlough program won him the endorsement of police 
groups in boston new york city and elsewhere 
dukakis opposes the death penalty under any circumstances polls 
indicated the public viewed the democrat as soft on crime 
james lynch an assistant professor of justice at american 
university said crime often becomes a lightning rod for peoples 
frustrations i think its possibly a code word for something 
else it could be racism 
as republican fliers and ads made clear willie horton is black 
his victims were white 
horton serving a life sentence without parole for fatally 
stabbing a 17yearold gas station attendant in a 1974 robbery 
never returned from his 10th weekend furlough in june 1986 ten 
months later he broke into an oxon hill md home attacking 
clifford barnes and his fiance later captured in a shootout he now 
is back behind bars serving two life terms plus 85 years in a 
maryland prison 
dukakis sought to blunt the bush attack by pointing out that 
every other state and the federal government has a furlough program 
citing crime sprees by other furloughed prisoners including one 
from a houston halfway house that bush once honored dukakis said 
i think when you use human tragedy for political purposes thats 
kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics 
but bush said the massachusetts furlough program begun in the 
1970s by a republican governor francis sargent was the most 
liberal in the nation and the only one that allowed lifers not 
eligible for parole out on passes 
dukakis vetoed a 1976 bill that would have made firstdegree 
murderers ineligible for furloughs and defended the policy against 
mounting criticism until it was suspended by his state department of 
correction last december dukakis signed legislation last april 
revoking furloughs for firstdegree murderers 
national crime statistics show crime up 18 percent last year 
ending a fiveyear decline and 347 million people were victimized 
by criminals 
more than 200000 furloughs were granted last year for 53000 
inmates across the united states 
there are 800000 inmates in us prisons and jails and prison 
reformers say that only the soviet union and south africa have 
higher incarceration rates than the united states 
many prisons are overcrowded and the problem is getting worse 
the big question is how can we deal with the volume of cases 
flooding our judicial systems and our penal institutions said 
williams furlough programs are a release valve 
bush has promised to double federal spending on prison 
construction in his first term providing an extra 250 million a 
year there are now 44000 prisoners in 51 federal institutions 
84000 are expected by 1995 because of tougher sentences 
the republican also wants to convert idle military bases into 
state and federal prisons and make the criminals help pay the 
rent on their prison stays by using the confiscated assets of drug 
traffickers and racketeers to help pay for prison construction 
bush promises to create an antigang unit in the justice 
department and says no one should be allowed out of prison until 
they test drugfree 
bush vows to throw the book at inside traders and other 
whitecollar criminals and promises to appoint judges who have 
a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less 
for the criminal 
dukakis promises to fight a real war not a phony war against 
drugs 
he charges bush botched his assignment in the reagan 
administration to coordinate antidrug efforts in florida he also 
ridicules bushs involvement as central intelligence agency director 
and as vice president with panama leader manuel noriega now under 
us indictment for drug trafficking 
dukakis has vowed to cut off us aid to countries that send 
their poison into the united states bush has not ruled out 
cutting off foreign aid as a tool in the war on drugs but he has 
suggested he is skeptical of such a move 
dukakis says he unlike bush has a proven record in 
massachusetts in fighting crime i didnt learn my lessons about 
crime from a clint eastwood movie ive been out there with you 
he told hispanic officers in los angeles 
dukakis also emphasizes his support for compensation for victims 
of crime and says he would create a national anticrime council to 
help coordinate the fight 
dukakis also promises to crack down on tax evaders whom he says 
cheat the treasury out of 110 billion a year 
the republican scoffs at that saying it would mean an irs 
auditor in every kitchen 
i have confidence in the honesty of the american people says 
bush

george bush an oilman before he became a 
politician aims to revive the ailing us oil industry with tax 
incentives and encourage alternative fuel sources including nuclear 
power 
michael dukakis his rival for the presidency says a strong 
domestic energy industry is vital to the security of our nation 
and he promises to target assistance to small and medium producers 
he has fought efforts to license the controversial seabrook nuclear 
plant in new hampshire just over the massachusetts border 
both presidential candidates oppose oil import fees or tariffs 
both also oppose increasing the federal tax on gasoline 
both see a larger role in americas future for natural gas and 
coal and both favor pressing ahead with research on ways to burn 
coal cleanly the two laud alternative fuels such as methanol from 
natural gas and ethanol from grain 
while energy issues have not received the same attention in the 
presidential race as has the environment each candidate has laid 
out detailed positions on energy issues 
here is an overview 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the republican says oil and gas will remain americas main source 
of energy for a long time he says the nation must find more and 
conserve more applying our best technology and ingenuity 
while protecting the environment 
bush says almost 100000 oil wells have been abandoned because 
they are not economic at low prices and high taxes he says he 
will try to reverse the fortunes of the domestic oil industry with 
tax incentives for stripper wells 
a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration up to 10 
million of costs and 5 percent above that 
expanding the research and development tax credit to include 
enhanced recovery techniques 
eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling costs as subject 
to the alternative minimum tax for independent producers 
bush says he will keep filling the strategic petroleum reserve 
with a goal of 740 million barrels by 1993 
although bush has called for a moratorium on drilling in 
environmentally sensitive tracts such as parts of northern 
california he generally favors oil drilling on the outer 
continental shelf 
there is no way to meet our energy requirements without 
offshore drilling bush says but he adds a few tracts are 
so sensitive environmentally aesthetically or commercially that 
they should not be leased 
he wants congress to decontrol natural gas prices we should 
fully decontrol natural gas and seek more competitive transportation 
of gas bush says gas decontrol alone will save the average 
consumer household 25 to 40 a year 
on nuclear energy bush says as long as the highest safety 
standards are maintained nuclear power must be a part of our energy 
mix 
he supported the law this year that gave states the right to 
raise their speed limits to 65 miles per hour which increases fuel 
consumption 
bush headed a reagan regulatory task force that was instrumental 
in repealing federal requirements for energy efficiency in new 
buildings 
bush also favors repealing fuel economy standards for automobiles 
bush advisers say the tax incentives favored by bush could 
increase production by 600000 barrels a day and cost 600 million 
in annual tax revenue 
domestic oil production is currently about 82 million barrels a 
day or 9 percent below 1985 levels the industry has lost 300000 
jobs since then

the massachusetts governor says we have no national energy 
policy today only a morass of conflicting ideologies and regional 
interests 
he has promised to take steps to 
insure against the economic catastrophe of a disruption in 
foreign oil supplies 
encourage a strong health energy industry 
promote conservation and fuel efficiency 
make sure that energy policies do not conflict with 
environmental goals including reduced acid rain and urban ozone 
levels 
dukakis says he would keep filling the strategic petroleum 
reserve and seek closer ties with such oilsupplying nations as 
canada mexico and venezuela as insurance against disruption of 
middle east supplies 
to stimulate oil and gas drilling dukakis promises a 
countercyclical program to assist energyproducing regions when 
times are tough 
he said he will target assistance on small and medium producers 
who do most of the exploratory drilling and phase out the program 
when oil prices and rig counts move back up 
he would tie the federal aid to comparable assistance or tax 
relief by the state and suggested one possibility would be a 
temporary abatement of federal taxes on income produced from new 
wells 
another possibility he said is to restrict a portion of the oil 
purchased for the strategic petroleum reserve to oil from new 
fields and to pay a 5 per barrel premium for it 
dukakis says he would expand the 10 million federal research 
budget for enhanced oil recovery techniques 
on natural gas dukakis says he would seek to remove the 
barriers that prevent distribution companies utilities and large 
industrial customers from bargaining directly with producers 
dukakis would use price incentives and regulations to spur the 
use of ethanol and methanol and maintain rules requiring auto 
producers to build more fuelefficient cars 
dukakis says he will appoint nuclear regulatory commissioners 
dedicated to strong enforcement of safety standards he says the 
federal liability limit that protects the nuclear industry in the 
event of accidents is outdated and unnecessary 
he opposes building new nuclear plants until safer reactors are 
designed and safe ways are found to treat and dispose of waste 
bush favors exploration of the arctic national wildlife refuge in 
alaska a good drilling prospect dukakis opposes it

the scarred and bruised valleys of wales 
are turning green again 
the proud but downtrodden celtic nation has painfully weaned 
itself from the coal and steel industries that once made it the 
energy capital of the world 
it has wrought a dramatic economic revival based on service 
industries and manufacturing that have changed not only the physical 
face of wales but also the way of life of its citizens 
many of its 28 million people are enjoying a new prosperity a 
new optimism born of the ecomomic revival of the 1980s 
the key to its success has been its ability to attract outside 
investment and foster local entrepreneurship both of which are 
creating much needed jobs above ground 
it is probably the fastest changing and fastest growing economy 
in western europe peter walker the british governments welsh 
secretary said in an interview i think its a very exciting 
scene 
all the signs are that the economy is more prosperous than at 
any time in the last half century said roger mansfield director 
of the university of wales cardiff business school a complete 
change from an industry dominated by coal and steel to a very mixed 
economy has opened up a lot of opportunities 
the physical transformation is most obvious in its southern 
valleys where coal was once king 
the scarring and bruising were described by the late welsh writer 
richard llewellyn in his heartwrenching 1939 classic how green 
was my valley 
the first thing i saw was the slag heap said the main 
character a miners young son called huw morgan about his first 
outing after a long convalescence 
big it had grown and long and black without life or sigh 
lying along the bottom of the valley on both sides of the river the 
green grass and the reeds and the flowers all had gone crushed 
beneath it 
but today in a rhondda valley spot once covered with coal slag 
you now can find a cluster of luxury homes overlooking two manmade 
lakes nestled in green hills 
this is part of a multimilliondollar government program to 
reclaim and landscape slag heaps all though the valleys 
were trying to get away from that image of wales as black and 
grimy said stephen white a welsh development agency official 
the revival also is physically visible in the welsh capital 
cardiff where an ambitious estimated 27billion 
governmentsupported redevelopment program is under way in the south 
side docklands an area covering 3000 acres or one third of the 
city 
meanwhile men who once went down into the dark mines where as 
huw morgan well knew the work was hard and dangerous now have 
jobs in such places as an insurance companys claimsprocessing 
office or a japaneseowned television assembly plant 
said lyn arnold another welsh development agency official in 
most communities there is somebody doing well and everybody is 
hearing about it 
ian kelsall head of the confederation of british industry in 
wales said the shopping centers are flourishing in south wales 
holiday travel is up you can see it in membership of golf clubs 
numbers underscore how big a wrench it has been one man in 100 
works in wales coal industry today compared with one in three in 
the early 1920s 
today the service sector accounts for 65 percent of employment 
manufacturing 24 percent primary industries such as coal mining 6 
percent and construction 5 percent 
wales gross domestic product grew almost 7 percent in 1986 the 
most recent year for which the statistics are available after a 
15percent spurt in 1985 its manufacturing index stands at 1159 in 
contrast to 100 in 1980 
the unemployment rate has fallen to 103 percent representing 
125300 people from a peak of 168 percent or 172000 people in 
march 1986 
the turnaround however is not without critics 
they hold that too many welshmen remain jobless and that the 
improvement is confined to the southeast and northeast regions of 
wales which covers a total area of 8018 square miles about the 
size of massachusetts 
critics also say wales jobs are particularly vulnerable to 
cutbacks because they are dependent on inward investment by 
companies that are headquartered elsewhere 
it seems a very dangerous situation to have your whole economy 
based on outside investment which can be whipped out at any time 
said dafydd williams general secretary of plaid cymru the welsh 
nationalist party it has been said that most schemes are to take 
advantage of cheap labor 
the newfound prosperity also has exacerbated a shortage of welsh 
managers and of skilled workers in general 
wales already was running short because the mines didnt create 
many managers or teach a wide variety of skills and because 
ambitious welshmen tended to emigrate in the past 
the welsh have consistently supported socialist political parties 
and many critics blame wales economic problems on prime minister 
margaret thatchers capitalist economic policies nationalists blame 
what they see as wales loss of independence 
wales was brought under english rule by king edward i in 1282 and 
united with england in 1536 today it sends 38 members to the house 
of commons eight of whom are conservative 
it was the recession of the early 1980s that broke the backs of 
the longdeclining overmanned coal and steel industries 
wales was harder hit by that downturn than other areas of 
britain as intertwined pits and foundries were closed 
massive layoffs cut the number of coal workers from 30000 in 
1979 to 7500 today and the number of steel workers from 55000 to 
20000 the welsh office said 
overall employment levels since have been helped by the 
significant amount of jobcreating inward investment in 
manufacturing and services by the japanese and other foreign 
investors some of whom have been seeking a european foothold before 
1992 when the european economic community is to become barrierfree 
last year wales became the favorite location in britain for 
overseas investors who also have been attracted by financial lures 
and by the proximity to london which is under 150 miles to the east 
wales won 302 investments in 1987 or onefifth of all the 
investment that came into britain according to the invest in 
britain bureau 
many jobs have also been created by the emerging welsh 
entrepreneurship 
it used to be said at one time that the welsh arent 
entrepreneurs that they are teachers and preachers kelsall said 
but ironically severance payments gave laidoff miners the 
capital to start their own businesses 
as a result wales counted 152000 selfemployed people last 
december compared with 115000 in 1975 the welsh office said 
these optimists have created a mixed bag of farming and local 
service companies and small manufacturers are starting to export 
their products arnold said with pride 
walker said now bright young men are staying in wales and a 
lot of bright young welshmen who left are coming back 
as little huw morgan would have said there is lovely

a prominent trader with ties to financial giant 
american express co is the latest target of a federal crackdown on 
wall street crime but his lawyer has denounced the charges and 
accused prosecutors of abuse 
the 22count indictment announced thursday against salim b lewis 
and the brokerage he owns sb lewis amp co charged him with 
manipulation and other frauds in connection with american expresss 
sale of firemans fund corp stock more than two years ago 
the indictment which carries enormous potential penalties is an 
indirect outgrowth of the ivan boesky insider trading scandal and 
manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani said others might be 
charged 
stanley arkin lewiss attorney said his client was innocent and 
would fight the charges arkin harshly denounced giulianis office 
for prosecuting the matter 
the allegations are totally off the wall arkin said 
twentytwo counts of this piece of garbage reflect a kind of 
mindless abusiveness of the people who brought this case theres no 
possible justification 
he added theres a great difference between being a tough 
prosecutor and being ruthless and this over here is ruthlessness 
completely unjustified on any basis 
american express was not named in the indictment but was 
portrayed as the intended beneficiary of the alleged manipulation 
scheme the company quickly denied any wrongdoing and said it has 
been cooperating fully with federal investigators 
giuliani whose office has been leading a crackdown on wall 
street corruption that has resulted in numerous indictments told 
reporters lewis allegedly conspired with others to manipulate upward 
the stock price of firemans fund an insurance concern partly owned 
by american express 
the prosecutor said the manipulation took place when american 
express was about to price an offering of firemans fund stock it 
wished to sell one of the objectives giuliani said was to make 
sure that american express maximized the proceeds that it received 
from that offering 
he would not elaborate on whether anyone inside american express 
participated in the alleged scheme 
lewis 49 has a close working relationship with american 
express one of the nations biggest financial services firms and 
parent of shearson lehman hutton inc a leading wall street 
investment house 
american express retained lewis to conduct major transactions in 
the past at the time of the alleged manipulation it had a 
substantial investment in sb lewis and has about a 20 percent 
stake in the firm now 
the indictment alleged that lewis requested two unidentified 
employees of the los angelesbased brokerage firm jefferies amp co 
buy more than 400000 shares of firemans fund on the new york and 
pacific stock exchanges on may 8 1986 in attempt to drive its 
price up to 38 a share substantially above its price at the time 
the indictment also accused lewis of promising to reimburse the 
jefferies employees for any losses they might incur and of hiding 
his role in the transactions through phony records 
the day after the alleged manipulation american express said it 
would sell 8 million shares of firemans fund at 4150 a share it 
eventually realized a gain of 88 million from that sale 
giuliani acknowledged that some information used to obtain the 
indictment was provided by boyd l jefferies the founder of 
jefferies amp co who settled civil securitieslaw violations with 
the securities and exchange commission last year and has been 
cooperating with federal investigators 
jefferies originally was implicated by boesky the most famous 
insider trader in us history now imprisoned boesky also has been 
cooperating with the government in other securities fraud 
investigations 
lewis and his firm were charged with various counts of 
conspiracy stock manipulation mail fraud wire fraud phony record 
keeping and margin violations for an individual each count carries 
a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment for a company the 
penalties range from 500000 to 225 million per count

west pointpepperell inc has taken the offensive 
in its battle to thwart a takeover by farley inc seeking a federal 
court order blocking the 14 billion offer 
pepperell filed suit in federal court in georgia seeking to stop 
farleys 48pershare offer on the grounds that the company is 
financially unable to go through with its offer and that its 
financial partner the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
legally can not participate in the deal 
in papers filed thursday with the securities and exchange 
commission in washington pepperell claimed drexel was violating 
terms of march 3 standstill agreement with pepperell 
the agreement prohibits drexel from assisting anyone in 
acquiring directly or indirectly jp stevens amp co inc or 
its business assets for a term of one year the filing stated 
earlier this year drexel advised the investor group odyssey 
partners during its efforts to buy stevens pepperell and odyssey 
eventually jointly acquired the company with pepperell retaining 
stevens bed and bath textile operations 
we were never a party to any standstill agreement and in our 
opinion the suit is totally lacking in merit said drexel 
spokesman steven anreder in new york 
jack albertine a farley spokesman in chicago said the company 
would have no comment until it had studied the allegations 
the sec filing also alleged that farleys offer violates federal 
reserve bank regulations because of the amount of debt involved and 
says drexel has failed to identify itself as a bidder under 
security regulations and has not filed necessary documents 
also thursday west point said it had delayed until nov 15 
enacting its poison pill provisions which grant shareholders 
special rights in the event of a takeover bid separate trading in 
the rights had been scheduled to begin thursday 
thursdays filing with the sec repeated pepperells contention 
that farleys offer does not reflect the longterm value 
achievable by the company as an independent entity 
pepperells board on wednesday said farley was trying to purchase 
the company before its stock price reflected the full value of the 
stevens acquisition 
the stevens assets must be held separately until early december 
under an agreement with the federal trade commission company 
officials have said 
pepperell stock fell 137 to 4387 a share thursday in 
composite new york stock exchange trading following a 25cent a 
share drop on wednesday 
also wednesday the pepperell board authorized management to 
explore other alternatives for the company a possible sale of the 
company or some of its businesses to a third party 
the company is not currently engaged in negotiations with any 
third parties with respect to any such transaction although it may 
commence such negotiations at any time the companys sec filing 
said 
the company said it would have no statement on any such 
negotiation until or if they were completed 
pepperell manufactures arrow shirts and martex towels and as a 
result of the stevens acquisition has about 25 percent of the 
nations home fashion textile market 
subsidiaries of farley a privately owned conglomerate headed by 
william farley manufacture fruit of the loom underwear and acme 
boots 
farley notified pepperell in may it was seeking up to 25 percent 
of pepperells 294 million outstanding shares and as of last week 
had spent 88 million for 98 percent of the stock

the impact of last summers drought has 
come home again for corn farmers with the worlds largest seed corn 
producer announcing a doubledigit price hike for 1989 sales to 
farmers 
pioneer hibred international inc said thursday the average 
increase of 118 percent which it said was mandated by higher 
production costs would come to about 739 a bag something that 
would bring the cost of an average bag of corn to about 70 
but because the company sells a wide variety of seed some 
farmers still will pay less than 70 and some will pay more 
an executive said the price announcement thursday should relieve 
farmer fears of an even steeper hike in seed costs for next springs 
planting 
this should be good news to those whove heard rumors that 
pioneer seed corn would be selling for well over 100 a bag 
charles s johnson senior vice president for the companys north 
american operations said in a prepared statement 
based on the average increase announced a farmer would spend 
about 220 more next spring than last for each 100 acres planted if 
he used a pioneer variety that is designed to seed 34 acres per bag 
pioneer seed corn is sold in packages ranging from 60000 kernels 
a bag to 110000 kernels and the company said most increases will 
range from 5 to 10 a bag 
the reason for the increase is very heavily related to the 
drought pioneer spokesman dave knau said in an interview 
the blistering summer of 1988 shriveled pioneers harvest of corn 
grown for farm seed to little more than half of what it had planned 
to grow knau said as a result the company had to plan expensive 
winter production half of it spread through the states of arizona 
california florida and texas and half in the south american 
countries of argentina and chile 
but he said pioneer believes the increase will be curbed somewhat 
because the outlook for the winter harvest is good and because it 
was able to carry over unsold seed corn from previous harvests 
equivalent to 57 percent of last springs sales 
johnson said the company is projecting that nearly onefourth of 
its supply for next spring will be in five new hybrids that 
demonstrated a strong performance advantage over the competition 
this past growing season even with the drought those hybrids are 
designated 3751 3585 3379 3343 and 3140 
meantime pioneer and others are forecasting stepped up sales for 
1989 plantings because the government in response to drought damage 
suffered by farmers will not require corn growers to leave as much 
land idle as they did this year to qualify for federal subsidies 
knau said the prices for 1989 seed were announced a few weeks 
later than usual because company officials had to factor in winter 
production he also said the company may slightly reduce 1989 
spending on advertising or on premium giveaways to promote sales 
such as caps and jackets 
but he said the company will continue offering discounts of 1 
percent to 14 percent based on the dollar volume of sales and 
discounts ranging from 2 percent to 7 percent for orders paid for in 
advance

automakers sold 8 percent more cars and light 
trucks in the united states last month than in october 1987 partly 
because of the stock market crash and partly because of lighter than 
normal sales in the yearearlier month 
us and foreign automakers on thursday reported selling 
1215402 vehicles during october of this year compared with 
1169067 a year earlier the percentage change is based on daily 
sales rates because there were 26 sales days in october this year 
and 27 during the month last year 
weak sales of foreignmade cars and light trucks were more than 
offset in october by strong sales of usmade cars and especially 
tucks 
auto sales like the rest of the economy slowed immediately 
after the oct 19 1987 stock market crash as consumers held off on 
bigticket purchases but over time the crash proved to have little 
if any effect on car sales the 1988 model year ended sept 30 was 
the thirdbest on record 
also coloring sales comparisons were consumers reactions to 
dealer incentives 
during august and september 1987 automakers offered big cash 
rebates or low financing to lure buyers into showrooms but those 
incentives ended sept 30 1987 and some consumers who planned to 
buy cars in october accelerated their plans to take advantage of the 
deals 
the effects of the crash and lackluster buying last year were 
most noticeable in comparing sales during the oct 2131 period with 
the entire month for both years 
in late october general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp reported car sales rose 61 percent on a daily 
basis with a total of 187249 sold during the period this year and 
196015 during the same time last year 
but for the month which takes into account sales before the 
crash sales for the big three jumped 175 percent to 542373 cars 
last month from 479176 in october last year 
consumers essentially sat out the latter part of october and 
early november last year in everything not just autos said 
auto analyst jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san 
francisco 
tom webb a senior economist with the national automobile dealers 
association outside washington said the sales swings resulted less 
from the crash than from depressed purchasing during october of last 
year compared with the same month this year 
last years real depressed sales during the 10day period was 
more of a payback he said from accelerated buying in august and 
september of 1987 but he acknowledged that the crash damaged 
consumer confidence for a short time 
during late october us automakes sold 79 percent more cars 
and light trucks compared with the same period last year 
domestic manufacturers sold 334237 cars and light trucks 
compared with 344190 during the same time last year the comparison 
is based on a daily selling rate and there were nine selling days 
in this years period and 10 last year 
ford reported that during late october it sold 61883 cars up 
156 percent from the 59502 cars it sold during the sae period in 
1987 the nations no 2 automaker said its monthly sales rose 293 
percent to 179903 cars last month from 144499 during october last 
year

pillsbury cos board of directors held an 
allday meeting but the food and restaurant giant was silent about 
how it would counter a 523 billion takeover bid from britains 
grand metropolitan plc 
johnny thompson vice president of public relations would not 
disclose where the board met for its regularly scheduled meeting 
thursday but said at 530 pm it had adjourned 
on oct 17 pillsburys board rejected as inadequate grand mets 
60ashare allcash tender offer but the food company has not 
offered shareholders an alternative and has not met with grand met 
officials to discuss the offer which its suitor has said is 
negotiable 
pillsbury chairman philip smith said oct 18 an alternative to 
the tender offer would be announced before shareholders are required 
to decide whether to sell to grand met the offer expires tuesday 
but grand met could extend the offer for a second time the original 
expiration date was nov 1 
some analysts and investors said the company planned to announce 
a recapitalization plan today to try to beat grand mets offer or 
prompt the british company to increase its price 
grand met a british distiller and consumer products company 
intends to start buying pillsbury shares tuesday 
i expect to hear them coming out with a plan to shareholders 
friday said stephen carnes of piper jaffray amp hopwood inc 
pillsbury management told shareholders theyll give them adequate 
time to decide between grand mets offer and whatever plan pillsbury 
develops carnes said 
pillsburys stock dropped 62 cents thursday to close at 6082 
per share on the new york stock exchange as speculators continued 
to anticipate a richer offer the stock was selling for about 37 
per share before grand met made its offer 
pillsbury and its four new york investment bankers have been 
talking to bankers other potential financiers and other parties 
about possible deals 
i think thats why we havent heard anything said craig 
carver of dain bosworth inc if four of the wall street wizards 
cant come up with something there aint nothing 
smith has said management was instructed by the board to pursue 
alternatives including a dividend to shareholders a leveraged 
buyout or the acquisition of pillsbury by a third party in a 
filing with the securities and exchange commission pillsbury also 
said it would consider buying shares of grand met stock as a defense 
against the takeover bid which was launched oct 4 
a group of dissident shareholders is suing to force pillsbury to 
negotiate the tender offer with grand met or come up with an 
alternative of equal or greater value 
hennepin county district court judge thomas carey on wednesday 
granted a request by the dissident group that all shareholders of 
record as of oct 17 be represented as a class in the lawsuit

overall sales again were sluggish in october for the nations 
largest general retailers but apparel lines continued the recovery 
they began in september 
sales for the month were good obviously it was led by 
apparel said monroe h greenstein a retail industry analyst with 
the investment firm bear stearns amp co inc 
however greenstein said thursday octobers results looked 
better than they really were because they were being compared 
against the very weak sales of october 1987 
jeffrey feiner a merrill lynch amp co analyst said we still 
characterize the overall retail environment as somewhat sluggish and 
dont expect any significant improvement going into this important 
christmas selling season 
but walter loeb of morgan stanley amp co saw cause for optimism 
i dont see any reason to compare the sales with last year 
because most of the weakness in october 1987 came in the week 
following the stock market crash he said 
i think christmas will be quite substantial loeb said 
analysts and retailers reported improvement in apparel sales 
which have been in a slump since august of last year because of 
customer reluctance to buy shorter skirts and clothes they felt were 
boring clothing sales had shown some signs of life in september 
boosting hopes that a recovery finally was under way 
limited inc a leading specialty apparel retailer reported its 
overall october sales rose 20 percent while sales at stores open at 
least a year known as samestore sales rose 15 percent 
were starting to see some pickup at the rest of the apparel 
retailers said fred wintzer an analyst with alex brown amp sons 
inc in baltimore 
beyond fashion troubles retailers in general have suffered 
through sluggish sales for more than a year and a half as consumers 
paid more for necessities and services and tried to pay down their 
high debt levels 
several retailers again reported sales gains well under the rate 
of inflation which has increased by 45 percent so far this year 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co which 
earlier this week announced a restructuring and overhaul of its 
selling strategy said its overall sales were up 75 percent last 
month and 59 percent for the first 39 weeks of the fiscal year 
sears samestore sales rose 25 percent in october and 2 percent 
for the year so far 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate yardstick of a companys performance than figures that 
include sales from new stores but not all retailers report both 
overall and samestore results 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 58 percent in october 
and 57 percent for the first 39 weeks of the year the companys 
samestore sales rose 18 for the month and 2 percent for the year 
to date 
walmart stores inc reported its overall sales were up 24 
percent last month and 29 percent so far this year its samestore 
sales were up 9 percent for the month and 11 percent for the year to 
date 
jc penney co inc said its overall sales rose 81 percent last 
month and 04 percent for the year so far its samestore sales 
were up 69 percent in october but fell 07 percent over the 39 
weeks 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales rose 88 percent last 
month and 16 percent for the 39week period samestore sales were 
up 1 percent in october and 17 percent for the year to date 
may department stores co reported a 228 percent jump in overall 
sales in october and a 154 percent rise so far this year mays 
samestore sales were up 37 percent last month and 18 percent for 
the year to date 
montgomery ward amp co reported a 32 percent rise in october 
sales and a 31 pickup during the 39week period 
fw woolworth co said its overall october sales rose 117 
percent while yeartodate sales improved 121 percent woolworths 
samestore sales were up 57 percent for the month and 59 percent 
so far this year 
the results reported thursday were from the biggest general 
merchandise and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail sales 
figures released by the federal government they do not include 
sales at auto dealers supermarkets or restaurants

just as a biological virus disrupts living cells to cause 
disease a computer virus invades data processors and disrupts 
normal operation of the machines 
biological viruses are pieces of the hereditary code that take 
over a cells machinery to trick it into making thousands of 
duplicates of the original virus that spread from cell to cell 
viruses cause diseases such as aids 
in a similar fashion a computer virus is a computer program that 
carries in its code instructions for replicating itself perfectly 
once it invades a computer the virus temporarily takes control 
of the operating system which is the master program that allows the 
computer to run other programs such as wordprocessing software 
the virus spreads into other programs in the computer and spreads 
from one computer to the next as users give each other floppy disks 
or link up over telephone lines 
some viruses are created by pranksters and do no more than 
deliver a message to an unsuspecting user others can wipe out 
stored data and slow or damage a computers hardware

a proposed 19 billion merger between san diego 
gas amp electric co and tucson electric power co was called off in 
the best interests of the respective companies the utilities 
announced jointly 
officials from both firms said thursday the deal was terminated 
because they could not agree on an approach to defeat efforts by 
southern california edison corp to block the merger 
sce a holding company for the southern california edison co 
utility made a 22 billion hostile bid for sdgampe last month the 
offer was contingent on the san diego utility not acquiring the 
arizona utility 
these issues led the boards of directors of tep and sdgampe to 
conclude that it was in the best interests of the respective 
companies and their stockholders employees and customers to 
terminate the merger agreement sdgampe spokesman fred vaughn said 
under the terminated agreement sdgampe and tep would have 
exchanged stock leaving sdgampe the surviving company

wall street already has cast its vote for george 
bush 
but the anticipated victory of its favored candidate doesnt seem 
likely to set off any raucous celebrations in the stock market in 
fact many analysts say a bush win in tuesdays presidential 
election could bring a mild downturn on wednesday 
the market has been anticipating a bush victory for quite some 
time now and has calculated that event into its thinking that sets 
up a classic case of buy the rumor then sell the fact after the 
election if the vice president wins 
whats factored into the market is that bush will win said 
monte gordon vice president and director of research at dreyfus 
corp 
investors who bought stocks earlier on the assumption of a 
republican victory will sell and take their profits on postelection 
wednesday under this scenario 
in addition the market could be hit by the realization that bush 
isnt going to create a miracle in 24 hours and the economys 
still got problems suggested bill raftery a stock analyst for 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
the selloff isnt expected to be massive and some market 
watchers even anticipate a rally 
in the event that michael dukakis wins on the other hand the 
market could be shaken more severely 
wall street sees dukakis among other things as a bigspending 
liberal democrat and someone who would be prone to raise taxes one 
of the markets biggest bugaboos 
the investment community views bush as an extension of reagan 
and reagan was considered healthy for the market said philip 
puccio a senior vice president at dillon read amp co 
a dukakis white house by contrast would be expected to pursue 
economic policies similar to those of the carter administration 
puccio added wall street was no fan of jimmy carter 
while it sees bush as a safe bet the market doesnt believe he 
has the election completely sewn up thats why trading stalled last 
week and volume on the new york stock exchange slowed to a trickle 
amid uncertainty ahead of the election 
you dont have to scratch hard to find preelection jitters under 
the markets surface 
on oct 19 the oneyear anniversary of last years stock 
collapse the market was knocked off a postcrash high by a rumor 
that the washington post was about to publish a story potentially 
damaging to bushs campaign the post denied it but traders who had 
made profits in the markets earlier rise were primed to sell and 
they did 
the market dislikes uncertainty almost as much as it hates 
taxes

soybean futures prices surged at todays opening 
on the chicago board of trade on news of a large unexpected export 
sale of soybeans and soybean meal but later turned mixed 
grain futures also opened higher but then turned mostly lower in 
early trading 
the markets were surprised by the agriculture departments 
announcement late thursday that the soviet union had purchased 
535000 metric tons of us soybeans and that another 540000 metric 
tons of soybeans and soymeal had been sold to undisclosed 
destinations analysts said 
rumors of such large export sales usually reach the futures 
markets before the sales are officially confirmed 
we didnt see a whole lot of commercial trade yesterday and in 
light of that it was somewhat surprising to see this type of deal 
made said walter spilka grain market analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york 
trading activity was much lighter in the grain markets where 
there was little news to sway prices he said 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 414 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 279 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 220 a bushel

researchers today tried to trace a virus that infected 
computer systems nationwide slowing machines in universities a 
nasa and nuclear weapons lab and other federal research centers 
linked by a defense department computer network 
by thursday night the virus had infected hundreds of computers 
on what one expert said was the largest scale ever authorities said 
the virus apparently destroyed no data but temporarily halted some 
research 
the new york times reported today that an anonymous caller to the 
newspaper claimed that a graduate student had created the virus as a 
harmless experiment and became terrified of the consequences when it 
got out of hand 
viruses are tiny programs introduced to computers either as a 
prank or vandalism they can attach themselves to other programs and 
spread through shared software or electronic mail systems that 
link computers 
mild viruses may flash a message on a users screen while 
deadly forms can destroy data or cripple a computer this virus 
apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself thereby 
slowing computers processing speed and taking up their memory space 
many research centers shut down their computers thursday in an 
effort to purge the rapidly spreading virus but not all experts 
were confident they had eliminated the program which could linger 
in electronic mailboxes in the past antidote programs have 
been developed to seek out and destroy viruses 
the very scary thing is that this is a very sophisticated 
computer program and shutting them down may not be enough said 
richard leblanc associate professor in georgia techs school of 
computer sciences 
at lawrence laboratory in berkeley calif computer scientists 
noticed their computers operating very slowly wednesday afternoon 
they turned off the machines flipped them back on again and 
within 30 seconds the virus was spreading again said lynn yarras a 
spokesman at the research center 
the computer problem also was discovered late wednesday at the 
lawrence livermore national laboratory in livermore calif the 
laboratorys work includes design of the nations nuclear weapons 
and key work on the strategic defense initiative or star wars 
program 
however spokesman jeff garberson said the virus affected the 
unclassified nonsecured computer systems and not the classified 
national defense system 
at the los alamos nm national laboratory the virus infected 
only unclassified computers said spokeswoman barbara mulkin 
computer experts at the lab were analyzing the situation to 
determine what damage might have occurred and to find a cure ms 
mulkin said that might take a day 
at stanford university in palo alto calif the virus was 
mainly just slowing down systems and slowing data said bob 
beyers a school spokesman 
the developer was clearly a very high order hacker or 
computer buff said john mcafee chairman of the computer virus 
industry association in santa clara calif 
he used a flaw in the operating systems of these computers to 
enter the electronic mail system of arpanet a computer network 
established by the defense advanced research projects agency the 
research arm of the us defense department mcafee said 
arpanet links nearly every university in the united states 
allowing researchers to communicate data and text very easily 
said bob finn a spokesman for the california institute of 
technology 
the virus also infected a network called science internet that 
serves many scientists and research labs including nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif said jpl spokesman jim 
wilson 
also attacked were computers at harvard university boston 
university purdue university the university of wisconsin in 
madison georgia tech the massachusetts institute of technology and 
other major research centers 
the times reported today that the anonymous caller to the paper 
said his associate was responsible for the attack and had meant it 
to be harmless the caller said the hacker was a graduate student 
who made a programming error in designing the virus causing the 
program to replicate much faster than expected 
the caller said the student realized his error shortly after 
letting the program loose and now was terrified of the consequences 
the times said 
the defense communications agency set up an emergency center to 
deal with the virus the newspaper said but no known criminal 
investigations were under way 
in september a former fort worth texas programmer was 
convicted of planting a virus in his employers computer system in 
the first such conviction in the nation two days after the employee 
was fired the virus activated erasing 168000 company records 
charley kline senior research programer at the university of 
illinois said thursdays virus traveled between computer systems 
through a process in which computer operators usually send 
electronic mail to each other 
he said once the messages were received their coding told the 
computer to make copies of the virus the copies then sought out 
other connected computers he said 
this is the first time that i know of that it has happened on 
this scale to larger systems said kline 
whether the virus ultimately would have destroyed computer data 
wont be known until its program is more thoroughly studied mcafee 
said 
in 1986 and 1987 two brothers in pakistan who sold inexpensive 
copies of computer software let loose a virus known as the pakistani 
brain through surreptitious coding in the software 
it eventually was found in every country in the world every 
state in the union every university computer mcafee said 
at boston university associate provost john porter called 
computer viruses electronic vandalism 
its childish and infantile done with no knowledge of the 
results porter said

british publisher robert maxwells persistence in 
pursuing macmillan inc has paid off and with his success has come 
another big buyout of a us media company by foreigncontrolled 
interests 
the publishing and information services giant which spurned 
maxwells advances repeatedly since midjuly gave in thursday and 
threw its support behind his latest 251 billion takeover offer 
the move paved the way for maxwells completion of his tender 
offer 
maxwells tender offer of 9025 cash a share expired at midnight 
thursday and he said today that about 275 million of macmillans 
29 million fullydiluted shares were tendered 
in london today his maxwell communication corp plc said it 
planned a restructuring to focus more on publishing and less on 
printing following its takeover of macmillan 
maxwell communication said in a statement that it plans to sell 
bpcc britains largest commercial printing business perhaps to its 
management in addition maxwell communication said it is 
considering selling its newspaper printing business 
maxwell is to retain his privately held mirror group newspapers 
which owns the national daily mirror 
these moves represent a major strategic refocusing of our 
businesses in the publishing arena on both sides of the atlantic 
said maxwell who serves as chairman of maxwell communication 
macmillan shares closed at 9012 a share thursday up 62 cents 
in new york stock exchange trading 
maxwells acquisition is the latest example of the importance 
that european publishing companies have placed on getting into the 
lucrative american market 
for maxwell it is his biggest step yet toward his oftenrepeated 
goal of creating a global communications powerhouse 
the macmillan boards change of heart came one day after the 
delaware supreme court effectively blocked it from proceeding with 
an agreement to sell the company to an investment group led by the 
buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and macmillans senior 
management 
in a terse midafternoon announcement macmillan said its board 
had determined the maxwell offer was in the best interest of all 
shareholders and recommended that they tender their shares 
the board also said its poisonpill defense against the maxwell 
offer was inapplicable 
shortly therafter kohlberg kravis said it was dropping its 
tender offer of 9005 a share in cash and securities and wished 
maxwell and macmillan well 
macmillan became a takeover target in midmay when a group led by 
the wealthy texan robert m bass proposed a 64ashare buyout the 
companys shares were trading at about 50 a share at the time 
maxwell joined the fray in midjuly and had been embroiled since 
midseptember in a bidding war with kohlberg kravis 
maxwells top financial adviser robert s pirie of rothschild 
inc said earlier he was confident maxwell would get sufficient 
shares to secure control of the company 
he said the bass group had advised him it planned to tender to 
maxwell its 25 million shares which is about 9 percent of 
macmillans shares 
the bass group was believed to have acquired its stake for about 
60 a share giving it a 75 million profit on the investment before 
expenses 
the takeover fight included a series of rancorous courtroom 
battles but wednesdays action by the delaware supreme court gave 
maxwell the edge 
the court ruled macmillan management had unfairly tipped kohlberg 
kravis about maxwells latest offer during a bidding auction in late 
september enabling kohlberg kravis to submit a higher bid and 
obtain an option to buy four key macmillan operations for 865 
million if the merger fell through 
the court called for an injunction against the macmillan merger 
agreement with kohlberg kravis and its lockup provision on the 
sale of the four businesses 
bert boksen who follows the publishing business for raymond 
james financial corp in st petersburg fla said maxwells buyout 
effort amounted to the the first successful hostile takeover of a 
domestic publishing operation 
among recent acquisitions were the 3 billion acquisition of tv 
guide publisher triangle publications inc by rupert murdochs news 
corp pearson plcs 283 million buyout of addisonwesley 
publishing co and hachette sas 450 million takeover of grolier 
inc 
maxwell has frequently stated his intention of making maxwell 
communication corp plc into a global communications giant the 
londonbased company had revenue of about 15 billion last year 
he was thwarted two years ago in an effort to acquire harcourt 
brace jovanovich inc a floridabased textbook publisher that 
underwent a costly recapitalization plan to thwart him 
maxwell is the second largest us printer and announced plans 
last week to buy the airline guides operation of the dun amp 
bradstreet corp for 750 million 
macmillan earned 707 million on revenue of 9558 million in 
1987 
its publishing operations accounted for about 46 percent of its 
sales and 41 percent of its operating income in 1987 while 
information services such as legal databases and directories 
comprised 24 percent of sales and 40 percent of operating income 
the remainder comes from instructional reference and retail 
operations

texas air corp reported friday a net loss of 
1141 million during a third quarter that traditionally is strong 
the nations largest airline company said its loss in the three 
months ended sept 30 widened from the 728 million it lost in the 
third quarter of 1987 
thirdquarter revenue declined to 213 billion from 220 
billion a year earlier 
texas air is the parent of continental airlines and financially 
troubled eastern airlines it recently agreed to sell easterns 
profitable shuttle service to developer donald trump for 365 
million in cash 
houstonbased continental posted a thirdquarter profit of 152 
million compared with a net loss of 102 million a year earlier 
its revenue for the quarter rose to 12 billion from 11 billion 
continentals modest profit signals that financial progress 
continues to be made at the company however in view of the fact 
that the quarter is traditionally one of the companys strongest 
the results are clearly unsatisfactory texas air said in a 
statement 
miamibased eastern had a net loss of 1129 million before a 
123 million charge for dividends payable to holders of its 
preferred shares that was widened from a loss of 674 million 
before a 14 million charge for preferred dividends a year earlier 
easterns thirdquarter revenue declined to 9127 million from 
11 billion 
easterns results reflect its labor situation as well as severe 
competitive pressures on the revenue side texas air said 
however eastern also is showing marked operational improvement 
as indicated by department of transportation statistics which is a 
tribute to the outstanding performance of easterns employees during 
this difficult period 
eastern has been locked in a prolonged bitter battle with its 
unions 
in the first nine months of the year texas air had a net loss of 
4943 million widened from a loss of 2005 million in the same 
period of 1987 
texas airs ninemonth revenue was unchanged at 64 billion 
continentals results for the first nine months amounted to a net 
loss of 2163 million including an adjustment of 131 million in 
the second quarter related to its air traffic liability account 
that compares with the first nine months of 1987 when continental 
had a net loss of 1792 million 
ninemonth revenue for continental jumped to 34 billion from 
29 billion 
for the same period eastern lost 2337 million widened from a 
loss of 382 million a year earlier its ninemonth revenue fell to 
30 billion from 34 billion 
eastern also announced that it will not renew its contingency 
pilot and flight attendant replacement training program with 
continental eastern officials said there are no plans to resume the 
program which expires this month in light of expectations that a 
work stoppage is considered unlikely

chubb corp facing a classaction lawsuit by 
farmers in 10 states who say they were unfairly denied drought 
insurance has offered another 437 million in coverage to some 
farmers whose applications it had rejected this year 
the company said friday it is willing to proceed to reach a 
settlement with farmers who applied for drought insurance but were 
rejected and filed suit against chubb 
the company made the offer thursday in us district court in 
cincinnati where the lawsuit against chubb is filed 
the offer is subject to approval of judge carl b rubin who is 
presiding over the classaction lawsuit it potentially represents 
about 8000 farmers in ohio kentucky indiana tennessee illinois 
minnesota michigan missouri iowa and wisconsin 
chubb said it would be willing to reach an agreement similar to 
one proposed in minnesota in which eligible applicants would 
receive amounts equal to losses that would have been paid if an 
applicant had been a policyholder reduced by applicable premium 
amounts and any goodwill payments already made 
if such a settlement is accepted chubb said it would result in 
an aftertax charge against earnings of 13 million or 30 cents per 
share in the fourth quarter of 1988 
stanley m chesley lead lawyer for the farmers complained to 
rubin that chubb was trying to outmaneuver chesley by making 
separate offers to farmers in indiana and minnesota 
then the judge challenged them to make it available to all the 
states said lawyer janet abaray an aide to chesley 
after a recess chubb attorneys came back with the 437 million 
proposal ms abaray said the farmers lawyers will use the figure 
as a starting point for new negotiations 
she said farmers whose rain insurance claims were honored would 
get nothing more also ineligible would be farmers whose premiums 
were rejected but whose land got too much rain to qualify if they 
had had policies 
ms abaray said payments would go to farmers whose applications 
were rejected but who would have received payments as drought 
victims the payments would be made in those cases only where the 
amounts exceed the premiums and the goodwill payments already 
made by chubb to rejected applicants 
whatever settlement is reached will be shared by all of the 
members of the class she said 
chubb based in warren nj began rejecting payments in 
midyear when it said brokers sold more coverage than planned chubb 
lawyers said the company was prepared to sell about 40 million 
coverage and brokers sold more than 300 million 
chubb spokeswoman gail devlin said friday the company has made 
11 million in goodwill payments and plans no further such payments 
chubb said in an oct 17 statement that its federal insurance co 
subsidiary issued 1176 policies in seven midwestern states in the 
1988 drought insurance program extending a total of 43 million in 
policy coverage chubb said federal insurance suffered 20 million 
in losses on those policies and has paid virtually all of them to 
the policyholders

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower friday in a quiet finish to a volatile session on the chicago 
board of trade 
the markets had opened higher on strength from the soybeans 
which took off like a shot in response to the agriculture 
departments surprise announcement late thursday that the soviet 
union had purchased 535000 metric tons of us soybeans and that 
another 540000 metric tons of soybeans and soymeal had been sold to 
undisclosed destinations 
but soybean prices fell rapidly as the market absorbed the news 
grain futures also dropped 
soybeans finished mixed on strength stemming from ideas that 
additional soybean sales to the soviets would be forthcoming 
analysts said 
there does seem to be a feeling that some more business will be 
transacted said joel karlin a research analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
but traders saw little chance for large export sales of corn or 
wheat in the near future he said 
at the close wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 4 
cents lower with december at 278 a bushel oats were unchanged to 
5 cents lower with december at 217 a bushel soybeans were 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with november at 792 a bushel

higher rates was rekindled by todays unemployment figures

britains investigation of minorco sas 47 
billion takeover bid for consolidated gold fields plc makes it 
unnecessary for the united states to look into whether a merger of 
the two companies would endanger the supply of strategic minerals 
us officials said friday 
under british law minorcos bid for consolidated gold fields a 
british company lapsed on oct 25 when it was referred to the 
british monopolies and mergers commission 
that wont prevent a us investigation if there is a new 
bid treasury spokesman robert levine said 
the british government decided to investigate the offer after a 
federal judge in new york issued an injunction against the deal 
because it might violate us antitrust law 
sen robert dole rkan the republican minority leader wrote 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady on oct 25 urging an 
investigation on the ground that us national security was at risk 
i view with concern the possibility of control by the south 
african conglomerate of us gold reserves coal and other 
significant business interests dole wrote 
he added that the proposed merger would give south african 
interests a substantial percentage of the world supply of platinum 
and of feedstocks for titanium used in alloys for jet engines and 
for zirconium used in the cores of nuclear reactors 
continued access to these minerals is of vital strategic 
significance to the national security interests of the united 
states he said 
similar letters were written by at least 20 other members of 
congress 
on oct 5 consolidated gold fields and newmont mining corp asked 
president reagan for the investigation under the new trade act 
which allows him to forbid a merger that threatens national security 
consolidated gold fields owns 493 percent of newmont this 
countrys largest gold producer it also produces the titanium and 
zirconium feedstocks 
minorco based in luxembourg is controlled by the big south 
african gold and diamond mining firms anglo american corp and de 
beers consolidated mines ltd minorco already owns 296 percent of 
consolidated gold fields 
the law gives the president 30 days from the filing of the 
request to decide on an investigation those 30 days were up on 
friday 
levine said consolidated gold fields was informed of the decision 
not to investigate by a letter from stephen j canner director of 
the treasurys office of international investment 
the treasury refused to release copies of the letters

cocoa futures prices roared to threemonth highs friday on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange on panic buying amid 
speculation that the worlds leading producers were planning to 
withhold supplies from the market 
on other exchanges livestock and meat posted strong gains 
precious metals were mixed energy futures were mixed grains and 
soybeans were mostly lower and stockindex futures retreated 
cocoa for delivery in december which had hit a 13yearlow near 
1100 per metric ton in late september soared above 1400 friday 
and settled at 1403 94 above thursdays final price it was the 
highest close since aug 12 
it seems that everybody was buying the trade the 
speculators the locals everybody was buying and nobody was 
selling said arthur stevenson a cocoa market analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
analysts said two factors sparked the rally and both of them were 
related to the ivory coast the worlds largest producer and source 
of the most highly prized cocoa beans 
for much of this year the ivory coast has withheld its cocoa 
from the world market hoping to force prices higher but with the 
new crop now being harvested the west african nation was running 
out of storage space and had to find more room or sell some cocoa 
on friday a rumor surfaced that the ivory coast and at least one 
french trading firm had reached an agreement that would allow the 
ivory coast to withhold another 400000 metric tons of cocoa from 
the market stevenson said 
meanwhile the ivory coasts official newspaper reported friday 
the 11 other nations in the cocoa producers alliance a group that 
accounts for more than fourfifths of the worlds cocoa output were 
considering adopting withholding policies similar to the ivory 
coasts the alliance is scheduled to meet next week 
naturally all of this coming out on one day induced a panic 
reaction stevenson said 
live cattle and live hog futures finished strongly higher on the 
chicago mercantile exchange partially reversing thursdays sharp 
losses and continuing the volatile trading pattern of the past week 
both the cattle and pork markets are struggling between 
conflicting perceptions of their future direction said thomas 
morgan president of sterling research corp in arlington heights 
ill 
in the cattle market heavy slaughter weights and slack demand on 
the cash markets signal that prices will weaken but cattle supplies 
typically decline and prices normally rise during the three weeks 
before thanksgiving and bullish traders expect the market to follow 
that pattern morgan said 
the pork markets normally hit a seasonal low at this time of 
year he said bullish traders keep trying to pick the bottom while 
the bears see nearrecord supplies of pork bellies in cold storage 
and believe pork prices must move lower 
the choppiness of both markets signifies the level of 
uncertainty right now and the fact that there are two sides to the 
story morgan said 
live cattle settled 10 cent to 1 cent higher with december at 
7375 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 50 cent higher 
with november at 8150 cents a pound hogs were 25 cent lower to

long island lighting co shareholders 
adopted an agreement friday that would close the shoreham nuclear 
power plant and give lilco guaranteed rate increases over the next 
10 years 
after a twohour meeting the vote was announced 78 million 
sharevotes in favor of the settlement and 12 million against 
the time has come to remove the uncertainty created by the 
controversy and to look ahead lilco chairman william catacosinos 
said 
gov mario cuomo worked out the settlement with lilco as a way of 
resolving the issue of the shoreham plant a 54 billion project 
whose opening has been opposed by state and suffolk county officials 
on grounds there would be no way to evacuate that part of long 
island if nuclear accident occurred 
the plant completed in 1985 a decade late and at seven times the 
original estimated cost has been prevented from operating at full 
power because of state and county refusal to join in emergency 
evacuation planning 
recent decisions of the us supreme court and the nuclear 
regulatory commission have said a utility can impose its own 
emergency plan which would open the way for shoreham to operate 
lilcos deal with cuomo expires on nov 18 without shareholder 
and legislative approval 
cuomo said thursday the deadline may have to be extended because 
the state legislature will not convene until late this month or 
early december 
catacosinos said he would recommend the board of directors grant 
an extension on the settlement until at least dec 1 
the governor has had a tough time convincing long islands 
legislators in albany to approve the deal the long islanders 
maintain the utilitys customers cant afford the rate increases 
provided in the plan about 5 percent a year for the next 10 years 
if the agreement goes through the state power authority would 
pay 1 for shoreham and then build nonnuclear electricgenerating 
stations to supply the power that would have been produced by 
shoreham 
the deal also provides for lilco to resume paying dividends on 
its common and preferred stock the utility teetering on the edge 
of a bankruptcy filing suspended dividends in 1984 
in addition to the decade of 5 percent annual rate increases the 
deal would permit lilco to recover all remaining costs of the plant 
through electric rates over the next 40 years

computer viruses are disrupting the information 
age the same way aids has cooled the sexual revolution 
viruses strike at the promise that people can manipulate massive 
projects from their own keyboards while trading timesaving programs 
freely with friends and colleagues 
although viruses spread by pranksters and criminals have caused 
little damage so far they have the potential to wreak havoc by 
destroying data or impeding the computers that are increasingly 
important to business and government 
as a result security measures are sure to increase which will 
make computers less convenient and accessible 
the brave new world of computing i think is still becoming a 
reality but theres a need for a gatekeeper richard teneyck 
telecommunications director of the boston computer society said 
friday 
a virus that swept across the country this week temporarily 
crippled the computing centers of several major universities and 
research centers business began to return to normal friday as 
computer operators cleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying 
program 
in attempts to control viruses there will be much stricter 
limits on who can use certain programs and databases and under what 
conditions this will make it harder for people to work together in 
computer networks 
new pieces of software no matter how seemingly beneficial will 
be tested at length especially if they come from insecure sources 
certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will be 
run every time someone sits down to use a piece of software causing 
frustrating delays 
there could even be delays in everyday activities such as using a 
credit card 
in short steps to protect against computer viruses will drain 
computers of two of their most important attributes speed and 
accessibility 
what i think it does is spell the end of the userfriendly 
era teneyck said 
even with timeconsuming and expensive precautions viruses will 
remain a problem 
once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almost 
impossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has been 
eradicated said mary carol chruscicki program manager for system 
reliability work at a rome ny institute that performs studies 
for the defense department 
some people have expressed concerns that the danger of computer 
viruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computers 
were mainframes in locked glass houses operated by people in 
white coats 
ms chruscicki said she does not think that will happen 
the world of information is here and computer users dont want 
to go back to where theyre sheltered from whats out there whether 
its a lowcost product or a free product she said 
the key issue is that with proper precautions one can continue 
to live a normal existence said delbert jones of the national lan 
laboratory in reston va 
more than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelines 
drafted by the national lan laboratory that are intended to prevent 
and control viruses 
among the recommendations 
all software should be purchased from known reputable sources 
new software should be quarantined on an isolated computer for 
testing 
backup copies of all master software and computer data should 
be made at least once a month so the backups can be used if the 
current versions are corrupted by a virus 
its very much like the aids virus the best solution is 
precaution jones said 
a computer virus is a program that infects other programs by 
modifying them to include a copy of itself it can spread from one 
computer to another and alter or destroy data 
viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone 
lines or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a 
computer 
however computer viruses have been found in packaged software 
from aldus corp at one texas company a computer time bomb 
planted by a fired employee wiped out 168000 payroll records three 
years ago 
last december international business machines corp had to shut 
down its worldwide network to eradicate a multiplying piece of code 
jones said precautions will inevitably but necessarily delay 
the work done by computers 
youre going to find some hard choices having to be made 
between a users ability to produce topquality output and the costs 
of providing that user with free access teneyck said 
many of the precautions that will be put in place are long 
overdue analysts said 
even the defense department which keeps its most important 
computers locked in vaults does not seal the machines from the 
outside world said ms chruscicki of the iit research institutes 
branch in rome ny 
the problem is with these viruses while you are in the nontop 
secret mode that virus could be getting in there we dont have 
mechanisms in place to detect that she said 
she said the defense departments attempts to improve security 
were being delayed by budget cuts everyone knows what to do 
its whos going to pay for it

pressured by new unemployment data that showed surprising strength 
in the economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials lost 2454 points to end

stocks started off sharply lower in response to the governments 
report that unemployment fell to 53 percent in october the lowest 
level in 14 years as the economy created more than 300000 jobs 
the unexpectedly low jobless rate fueled concern that the economy 
could be heating up and the federal reserve could move to rein in 
inflation by nudging interest rates higher 
it was a negative surprise said michael metz an analyst for 
oppenheimer amp co 
stock prices made a quick recovery in the morning but later slid

like stocks bond prices were hurt by fears of higher interest 
rates the yield on the treasurys closely watched 30year bond 
which moves inversely to its price surged to 887 percent from 874 
percent late thursday 
earlier in the week many observers had been expecting the fed to 
keep credit policy and interest rates stable in the near future 
recent signs that the economy is slowing and inflationary pressures 
are easing would make the central bank loathe to push interest rates 
higher they believed 
but a recent slide in the dollar raised concern that the fed 
could nudge interest rates higher in order to bolster the us 
currency the dollar steadied late in the week but the fear of 
higher rates was rekindled by the unemployment figures the final 
economic report before the election

bond prices tumbled and interest rates soared 
friday after the government reported the october unemployment rate 
fell to the lowest level in more than four years 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond fell nearly 2 points or 
about 1875 per 1000 face amount 
its yield which moves inversely to its price and often is a key 
indicator of the direction of interest rates jumped to 890 percent 
from 874 percent late thursday shorterterm rates also moved 
higher 
analysts said the lowerthanexpected jobless rate and healthy 
growth of new jobs last month fueled investor concern the economy is 
not slowing down as anticipated 
its a straight forward story the market has been rallying 
precisely because the labor market for august and september were 
weaker than the economics profession suggested said maury harris 
an economist with painewebber inc 
then suddenly the economic data are revised up and now were 
talking about the economy not being as weak as everbody said it 
was he said 
analysts said prices started out lower as caution gripped the 
market in advance of the labor report then almost immediately 
after the labor departments 830 am announcement that octobers 
jobless rate fell 01 percentage point to 53 percent the lowest 
level since may 1984 a selloff began 
it was a kneejerk reaction to these employment numbers said 
marshall b front an economist at the chicago investment and 
mutualfund management firm of stein roe amp farnham they were a 
surprise to most people who felt that they would be a continuation 
of a trend toward a less robust business 
f ward mccarthy chief financial economist for merrill lynch 
capital markets inc said the credit markets were unnerved by 
numbers showing employers added 325000 new jobs last month an 
indication the manufacturing sector of the economy remains strong 
a more vibrant economy signals higher inflation which erodes the 
value of fixedincome securities such as bonds and notes higher 
inflation also suggests the federal reserve might move to tighten 
credit by raising interest rates 
now its fruitless to talk about the fed raising interest 
rates said maury harris an economist with painewebber inc the 
economy is doing well now so the fed doesnt need to ease anytime 
soon either 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues lost between 1132 point and 716 point

scientists at los alamos national 
laboratory said friday they are working on a cure for viral 
infections like the one that infiltrated research computers this 
week 
computer security experts said the virus made life inconvenient 
for researchers but did no known permanent damage and did not enter 
the labs classified computers 
computer security officer jimmy mcclary said the laboratory was 
able to identify the virus and cleanse it from the system with a 
code akin to a computer vaccine 
the most useful aspect of these sort of events is that they 
occur in an unclassified nonsensitive environment that lets us 
look at the techniques used to introduce these viruses said 
mcclary 
this weeks virus was able to infiltrate the unix operating 
system that links scientific laboratories nationwide infecting los 
alamos its sister facility lawrence livermore national laboratory 
in california and numerous other government and private research 
facilities 
this is the largest scale virus attack that i have seen that 
was distributed across the country mcclary said 
a computer virus is a program that infects other programs by 
modifying them to include a copy of itself it can spread from one 
computer to another and alter or destroy data 
viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phone 
lines or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into a 
computer 
mcclary said two main efforts are under way to guard against 
future viruses 
the first is to use computers to guard computers against 
viruses enhanced intrusion detection techiques that let you look 
for unexpected or unexplained changes in the behavior of a computer 
system he said the other approach is to develop antiviral 
code vaccines if you like to carry the analogy further that 
amount to selfexamining code so the code itself will know if 
someone makes an unauthorized change to it 
mcclary said scientists working at remote terminals all using 
the unix operating system began experiencing delays in gaining 
access to their research data late wednesday he said he believes 
the first clues occurred about an hour after the virus entered the 
computers 
los alamos and the other laboratories will analyze the virus code 
to determine its source said mcclary 
what theyll have to do is follow each path that theyre able 
to pick up at some point and go back along that path he said 
generally you can trace back we dont know yet enough about this 
one this one does a fair job of cleaning up after itself 
he said laboratory scientists disconnected the source of the 
virus from the computing system thursday morning later in the 
morning the us department of energy informed the lab a computer 
virus existed 
the virus came in through the electronic mail system by which 
scientific data is transmitted among research institutions mcclary 
said

the income 13 percent in 1990 12 percent in 1991 11 percent in 
1992 and 10 percent from 1993 to 2021 
kennedys letter said the news has sustained losses of more than 
90 million since the joa was instituted in 1966 with the herald 
owned by knightridder inc 
it was announced oct 14 that the news would close dec 31 if no 
buyer is found company officials cited declining circulation

pillsbury co appears to be using a just say 
no defense against the 523 billion takeover bid from grand 
metropolitan plc a lawyer for the british distilling and gaming 
conglomerate said friday 
pillsbury keeps saying we need more time stuart gold told 
a hearing in delaware chancery court in wilmington del that 
doesnt cut 
gold was appearing before justice william duffy who was asked to 
block pillsbury from using a corporate poison pill to defend against 
grand mets unsolicited 60ashare allcash tender offer duffy 
took the case under advisement and did not indicate when he would 
issue a ruling 
grand met has said it intends to start buying pillsbury stock on 
tuesday 
gold urged duffy to remove the poison pill defense so that 
shareholders can decide for themselves if the offer is adequate he 
said pillsburys board of directors has not been able to come up 
with an alternative after meeting four times since the offer was 
made 
he said pillsbury has exceeded by 10 days the 20day deadline 
under the williams act for a target company to respond to a tender 
offer 
pillsburys board of directors rejected the offer as 
inadequate oct 17 but has not offered an alternative to 
shareholders and has not negotiated the offer with grand met 
steven rothschild a pillsbury lawyer said the 20day deadline 
under the williams act doesnt begin until an adequate tender 
offer is on the table he also said pillsbury is not obligated to 
negotiate with grand met because the food and restaurant company is 
not for sale 
he likened grand mets argument about the williams act to a 
terrorist time bomb threat 
come to the target with a hostile offer drop a time bomb in 
the targets pocket and say you have 20 days rothschild said 
rothschild said pillsbury does not intend to drop its poison pill 
defense plan also known as a shareholders rights plan 
he did not say what alternatives to the tender offer the 
pillsbury board is considering but he said the board is carrying 
out its fiduciary responsibility to get maximum value out of the 
companys stock 
the poison pill which was adopted by pillsbury in 1986 and 
amended before grand met launched its takeover bid oct 4 would 
result in a disastrous dilution of pillsbury stock gold said 
under the poison pill defense pillsbury could issue new stock 
once grand met acquired a certain percentage of the existing stock 
the new stock could be purchased by shareholders for less than grand 
met could buy it for making the takeover more expensive 
rothschild said pillsbury is protecting its shareholders by 
keeping the poison pill in place he said outside consultants have 
told pillsburys board that the 60 price is not fair 
gold challenged the statement asking rothschild why pillsburys 
stock price hasnt escalated much higher than 60 a share on the new 
york stock exchange if it has greater value the stock traded in the 
range of 37 a share before the tender offer was announced on 
friday pillsbury closed at 6037 a share down 50 cents 
stephen oestreich a lawyer representing dissident shareholders 
at fridays hearing said shareholders ought to be in the board 
room if the directors dont think grand mets offer is worth 
negotiating 
oestreich urged pillsbury to take off the boxing gloves and 
talk to grand met about the offer which grand met has said is 
negotiable 
rothschild said that silence itself is a negotiating tool 
grand mets gold also asked the judge to enjoin pillsbury from 
challenging the takeover bid on the basis of state tiedhouse laws 
the laws prevent liquor distillers from selling alcohol at retail 
outlets 
grand met has said it would sell pillsburys fullservice 
restaurants which sell alcohol if the takeover bid is successful

a government report showing the economy created 325000 new jobs 
last month and pushed unemployment to a 14year low has unnerved the 
inflationsensitive stock and bond markets but elated republican 
presidential campaigners 
in the last major economic report before the election the labor 
department said friday the 01 percentage point drop in the jobless 
rate to 53 percent in october partly reflected the creation of 
99000 new manufacturing jobs the biggest monthly increase in that 
category since february 1984 
although department officials cautioned that the october pickup 
in factory employment was inflated by seasonal adjustments the 
report still showed payroll growth returning to the average monthly 
rate of 300000 achieved in 1986 1987 and the first seven months of 
1988 
the 53 percent jobless rate in october matched junes rate as 
the lowest since may 1974 
the future is bright and its getting brighter president 
reagan said of the figures as he was leaving the white house to 
campaign for his intended successor vice president george bush 
with only a few days before the election next tuesday nothings 
going to stop us now 
private political and economic analysts agreed some speculated 
that the figures were a significant blow to democratic nominee 
michael dukakis who has made economic weakness under the 
republicans one of his main themes 
the manufacturing employment gains plus figures in fridays job 
market report showing assembly line workers continued to work on 
average 4 hours of overtime each week suggested a strengthening 
economy that conflicted with other reports over the last few weeks 
that have indicated a slowdown 
for stock and bondholders the unemployment report was bad news 
because it suggested impending inflation that would force the

british publisher robert maxwell taking charge 
after his hardfought victory in the battle for macmillan inc says 
he plans to encourage the growth of the publishing and information 
services giant 
but at the same time maxwell said his maxwell communication 
corp planned to sell its british commercial printing operations and 
possibly sell other assets to help reduce the debt incurred in the 
buyout 
the announcement friday came just one day after macmillan gave up 
its sixmonth fight for independence and accepted maxwells takeover 
bid 
maxwell communication said the offer valued macmillan at 26 
billion and that 975 percent of macmillans shares had been 
tendered by the deadline set in its 9025 a share offer 
maxwell lost little time friday in taking charge at macmillan 
where he was elected chairman of the board replacing edward p 
evans who resigned 
evans had been part of a group led by the buyout firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co which lost out to maxwell in the bidding for 
macmillan 
maxwell told a news conference at macmillan headquarters that he 
met with macmillans senior managers to assure them he planned to 
make the company grow rather than break it up and sent letters 
making the same point to all of the companys employees 
he lamented what he said was a change in style in american 
management that has placed more emphasis on breakup values of 
companies and less on loyalty to the company and its employees 
maxwell is chairman of maxwell communication a londonbased 
printing and publishing concern that he has often said he wants to 
make one of the worlds 10 largest communications companies 
the company will focus more on publishing and less on printing 
following the macmillan deal he said 
maxwell said he plans to sell bpcc britains largest commercial 
printing business perhaps to its management he indicated it could 
attract a bid of about 600 million 
in addition maxwell said he is considering selling its british 
newspaper printing business which he said had a book value of 500 
million 
maxwell is to retain his privately held mirror group newspapers 
which owns the national daily mirror 
at the new york news conference maxwell asserted that he has no 
intention of selling any of macmillans publishing assets 
i am a publisher not a bookkeeper he said and added that 
he hoped to improve the companys system for distributing books 
compete more aggressively for bestselling works and strive for 
international publishing prominence 
maxwell said his company is still looking for possible publishing 
acquisitions but he declined to say whether they would approach the 
size of the macmillan purchase 
maxwell also recently announced plans to buy dun and bradstreet 
corps official airline guides for 750 million 
bpcc prints books consumer journals magazines documents 
packaging and labels it had an operating profit of 62 million on 
sales of about 534 million in 1987 maxwell communication said 
in addition to the newspaper printing business maxwell 
communication said it was considering disposing of three recently 
acquired printing plants in europe and the companys property 
portfolio 
the company also said it intended to sell off divisions of 
macmillan that prove peripheral to our core strategy 
macmillans interests include the katherine gibbs secretarial and 
berlitz language schools and its gumps retailing operations 
maxwell said while it was possible that these operations would be 
sold he said no decision on that issue has yet been made and each 
company will be evalauted on its own merits

an investor group led by the buyout firm 
forstmann little amp co and that includes the consumer products giant 
procter amp gamble co has emerged as a possible white knight in 
the fight for rjr nabisco inc 
forstmann little said late friday the group was considering a bid 
for the food and tobacco products company that would surpass a 207 
billion offer made by nabisco management and a competing 203 
billion bid by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts inc 
in a statement forstmann little said a special committee of the 
rjr nabisco board set up to review the offers had welcomed the 
interest of the group which also included the food companies 
ralston purina co and castle amp cooke inc and the investment firm 
goldman sachs amp co 
the statement appeared to indicate rjr nabisco was seeking a 
white knight or a friendly suitor that could outbid kohlberg 
kravis 
kohlberg kravis a leveraged buyout specialist had been expected 
to answer the 92ashare bid from rjr nabisco management by raising 
its own 90ashare offer 
on thursday kohlberg kravis withdrew a 25 billion offer for 
the publishing and information services giant macmillan inc which 
could leave the investment firm with considerable resources to mount 
a battle for rjr nabisco 
the combination of forstmann little and its partners could be 
expected to easily counter a higher kohlberg kravis bid 
each group member has indicated its intention to have a 
continuing debt or equity participation in the entire transaction 
the forstmann little statement said 
forstmann little said rjr nabisco had agreed to provide the group 
with confidential information about its finances 
there was no answer at the atlanta offices of rjr nabisco when a 
reporter called late friday to confirm the forstmann little 
statement there also was no answer at the offices of kohlberg 
kravis spokesmen 
if either of the outstanding bids or a higher bid by the 
forstmann little group is successful it would rank as the largest 
us takeover in history 
on wednesday a day before the management bid was announced the 
special committee of rjr nabiscos board seemed to be attempting to 
flush out other offers when it issued a statement saying it would 
review all other bids for the company from credible parties the 
committees chairman charles hugel already had acknowledged that 
the sale of the company was a virtual certainty 
the battle over the nations 19th largest industrial concern 
the maker of such well known brands as camel and winston cigarettes 
oreo cookies and ritz crackers began last month when company 
president f ross johnson announced he and other top managers were 
contemplating a 75ashare deal valued at about 17 billion 
kohlberg kravis countered with its own offer and said it hoped a 
deal supported by rjr nabiscos management could be worked out when 
johnsons group rebuffed the firm kohlberg kravis launched a tender 
offer directly to stockholders but still made the bid contingent on 
winning managements cooperation 
kohlberg kravis rjr nabisco and one of its financial partners in 
the managementled buyout shearson lehman hutton inc talked off 
and on over the past two weeks without success about a possible 
joint effort to buy the company 
discussions that pitted shearson chairman peter cohen against his 
onetime skiing partner henry kravis over joining forces to take 
over rjr nabisco also deteriorated 
kohlberg kravis said the management bid did not foreclose 
further discussions in the future although there could be no 
assurances that such discussions would occur 
procter amp gamble which is based in cincinnati is the nations 
17th largest industrial company with sales of 17 billion in 1987

tide cheer ivory zest and oxydol it also makes and markets head
