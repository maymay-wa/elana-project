a federal appeals judge was killed 
by a mail bomb that went off at his home saturday afternoon and his 
wife was seriously wounded authorities said 
eleventh us circuit court of appeals judge robert s vance 
58 died instantly when a package delivered to his home went off 
around 3 pm fbi spokesman chuck steinmetz said in washington 
authorities said they had no suspects or motive 
there is speculation that it is drugrelated said tom 
moore an fbi spokesman in birmingham we will review that avenue 
along with all the cases hes handled we will talk to everybody 
who might have an inkling of what happened there will be 
absolutely no pebble overlooked 
it was believed to be only the third time this century a federal 
judge has been assassinated 
attorney general dick thornburgh and fbi director william 
sessions tonight expressed outrage over the murder steinmetz 
said reading from a statement 
the judges wife helen was in serious condition at st 
vincents hospital with lacerations and internal injuries said 
hospital spokeswoman barbara traylor 
the fbi postal service investigators the us marshal and 
local authorities were investigating the blast said us attorney 
frank donaldson he added that the federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms might also become involved 
state attorney general don siegelman told staff members to 
dedicate every resource of this office to find the perpetrators 
us sen howell heflin dala said officials were greatly 
alarmed over his death and we wonder why it happened 
as a member of the 11th circuit court of appeals they heard 
many appeal cases related to drugs from miami heflin said in an 
interview from his home in tuscumbia theres speculation in that 
regard but nobody knows 
alabama supreme court justice janie shores a friend of vance 
said the slain judges colleagues assumed the blast had something 
to do with cases decided by him 
but i didnt know bob had an enemy in the world it must ave 
been a disgruntled defendant mrs shores said they handle so 
many drugrelated cases 
state democratic party chairman john baker who said he had 
known the judge for about 20 years said he couldnt imagine who 
would want to harm vance 
i can only speculate that it had something to do with cases he 
had handled or was handling on the federal bench said baker 
its been so long since hes been a lawyer that i wouldnt think 
it had to do with any of those cases 
steinmetz said sessions described the attack as an affront to 
the very strength of our democratic society our justice system 
the spokesman said thornburgh said violent acts such as that 
which occurred today are at odds with the underlying belief of our 
nation and the rule of law such acts are to be condemned 
my heart goes out to the family of judge vance who has served 
with distinction on the 11th circuit court of appeals the 
attorney general said 
gov guy hunt called the attack a cowardly thing and an 
affront against civilization against our form of government 
judge vance had a very sharp legal mind he was one of the 
leading judges in the country the governor said 
i just hope and pray the perpetrators of this crime will be 
quickly brought to justice and receive swift punishment and our 
prayers are with the family hunt said 
vance was chairman of the state democratic party from 1967 to 
1977 in 1978 president carter appointed him to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals which covers florida georgia and alabama 
heflin said vance would occupy many of the pages of the 
history of alabama for his leadership of reasoned sanity as party 
chairman during those turbulent years 
it is believed that only two other federal judges have been 
assassinated this century 
us district judge richard daronco 56 was shot and killed at 
his home in may 1988 by a former new york city police officer angry 
at daroncos dismissal of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by his 
daughter charles koster 67 killed himself after gunning down the 
judge 
district judge john h wood jr 63 was killed by a sniper 
outside his home in san antonio texas in 1979 charles voyed 
harrelson was convicted of the contract killing and is serving two 
life sentences in a texas prison el paso drug trafficker jamiel 
jimmy chagra who authorities say ordered the hit was 
convicted of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of woods 
murder and various drug charges he is serving a life sentence in a 
federal prison 
chagra had been scheduled to go on trial on drug charges before 
wood the day the judge was slain

a suspended county judge accused of 
running the rural courthouse like a fiefdom was convicted of 
bribery and official oppression saturday but acquitted of open 
lewdness and three other counts 
suspended cambria county judge joseph f okicki who rose from 
poverty to win his first judicial election 18 years ago showed no 
emotion as the verdicts were read after 16 hours of deliberations 
over two days 
okicki faces a maximum term of 26 years and 57500 in fines 
no sentencing date has been set on sentencing he will lose his 
80000ayear job and his pension 
okicki said he will appeal 
this verdict today is a sad day for the justice system in 
pennsylvania okicki said the sad day for okicki was oct 8 
1988 when he was suspended 
prosecutors said the 59yearold judge used fear and favors to 
rule the elegant 19thcentury courthouse in the foothills of the 
southern allegheny mountains in eastern pennsylvania 
okicki maintained that the charges were prompted by his feud 
with a johnstown political power broker who has family ties to the 
lieutenant governor 
the judge was convicted of six counts involving the acceptance 
of 500 from a court employee for a promotion that never came 
asking a johnstown attorney for 500 after a favorable ruling and 
demanding a favorable settlement on a bank loan 
charges included official oppression demanding property to 
secure employment criminal coercion and bribery all are felonies 
he was acquitted of charges of requiring court employees perform 
personal chores for him on county time of open lewdness for 
allegedly asking two secretaries into his office while he was 
wearing only his underwear of using inside information about an 
estate in a moneymaking scheme and of seeking a bribe from a 
johnstown stripmining company 
okicki also faces a second trial on 16 additional charges 
focusing on private business dealings no date has been set for 
that trial 
the prosecution and defense called 82 witnesses and introduced 
nearly 200 pieces of evidence testimony began nov 7 
okicki who prided himself on streamlining the countys civil 
court system was suspended by the state supreme court in june 1988 
and was indicted in march 
during two days of testimony okicki blamed his legal troubles 
on johnstown millionaire we schonek the politically influential 
fatherinlaw of lt gov mark singel 
according to okicki the millionaire was angry at him for 
encouraging schoneks brother rudolph to make a stock gift worth 
more than 200000 to st francis college in loretto 
okicki said schonek yelled threats at him about the gift in 
1987 at a johnstowncambria county airport restaurant 
schonek and singel have denied influencing the investigation 
northampton county judge richard grifo who presided over the 
sevenweek trial told the jury that the investigators motives 
were irrelevant 
okicki sat impassively through the testimony with his second 
wife sylvia at his side but he said the trial was physically 
emotionally and intellectually devastating 
on the stand okicki denied the charges as his attorney asked 
him about them one by one answering many of the allegations no 
absolutely no 
he broke down in tears once when he referred to his empty home 
following his divorce from his first wife theresa in 1986 
after unsuccessful bids for district attorneys office and 
congress okicki a democrat was elected judge in 1971 by 
defeating the endorsed democratic candidate in the primary and then 
winning the general election 
he won a retention election for a second 10year term in 1981 
and was elected president of the pennsylvania conference of trial 
court judges two years later 
okicki reached the pinnacle of his success in june 1988 by 
becoming president of the fivejudge county court but a state 
investigation into his dealings already was under way 
defense attorney richard galloway indicated that in the appeal 
he will make an issue of the trial judges refusal to declare a 
mistrial after an unusual development 
when jurors were asked to state their verdicts individually 
james c miller of johnstown said he disagreed with the other 11 
jurors on three of the six convictions although an unanimous 
verdict is required grifo rejected galloways mistrial request 
saying he didnt hear any discrepencies 
miller reached at home afterward said he agreed with the other 
jurors conclusions although it appeared to courtroom witnesses he 
had disagreed when the jury was polled 
i absolutely did he said when asked if he concurred in the 
guilty verdicts

a us soldier was fatally shot 
saturday night as he and three other american servicemen tried to 
flee a crowd of panamanian troopers and civilians a us southern 
command spokesman reported 
the panamanian defense forces said sunday that the us 
servicemen had fired several shots at the military headquarters of 
gen manuel antonio noriega wounding three panamanians including 
a soldier and a 1yearold girl us officials said the americans 
were unarmed 
us and panamanian troops went on alert after the incident the 
most serious in a series of confrontations between the two forces 
american troops in battle gear could be seen around fort clayton 
and tanks were heading toward the base several unidentified 
helicopters flew over the city shortly after midnight 
a us spokesman col ronald sconyers said four offduty 
american soldiers in civilian clothes were stopped by about 40 
civilians and five defense forces troopers as they were driving by 
military headquarters 
the spokesman said the crowd tried to pull the americans out of 
the car and as the us soldiers drove off shots were fired at the 
car wounding one of the americans he said the other us 
servicemen were not injured 
the wounded american was taken to the us militarys gorgas 
hospital where he died sconyers said he did not identify the 
victim pending notification of his relatives 
the defense forces made no mention of the american casualty in a 
statement issued at 4 am sunday 
it said a car with us license plates broke through 
checkpoints drove past the defense headquarters and fired several 
shots at it wounding three panamanians the 1yearold elin 
bethancourt was wounded in the left arm the defense forces said 
lt col arnulfo castrejon the duty officer at the time called 
the incident a provocation against the life and property of our 
people 
civilians said panamanian troopers condoned off the area 
surrounding the defense forces headquarters 
the television channel of the us southern command announced 
that a delta alert was in effect restricting us military 
personnel to their bases that alert was ordered during the october 
revolt by a small group of defense forces personnel 
since may there have been several confrontations between 
panamanian and us forces in panama that included shouting 
matches but no shooting 
a noriegaorganized paramilitary force the dignity battalions 
have demonstrated and tried to block recent us maneuvers in a 
recent letter the us high command told the panamanian military 
that any action against us personnel would be considered an 
action by the defense forces 
a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
noriega who was declared panamas chief of government friday was 
in the western province of chiriqui late saturday 
in appointing noriega chief executive the rubberstamp 
legislature said the action was necessary because panama was in a 
state of war with the united states it based the stateofwar 
declaration on severe ecnomic sanctions imposed on panama in an 
effort to force noriega to step down 
noriega had been panamas de facto ruler as defense forces chief 
the general who is under indictment on drugtrafficking charges 
in the united states thwarted an oct 3 coup attempt when loyal 
troops came to his support after he was trapped and held hostage by 
the rebels for several hours 
at least 10 of the rebellious officers and soldiers who launched 
the october coup were killed either in fighting or after they 
surrendered 
noriega has denied the us drug charges and says washingtons 
efforts to oust him are an attempt to avoid complying with the 1977 
panama canal treaties the accords turn the waterway over to panama 
at the end of the century 
after the october coup he claimed the united states was behind 
the revolt but washington denied that some of the 12000 american 
troops stationed in panama had blocked streets near defense forces 
headquarters but they did not become engaged in the conflict

the mayor of this northeastern ohio city 
has been using city stationery to wage a religious battle against 
pornography a tactic critics say violates the principle of 
separation of church and state 
mayor donald j kainrad is a 37yearold roman catholic and a 
selfdescribed bornagain christian who was elected in 1983 he 
also heads a local citizens group against pornography and has 
been sending letters to a national convenience store chain seeking 
the removal of playboy penthouse and other adult magazines from 
four city stores 
god cannot and will not bless the dairy mart corporation or 
other businesses that willfully violate his commandment kainrad 
wrote in a sept 28 letter to charles nirenberg chairman of 
enfield connbased dairy mart convenience stores inc 
nirenberg wrote back informing kainrad that a statewide survey 
of people entering dairy mart stores showed they overwhelmingly 
supported customers rights to buy the magazines 
the debate intensified after nirenberg forwarded kainrads 
letters to simon porteous amp associates inc of great barrington 
mass the nonprofit company publishes the freedom writer a 
nationwide 21000circulation newsletter that describes itself as 
the national newsletter that defends the separation of church and 
state 
the newsletters publisher skipp porteous a former pentecostal 
minister threatened kainrad with a federal lawsuit if kainrad 
continued to use city stationery for his antipornography campaign 
hes using his elected position to endorse a religion a 
number of supreme court decisions say its a clear violation of 
church and state said porteous who said he founded the 
newsletter after his christian zeal ebbed and he became worried 
over fundamentalist christians putting the bible above the bill 
of rights 
kainrad said in an interview last week that he will stop using 
city stationery to write to dairy mart and has asked citizens for 
decency in portage county of which he is chairman to print 
stationery 
however he added i have a very strong personal relationship 
with god with jesus christ if someone asks me what i think of 
pornography i will respond on city stationery 
as mayor ill continue to address my office as a christian 
kainrad said there is not a separation of church and state i 
dont believe that 
kainrad who displays the 23rd psalm on his desk waved a batch 
of letters he said were from supporters and said he has received 
numerous phone calls as well 
the mayor also said he similarly wrote revco another national 
drugstore chain a few years ago the chain was one of several that 
withdrew adult magazines from its stores in 1986 after 
letterwriting campaigns from religious and antipornography groups 
city councilman eric hellekson said kainrads mixing of his 
personal views with his role as a mayor could set a bad precedent 
for this quiet rural town of 12000 that lies just beyond akrons 
outer suburbs heading toward amish country 
my concern is the use of city facilities to support a group 
not backed by the city hellekson said the argument i have is 
the use of city personnel making copies of letters we dont know 
if hes been doing a lot of copies and mailing them out around the 
country 
at the dairy mart on main street cashier robin mcelhiney 19 
said of selling adult magazines the people who buy them are 
responsible if somebody looks too young we wont sell it 
porteous said kainrads remarks that he will use noncity 
stationery for future mailings is enough for him to drop his plans 
for a lawsuit he intends to feature the issue in the next edition 
of freedom writer 
however porteous said he will monitor kainrad in november when 
the mayor traditionally declares thanksgiving week bible week 
ive made a note in my 1990 appointment book so we can head 
him off at the pass porteous said

antiwestern radicals have won several 
parliamentary seats in special elections strengthening hardline 
opposition to president hashemi rafsanjanis policy of economic 
reform 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
reported late saturday that former foreign minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi a middleranking cleric took 225570 votes in polling 
to win from a tehran district 
another hardline cleric hojatoleslam movahedi kermani also 
was elected friday in tehran with 287921 votes irna reported 
diplomats said the midterm elections were seen as a test for 
rafsanjanis policies 
sixtyfour candidates ran in the elections called to fill nine 
vacant seats in the 270member parliament irans official media 
reported a heavy turnout but gave no overall figures 
most of the seats were left empty when rafsanjani appointed 
legislators to his cabinet following his election july 28 
tehran radio said four other candidates including lesserknown 
radicals won seats in provincial centers 
the state radio also monitored in nicosia said no candidate 
won a majority in two other tehran districts and the provincial 
bandar turkman constituency so a second round of voting will be 
held 
the frontrunners for the remaining tehran seats are all 
radicals former commerce minister habibollah asgarowladi former 
labor minister aboloasem sarhadizadeh and former posts and 
telegraphs minister morteza nabavi 
mohtashemis election marked a comeback for the 43yearold 
islamic fundamentalist who has close links with proiranian 
militants holding western hostages in lebanon 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists dumped 
mohtashemi and other hardliners in august when he formed a 
cabinet dominated by technocrats designed to revitalize irans 
economy following last years ceasefire in the eightyear war with 
iraq 
mohtashemi is allied with ahmad khomeini son of the late 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and considered a 
focal point for the radicals espousing the ayatollahs ideological 
legacy 
the hardliners oppose rafsanjanis moves to improve irans 
relations with the west to acquire badly needed investment to help 
the postwar economy 
they contend his policies move too far from the fundamentalist 
principles that form the bedrock of the 1979 islamic revolution 
rafsanjani while no less committed to the revolution than his 
rivals believes iran cannot afford to remain isolated and that its 
55 million people have had enough hardship after a decade of 
turmoil and war 
radicals already dominate the majlis and their gains are likely 
to further inhibit rafsanjanis room for maneuver between guiding 
iran into a more open prosperous era while preserving islamic 
principles

the democratic revolution sweeping eastern

had the satisfaction of seeing their hardline neighbors finally 
following in their footsteps 
in a few tumultuous weeks east germany czechoslovakia and 
bulgaria have all seen the birth of mass civic opposition movements 
demanding pluralism abandonment of the leading role of the 
communist party and free elections 
for poland all those things were old hat they were won in the 
independent solidarity movements decadelong struggle first in 
the 1980 shipyard strikes through the long winter of the 
martiallaw period and then in the triumphant years of 198889 when 
the movement was reborn handily won parliamentary elections and 
took control of the government 
cribbing from poland one newspaper headline crowed last 
week about events in east germany and czechoslovakia 
we have gone the farthest and without the fireworks 
solidarity leader lech walesa said 
while much of the world may credit mikhail s gorbachev with 
sparking the reform movement in the soviet unions former 
satellites poles generally ask would there have been gorbachev 
without walesa first 
even polands communist party a minor partner in a 
solidarityled coalition government after it couldnt form a 
parliamentary majority of its own is patting itself on the back 
we decided a year ago that all the processes would be managed 
in an evolutionary way party spokesman jan bisztyga said in 
the other countries there was no such logical decision by the 
establishments 
amid the joy there has been the occasional discordant voice 
worrying that poland might be overtaken by its neighbors in the 
race for reforms or elbowed to the sidelines as others seek aid 
from the west 
for instance the polish parliament still has not removed the 
clause in the constitution granting the leading role to the 
communist party with parliamentary leaders saying that clause is 
obviously moot at the moment but economic issues are more pressing 
zdzislaw najder a sociologist close to solidarity noted in the 
government newspaper that other countries are overtaking poland in 
this aspect of constitutional reform 
faced with this new situation shouldnt we perhaps reconsider 
another acceleration of institutional reforms in this country this 
is not just a matter of winning the race for priority claims this 
is a question of installing a sound political system and of our 
international prestige he said 
for poles the current situation is fraught with irony 
normally known as the most restive country in eastern europe 
poland has been an island of tranquility this autumn while its 
previously staid neighbors in east germany and czechoslovakia were 
packing public squares by the hundreds of thousands 
we poles constant rebels as we were thought of the world 
over are the prop of stability in eastern and central europe 
today government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska declared 
at a news conference 
and the polish transition to democracy this year was achieved 
more through hard dull negotiating and grassroots political work 
than through mass rallies dramatic gestures or ultimatums 
instead of a huge wave of euphoria sweeping poland after the 
installation of a solidarity government in september activists 
barely stopped to celebrate before getting down to the serious work 
of reforming the moribund economy and rebuilding democratic 
institutions after 45 years of oneparty rule 
but with the possible exception of the rise of populism in east 
germany which has been accompanied by reports of antipolish 
discrimination and has awakened fears of german reunification and 
expansionism poles express paternal pride in the developments 
elsewhere in the region 
adam michnik editor of the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta 
wyborcza recalled the appeal issued at the solidarity trade union 
congress in 1981 urging the other peoples of eastern europe to rise 
up 
at the time it was said even by union sympathizers that 
solidarity had gone too far and was inviting soviet intervention 
but in his recent travels around eastern europe michnik told a 
gathering of solidarity activists he is surprised at how widely 
that appeal is still remembered 
sometimes actions which seem pragmatically unwise in the short 
term bear fruit in the long term in great moral and political 
capital he said 
michnik said the model created by solidarity of demanding 
independence while eschewing violence or retribution has been 
widely emulated 
in this sense solidaritys path has become the path of the 
most enlightened and best democratic forces in central and eastern 
europe he said

four months after a hollywood 
executive and his wife were slain in their mansion the motive is 
unclear although police say they suspect the shootings were 
message murders 
relatives have maintained that jose enrique menendez 
harddriving chairman of live entertainment inc was killed for a 
reason related to his video and music distribution business 
nothing was stolen from the spanishstyle 5 million home 
there were no signs the killers forced their way in no clues were 
left at the scene the couple were killed the night of aug 20 by 
multiple shotgun blasts at close range their sons said they found 
the bodies after a night out 
police say they are continuing to investigate possible mob links 
to the death of menendez 45 and his wife mary louise kitty 
menendez 44 but detectives have pursued many other angles 
including questioning the menendez couples sons erik 19 and 
lyle 21 about the night of the deaths 
the sons did not reply to an interview request relayed by 
probate lawyer stephen b goldberg 
police also are looking into the disappearance of an apparent 
reference to menendezs plans to write a new will 
under terms of the parents 9yearold wills the sons will 
share a 10 million estate that goldberg estimates will exceed 5 
million after debts and taxes are paid next summer if all goes 
smoothly 
they also were beneficiaries of a 400000 life insurance policy 
goldberg said he tried to determine a few weeks ago whether the 
boys had been ruled out as suspects but the answer was 
inconclusive the only thing i have been able to confirm is that 
there are no prime suspects goldberg said last week 
police wont rule out anybody or anything at least not 
publicly a 25000 reward posted by family friends had brought in 
some leads police said 
there has been no specific motive determined said lt 
robert curtis a spokesman for the department its fair to say 
some progress has been made but thats about all i can say 
he refused to comment on the disappearance of an apparent 
reference to a new will in the menendez home computer 
family members speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
relative tried to read a computer file named will after the 
murders but was unable to do so before a computer expert was 
brought in the file disappeared 
the relatives would not say who could have erased the file 
no new will has been found the family and goldberg say they are 
convinced none was made although menendez had discussed drawing 
one up to replace the wills made in 1980 in new jersey when he was 
far less wealthy 
menendez had little money when his parents sent him out of cuba 
after castro took power smart and a perfectionist he was an 
executive for rca and hertz before joining live entertainment 
companies operated by live had been linked to organized crime 
and pornography before live bought them but company officials have 
vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link 
curtis said that was still considered possible and menendezs 
sister marta menendezcano of west palm beach fla said not long 
after the slayings that the family blamed organized crime 
we think he made the mistake of buying a business that had 
been used before by the mafia and we think he was trying to run it 
straight she said 
richard stavin former head of a federal task force into 
organized crimes influence in hollywood noted that vast amounts 
of money are at stake in the booming video business and said 
its conceivable that this could be a mob hit 
meanwhile the family says the sons have tried to get on with 
their lives talented tennis players they practice obsessively 
nowadays and talk of getting into the real estate business its 
unclear if lyle will return to princeton university in january

us corporations are skimming billions of 
dollars from their employees pension programs to finance buyouts 
ward off takeovers or simply pocket the profits 
these reversions legal under a 1974 law face growing 
criticism amid warnings that parts of the nations 2 trillion 
private pension system are on shaky ground and could eventually 
force a massive taxpayer bailout 
big business backed by the bush administration argues that the 
pension raids only involve surplus money most of it supplied by 
the employer in the first place some unions and workers however 
say they are being robbed of money that is rightfully theirs 
corporate raiders taking hundreds of millions of dollars in a 
single reversion have attracted most of the attention but big 
business isnt alone in taking advantage of the law 
some 2000 companies have applications pending with the internal 
revenue service for pension reversions among them according to 
irs documents obtained by the associated press the museum of 
modern art in new york which is seeking 17 million the detroit 
athletic club seeking 842000 niagara university 500000 the 
st louis country club 736000 
the 1974 employment retirement income security act known as 
erisa allows employers to pull back the money by terminating the 
pension programs and paying off the employees usually with a lump 
sum 
industry statistics show that 25 percent of the plans are not 
replaced in many other cases the pensions are succeeded by 
programs that provide fewer benefits and even if a plan is 
restored it has been stripped of its cushion against potential 
future losses from bad investments or stock crashes 
the labor department estimates that about 80 percent of private 
pension plans contain some sort of surplus making them potential 
targets 
michael s gordon a washington pension attorney likens the 
maneuver to breaking into a piggy bank 
in order to get its mitts on what is usually a surplus the 
employer will terminate the plan not for any sound business 
reason but to help finance a takeover or ward off one gordon 
said 
that money should stay in the retiree system said james b 
foley a retired american red cross vice president whose former 
employer took an almost 100 million reversion this year 
the west german company tengelmann group recouped the money it 
used to buy great atlantic amp pacific tea co by terminating the aampp 
pension plan and netting more than 200 million on the other side 
union carbide helped thwart a takeover by gaf by pulling 500 
million from its pension plans 
exxon corp drew a record 16 billion reversion in 1986 
the governments official tally shows that since 1980 about 
2000 companies have terminated their employerpaid plans to nab 
about 26 billion and those figures do not include the far more 
numerous reversions of less than 1 million 
ten reversions of more than 1 million were completed in may and 
june of this year the irs documents show at the same time 298 
smaller ones were completed 
jeffrey mamorsky a new york pension attorney and author says 
the money is a welldeserved reward for companies large or small 
that have managed their pension programs well 
we dont live in a communist country he said theres 
nothing thats forcing employers to install the plan or keep the 
plan 
gordon who helped write the erisa law disagrees the 
attitude of the bush administration and business is totally at 
war with the interests of the beneficiaries across the united 
states he said 
sen howard metzenbaum says hes been fighting for six years to 
make it tougher for companies to skim off the excess money 
i dont think it should be legal the ohio democrat said 
im not saying any of these people are being evil i just say 
theyre being unfair 
but mark ugoretz executive director of the erisa industry 
committee argues that restrictive laws will cause employers to 
dump their plans 
ultimately you will see a complete reduction in plan 
funding ugoretz said it would weaken the retirement security 
of people in the plans it would substantially jeopardize the 
status of the pbgc 
the pension benefit guaranty corporation or pbgc is the 
federal insurer for employerpaid plans already holding a deficit 
of 15 billion the pbgc gets most of its revenues from premiums 
paid by the companies 
james b lockhart executive director of the pbgc said most of 
the deficit stems from the beleaguered steel industry but noted 
that pension funds of the major airlines are underfunded by about 
2 billion should they collapse the burden would fall on the 
federal agency 
papers obtained under the freedom of information act showed that 
delta air lines and pan american world airways are among the 
companies that have been fined by the pbgc for making late premium 
payments both have underfunded plans 
the pbgc also filed a contingency claim against eastern air 
lines to cover an estimated pension plan underfunding of 11 
billion 
the pension agency faces another threat from the dallasbased 
ltv corp the company declared bankruptcy in 1986 and saddled the 
pbgc with claims of about 23 billion for more than 108000 
employees 
ltv has since restructured and come out of bankruptcy but 
contends that the government should still have to pay its pension 
obligations 
the case is before the supreme court where a ruling in favor of 
ltv could open the door to similar maneuvers by other companies 
seeking to dump their pension obligations on taxpayers 
like the federal savings and loan insurance program the 
pension termination insurance program is in dire financial 
condition the justice department says in a legal brief backing 
the pbgcs suit

afterward in a soft unwavering voice i just went up and said i 
was the one its been hard to keep this secret i decided not to 
keep it anymore

give me a lot of stuff i just want them to know 
after showandtell last week bretts teacher nancy terry led 
the class in a health lesson that focused on aids which destroys 
the bodys defenses against disease leaving a person prey to 
lifethreatening infections and certain cancers 
bretts father steve lykins said his sons health has been 
relatively good despite the aids infection which was contracted 
from a blood transfusion received shortly after his premature 
birth his parents learned in 1987 that he had the disease and 
brett was told this year 
health experts say bretts presence in class does not endanger 
his classmates 
ms terry said bretts showandtell session was a wonderful

fiftyfive people responded to a judges 
newspaper ad that theyd be jailed for not paying child support 
unless they appeared in court 
judge stephen e levin had placed an ad in the philadelphia 
daily news a week ago listing 142 people accused of delinquency in 
child support payments the judges message appear in court friday 
or you will be jailed 
this is an experiment and i think its worked out very 
well levin during a break between cases 
the ad which cost the court 5525 listed 136 men and six 
women and offered one last opportunity to appear and work things 
out 
in addition to the 40 people in court friday 15 others had 
surrendered earlier in the week and resumed support payments 
several men waiting their turn said they had been alerted to the 
ad by friends 
when i went to cash my check the guy told me said an 
electrician who declined to give his name i couldnt believe 
they put it in the paper i felt like i had murdered somebody or 
something 
the man said he fell behind in his support payments for his 
9yearold after losing his job about two years ago and then got 
scared and took off when a bench warrant was issued for his 
arrest 
many of those waiting to be heard friday were angry and said the 
ad had embarrassed them and their families 
they printed my fathers name on the list and he is very 
embarrassed my name is joseph ciambella jr and they left off the 
junior the younger ciambella said 
im the one who hasnt paid my child support and its because 
i havent seen my son whos 5 in two years my mother and father 
have only been able to see him five times since he was born 
levin said if the ad proves to be cost effective he will run 
others 
these people are really afraid what will happen is that a lot 
of people who would have totally ignored us will pay what they owe 
in child support he said 
it is clear that there will be some people on the list who are 
not deadbeats but they will be rare exceptions he added

a chronic pilot shortage has forced 
northwest airlines to cancel hundreds of flights in recent months 
and prompted the airline to temporarily cut back its pilot training 
but the carrier says its flight cancellations are back at 
normal levels and contends its record for the 12 months before 
october was consistent with that of other major airlines 
some of the carriers pilots say postponing training could only 
aggravate the problem according to a story in sunday editions of 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch 
thats the best that can be said about it said gerald 
wallin northwests senior director of flight administration until 
midaugust its like eating your seed corn 
in october northwest canceled 707 flights for nonmechanical 
reasons 18 percent of all flights thats the worst rate among 
the 13 major carriers according to an internal us transportation 
department report obtained by the newspaper 
wallin and others called the number of halted flights 
extraordinary and said they believe cancellations at northwest 
stemming from pilot shortages have at least doubled since early 
this year the transportation department which counts canceled 
flights would not release historic data for comparison 
other major carriers facing fast industry growth have had 
similar problems with flight cancellations according to the 
transportation department figures usair cancelled 13 percent of 
its flights for nonmechanical reasons in october followed by 
united which cancelled 11 percent of its flights 
a statement from the suburban eaganbased airline acknowledged 
that cancellations were higher than normal in late october and 
early november however it said its record for the 12 months ended 
sept 30 was consistent with the performance of all other major 
airlines 
it is unfair to judge northwests flight schedule 
dependability based on only one month 
the statement also said northwest has not at any time 
canceled required faa training for its pilots 
a northwest spokesman would not elaborate on the statement 
but northwest employees past and present said the situation is 
troubling because the airline has scrapped many highrevenue 
international flights on large jetliners 
moreover the carriers new owners hope to build the airline by 
wooing new passengers with good service northwest chairman alfred 
checchi intends to double the size of the airline in the next five 
years to help reduce 31 billion in debt from his groups august 
takeover of the company 
a group led by checchi bought the nations fourth largest 
carrier for 565 billion in september checchi became northwests 
chairman when former chairman steven rothmeier and rothmeiers top 
four executives resigned 
northwests problem with cancelled flights has been building 
over several years according to pilots and former managers and 
was exacerbated by toplevel decisions during the years rothmeier 
ran the carrier 
rothmeiers group continually had a pilot shortage and they 
never hired enough pilots to meet demand said duane woerth a 
member of the master executive council of the northwest chapter of 
the air line pilots association union which represents the 
carriers 5400 pilots 
woerth and others said northwest is taking steps to remedy the 
problem in midnovember it halted all pilotadvancement training 
the company said it is continuing to train newly hired pilots

fifthgrade teacher susan nardinger is 
rallying the faithful in this river city to defend its short 
reputation which has been assaulted once again by river rats in 
lincoln city ore 
students in nardingers class touched off the battle two years 
ago when they petitioned the guinness book of world records to 
declare the 201footlong roe river northeast of great falls the 
worlds shortest river 
guinness editors agreed and the roe displaced lincoln citys d 
river in the 1988 edition of the record book 
but lincoln city was not about to be sold short 
they remeasured the d river and announced that it was 120 feet 
mysteriously smaller than the last measuring and guinness editors 
notified the lincoln city chamber of commerce recently that the d 
river would be back in the books by the 1991 edition unless a 
shorter river is found 
well thats just what students in great falls intend to do and 
theyll look no farther than the roe 
nardinger said the roe could claim a length of only 30 feet 
because it has two forks and the students submitted the longer of 
the two for consideration of the record 
i stand behind the kids 100 percent she said friday 
she dismissed the d river as an ocean water backup not a 
river at all and suggested guinness officials take a look for 
themselves 
molly peterson one of the students who helped petition on 
behalf the roe took a more philosophical approach she said the 
roe is still the shortest river but records are made to be 
broken

a 6foot alligator out for an evening 
stroll on a suburban sidewalk drew a neighborly reaction from ruben 
hernandez he tackled the meateating reptile kept it safe for its 
owner and refused to tattle 
i grabbed the tail and put a foot on the alligators back 
he said i started screaming to put the duct tape around the 
alligators mouth 
hernandez 32 said he took a few shots to the head wrestling 
the 200pound alligator when the beast whipped its powerful tail 
but he and his brotherinlaw loaded the gator into their pickup 
truck 
when the sun came up friday hernandez watched the huge reptile 
lash at a chain holding it in the truck and questioned his bravado 
of the previous night 
i could have gotten hurt he said 
hernandez said contacted the animals owner and arranged to 
return the beast he refused to identify the owner who officials 
said lacked permits to keep the exotic animal 
i cant imagine that anyone in possession of an alligator 
legally would allow it to run loose in an area where it could come 
in contact with people said eva schultz a warden for the 
california department of fish and game in long beach 
she said it is illegal to keep an alligator without a special 
permit adding that those permits are rarely issued

policymakers at the federal reserve will move 
to push interest rates lower possibly as early as this week 
private economist say 
the expected round of credit easing in response to evidence of a 
weakening economy and moderating inflation would cause a variety of 
business and consumer rates to fall the economic forecasters say 
among the rates that could drop would be the prime rate and home 
mortgage rates 
the federal open market committee is meeting monday and tuesday 
for its final strategy sessions of the year most analysts were 
looking for the fed to decide to reduce a key interest rate the 
federal funds rate by another 025 percentage point 
fed officials have more than enough evidence to justify 
another easing step before the end of the year said david jones 
chief economist of aubrey g lanston amp co it will take 
additional easing steps to guarantee that we dont go into a 
recession i think we will avoid a recession but just barely 
some analysts said the reduction could come before the week is 
out while other analysts said the rate drop might not occur before 
early january 
the federal funds rate the rate banks charge each other on 
overnight loans is the primary lever the central bank uses to 
control shortterm interest rates 
when it does fall economists were predicting that the benchmark 
prime lending rate to which onethird of all business and consumer 
loans are tied would be cut from 105 percent to 10 percent with 
another cut to 95 percent expected before summer as the fed eases 
further 
analysts were looking for mortgage rates to drop as well in 
response to the feds credit easing moves many predicted that 
fixedrate mortgages which have already fallen to a national 
average of 975 percent could fall as low as 925 percent by next 
summer 
jones and other economists point to various signs that the 
economy is passing through a period of extreme sluggishness with 
unemployment beginning to inch back up raising fears that some 
unexpected shock could spell the end of a recovery that has already 
lasted a peacetime record of seven years 
when 1989 began the central bank was in the midst of a 
yearlong effort to push interest rates higher in an effort to 
dampen demand and keep inflationary pressures in check however in 
may the fed switched course and began a series of gradual easing 
moves as signs mounted that economic growth was beginning to slow 
in response to the earlier credittightening 
inflation has eased with the slowing of growth 
on friday the government reported that wholesale prices fell in 
november for the third time in the past five months with the drop 
led by a big decline in gasoline costs 
inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank has 
a margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economic 
growth said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the bush administration has complained that the central bank has 
been too timid in its creditloosening campaign and will have to 
bear the blame if the economy does go into a nosedive 
but the consensus among most economists is that the feds dose 
of easy money has come in time to keep the country out of a 
recession 
before the fed began its gradual crediteasing moves the 
federal funds rate stood at 975 percent it is now at 85 percent 
having been reduced in a series of five 025 percentage point drops 
jones said he expected the federal funds rate would fall to 775 
percent before the fed calls a halt to its easing campaign 
but when the economy begins to rebound next summer many 
economists were looking for the fed to reverse course once more and 
begin tightening up on credit to guard against triggering higher 
inflation 
we think the economy will start accelerating in the second 
half of next year and inflation will become a little worse as labor 
costs begin to accelerate said david wyss senior financial 
economist at drimcgraw hill an economic consulting firm

the frightened faces of 
schoolboy militiamen barely in their teens peered from the windows 
of a bus commandeered by grinning warriors no older than the 
captives 
the captives and the captors were tamils from rival guerrilla 
groups that have turned on each other in their struggle for 
independence from the sri lankan government 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam took control of the village 
of iruthayapuram and nearby batticaloa after a raid tuesday in 
which as many as 100 members of the socalled tamil national army 
were killed 
the tigers leaders have put away their camouflage uniforms to 
negotiate with the government in colombo for political power and 
the raid was meant to demonstrate that they are the only tamil 
force worth reckoning with in northeastern sri lanka where most 
members of their ethnic minority live 
the sri lankan government which gave up any claims to control 
of the batticaloa district 2 years ago acknowledges it is 
virtually impotent to halt the tamil power struggle 
the tamils are going to liquidate each other said foreign 
minister ranjan wijeratne who is also the deputy defense minister 
he blamed the departing indian peacekeeping force for arming 
to the teeth the tamil national army which was created by 
proindian tamils shortly before the indians withdrew from the 
batticaloa area 
india has repeatedly denied training or arming that tamil force 
despite claims to the contrary by the sri lankan government 
families of teenagers conscripted by the militia and several 
longtime batticaloa residents 
asked what the sri lankan armed forces should do to prevent the 
tamil infighting wijeratne replied 
so do you want us to go and kill all the people we have 
deliberately restrained ourselves let good sense prevail 
sending in the sri lankan army could lead to a repeat of the 
ethnic war that prompted india to intervene in the first place 
the sri lankan government is controlled by the islands 
sinhalese majority the sinhalese make up 75 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people and according to wijeratne 99 percent of the 
army about 18 percent of the population is tamil most sinhalese 
are buddhists and most tamils are hindus but there are christians 
in each group 
it is this sinhalese domination that touched off the tamil 
separatist revolt in 1983 
the tigers and an array of other tamil militias alternately 
allying and feuding with each other demanded a separate nation 
or at least autonomy to preserve the language culture and 
economic opportunities of their people 
the guerrilla war led to terrorist attacks and massacres of 
sinhalese civilians the sri lankan military although unequipped 
for allout war responded with heavy force that included pitching 
barrels packed with explosives out of their light transport 
airplanes 
six years later at least 11000 people have died in the tamil 
revolt including 1100 of the indians who intervened at the urging 
of their own nations politically powerful tamil minority 
the indian force which started arriving july 30 1987 is now 
withdrawing it set in motion a political formula to give the 
tamils a measure of autonomy but it failed in its mission to 
disarm the tigers 
after 2 years of fighting the indians this once ragtag bunch 
of guerrillas has evolved into an experienced fighting force 
determined to deny the tamil national army or any other tamil 
rivals the right to run the provincial government in the northeast 
the armed struggle is a means to achieve a political end 
the tigers chief negotiator anton balasingham said in an 
interview in colombo we are not laying down our guns we will 
have our weapons as long as this problem is there 
in iruthayapuram a senior tiger who uses the code name 
karikalan said now we are going to restore normalcy civilian 
adminstration transportation everything 
karikalan who had a czech automatic pistol on his hip an 
italian machine gun slung over his shoulder and a spare ammunition 
clip tucked in the waistband of his camouflage pants described 
himself as the politicalwing leader of the tigers in the 
batticaloa area 
as for the frightened tamil national army members on the bus 
the 39yearold karikalan said after interrogation they will be 
released he would not say how long that might take 
after tuesdays raid in batticaloa fishermen scooped shrimp and 
crabs from the smooth blue water as young tigers patrolled the road 
in trucks and jeeps that had been driven by local government 
officials a few days earlier 
at the soboraj cinema where films are shown only during the day 
because most people prefer to stay off the streets after dark 
uncommon valor starring harrison ford was playing only 39 
people about onefifth the ususal turnout bought tickets the 
day after the tigers took the town

would lebanons real ambassador please stand 
up 
the request reflects the anomalous situation at the lebanese 
embassy where the battle for control of lebanon is being 
reenacted between loyalists of embattled christian gen michel 
aoun and supporters of newly elected lebanese president elias hrawi 
hrawi who has fired aoun from all his posts last week removed 
lebanons veteran ambassador to washington abdallah bouhabib and 
handed control of the embassy to the no 2 diplomat sleiman rassi 
on wednesday the state department said it had been informed by 
lebanons new government that bouhabib had resigned effective dec 
11 and rassi was now in charge the department said that since it 
recognizes the hrawi government as the legitimate ruler of lebanon 
it would now deal only with rassi 
so far so good 
but aoun who is holding out with 20000 troops at the 
presidential palace in beirut and refuses to recognize the hrawi 
government sent bouhabib a telex ordering him to stay put 
aoun says bouhabib is the legitimate ambassador because he 
aoun is the legitimate ruler said embassy spokesman yousef 
sayah 
so bouhabib a staunch aoun backer continues to occupy the 
ambassadors office and residence 
he argues that under foreign service regulations he is entitled 
to a twomonth transition period to put his affairs in order and 
transfer the embassy to his successor 
even from a humanitarian point of view you cant just tell 
someone who has been in office six years to just leave 
immediately said sayah 
but lebanons prime minister salim alhoss decided he could 
in recent months bouhabib had made derogatory statements about 
alhoss and the moslem leader demanded he cede his job 
immediately said lebanese sources 
bouhabib who owns a house in washington and whose wife and 
children are americans turned to his american and arab friends for 
help 
he asked ambassador clovis maksoud the envoy of the 22nation 
arab league to intercede on his behalf with alhoss 
maksoud a skilled diplomat urged the new lebanese government 
to grant bouhabib a twomonth transition and avoid public 
embarrassment said the lebanese sources 
bouhabib also controls the embassys bank accounts and has 
insisted he will retain control unless he is guaranteed a graceful 
transition they said 
then too he could be hoping that within two months aoun may 
gain control and he bouhabib could stay said one official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
all this leaves the state department in a bind 
the us embassy in beirut has been shut for several months for 
security reasons and the main channel of communications with the 
hrawi government is through its ambassador here 
we will deal with rassi said one american official adding 
were not looking to chase bouhabib out but we have to go with 
what the new government says

top pentagon officials are recommending to 
defense secretary dick cheney that us troop strength in europe 
eventually be cut in half if soviet reductions continue for several 
years the washington post reported sunday 
the newspaper said that according to defense officials familiar 
with option papers presented to cheney reducing the current force 
of 305000 us air and ground forces to 150000 would retain a 
political minimum to maintain a military presence in europe 
that reduced level would enable the united states to meet global 
responsibilities in an era of deficit reduction at home they said 
the post said the proposals recommend the united states for the 
first time consider reducing its naval commitment to defend north 
american sea lanes in order to reinforce europe from america in 
wartime 
pentagon planners also have concluded that the soviet union no 
longer can count on the armies of its east european allies to 
support it in any hostilities the story said 
senior defense officials last week presented cheney with their 
views on us armed forces for the next century during the first 
two of nine marathon sessions 
according to the post the meetings were attended by cheney 
joint chiefs of staff chairman gen colin l powell military 
service chiefs and civilian service secretaries the sessions will 
resume monday and then recess until january 
one policy paper assessing germanys future role in europe 
predicted that some form of reunification will occur within a few 
years 
the post quoted the paper as saying that we will likely face 
by the next century a europe shaped as much by german economic 
influence and military potential as by russian military presence 
meetings this week will cover options for reshaping pacific 
basin forces and strategic nuclear forces for next months 
sessions cheney has requested a senior review of the strategic 
defense initiative and space programs weapons acquisition and the 
defense industrial base

the government sunday held a meeting of 
political parties to discuss sikh separatism in punjab but the two 
main sikh parties stayed away demanding an investigation into 
alleged human rights abuses 
prime minister vp singh presided over the meeting his first 
political initiative to address sikh militants demands for an 
independent homeland in the northern farming state more than 7000 
people have died in an 8yearold separatist movement in the region 
about 40 leaders from 21 parties attended the meeting and they 
later issued a statement that was endorsed by all but one of the 
parties 
while serious efforts to find a political solution continue 
the people must be reassured that there would be no letup in the 
fight against terrorism the statement said 
former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party dissociated 
itself from the statement saying it could not be considered a 
consensus document since congress had no part in drafting it 
punjabs two main sikh parties the akali dalmann and akali 
dalbadal boycotted the meeting before discussions can be held 
they said tensions must be eased in the state and police must be 
investigated for alleged human rights violations 
akali dalmann party known to be supported by sikh extremist 
groups won nine of the states 13 parliamentary seats in last 
months general elections 
the conference condemned the daily killings in punjab but made 
only one specific recommendation repealing a law that gives the 
government broad powers to detain suspected extremists 
the law was passed by gandhis government and officials at the 
meeting said the recommendation to repeal the statute probably was 
the reason the congress party refused to endorse the joint 
statement 
congress issued a separate statement that said the government 
asked the participants to reach a consensus without stating its own 
position 
gandhi was forced to resign as prime minister after the party 
failed to maintain a majority in parliament following the general 
elections 
singh took office on dec 2 he visited sikhisms holiest 
shrine the golden temple five days later but described the visit 
as personal 
nonetheless he was the first prime minister to visit the temple 
in five years and the trip was seen as an astute move to assuage 
sikhs angered by an army raid on the shrine in june 1984 
the attack was ordered by indira gandhi the former prime 
ministers mother and predecessor to flush out sikh extremists 
entrenched inside 
she was assassinated four months later by two sikh bodyguards 
antisikh riots ensued nationwide and more than 3000 sikhs were 
killed 
militants say indias hindudominated government discriminates 
against sikhs socially and culturally and wants an independent 
homeland in punjab 
sikhs are in a slight majority in the state which borders 
pakistan nationwide they make up 2 percent of the 880 million 
people while hindus make up 80 percent of the population

president hafez assad met sunday with an 
egyptian government minister for the latest in a series of talks 
aimed at ending a 10yearold rift between the two major arab 
powers 
egyptian information minister safwat alsharif was sent by 
egypts president hosni mubarak 
alsharif became the first egyptian presidential emissary to 
visit demascus since syria broke relations with cairo in 1979 to 
protest the late president anwar sadats peace treaty with israel 
the rift between the two arab states has been a major stumbling 
block to arab unity 
assads spokesman jibran kourieh said the syrian president 
will dispatch a personal envoy to mubarak within the next few days 
he said that during the meeting with alsharif assad 
expressed syrias keenness to strengthen cooperation with egypt 
in various fields 
the egyptian envoy accompanied by senior officials of cairos 
foreign ministry delivered a letter from mubarak to assad who in 
turn gave sharif a letter to deliver to mubarak 
the contents were not disclosed but sharif said when he arrived 
at damascus airport that the rapprochement that was started when 
the two leaders met in casablanca is continuing permanently and we 
are all witnessing the positive developments between the two 
countries 
assad and mubarak met in the moroccan city in may during an arab 
summit conference they met twice in october and agreed to build 
economic ties in agriculture oil and industry 
sharif said god willing we hope to proceed forward on the 
road of common arab action and joint struggle through the mutual 
understanding between presidents mubarak and assad 
egypt was returned to the arab fold after an arab summit in 1987 
gave the green light to restoring relations with cairo since then 
most of the arab states that severed links in 1979 have resumed 
them only radical syria and libya have yet to do so formally but 
both are now moving down that road 
last week mubarak and assad agreed during a telephone 
conversation to resume direct flights between cairo and damascus by 
their national airlines 
the first egypt air jetliner to touch down in damascus in a 
decade landed tuesday carrying maj gen samir rashad egypts 
deputy transport minister 
egypt and libya restored air links in june and reopened their 
border closed since 1977 when they fought a fiveday war 
mubarak has lately been acting as a key mediator between israel 
the palestine liberation organization and other arab states in 
trying to forge a middle east peace settlement 
syria also is at odds with plo chairman yasser arafat and has 
rejected his peace initiative toward israel a move strongly backed 
by egypt

five astronauts are ready to rocket 
into orbit on a holiday voyage to capture a prized christmas 
present for eager scientists 
the treasure is a satellite the size of a small school bus that 
has orbited for nearly six years and will crash to earth in march 
if it is not corraled 
it is called ldef for long duration exposure facility and is 
packed with 57 experiments containing a wealth of scientific and 
technological information 
the astronauts are to ride the shuttle columbia into space later 
this week to track down and retrieve ldef which is 30 feet long 
14 feet in diameter and weighs 21400 pounds 
they had been scheduled for liftoff monday but lagging work at 
the launch pad last week forced a delay until thursday sources 
reported saturday the work remained behind schedule and that a new 
date possibly friday or saturday would be set monday at a meeting 
of shuttle managers 
on day 2 of the 10day mission the space travelers are to 
deploy a navy communications satellite and start several medical 
and scientific experiments as commander dan brandenstein and pilot 
jim wetherbee maneuver columbia toward their target 
they will rendezvous with ldef on day 4 5 or 6 depending on 
the time and day they lift off 
we hope that even though well be gone from our families and 
loved ones at christmas that well be able to bring back a great 
big christmas present for all the scientists who are working on 
ldef brandenstein said in an interview well celebrate 
christmas when we get back 
brandenstein will steer to within 35 feet of ldef and mission 
specialist bonnie dunbar will extend the spacecrafts 50foot robot 
arm to snare the satellite 
it will be like hunting a speck in the sky brandenstein 
said but nasa has had plenty experience doing this type of 
rendezvous and jim and i have practiced it to perfection in the 
simulator 
once dunbar has grasped the satellite she will hold it on the 
end of the arm turning it frequently for as long as five hours 
while mission specialists marsha ivins and david low photograph 
each of its exterior experiments 
some might have become so eroded or weakened by the long 
exposure to space and bombardment by micrometeoroids and atomic 
oxygen that they could fall apart during the stress of atmospheric 
reentry or a return to earths gravity dunbar explained so 
we want good documentary photos in case that happens 
then she will load ldef into the cargo bay and the astronauts 
will concentrate on experiments for the remainder of the flight 
the second longest planned so far in 33 shuttle missions 
the flight will be a stepping stone for even longer missions as 
columbia gradually is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days in 
1992 and eventually for 28 days 
scientists are eager to examine ldef to learn how various 
materials and systems have withstood the long exposure to the space 
environment information that will help in designing permanent 
space stations and other longterm spacecraft such as those planned 
for a star wars missile defense system 
ldef is invaluable to us said the missions flight 
director al pennington it is chock full of every material we 
use in space flight 
ldef has been in space nearly five years longer than it was 
supposed to 
it was launched by a shuttle crew in april 1984 and was to have 
been retrieved 10 months later but scheduling problems and the 
1986 challenger disaster delayed the rescue 
if ldef is not recovered the loss would be tremendous said 
robert m walker director of the mcdonnell center for the space 
sciences at washington university in st louis who is 
coinvestigator of one of the experiments 
we would not only lose experiments that could provide clues to 
the origin of our sun and planets but more importantly we will 
lose valuable information about the changes and damage to 
spacecraft after long exposure to the space environment 
also aboard are 125 million tomato seeds which will be 
distributed to american students in grades 5 through university 
level for research into such things as germination rates and 
genetics

film critic rex reed says he loves movies but 
thinks so much of what is produced today is horrible 
ninety percent of the films today are toxic waste he said 
on every screen youre confronted by the same girls you saw the 
night before buying yogurt and kleenex at the safeway 
reed who was born in fort worth said romance has been replaced 
with bloodsplattering violence and a lot of crude sexual 
calisthenics 
he also said moviegoers must get the idea that women today are 
whores emotional cripples or birdbrains 
reed said it isnt really a chore to review movies even though 
he doesnt think highly of many of them 
when theyre bad you dont remember them at all but at least 
you had fun for a couple hours he said so i do like movies 
and every time theres a good one it revives my faith in the movie

the argument that drugs should be legalized is 
fed by indifference to the fact that a large number of drug users 
are minorities federal antidrug coordinator william bennett said 
sunday 
i have to tell you ive heard in some circles well let them 
kill each other bennett said on the abctv program this week 
with david brinkley 
that is not worthy of the american people said bennett who 
did not say who harbored that attitude 
bennett who is director of the office of national drug control 
policy has been a vocal opponent of calls to make illicit drugs 
legal among the advocates of legalization are baltimore mayor kurt 
l schmoke who is black economist milton friedman and us 
district judge robert sweet who last week became the first federal 
judge to publicly voice such an opinion 
friedman and sweet also appeared on the show but did not 
address bennetts comments 
bennett made his remarks in response to a question by 
conservative columnist george will 
do you think if the people disproportionately killing 
themselves off were white suburban high school students there would 
be a different kind of argument going on will asked im 
asking is there a certain racial indifference in this argument 
im afraid there is bennett responded 
the drug coordinator said that neither sweet nor friedman had 
that attitude 
but he said im afraid thats in the air but these are our 
children we have to protect black or white whatever and were 
not going to protect them very well if we let this genie out of the 
bottle 
sweet and friedman said that law enforcement efforts rather 
than halting the multibillion dollar drug industry are resulting 
in wasted money 
what we have now is not working sweet said 
bennett called such arguments irresponsible nonsense

an antidrug smuggling project to 
create radar coverage along the entire usmexico border is nearly 
complete with the last two of six surveillance balloons installed 
and undergoing final tests 
unavoidable radar scrutiny will stretch from the pacific ocean 
to the gulf of mexico when the two heliumfilled aerostats begin 
full operation early in 1990 at eagle pass and rio grande city in 
southern texas officials said 
us customs directs the project and already has radarequipped 
balloons operating at yuma and fort huachuca ariz deming nm 
and marfa in west texas 
the aerostat at eagle pass southwest of san antonio probably 
will be fully deployed in two weeks said judy turner customs 
spokeswoman in houston 
radar testing probably will begin this week at the other site 
north of rio grande city in starr county said hood goodrich site 
manager with contractor general electric government services 
a rutted dirt road provides the only access to the remote 
treeless base surrounded by ranches thick with brush and cactus 
the white fishshaped 241footlong aerostat already presents 
an imposing sight hovering 50 feet above its base near rio grande 
city when placed into duty expected by the end of march it will 
rise 15000 feet on its tether and will have a 160mile tracking 
range 
for federal drug agents the aerostat system will ease the 
frustration of not knowing what flies across the border along the 
vast stretches out of the reach of fixed radar installations ms 
turner said 
we would certainly hope that it means less air smuggling that 
the traffickers will be forced to use another method or another 
route she said 
the radar balloons will track planes entering us air space and 
feed the data to the federal aviation center in riverside calif 
that gives them the information from which to launch an 
interdiction or tracking plane ms turner said 
since federal agents began a crackdown in florida several years 
ago much of the drug traffic especially cocaine is believed to 
have shifted to the mexican border 
ms turner said customs agents believe a sharp increase in drug 
seizures on the ground in arizona during the past year is related 
to the radar balloons there forcing the drug traffic out of the 
air 
customs also operates radar aerostats in florida at patrick air 
force base and cudjoe key and another at grand bahama island more 
are planned along the gulf coast

when she lived in near poverty with a young 
son romy koecher often heard east germanys communist leaders 
proclaim they were doing everything they could for the country 
now as disclosures grow about the lavish living of former 
leader erich honecker and his ousted cronies she feels deeply 
betrayed 
i always knew there were privileged layers in society says 
the 32yearold art historian but people just didnt know the 
extent of what was going on 
for years honecker manipulated the official news media to 
proclaim a phoenixlike recovery from the ashes of world war ii and 
accused the west of waiting to plunder east germany 
but according to recent revelations honecker and his friends 
were themselves plundering the country there were fancy hunting 
lodges imported foods and clothes shining volvos 
so far the allegations have hit mainly a several dozen top 
communist party members and much of the ousted leadership faces 
criminal prosecution seven former politburo members are in jail 
and honecker is under house arrest 
wandlitz the compound where the party bosses lived is being 
turned into a health center for children the compound includes an 
indoor swimming pool perfectly manicured grounds and houses that 
are the envy of the rest of the nations 163 million people 
honeckers summer retreat complete with two restaurants is 
being turned into a tourist hotel that can accommodate 50 people 
i never knew there were these mafialike organizations said 
ms koecher referring to businesses set up to hide financial 
irregularities 
the accusations of corruption reached a peak on dec 1 when one 
member of parliament suggested the disgraced leaders stashed 54 
billion in swiss bank accounts 
while prosecutors have not used that figure they have said that 
hundreds of millions of dollars left the country 
the reform movements in other soviet bloc countries have not led 
to anything like east germanys anticorruption fervor 
opposition leader vaclav havel said that if he is elected 
czechoslovakias president he will try to prevent a witchhunt 
against the communists 
there must be justice but not revenge havel said 
polish prime minister taduesz mazowiecki a member of the 
solidarity opposition has cut off government subsidies that helped 
the communist party build a vast bureaucracy and acquire companies 
buildings hotels fleets of cars and garages the government has 
said it has no plans to recover property however 
the bestknown soviet case involved yuri churbanov soninlaw 
of the late kremlin leader leonid i brezhnev churbanov former 
deputy interior minister was convicted a year ago of taking bribes 
and is serving a 12year prison term 
the current leaders are fanning popular resentment of 
corruption in part to deflect any criticism of them 
the whole thing is being played up says guenther buch a 
west german government expert on east german affairs certainly 
people knew about it but before people were punished if they 
started talking 
now theyre venting their anger he said 
buch said he fears the resentment could turn into violence 
especially if there are disclosures of corruption in the middle and 
lower levels of the communist party 
in an interview with the communist newspaper junge welt 
opposition leader rainer eppelmann said he believes there also are 
cases of corruption in the four parties long allied with the 
communists 
the former head of one of those parties the christian 
democrats already is under investigation for unspecified financial 
irregularities 
part of east germanys anticorruption campaign is in the hands 
of a commission headed by new communist party chief gregor gysi 
gysi a 41yearold lawyer has promised to uncover all abuse 
but has cautioned against tearing ourselves to pieces 
one of the bestknown cases of corruption so far is that of 
alexander schalckgolodkowski wanted for overseeing a ring that 
sold weapons to countries in south america africa and the middle 
east 
the former topranking government official is in a west berlin 
prison and says he will fight any extradition attempts 
he has said he was repaying about 30 million to east germany 
from swiss bank accounts but that is only a small part of what the 
nations official news media claim he embezzled 
schalckgolodkowski is worried hell be sacrificed if he is 
sent back says his west berlin lawyer peter danckert

the united states has started negotiations 
with poland and hungary aimed at preventing diversion to the soviet 
union of us hightechnology exports to those two east european 
countries commerce secretary robert mosbacher said sunday 
mosbachers remarks came a day after president bush signaled 
that his administration is ready to consider a major relaxation of 
export controls with regard to warsaw pact nations 
i think it is timely that we take a new look at the commercial 
restraints bush said saturday at a news conference on the 
caribbean island of st martin after meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand 
mosbacher appearing on nbcs meet the press program was 
asked about a pending request by the control data corp to sell 
several highpowered computers to the soviet union 
the commerce secretary responded that well have to look at 
each item on a casebycase basis 
we released middle technology and were going to look to see 
whether it should go higher than that mosbacher said eastern 
european countries yes the soviet union wed have to be very 
careful 
later in the program mosbacher was asked how the united states 
could be confident that hightechnology items exported to poland 
and hungary which remain members of the warsaw pact would not end 
up in soviet hands 
he replied well because both of them have started 
negotiations with us on verification and continuing observation on 
what they do with whatever we send them and it would be on that 
condition and that we make that negotiation a reality that we would 
send them these things so that there couldnt be transshipment 
mosbacher also was questioned about the announcement friday that 
the us merchandise trade deficit had surged to 102 billion in 
october the biggest deficit in 10 months 
the commerce secretary replied that he did not believe the 
october figure spelled bad news for longerterm efforts to help 
reduce the trade deficit 
mosbacher said he expects the us trade imbalance for all of 
1989 will total about 110 billion down from approximately 120 
billion last year 
were chipping away at it not fast enough but were working 
on it he said

the united states and china are discussing the 
release of chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian 
to a third country a published report said sunday 
the discussions about a possible release of fang occurred as a 
result of private talks that former secretary of state henry 
kissinger held in beijing last month the washington post said 
quoting an anonymous bush administration source 
national security adviser brent scowcroft followed up on those 
talks last weekend when he and deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger met with officials in beijing on a muchcriticized 
surprise mission the newspaper said 
scowcroft and eagleburger are former business partners of 
kissingers in a consulting firm that has clients in china 
kissinger has been involved with china since the nixon 
administration which paved the way for a reopening of relations 
between the two countries former president nixon visited china in 
late october 
fang and li have taken refuge in the us embassy in beijing 
since the chinese governments bloody crackdown in june on the 
democracy movement the suppression culminated in the killing of 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people at tiananmen square 
the recent us overture including a toast by scowcroft to the 
chinese leaders who led the crackdown has been criticized in the 
united states some lawmakers have threatened to seek sanctions 
against china when congress returns in january 
president bush however said saturday in st martin that he had 
seen a couple of indications that the visit would have 
positive results he did not elaborate 
bush made the remarks after a meeting with french president 
francois mitterrand 
according to the official quoted in the post chinas leaders 
have said they would not release fang to the united states or 
france both countries host numbers of chinese student dissidents 
the official said the united states wants to get him out of 
there and the search is continuing for a compromise the post 
reported 
kissinger appearing sunday on cbstvs face the nation 
declined to comment on his discussions 
but he did say i would expect that over the next four to six 
weeks it will be obvious that the human rights issue was not put on 
the back burner and that important considerations with respect to 
human rights were raised 
asked if there were a conflict of interest between his business 
interests and his private diplomacy kissinger said well the 
funny thing is that im trying to keep the list of my clients 
confidential for that very reason that i dont want to raise 
conflictofinterest questions and others are trying to make me 
get me to make them public because our client list is not revealed 
to the governments concerned 
he added my opinions are not for sale

the scandalplagued department of housing and 
urban development must establish a new level of credibility 
before congress will back significant new housing programs 
according to the head of a senate panel that plans a new probe of 
the department 
sen bob graham dfla chairman of the newly appointed 
subcommittee on hud investigations said multibilliondollar abuses 
uncovered at hud during the reagan administration are the result of 
deeprooted problems in the way the agencys housing subsidy 
programs are structured 
he said his panel will open hearings soon after congress 
reconvenes in january aimed at finding ways to change federal 
housing subsidies for the poor to make influencepeddling and 
mismanagement more difficult and more detectible 
it may be that the plunder reached new heights during the 
pierce era but it is not by any means the first time there have 
been scandals similar to those that have come out in the last few 
months graham said referring to former hud secretary samuel r 
pierce jr 
our approach is going to be one of trying to understand and 
legislate on why these programs of hud have been so subject to 
plunder for an extended period of time graham said 
clearly the original objectives of these programs is not 
being achieved 
grahams investigative panel was appointed by senate banking 
committee chairman don riegle dmich he commented in a recent 
interview in his office during the congressional recess 
graham contended that a package of management reforms proposed 
by hud secretary jack kemp and enacted by congress as one of its 
final actions before recessing for the year did not end all the 
potential for abuse in housing laws 
he said developers continue to be able to layer their 
federal subsidies from hud combining multifamily housing grants 
with other subsidies including lowincome housing tax credits 
graham is among the senate cosponsors of a bill that would 
overhaul most housing programs aimed to benefit lowincome people 
and which has been pushed strongly by advocates of increased 
federal housing aid 
that legislation did not advance during this years session and 
graham suggested it was unlikely to move until his panel makes its 
report 
there has to be a new level of credibility in the department 
and in the programs before it is likely the congress will support 
significant new housing initiatives graham said 
still the senate committees move to investigate hud has raised 
questions about its timing and motives since furor over the fraud 
influencepeddling and mismanagement at hud seems to be fading 
after first gaining attention last spring 
a house subcommittee headed by rep tom lantos dcalif 
conducted nearly 30 hearings over eight months it subpoenaed 
pierce and his former aides prompting pierce and three others to 
refuse to testify on grounds of selfincrimination attorney 
general dick thornburgh has begun a preliminary inquiry into 
whether a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate 
pierce 
grahams probe also comes as kemp has voiced anger at congress 
for appropriating millions of dollars to specific hud projects that 
the departments own staff says is unnecessary or wasteful 
talbot sandy dalemberte a florida attorney hired by graham 
to lead the panels staff said the probe would not focus on the 
scandals rats as the lantos probe did and would not create 
the sensation that the house panel did with its parade of witnesses 
invoking 5th amendment rights 
dalemberte is a former dean of the florida state university law 
school and presidentelect of the american bar association 
graham said his panel would focus instead on vulnerability 
to abuse in housing laws and probably would not try to compel 
testimony from witnesses who have refused before the lantos panel 
he said it would conclude hearings in 60 to 90 days

more than 800 aging oldtime 
communists reaffirmed their loyalty to a hardline ideology sunday 
at a meeting to reorganize the party which reformers disbanded two 
months ago 
communist reformers declared the old party dead on oct 8 and 
formed the hungarian socialist party 
former general secretary karoly grosz denounced the move as a 
coup 
grosz and other leading conservatives since have tried to 
reassemble likeminded communists asserting that the old party 
officially known as the hungarian socialist workers party still 
exists 
the tone of sundays session was set by gyoergy marosan 82 who 
told the gathering in a voice choked with emotion i am glad i 
dont have to begin by saying ladies and gentlemen because we are 
all comrades here 
the delegates responded with deafening applause 
the old communist party had more than 750000 members and they 
have not been allowed to join the new party unless they sign a 
declaration reflecting support for democratic reforms similar to 
those taking place in other eastern european countries 
marosan urged efforts to avoid fratricide referring to the 
split no one can sweep marxism off the table of history he 
told the cheering audience 
in his keynote speech grosz declared that the communist party 
is alive because members want it that way and said it had about 
100000 members 
he attacked the new governments economic plans which are 
similar to his when he was premier 18 months ago and warned 
against capitalist restoration 
grosz announced that the committee that organized the 
conservatives was resigning and urged the delegates to elect new 
faces new personalities into the leadership 
that organizing committee had been an uneasy alliance of former 
government leaders it included former communist ideologist janos 
berecz onetime foreign minister frigyes puja and robert 
ribanszki a former personal secretary of the late party chief 
janos kadar 
a strong candidate to lead the party is gyula thuermer groszs 
former foreign policy adviser

for czechoslovak journalists the 
whirlwind revolution of the past month has set them free from the 
dictates of ideology but left them grappling with the constraints 
of the marketplace 
what we need is an editor who is a humanist a visionary a 
person with a clear moral point of view but we also want someone 
who is hardworking and aggressive a manager who knows how to get 
us a new printing press said michal horacek a reporter on the 
mass circulation weekly mlady svet and a member of the opposition 
group civic forum 
among the first acts of the new oppositionapproved government 
sworn in dec 10 was the firing of the official state censor last 
monday reporters at mlady svet who were required by unwritten 
rule to be party members celebrated the new government by 
destroying their membership cards 
even the communist party dailies rude pravo and pravda now carry 
news instead of pablum and propaganda each days pages offer 
reports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police and 
corruption in the highest party circles 
its a big change from only a month ago when editors made weekly 
visits to the communist party press office to hear about the 
previous weeks errors and receive advice that was passed 
along to the staff 
offensive passages were deleted offensive publications 
confiscated before they hit the street and some journalists who 
operated too far from the party line like those editing 
underground journals wound up behind bars 
the people of this country were trained to read between the 
lines said horacek whose column letters of love and hate 
was addressed to dead heroes but with a political message that was 
clear to czechoslovak cognoscente 
when information was strictly controlled every text had a 
subtext every word a hidden meaning people knew better than to 
believe what they read and literature became a refuge from reality 
in this way the traditionally important role of writers and 
other intellectuals in eastern europe was enhanced cultural 
variety substituted for political plurality and the censor and the 
written word both carried enormous weight in the battle for 
readers minds 
now the rules of this kafkaesque game have changed 
what was only suggested before can now be said and this means 
we have to be more accurate more tolerant and we have to learn to 
compete in the marketplace said lubos beniaka horaceks 
colleague who wrote 121 pages for his newspaper on the 
prodemocracy demonstrations that began nov 17 and will end in 
free elections next year 
we are quite in the dark about what we are going to be he 
said 
whatever it is newspaper staffs will have to decide quickly 
since state subsidies in a democratic system will disappear 
reporters throughout prague exhausted by the nonstop coverage 
of fastbreaking events but exhilarated by new opportunities are 
spending much time in meetings discussing their fate 
we can be bought by robert maxwell or rupert murdoch now 
horacek said anything can happen but above all we want to be 
independent and now we are asking would we be independent in mr 
murdochs world

the governments efforts to rebound 
after the recent failed coup have largely consisted of rhetoric 
partly because of a political system designed to check presidential 
action 
it is widely assumed that president corazon aquino must make 
sweeping changes in her administration and leadership style if the 
nation is to recover from the political economic and social damage 
caused by the dec 19 military mutiny that nearly ousted her 
more than a week after the last rebel surrendered there have 
been no cabinet changes she seems to have delayed action so it 
does not appear that she bowed to the mutineers demands for 
change including an end to government corruption and inefficiency 
there also have been no major domestic policy reforms but the 
philippine political system which mrs aquino proudly describes as 
a restored democracy is not designed for speedy action 
it was designed to divide power among the executive legislative 
and judicial branches after 20 years of strongman rule under the 
late president ferdinand marcos for better or worse the aquino 
administration and citizens are discovering what that means in time 
of crisis 
in a bid to restore public confidence mrs aquino declared a 
state of national emergency on dec 6 the declaration exists in 
name only however because congress has not ratified the final 
version of a bill spelling out what ms aquino would be empowered 
to do during a state of emergency 
the senate and house of representatives planned to take up the 
legislation on monday 
it would grant few new powers beyond price controls state 
operation of public utilities and recovery of loose firearms 
congress amended the original proposal to require adherence to 
the constitution language that virtually guarantees court 
challenges if the legislation passes 
for example the compromise bill would not allow the government 
to arrest suspects without warrants or circumvent other legal 
restraints lawmakers also have weakened proposed curbs on the 
right to strike and media reporting 
the idea of emergency powers has been severely criticized by 
people with bitter memories of martial law which marcos imposed 
from 1972 until 1981 
we see a repeat of the marcos regime wrote columnist neal 
cruz in the philippine daily globe marcos refused to heed 
appeals for reform instead he declared a state of emergency then 
imposed martial law now that housewife is turning out to be 
another marcos 
in the heady days after the 1986 people power revolution 
that toppled the marcos administration mrs aquino appointed a 
commission to draft a new constitution to guarantee no more 
oneperson rule 
the commission restored the twohouse legislature precisely 
because marcos had been successful in transforming a singlehouse 
national assembly into a rubberstamp chamber 
last week the system seemed to work congress refused to give 
the administration everything it wanted 
the president is constitutionally empowered to declare a state 
of emergency and under reasonable terms temporarily take over 
or direct the operations of any privately owned public utility or 
business affected by the public interest no other specific 
powers are cited 
even if she declared martial law mrs aquino would hardly have 
a free legal hand 
the constitution stipulates that martial law does not suspend 
the operation of the constitution or the operations of congress 
and the courts 
mrs aquino could order arrest without warrants for 60 days but 
congress is empowered to overrule such a decree after 48 hours 
one step that she could take would be to dismiss her cabinet 
which had been widely criticized as ineffective months before the 
coup attempt 
presidential staff sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
say mrs aquino was preparing to drop some cabinet members but did 
not plan a massive shakeup because she believes much of the 
criticism is unfair

robert s vance was remembered by 
friends and colleagues as a thoughtful federal appeals court judge 
who earlier helped heal racial wounds that threatened to destroy 
the alabama democratic party 
vance 58 a judge on the atlantabased us 11th circuit court 
of appeals was killed by a mail bomb that went off at his home 
saturday afternoon his wife helen was seriously injured 
he was a voice of sanity in turbulent times and a leader of 
reasoned action said sen howell heflin dala who met vance 
more than 30 years ago when they were young trial lawyers 
alabama and americas jurisprudence has suffered a tremendous 
loss 
in 1977 thenpresident carter appointed vance a former 
chairman of the alabama democratic party to serve as a member of 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals he later was assigned to the 
new 11th circuit which reviews appeals from triallevel federal 
courts in florida georgia and alabama 
as a judge vance did not receive the attention that his party 
chairmanship had given him but he did have a hand in some cases 
heavily publicized regionally 
bob was intellectually brilliant said huntsville attorney 
julian butler a longtime friend he had an incredibly innovative 
mind but was realistic and pragmatic he understood the 
realities of politics 
vance a student body president at the university of alabama 
first gained statewide notice with his efforts to get the alabama 
legislature to redraw legislative districts to reflect changes in 
population in the early 1960s 
at that time the state democratic executive committee was under 
the control of a staunchly conservative coalition of states rights 
advocates and dixiecrats loyal to thensegregationist gov george 
c wallace 
vance then a young lawyer became the champion for loyalist 
democrats who were afraid that wallaces growing influence would 
cause a split with the national democratic party 
the talladega native was elected state party chairman in 1966 
and won reelection twice over the next 11 years he soon began the 
political wrangling necessary to fully integrate the allwhite 
state democratic party 
he was just such a fine example of what the democratic party 
needed for leadership former state sen george lewis bailes 
said he was very propeople prodemocrat 
bob vance more than any other human being in alabama was 
responsible for keeping the democratic party in alabama a 
democratic party butler said 
one of vances first moves as party chairman was to bring about 
the removal of the white rooster a symbol of white supremacy with 
the slogan for the right from atop the partys election 
ballots 
he felt like we had to move forward out of the racial unrest 
we were in heflin said he believed we ought to approach these 
things not draw a line in the dust 
wallace unsuccessfully challenged vances leadership of the 
party numerous times backing candidates he thought could unseat 
the chairman 
vance never held an elected office other than his party 
chairmanship and seat on state democratic executive committee but 
his tenure saw some other changes that left their impact on alabama 
politics 
the party pushed vigorously for election law reform and later 
adopted a rule requiring its candidates to disclose their finances 
before the party primary elections 
vance was survived by his wife of 36 years and by two sons 
robert s vance jr and charles vance

east germanys premier says his nation is 
willing to change its policy of denying responsibility for the nazi 
holocaust as a way to establish diplomatic ties with israel a 
newspaper reported sunday 
we have approached israel officially with a request to discuss 
establishing diplomatic relations premier hans modrow was quoted 
as saying in an interview published in the daily haaretz 
foreign minister moshe arens told israel radio sunday that 
officials had not received a formal east german request for 
diplomatic relations but he welcomed what he called growing signs 
of repentance by soviet bloc nations for unwavering support for 
the arab world 
many east bloc countries that broke ties with israel after the 
1967 middle east war recently have expressed interest in renewing 
relations 
but israel never has had diplomatic ties with east germany 
which has maintained that it bore no responsibility for the 
holocaust because the nation did not exist at the time 
the nazis killed about 6 million jews before germany was 
defeated in world war ii and divided into two states 
when modrow was asked about payments to holocaust survivors he 
told haaretz we are certainly prepared to discuss the issue with 
official representatives of the jewish organizations dealing with 
it and of israel 
east german deputy foreign minister heinzdieter winter said 
last week that his country would discuss humanitarian 
assistance but not war reparations 
motti amichai a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry 
said that would not be enough 
what we want is very clearly the acceptance of responsibility 
and if you accept the responsibility then you need to pay 
reparations amichai said 
the holocaust still is a deeply painful issue in israeli 
society but many believe that establishing ties with east germany 
would not cause the riots that erupted when israel began diplomatic 
relations with west germany in 1965 
shevach weiss a leftwing legislator and holocaust survivor 
said in a telephone interview sunday fortyfive years after the 
war the population of east germany is made up of young people most 
israelis understand that you have to have relations with east 
germany especially after having ties with west germany 
weiss said however that israel should insist that east germany 
accept responsibility for the holocaust and pay reparations 
since 1952 west germany has paid more than 43 billion in 
reparations to holocaust survivors and their families 
newly elected east german communist party leader gregor gysi 
also told haaretz he expects his nation to establish diplomatic 
ties with israel 
we are interested in ties with israel in all fields including 
of course diplomatic relations he said this doesnt mean we 
agree with israel on every issue but we have relations with many 
countries that we disagree with

maly was stripped of his license to preach after signing the 
charter 77 human rights document he held services illegally in his 
cramped apartment for laymen who faced discrimination for their 
christian beliefs

dr priscilla white whose research 
sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic 
women died at age 89 after a long illness 
white died saturday at her home in this boston suburb according 
to a statement from the joslin diabetes center in boston 
her studies identified ways to decrease the risk of maternal and 
child death in pregnancies complicated by diabetes the statement 
said 
whites research and the treatment process she developed 
increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54 
percent in the 1920s to about 97 percent in the late 1970s and 
1980s it said 
born in boston white attended radcliffe college and graduated 
third in her class from tufts university medical school in 1923 
she joined a diabetes practice headed by elliott p joslin and 
in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the 
clinic now known as the joslin diabetes center 
white taught at harvard medical school and was an assistant 
professor of medicine at tufts she received numerous honors and 
was the first woman to receive the banting medal the american 
diabetes associations highest scientific award

often would be healthy a month before delivery but would die if 
allowed to go full term she concluded that babies of diabetic 
women should be delivered by caesarean section at eight months

extra week to develop she also learned that although infants of 
diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size 
despite premature birth they require the same special care needed

the opposition socialist party claimed 
major victories in local voting sunday with the election of its 
leader as mayor of lisbon and the capture of other large cities and 
government strongholds 
the governing centerright social democrats of prime minister 
anibal cavaco silva received most votes nationwide when initial 
results were announced winning an estimated 40 percent of the 
vote according to state rtp television 
however the loss of lisbon oporto in the north the major 
cities of coimbra and faro and social democratic strongholds on 
madeira and in the azores islands were hailed as triumphs by the 
opposition 
this is a clear defeat for the government and the social 
democratic party on a national scale and the lisbon result shows 
the capital doesnt even trust the ministries it houses 
socialist party leader jorge sampaio told a news conference at his 
party headquarters 
three hours after polling stations closed about 35 percent of 
the vote was reported as having gone to the socialists 11 percent 
to the conservative democratic social center and 9 percent to the 
communists no vote totals were available 
sampaio won in lisbon as candidate of an unprecedented alliance 
between socialists and communists that won from 48 to 50 percent of 
the city vote 
his conservative opponent marcelo rebelo de sousa admitted 
defeat after hearing first estimates 
shortly after initial results were announced socialist party 
spokesman antonio lopes cardoso said sampaio would not join forces 
with the communists in the next legislative elections slated for 
1991 
the social democrats had warned that a leftist victory in lisbon 
could tempt the socialists to maintain the alliance in general 
elections and so let the communists into the federal government by 
the back door 
the government has slipped in popularity since winning 
portugals first absolute majority in 1987 on the promise of 
freemarket economic policies and rapid modernization 
a consumer boom and big foreign investment have brought 
prosperity to some but annual inflation of more than 12 percent 
has squeezed lowincome budgets 
persistent rumors of highlevel corruption also plagued the 
social democrats 
about 8 million portuguese were eligible to vote in elections 
for 55000 local authorities 
voting in cunha alta in the northern region of mangulade was 
postponed until sunday dec 24 after strong winds ripped roofs 
off houses and injured at least two people the portuguese news

mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief 
sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flowerdraped body of andrei 
d sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as 
his countrys conscience 
crimean tatars and jewish refuseniks two of the groups 
sakharov helped joined rankandfile communists teachers and 
engineers in filing past the body of the physicist nobel peace 
prize winner human rights advocate and legislator 
based on official sources an estimated 45000 people filed 
through and the flow of mourners continued into the night a 
friend of the family speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
heard estimates that 70000 mourners viewed the body before it was 
returned to sakharovs apartment at midnight 
my god forgive us one elderly woman cried out as she saw 
sakharovs body in an open coffin sloping to the floor of the 
beige marble youth palace in central moscow she apparently meant 
to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier 
a mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at sakharovs 
feet and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing sakharov 
with his hands over his mouth deep in thought an organ and piano 
alternated dirges 
sakharov died thursday alone in his study at the age of 68 
apparently of a heart attack ending a threedecade fight against 
the jailing of innocent people for free emigration for 
disarmament and other causes 
sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies and the 
outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and 
committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote 
city of gorky 
there were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of 9 
million people as though a government leader had died the huge 
line of mourners sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against 
belowzero temperatures stretched a mile from the palace and 
poured continuously out of a subway station 
so many people wanted to see sakharovs body lying in state that 
authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the 
coffin so two rows of mourners could file past 
roald z sagdeyev a member of the official funeral commission 
said about 3000 people an hour were arriving initially but the 
official news agency tass said that rate doubled later making for 
a total of 45000 by nighttime 
police lined the sidewalks where people waited sakharovs widow 
yelena bonner pleased authorities were not turning people away 
praised them for being very democratic 
in her first detailed public comments on her husbands death 
bonner said she hopes he will not be idolized 
i would not wish a living person he has lived an animated 
happy life to be turned into an icon an icon which could be used 
by various forces in their interests bonner said in an interview 
broadcast on soviet tv 
she said however that she hopes sakharovs writings published 
abroad long ago will become widely available in his homeland so 
there can be a conversation of the people of the future with 
andrei dmitrievich 
mourners carried small portraits of sakharov and red and white 
carnations to place near his coffin one man sergei kosykh 
brought his 7yearold daughter along 
my daughter who is being brought up with the belief that 
there is nobody greater than soviet founder vladimir lenin i 
have brought her here today just to show her the person greater 
than lenin he said 
a middleaged woman drew from russian literature to reflect on 
sakharovs contributions 
he was like the man from one of maxim gorkys tales who used 
his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to 
light and truth said the woman a teacher who declined to give 
her name 
sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced 
our leadership to do the same said boris sorokin a 50yearold 
designer 
unofficial shrines sprouted outside sakharovs southeast moscow 
apartment where candles flickered alongside his portrait outside 
the offices of the weekly newspaper moscow news on pushkin square 
a popular gathering place for political activists portraits and 
flowers were displayed 
an entry in a notebook for mourners comments outside sakharovs 
apartment building declared the conscience of the nation has 
died 
moscow news an organ of the official press which had branded 
sakharov an utterly ignorant person took the rare step sunday 
of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist 
four pages were filled with pictures of him condolence 
telegrams from exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn and president 
bush and a text of sakharovs last public remarks a speech he 
delivered hours before his death in which he said the soviet 
hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe 
on sunday night soviet tvs newscast seven days also paid 
tribute to sakharov leading the program with a 10minute report on 
him 
the communist party daily pravda published a poem by yevgeny 
yevtushenko that read in part 
historys most peaceful rebel in dying did not come down 
from the cross but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of 
the world 
on saturday pravda published what amounted to a public apology 
to sakharov 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet leaders said in 
an obituary that sakharov had been the victim of gross 
injustices and praised him as a man of honesty and sincerity 
bonner sakharovs constant companion and fellow human rights 
activist sat closest to the coffin clutching a black handbag and 
periodically closing her eyes a son and daughter from his first 
marriage and son and daughter of bonner also attended along with 
four grandchildren 
gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects monday when the 
funeral is planned and on sunday was represented by yevgeny m 
primakov chairman of the funeral commission and a nonvoting 
member of the countrys ruling politburo 
the foreign dignitaries expected to take part in mondays 
ceremonies include lech walesa head of polands solidarity 
movement who will be making his first trip to the soviet union 
and former refuseniks yosef begun and vladimir slepak who now live 
in israel 
israels best known soviet dissident natan sharansky was 
refused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to moscow 
said sharanskys spokesman avraham benyaakov begun and slepak 
said they would lay a wreath on sakharovs grave in sharanskys

themselves to death had consulted a spiritual guide who is facing 
lawsuits in the deaths of seven associates according to a report 
published sunday 
david and glenda goodman who killed themselves in late october 
were among a tightly knit group who followed the teachings of terri 
hoffman who reportedly told students she was an incarnation of 
christ the dallas morning news said 
the goodmans deaths bring to nine the number of associates of 
hoffman who have committed suicide or died in accidents since 1977 
mrs hoffman is accused in two dallas lawsuits of profiting and 
mind control in the deaths of the seven who died before the 
goodmans five followers and two of her husbands the paper said 
it did not say when the lawsuits were filed 
the suits by the victims survivors allege that mrs hoffman 
used hypnosis to make her associates change their wills and 
insurance policies to favor her and her metaphysical organization 
conscious development of body mind and soul inc 
papers filed with the lawsuits allege that mrs hoffman caused 
her followers to kill themselves or suffer fatal accidents 
the goodmans had written checks to mrs hoffman for more than 
110000 in return for her showing them the purple realm their 
promised realm the paper said citing police sources 
fred time mrs hoffmans attorney refused to discuss specifics 
of the case but told the newspaper that she was not connected with 
the goodmans deaths 
this is character assassination the attorney said you 
have nothing to go on whats wrong with giving a large gift in 
return for spiritual guidance call up some of the big churches and 
see if anybody died and left them money 
mrs hoffman who declined an interview with the newspaper did 
not immediately return a telephone call from the associated press 
the goodmans badly decomposed bodies were found in their lake 
highlands home nov 25 authorities have not determined the exact 
circumstances of their deaths but have ruled that no third person 
participated in the shootings 
goodman was a berkeley and yaleeducated business and computer 
professor at southern methodist university he left teaching at the 
private dallas college in 1987 to begin an investment counseling 
service and newsletters 
dallas police said friday the goodmans deaths were still under 
investigation 
even though the evidence indicates that these two deaths were 
not caused by an outside agency the unusual circumstances have 
caused us to keep this case open deputy police chief ray hawkins 
told the paper 
when these cases were ruled suicides we basically got out of 
it police detective bobby hammer said when contacted by the 
associated press on sunday he said they were currently not 
investigating the other deaths 
the paper said mrs hoffman had about 20 followers some of whom 
were students at smu 
the newspaper said manuscripts police found at the goodmans 
home show they were studying mrs hoffmans teachings of gods and 
spirits rays energy and karma 
you are no longer david goodman son of alice amp leonard 
said one passage addressed to goodman in his wifes handwriting 
that person is gone because the programming is wiped out you are

to german reunification as an emergency party congress ended sunday

and adopted a new one designed to guide the party until its next 
regular congress in february 
the congress ended with a new name for the discredited party 
which is trying to maintain a role for itself as elections approach

in the latest change premier hans modrow announced that east 
germanys new domestic intelligence services will be under direct 
control of the government the new agency will replace the hated 
ministry for national security which was dissolved 
the new communist platform says the party roots lie in the 
communist and social democratic workers movement a phrase 
aimed at disassociating the party from 40 years of stalinist rule 
from the top 
the goal is a new human democratic socialism in east 
germany the platform said in an echo of a phrase used by former 
czechoslovak communist leader alexander dubcek dubceks attempt to 
create socialism with a human face was crushed by east germany 
and four other warsaw pact nations that invaded his country in 1968 
it was the first democratic party congress we have staged in 
decades east german party chief gregor gysi told delegates

germany is willing to change its policy of denying responsibility 
for the nazi holocaust as a way to establish diplomatic ties with 
israel 
we have approached israel officially with a request to discuss 
establishing diplomatic relations modrow was quoted as saying in 
an interview in the daily haaretz 
while west germany has paid billions of dollars in reparations 
to holocaust survivors east germany traditionally has denied 
responsibility on the grounds that it did not exist as a state at 
the time 
on saturday meanwhile president bush said he would be very 
responsive to any request from east germany for emergency

federal agents sunday searched the 
secluded estate of a federal judge killed by a mail bomb delivered 
to his home investigators said a drugrelated motive was one 
possibility being examined 
robert s vance an 11th us circuit court of appeals judge 
was killed instantly when the package exploded saturday afternoon 
in the kitchen of his suburban birmingham home authorities said 
his wife helen was injured and remained hospitalized sunday in 
serious condition 
vance 58 a progressive force in alabama during 11 years as 
state chairman of the democratic party was the third federal judge 
to be assassinated in 10 years the three are believed to be the 
only federal jurists killed this century 
fbi spokesman tom moore said there were specific leads but 
declined to elaborate saying only that investigators were pursuing 
numerous possibilities 
asked whether vances death was connected to drug cases handled 
by his court it is not being ruled out but it is no more 
prominent than several other avenues we are following we are 
reviewing his full case load 
agent allen whitaker said every fbi agent in the birmingham area 
was working on the case he said many details could not disclosed 
because of the very rapid breaking nature of this 
investigation 
us marshal thomas c greene said vance had not asked for 
protection and the marshals office was not aware of any threats on 
his life greene would not say whether security has been increased 
for judges because of the slaying 
asked about security for other federal judges moore said 
they have been warned but declined to say if any were under 
guard judges may request security at any time he added 
vance appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 served in 
a circuit that reviewed cases from florida georgia and alabama 
as a member of the 11th circuit court of appeals they heard 
many appeal cases related to drugs from miami sen howell 
heflin dala a longtime friend of vance said saturday 
theres speculation in that regard but nobody knows 
the circuit has 12 judges as well as six judges on senior or 
semiretired status the judges generally serve on threejudge 
panels that review rulings made by triallevel courts 
in miami us district judge lawrence king said if vances 
death were related to drug trafficking you would be more apt to 
see this type of violence directed toward a judge or magistrate at 
the trial level in florida or perhaps alabama 
but who knows king told the birmingham news 
vances twostory home in birminghams most exclusive suburb was 
cordoned off sunday as federal and local authorities searched it 
whitaker said fbi agents and postal inspectors spoke with mrs 
vance at the hospital and she has provided information that will 
be helpful in an investigation 
whitaker said mrs vance apparently was not standing close to 
her husband when the bomb exploded she was able to call a 
neighbor who then summoned police to the home moore said 
indications are that it was delivered by regular us mail 
not special delivery moore said 
moore said vances family was being guarded but declined to 
give details the couple which had been married 36 years had two 
sons robert s vance jr a birmingham lawyer and charles vance 
whose residence wasnt known immediately 
whitaker and jefferson county district attorney david barber 
joined investigators inside the home on a narrow curving road 
lined by houses set deep in wooded estates 
vance was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 by 
president carter and took his seat the following year he continued 
to live and work in the birmingham area although the court is 
based in atlanta 
as state democratic party chairman from 1966 to 1977 vance was 
a force for racial moderation fighting off attacks by thengov 
george c wallace against the national democratic party 
in 1974 wallace sought to wrest control of the state party from 
vance but in a secret ballot in birmingham vance turned back 
wallaces handpicked choice for chairman 
he was a voice of sanity in turbulent times and a leader of 
reasoned action said heflin who met vance more than 30 years 
ago when they were young trial lawyers alabama and americas 
jurisprudence has suffered a tremendous loss 
it was believed that only two other federal judges have been 
assassinated this century 
us district judge richard daronco 56 was shot and killed at 
his home in pelham ny in 1988 by a former policeman angry at 
daroncos dismissal of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by his 
daughter charles koster 67 killed himself after gunning down the 
judge 
district judge john h wood jr 63 was killed by a sniper 
outside his home in san antonio in 1979 charles voyed harrelson 
was convicted of the contract killing and is serving two life 
sentences in a texas prison el paso drug trafficker jamiel 
jimmy chagra who authorities say ordered the hit was 
convicted of conspiring to obstruct the investigation of woods 
murder and various drug charges he is serving a life sentence in 
federal prison 
chagra had been scheduled to go on trial on drug charges before 
wood the day the judge was slain

rep george crockett has called for the 
decriminalization of drugs becoming the first member of congress 
to do so publicly and drawing sharp criticism from drug czar 
william bennett 
decriminalization is the only solution crockett dmich 
said in an interview in washington published sunday in the detroit 
news 
our courts are burdened down with these drug cases and there 
is nothing they can do about it he said and here we are 
talking about spending additional billions to build jails and 
prisons to send people to 
money now spent on drug enforcement should be shifted to job 
training for the urban poor education health care and day care 
said crockett whose district includes detroits economically 
depressed east side 
crockett said he had no immediate plans to introduce legislation 
decriminalizing drugs because it could not win congressional 
approval 
told of crocketts position bennett cursed and said here we 
go we were wondering who was going to be the first the news 
said 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
said he feared others in congress could join crockett and subvert 
the administrations antidrug efforts 
last week us district judge robert sweet became the first 
federal judge to publicly support decriminalization also favoring 
decriminalization are baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke and economist 
milton friedman 
bennett said that giving drugs the same legal status as alcohol 
could cause even greater social and economic problems 
alcohol has done quite enough damage thank you he told the 
news and if you want to see people using crack go from 1 
million or 2 million to 10 million make it as available as 
alcohol 
bennett also spoke against legalizing drugs sunday in an 
appearance on the abctv program this week with david brinkley

the fatal shooting of a us military 
officer over the weekend came after months of a vitriolic 
governmentsponsored campaign against americans and their 
government 
the campaign peaked friday when a member of the peoples 
assembly which named gen manuel antonio noriega as chief of 
government asked for guns for the people because what we have to 
do here is kill gringos and progringos 
we have to kill all gringos a panamanian soldier guarding 
the defense headquarters told reporters earlier pointing to a us 
army helicopter hovering a short distance away 
he spoke before the assembly declared panama in a state of war 
as long as the us aggression lasts 
saturdays shooting death of the american officer near panamas 
defense headquarters was ignored by the panamanian military its 
communique on the incident referred only to a provocation by 
the us military 
the us southern command said the officer and three others all 
off duty unarmed and in civilian clothes were detained by 
panamanian soldiers near the checkpoint according to an official 
statment the officers were hassled and tried to flee by car 
and the panamanian soldiers shot at the car 
for nearly two years the us government has tried to force 
noriegas ouster noriega commander of the panamanian defense 
forces was indicted in florida in february 1988 on us 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges noriega denies the 
charges 
the us government has tried to isolate noriega 
internationally accusing him of annulling presidential elections 
in may because his handpicked candidate lost 
us and panamanian forces have faced each other several times 
when the panamanians tried to block us military maneuvers that 
washington claims are necessary to train forces here to defend the 
panama canal 
yet until two years ago these same forces regularly 
participated in joint military exercises and their officers 
socialized together 
it all ended abruptly after the first military coup attempt 
against noriega on march 16 1988 noriega accused the united 
states of trying to infiltrate the defense forces and brought back 
panama officers attending special training programs at us 
military bases 
as the united states imposed economic sanctions on panama the 
governmentcontrolled news media began a campaign aimed at 
discrediting the us government all us officials and us 
military officers here 
newspapers depicted us soldiers as cowards and drug addicts 
and carriers of the aids virus and other sexually transmitted 
diseases 
the united states was shown in column after column as a country 
where discrimination is practiced against blacks and hispanics 
but mostly the columnists said the united states was trying to 
back out of the treaties that call for transfer of the canal 
adminstration to panama and the closing of us bases at the end of 
the century 
they whipped up nationalistic fervor portraying noriega as the 
leader of the resistance to us attempts to revoke the treaties 
no opposition or independent news media exist in panama 
a southern command source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said of the saturday shooting this is the result of 
antiamerican propaganda and the totally unprofessional attitude of 
the defense forces 
ricardo arias calderon leader of the christian democratic party 
and former opposition vice presidential candidate said it is 
the result of the psychological war and the escalation of the 
confrontation between the countries military 
we had warned that the series of confrontations would produce 
incidents like this the danger is that this can provoke a greater 
confrontation 
the climate of confrontation was new in a country where the 
official currency is the us dollar where relations with the 
united states have been close since the united states built the 
canal at the beginning of the century and where thousands of us 
soldiers and their dependents used to live offbase in panama city 
about 13000 american troops are stationed in panama and a 
total of about 40000 americans live here

studying for the past three years at a beijing university 
even from talking to the crew we could get very little 
information she told reporters at san francisco international 
airport they said they were also very worried 
flight 981 was flying from beijing to new york via shanghai and 
san francisco on saturday when zhang zhenai ordered the plane to 
fly to seoul south korea korean authorities refused permission to 
land and the plane was diverted to fukuoka airport on japans 
southern island of kyushu 
there a purser reportedly pushed zhang out the planes rear 
door shattering his legs and pelvis he was being treated at a 
japanese hospital 
authorities reported that zhang a 35yearold cotton factory 
foreman threatened crew members with a knife he reportedly told 
japanese police he participated in prodemocracy demonstrations in 
china last june and decided to flee after the crackdown 
ofstedal said the crew at one point asked passengers for rope 
although no one was told why it was needed she said there was 
speculation an overwrought passenger needed to be subdued later 
she said she heard zhang had been tied up with the rope with the 
help of passengers 
the plane returned to beijing with 185 of its 200 passengers 
including zhangs wife and 10yearold son police and airline 
officials said they did not know what happened to them but foreign 
reporters saw the wife led from the plane in handcuffs 
the flight to new york then resumed on a new aircraft chinas 
civil aviation administration said most of the passengers were 
chinese japanese police said there were 19 nonchinese including 
12 americans

to shanghai which normally takes 1 hour and 45 minutes lasted 
more than two hours and the plane spent more than an hour circling 
a small island 
people were acting very calm she said but it was 
obviously very tense 
wang yuan of beijing said she didnt realize a hijacking was 
taking place although she and others were worried because the 
flight to shanghai was taking so long 
when the plane flew to fukuoka she said through a translator 
passengers knew something was wrong when they looked out the 
windows and saw tall buildings and roadways full of cars an 
unusual sight in china 
asked if she was sympathetic to zhangs comments that he was 
motivated by fear of reprisals for speaking out against his 
government ofstedal replied i think he could have chosen a 
better way

recreational shooting of assault rifles 
is going out with a bang in california 
a state ban on more than 50 varieties of the powerful weapons 
takes effect jan 1 more than 200 people gathered on a windswept 
ridge in this town about 50 miles north of san diego on saturday to 
get in one last round of gunfire 
i just had to get my hands on an uzi one more time said 
robert anderson a selfdescribed gun nut who paid a 12 
admission fee and up to 1 per round to fire a variety of the 
militarystyle rifles 
cathy tolly a 26yearold registered nurse who helped organize 
the shoot called it a last hurrah for lawabiding citizens who 
happen to like assaulttype weapons 
once the ban takes place you wont see events like this 
anymore she said 
the state legislature enacted the ban after a drifter toting an 
ak47 assault rifle shot and killed five children and wounded 30 
other people in stockton last january 
angry gun enthusiasts said the ban would do little to stem such 
shootings 
theyre kidding themselves if they think taking away assault 
weapons is going to lessen the crime problem said bart montier 
who brought an antique cannon to the shoot the whole things 
absurd youre not going to see gang members turn in their 
weapons 
montier said he came to the shoot try out an israeli gallil 
assault rifle 
now thats a gun he exclaimed after firing several rounds 
into a row of clay pigeons set up against a hillside 
nearly 40 highperformance weapons were available for shooting 
including more than two dozen types of assault rifles and an 
assortment of pistols and shotguns 
elodie mckee of burbank who wore a tshirt reading just say 
no to gun control said the shoot was a way of dressing down 
guncontrol advocates 
just by showing up here i think we make a statement said 
ms mckee 
these guns have gotten such a bad rap that a lot of gun 
enthusiasts would prefer to just go into hiding and not mention 
them said tj johnston another organizer but i dont feel 
that way thats why we held this thing to show people what 
theyre going to be missing

its not exactly boymeetsgirl but 
sunshine by william mastrosimone deals unconvincingly with the 
relationship between two unhappy strangers looking for love 
the play the second offering of the season by offbroadways 
circle repertory company opened sunday night 
the title character jennifer jason leigh is a smalltime porno 
queen who works in a place called club paradise where the women sit 
in isolated plexiglas booths and talk dirty to the customers shes 
the star of the place has a large following of regular customers 
and even gets her name up in lights 
two such raunchy scenes frame the heart of the oneact play an 
unlikely and lengthy encounter between sunshine and her white 
knight a disillusioned paramedic named nelson their meeting 
occurs bizarrely sunshine bursts into nelsons shabby studio 
apartment one night after jumping out of a van driven by her 
husband 
it doesnt take long before they are serving as each others 
analyst and patient offering advice and telling their individual 
tales of woe the anguish level is pretty high hes trying to 
reconcile with his wife who left him some seven years ago shes 
trying to break from a dominating husband and a degrading job 
john dossett is fine as nelson considering he is forced to 
recite with a straight face such lines as my soul hurts 
leigh is even better she brings a conviction to what could be 
and often is the stock role of the bad girl with a good heart 
her toughasnails exterior gradually softens revealing a 
vulnerability that rings true no matter what mastrosimone has her 
say and jordan mott delivers a memorable vignette as a college 
student one of sunshines more pathetic customers 
the playwright is best known for extremities a revenge 
fantasy play that later became a film it dealt with one womans 
attempt to punish a wouldbe rapist sunshine takes a less 
savage look at the same subject how men and women regard each 
other and what sex whether violent or not can do to a 
relationship 
marshall w mason directs sunshine with his customary 
energy and the production rarely falters even if you dont 
believe the dialogue or plot mastrosimone has concocted

the communist premier has warned 
that his government will resign if parliament rejects a package of 
austerity measures he plans to submit monday to contain 
hyperinflation 
the threeday parliamentary session has already been billed in 
the media as dday for yugoslavia with a sharp clash expected 
between liberals and conservatives representing the countrys 
different regions 
premier ante markovics government which took over in march 
has moved fast to introduce market mechanisms as a way out of 
yugoslavias worstever economic crisis marked by a 2000 percent 
annual inflation rate a 17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent 
unemployment rate 
his reform program has been criticized by conservatives in 
yugoslavias communist leadership especially in the republic of 
serbia who oppose his marketoriented efforts and the promotion of 
greater political pluralism 
several key governmentsponsored reforms have been blocked by 
the conservatives and markovic is expected to demand urgent 
changes in yugoslavias constitution that would give more power to 
the federal government to implement its program 
the new austerity package has been kept under strict secrecy 
and speculation about the measures have caused a huge shopping 
spree by yugoslavs fearing their effect 
never before in postwar parliaments have there been so many 
expectations and so much guesswork about a session of 
parliament the staterun tanjug news agency said sunday 
last week the us state department said it was worried by 
rising tensions in yugoslavia and urged the people to unite in 
support of markovics reform program 
the tough reform measures are expected to include a substantial 
devaluation of the national currency the dinar and tight monetary 
and budgetary controls accompanied by stiff wage and price 
discipline but government spokesmen have denied rumors of a wage 
and price freeze 
the government has already announced that if the package is 
passed the country would receive substantial financial aid 
including a loan of up to 1 billion from the international 
monetary fund and some western countries 
in serbia the largest of the countrys six member republics 
the opposition to markovics reforms is centered on claims that he

a key plutonium production plant at the 
hanford nuclear reservation reopened sunday to process spent 
nuclear fuel that has been stuck in the plant since it was shut 
down a year ago the government said 
energy secretary james d watkins authorized the reopening 
friday based on a review by the department and the need to improve 
safety at the facility said department of energy spokesman tom 
bauman 
the plutoniumuranium extraction plant takes nuclear fuel rods 
from hanfords n reactor and dissolves them to extract plutonium 
and uranium the plutonium must be processed further at another 
facility for use in nuclear weapons 
the n reactor has been closed since late 1986 but purex 
continued to operate until last december to reduce a large 
stockpile of irradiated fuel 
westinghouse hanford co which operates the nuclear production 
complex for the government said it shut the plant down because 
operators did not follow procedures in handling a loss of steam 
pressure 
doe officials have said previously that the shutdown of the 
purex plant would not hurt the countrys ability to make nuclear 
weapons 
a review of safety requirements and procedures along with 
retraining of about 500 purex workers was completed in march 
equipment repairs and improvements to waste treatment systems at 
the 33yearold plant delayed the resumption of operations bauman 
said 
purex is expected to remain open for four to six weeks to finish 
processing material that was in the plant when it was shut down 
bauman said 
then the plant will be shut for another year to make additional 
modifications and improvements before resuming the processing of 
spent fuel in storage at hanford bauman said processing that 
inventory is expected to take until 1995 
from purex plutonium is sent to hanfords plutonium finishing 
plant which has been operating only periodically for the past 
year bauman said that plant will gear up eventually to handle the 
additional plutonium from purex but he could not say when that 
might occur 
the nations only other plutonium extraction operation is at the 
savannah river plant in south carolina but it has little to do 
because reactors at that site have been closed for safety reasons

scotlands chief law officer was quoted sunday as 
saying criminal trials arising from the bombing of pan am flight 
103 would probably take place in the united states 
in this matter on terrorists i think there can be little 
doubt that the americans could assert a jurisdiction lord 
fraser the lord advocate was quoted as saying in an edinburgh 
weekly newspaper 
but a spokesman for the lord advocate firmly refuted reports 
that police have gathered enough evidence to charge several 
suspects in the dec 21 1988 bombing of the new yorkbound flight 
the sunday times of london said that despite their cautious 
public statements scottish investigators told a secret 
fivenation summit of security services that charges are now 
possible against certain persons 
the report said that police heading the international manhunt 
told the meeting in meckenheim west germany that because of 
extradition obstacles some suspects might have to be tried abroad 
the newspaper said leaders of security services in britain west 
germany the united states sweden and malta attended the summit 
it did not identify the source of its information or say when the 
meeting occurred 
a spokesman for scotlands crown office speaking anonymously in 
keeping with british custom said the lord advocate has no 
evidence before him with which to initiate warrants or extradition 
proceedings 
lord fraser and chief constable george esson of the dumfries and 
galloway constabulary told a news conference on friday that 
considerable progress had been made in their investigation but that 
no arrests were imminent 
the pan am flight originated in frankfurt west germany and 
changed in london to a larger boeing 747 which exploded over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the 
ground investigators say the blast was caused by a bomb made of a 
plastic explosives and packed in a radiocassette player that was 
placed in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo hold 
about 40 lockerbie residents whose houses were damaged in the 
crash gathered in the rain sunday to witness the dedication of a 
stone memorial to the victims 
a piper played a scottish lament and three clergymen led 
prayers and blessed the red sandstone block memorializing the 
victims 
the sunday times said police have for some time suspected who 
the killers are but would probably wait until their inquiries are 
completed in three or four months before starting criminal 
proceedings 
esson told the news conference he could not put a timetable on 
his investigation he confirmed that ahmed jibrils radical 
palestinian group the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command or pflpgc has been under 
investigation esson also confirmed investigators interest in 
mohammed abu talb a member of another palestinian group the 
popular struggle front who is in jail in sweden awaiting verdicts 
thursday on unrelated bombing charges the sunday times said 
scottish police will interview him monday 
terrorism experts and western media say the pflpgc may have 
been hired by iran to avenge the july 1988 downing of an iran air 
jetliner with 290 people aboard by a us warship in the persian 
gulf iran has denied involvement 
cbs reported in february that the attack was in revenge for the 
1986 us bombing of libya and the us decision to talk with the 
palestine liberation organization they said jibril cleared the 
operation with syrian intelligence and had the full backing of the 
libyan secret service 
in his interview with the weekly newspaper scotland on sunday 
lord fraser said criminal trials would almost certainly take place 
in the united states if it claimed jurisdiction under international 
law on friday he said it was possible trials could be held in 
several countries 
while this is an outrage to scotland i never lose sight of 
the fact that this was intended as a direct assault on american 
sovereignty and for that reason i understand the strength of their 
feeling of their claim to american jurisdiction 
lord fraser was quoted as saying that scotland would not compete 
with the united states to extradite suspects from other countries 
unless a country holding a suspect refused an extradition request 
because the united states has the death penalty 
if on the other hand the united states was in that position 
to secure extradition when the united kingdom couldnt i want 
these people brought to justice and i wouldnt stand in the way of 
anything he was quoted as saying 
lord fraser was quoted as saying he considered winding down the 
police inquiry during the summer because of lack of progress but 
police then discovered new leads pointing to the mediterranean 
island of malta 
unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase bomb was 
transferred to flight 103 in frankfurt from an air malta flight 
some reported that police have traced scorched clothing and an 
umbrella in the suitcase to malta 
transport secretary cecil parkinson said sunday that britains 
airports are more secure now than at the time of the bombing 
particularly for american aircraft which are regarded as a higher 
risk than ours

exit polls showed freemarket champion 
fernando collor de mello had defeated his socialist adversary by a 
narrow margin sunday in brazils first free presidential election 
since 1960 
initial returns late sunday showed collor de mello running neck 
and neck with luis inacio da silva 
many of the millions who turned out waved campaign flags and 
sported candidates buttons in a climate that appeared totally free 
of political or military intimidation 
unofficial results gave collor de mello 141 million votes with 
37 percent counted leftist luis inacio lula da silva had 14 
million globo tv the nations largest network said 
the superior electoral courts official count far behind with 
just 12 percent of the vote tallied gave da silva 452780 votes 
or 44 percent and collor de mello 408061 or 39 percent the rest 
of the votes were blank nullified or abstentions 
election officials said final results would be known in three 
days 
collor de mello a member of one of brazils wealthiest families 
and former governor and rep da silva a former lathe worker and 
union chief appeared to be in a dead heat when the polls opened 
but one survey by the brazilian institute of public opinion and 
statistics gave collor de mello of the rightist national 
reconstruction party 52 percent of the vote in an exit poll the 
institute interviewed 1218 brazilians after they voted in 95 
cities between 10 am and 4 pm 
da silva of the radical left workers party had 48 percent of 
the vote according to the institute 
we are predicting a victory for collor de mello by 25 million 
to 4 million votes carlos augusto montenegro director of the 
polling company said in a live televised interview 
a second exit poll by the datafolha polling institute gave 
515 percent to collor de mello and 485 percent to da silva after 
11995 people were questioned in 223 cities nationwide between 8 
am and 4 pm datafolha said 
the exit polls buoyed officials in the collor de mello camp 
we are not celebrating yet but we are relieved because the 
polls are confirming our expectations of victory said claudio 
humberto rosa e silva collor de mellos chief spokesman 
officials of da silvas party said it was too early to concede 
we need to get the end of the vote counting before conceding 
anything eduardo suplicy a member of the workers partys board 
of directors said in a televised interview 
from the amazon rain forest to the concrete sprawl of brazils 
southeastern cities lines of voters began forming before sunrise 
polls opened at 8 am and closed at 5 pm 2 pm est 
although voters in line then were allowed to cast ballots 
unofficial reports from polling stations in several major cities 
showed turnout lower than anticipated 
election officials attributed this in part to heavy rains in 
central northeastern and far southern brazil 
rain also caused the deaths of four people in northern brazil 
when two trucks carrying voters to polling stations overturned on 
slippery roads 
the workers party complained that in some cities da silva 
voters couldnt get to the polls because private bus companies 
idled their vehicles it asked federal election officials to 
investigate 
some 82 million voters across latin americas biggest nation 
were registered for the election seen as a huge step toward the 
return of full democracy after a rightist military regime ruled 
from 1964 to 1985 
the new president takes office march 15 for a fiveyear term 
the current president jose sarney took office in 1985 after he 
was picked by an electoral college controlled by the military 
regime 
the election also was seen as a referendum on the past two 
decades which have been marked by 1500 percent annual inflation 
sinking real wages and corruption 
despite wild street rallies that capped a week of mudslinging by 
both candidates voting was peaceful across the country 
da silva supporters jammed brasilias confettilittered business 
district in cars honking horns and waving huge redandwhite flags 
collor de mello 40 voted in his home district of maceio the 
capital of alagoas state on brazils northeastern atlantic tip 
i am confident in the grand victory the brazilian people will 
obtain with our proposal of rebuilding this country he said he 
later flew to brasilia to follow the vote count 
the burly da silva 44 kissed his ballot as he cast it in the 
southeastern industrial city of sao bernardo do campo on the 
outskirts of sao paulo brazils biggest city 
today is the happiest day of my life said the former 
factory worker dressed in a red tshirt and jeans he drove to a 
friends ranch to await the final results 
collor de mello and da silva were the top votegetters in a 
field of 21 candidates in balloting nov 15 neither obtained the 
majority needed to win and sundays runoff was scheduled 
collor de mello campaigned for a freemarket economy and an end 
to government corruption he was backed by business leaders the 
military and the media 
he tried to portray his adversary as a radical who favored 
violent marxist revolution 
da silva also had the support of the brazil popular front a 
coalition that includes marxists unionists and the dominant 
liberal wing of brazils powerful roman catholic church 
da silva said he supports redistribution of land and wealth 
reforms in education and health care and a moratorium on brazils 
110 billion foreign debt 
he criticized his opponent as a media creation with ties to the 
ruling class and the former military regime 
the last popularly elected president of brazil was janio 
quadros he resigned in 1961 after seven months in office citing 
occult forces 
a rightwing military regime overthrew quadros successor joao 
goulart and ruled from 19641985

a national commission is reconsidering 
its accreditation of connecticuts state police because the 
department secretly taped telephone calls between suspects and 
their attorneys the hartford courant reported sunday 
the commission on accreditation of law enforcement agencies inc 
has given the police until the end of the month to document that 
its policies in 1988 complied with a requirement that suspects be 
given confidential access to lawyers the newspaper said 
the commission also called on the department to explain its 
taping operations the courant said 
the issue of secret taping arose in a manslaughter trial in 
october and controversy snowballed last month when the courant 
reported that the state police routinely taperecorded telephone 
conversations at state police barracks including calls between 
suspects and lawyers 
the disclosures led to the forced resignation of the 
departments head lester j forst a federal grand jury is 
investigating the practice and congress is scheduled to begin 
hearings on the issue monday a group of attorneys has sued the 
state on behalf of prisoners 
taperecording telephone calls is legal in certain 
circumstances such as with a judges permission or when one of the 
people talking knows the call is being recorded but recording 
calls between lawyers and clients is forbidden under federal law 
the courant reported earlier this month that it found evidence 
that suspectattorney phone calls may have been monitored in 
several other states including west virginia and utah 
the newspaper reported sunday that state police officials 
assured the accrediting commission more than a year ago that they 
guaranteed privacy for suspects talking to lawyers the paper cited 
a february 1988 report from the nonprofit commission which 
accredits police departments across the country 
the connecticut department is one of only nine state forces in 
the country to win full accreditation the department prepared 18 
months for the evaluation and paid the commission 14620 for it 
bernard r sullivan who replaced forst as the states public 
safety commissioner and head of the state police said he wrote the 
commission recently to suggest it consider setting a specific 
standard on police taping 
after problems caused by taping in connecticut and elsewhere 
were solved sullivan said this may turn out to be a very 
positive thing for policing 
as part of the accreditation process four commission inspectors 
pored over documents scrutinized equipment and interviewed 
department members for five days 
police who knew of the secret taping did not tell commission 
inspectors said ken medeiros executive director of the

american soldiers in battle gear 
guarded base perimeters sunday after a us officer was killed a 
second wounded and a navy couple beaten in the worst 
uspanamanian confrontation in 25 years us officials said 
the white house deplored the killing and termed it a 
consequence of panamas being under the rule of gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
panamanian troopers used trucks and buses to block streets 
leading to noriegas headquarters after the violence saturday 
night panamanian officials said the americans had wounded a 
panamanian soldier and two civilians 
a us southern command statement said the slain officer was 
off duty unarmed and in civilian clothes when he and three 
others were stopped by panamanian soldiers near the panamanian 
defense headquarters in the old section of panama city 
the panamanians tried to drag the americans from their car and 
fired at them as they drove off killing one officer it said his 
identity was withheld 
in washington a defense department statement confirmed that a 
us officer was fatally shot and said a second soldier was grazed 
on the ankle by a bullet 
the panamanian defense forces accused us officers of a 
provocation without mentioning the americans death 
the pentagon gave this additional account 
a us navy lieutenant and his wife were stopped at the same 
roadblock as the other soldiers a halfhour earlier and witnessed 
the shooting the panamanians then blindfolded both with masking 
tape and interrogated them for about four hours 
they repeatedly beat and kicked the man in the groin and head 
and threatened to kill him if he did not give information on his 
duties and unit 
his wifes head was cut when she was slammed against a wall and 
she later collapsed panamanian soldiers also threatened her 
sexually before the pair was escorted back to an avenue that 
connects with us military bases and released 
us defense secretary dick cheney said in his statement the 
lack of discipline and control in the panamanian defense forces is 
further evidence that panama is a country without a government 
panamanian and us military officers were reported sunday to be 
meeting to discuss the incident opposition politicians said the 
southern command refused to comment 
the contact was reported to be through the joint board a 
liaison between the two countries military forces that deals with 
panama canal security and defense 
col ronald sconyers a southern command spokesman said the 
us officers had made a wrong turn and were lost 
the panamanian statement said the us officers had broken 
through checkpoints and fired at the headquarters building 
wounding a soldier and two civilians including a 1yearold girl 
president bush was informed of the situation by national 
security adviser brent scowcroft white house deputy press 
secretary roman popadiuk said in washington 
we deplore this act of violence we are presently looking into 
the circumstances of this incident popadiuk said the noriega 
regime is isolated both domestically and internationally and has 
been using force and intimidation to thwart the will of the 
panamanian people acts such as those of last evening are the 
consequence of such a regime 
word of the death and rumors of us retaliation spread quickly 
sunday morning people at a gas station spoke of the imminent 
arrival of the americans 
us soldiers mobilized along the perimeters of us 
installations a few miles northwest of panama city lines of 
armored personnel carriers and trucks stood at the ready inside the 
boundary of fort clayton 
combat units were not seen at us bases closer to panama city 
including southern command headquarters at quarry heights which 
borders the capital to the west 
the 12000 us troops stationed in the panama canal area were 
restricted to base and only authorized movement was permitted 
a golf course at fort amador a base shared by us and 
panamanian military units was deserted sunday a causeway where 
panamanians picnic near the fort was empty except for a salsa group 
rehearsing 
the nearby bridge of the americas across the panama canal was 
open 
panamas opposition leaders refused to comment directly about 
the shooting saying the information they had received was 
confusing 
but christian democratic leader ricardo arias calderon said the 
confrontation was the result of other clashes between panama and 
the united states in recent months 
the bloodiest previous incident between the nations occurred on 
jan 9 1964 in the time of the old panama canal zone which 
consisted of a 10milewide strip across panama that was considered 
us territory 
us police and soldiers clashed with panamanian rioters over 
the display of the us and panamanian flags at a high school four 
us soldiers and 22 panamanians died and panama broke diplomatic 
relations with the united states for three months 
noriega who was de facto leader through his control of the 
defense forces was named chief of government on friday by a 
rubberstamp assembly it said noriegas leadership was needed to 
confront a state of war caused by us economic sanctions and 
other efforts to oust the general 
panama and the us government have been at odds since february 
1988 when noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in the 
united states 
he denies the charges and says washington wants to oust him to 
make it easier for the united states to renege on the panama canal 
treaties which transfer the canal to panama at the end of the 
century and close us military installations here

britains 15 percent interest rates are 
discouraging shoppers from splurging on christmas gifts and 
threatening the countrys retailers with the worst selling season 
in nine years 
many stores are packed with people but many seem to be 
modernday scrooges and arent buying much christmas sales are 
patchy 
a lastminute flurry of purchases is expected but this wont 
salvage the crucial season experts say 
the vote on this christmas will be that it was a very poor 
christmas said nick bubb a retail analyst with the investment 
firm morgan stanley international in london its going to be 
flat 
the disappointing prechristmas season has prompted many stores 
to start slashing prices before britains traditional january 
sales many also likely will defy the law requiring them to close 
on sundays and risk a fine of 1600 to stay open on the day before 
christmas 
the poor sales trend reflects a monthslong downturn and its 
bad news for retailers profits and their stock prices which 
generally have been depressed on londons stock exchange 
but its good news for consumers who are benefiting from sales 
in jewelry consumer electronics clothing and home furnishings 
its also positive for prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government because slower sales are a sign that its 
antiinflation policy is working 
its been a bad year christmas will make or break some 
people said harry shepherd director of the oxford street 
association oxford street is londons main shopping street 
shepherd said he expects retailers to eke out an overall 1 
percent to 2 percent sales gain but that wont be enough to cover 
higher costs 
the tiffanies of the world appear to be doing ok on the basis 
that the very rich will always be rich and the retailers selling 
three pairs of knickers for 99 pence are still doing very well 
its the mass in the middle who are suffering he said 
consumer electronics and furniture retailers will be hurt the 
most bubb predicted 
experts agree that trading conditions are tough because of the 
higher interest rates which the government has pushed to an 
eightyear peak to fight resurgent inflation inflation is running 
at an annual rate of 77 percent 
the higher interest rates have squeezed british homeowners who 
mostly hold adjustable rate mortgages and have seen their monthly 
payments climb sharply 
before the economy began overheating more than 18 months ago 
britain enjoyed a fiveyear steady economic expansion fueled by 
consumer demand 
but growth in consumer spending has slowed from 7 percent in 
1988 to an expected 4 percent in 1989 and is predicted to slow to 
1 percent in 1990 
the slowdown has been showing up in the governments retail 
sales figures 
in november sales declined a sharp 08 percent from october 
the government announced recently that meant sales for the latest 
three months rose 11 percent over a year ago the lowest such 
growth rate since june 1982 figures from the central statistical 
office show 
the retailers themselves are having to pay the higher interest 
rates and rents are pricey too wage costs also are up because 
fewer teenage workers are available 
although the inflation rate is high retailers cant raise 
prices to enhance their profits bubb said 
their promotions arent going to help the bottom line 
ratners jewelry stores for example are offering the equivalent 
of 80 gift vouchers for every 240 worth of sales while the tandy 
consumer electronics chain has slashed 8 off a radio cassette 
player to 48 
the longerterm outlook is gloomy too 
the confederation of british industry the countrys major 
business group recently said one of its regular surveys showed 
that retailers and wholesalers anticipate a deterioration in 
business over the coming three months 
it was the first time since the survey was launched in 1983 that 
such a decline was expected

for 25 years tom carrolls volunteer 
service corps has sent retired executives overseas to lend their 
business expertise to foreign companies 
now several of his retirees are getting ready to pack their bags 
and head for a new frontier eastern europe 
carrolls organization the international executive service 
corps has embarked on an ambitious project to help meat 
processors textile factories and other governmentowned businesses 
in poland the first executive left in october and others will 
head for the airport after the first of the year 
the projects are a way for polish operations to learn western 
businesses ways while giving retired executives an opportunity to 
pass along their skills the governmentowned companies pay the 
executives expenses and also provide interpreters 
the work in poland comes as eastern european nations undergo 
revolutionary changes in their governments and economies 
this is such a fantastic magical time in the history of man 
it is a major renaissance of our time an industrial revolution 
said carroll who keeps miniature flags of several countries in his 
ninth floor office in stamford overlooking long island sound 
weve got plenty of men we hope will play a major part in the 
progress in hungary and poland said carroll the chief executive 
officer of lever brothers before becoming president of the corps in 
1981 he is one of 50 paid employees 
the corps which has 10700 volunteers was founded in 1964 by 
david rockefeller and sol linowitz who separately thought up the 
idea of sending retired executives overseas since then volunteers 
have worked on more than 12000 projects in 90 countries 
the projects in the east bloc began in 1986 when a volunteer 
went to hungary to help a meat processing plant 
it was so successful that when the guy went home they wanted 
him back carroll said 
the first polish project began in october when a former 
manufacturing executive left his texas home to advise a synthetic 
fiber operation another 10 to 25 projects are expected next year 
said vice president charles neiswender 
pete moyer one of 39 executive recruiters sat in carrolls 
office last week and briefed him on some of the projects such as 
plans to send a former executive with international harvester to 
advise a polish tractor factory 
he said a former rca executive was leaving jan 5 to advise the 
managers of an old television tube plant another retiree will 
leave in april to advise a textile manufacturer 
the corps is still looking for an executive to advise a copper 
mining and smelting operation 
officials said many poles already understand the way a 
capitalist economy works partly because of the black market that 
has flourished through the 40 years of communist rule that 
officially ended in september 
but moyer said the governmentowned operations need help in 
organization 
this picture tube outfit said they have 5500 employees and 
over 140 organization units each of which has its own program and 
plan much of the time not being consistent with what top 
management sees as the overall plan he said so they need 
help 
neiswender said employee motivation is another concern among 
workers not used to the incentive system 
many of these governmentowned companies have so many 
employees that productive people are unproductive because they have 
to trip on and step over the unproductive he said 
but moyer who worked on one of 17 projects in hungary said the 
eastern europeans are eager to learn 
what struck me was the hospitality and from a philosophical 
point of view the eagerness to learn the knowhow of american and 
western european practices to understand how to run an 
organization he said 
these are smart people theyre bright people theyre not 
saying were dumb teach us something we dont know theyre 
saying were coming from a different way teach us something 
different

the world bank the biggest source of aid to 
the third world is planning new help to eastern europe but will 
not reduce aid to developing countries according to bank vice 
president stanley fischer 
as far as the world bank is concerned we dont see how 
lending to eastern europe is going to detract from our lending to 
africa and latin america fischer the banks top economist said 
at a news conference friday 
bank president barber w conable said the bank had 350 million 
worth of loans prepared for projects in poland and might lend as 
much as 1 billion more in the coming year so far poland has not 
had any loans from the bank 
as poland stabilizes if it does its very likely that our 
lending program will increase fischer said 
in the year that ended june 30 hungary got 345 million in 
loans yugoslavia 198 million and china 13 billion there would 
have been more for china but conable cut off new loans when 
beijing violently crushed the movement for more democracy last june 
the banks annual report on third world debt released friday 
predicted that the money owed by developing countries would rise 
next year to 1319 trillion from this years 129 trillion it 
estimated that this year third world countries will be paying out 
516 billion in principal and interest beyond what they will be 
getting in new loans 
third world governments complain that this outflow leaves them 
little to put into schools roads farms and other public 
improvements 
the banks loans for the year totalled 213 billion most of 
which it borrowed on world markets 
the united states is the biggest shareholder in the bank which 
has its headquarters in washington china hungary poland and 
yugoslavia are already among the 152 countries that own it 
czechoslovakia is trying to join and the soviet union has said it 
would like to

prices in november were only 59 percent higher 
than a year earlier the government said sunday in announcing in 
the lowest inflation rate china has seen since 1987 
however the government was forced again to bail out large 
stateowned factories hard hit by the austerity program that has 
reduced inflation 
the official china daily said the peoples bank of china the 
central bank granted the equivalent of 638 million in loans last 
week to the state sector which the government says must be 
preserved as a pillar of the socialist system despite its 
inefficiencies 
similar loans totalling 19 billion were reported in october 
and november 
the china daily said the peoples bank and other banks 
anticipate making total emergency loans of 212 billion to 
stateowned industries in the fourth quarter to keep production 
from sliding further 
industrial production dropped 21 percent in october from 
october 1988 its first decline in a decade and in november was up 
less than 1 percent over november 1988 
some economists have pointed to the sluggish industrial 
performance as a sign that the economy has entered a recession 
the government clamped down on official spending new 
construction and bank loans in september 1988 in an effort to cut 
inflation that peaked at about 40 percent chinas highest rate 
since the communists took power in 1949 
since then inflation has dropped sharply and the china daily 
said vegetable prices in october were actually 46 percent lower 
than in october 1988 while fruit prices also declined 
however the austerity policy has left many companies so short 
of cash that they cannot purchase raw materials forcing the 
government to issue special loans to aid priority sectors such as 
the large state factories the austerity also has resulted in a 
backlog of unsold consumer goods including automobiles and 
television sets which were in high demand last year 
when foreign jointventure car makers including shanghai 
volkswagen and guangzhou peugeot appealed for help the government 
spent 94 million to buy 7440 cars the state also issued 
emergency loans to grain bureaus so they could purchase the fall 
harvest 
the repeated emergency loans have dealt a blow to the 
governments plan to balance its budget earlier this year the 
government projected a 22 billion deficit but western economists 
say it could be four times that much 
they say the governments method of controlling inflation by 
clamping down on credit has only propelled the economy toward a 
recession without resolving the causes of inflation such as the 
irrational price structure 
the official xinhua news agency which reported the november 
inflation figure said retail sales dropped by 1 percent from the 
previous november bank savings were up more than 25 percent from 
january to 1068 billion

irans advance sales of oil have yielded 
26 billion and it has saved 800 million in imported petroleum 
products since its abadan refinery resumed operations in april a 
newspaper reported sunday 
in an interview with the daily kayhan oil minister gholamreza 
aqazadeh also reiterated his previous prediction that members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries would soon be 
able to produce as much oil as they want 
aqazadeh in excerpts from the interview quoted by the islamic 
republic news agency said the members of opec were nearing their 
top production capacity and demand for oil would be strong enough 
that quotas would become unnecessary 
he said a decision was taken by iran to sell oil in advance 
raising 26 billion because of the favorable condition of the 
market 
he said the contracts were to receive cash now and supply the 
oil within 12 to 18 months which truly cannot be considered 
extra oil revenue but rather a more flexible sales policy 
aqazadeh said future iranian oilrelated revenues from 1989 to 
1994 were estimated at about 83 billion including crude oil gas 
exports to the soviet union sales of liquefied gas and other 
related products 
since the reopening in april of the huge abadan refinery on the 
gulf coast near the iraniraq border iran has saved 800 million 
on imported refined products aqazadeh said 
he also said the arak refinery with a capacity of 150000 
barrels a day and the bandar abbas refinery with a capacity of 
230000 barrels a day would soon become operational
