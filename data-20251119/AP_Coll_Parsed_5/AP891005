ptl evangelist jim bakker was convicted 
thursday of using his television show to defraud followers of 37 
million money the jury foreman said corrupted a minister who 
started out to do good 
he was called by god but eventually the money became too much 
for him said foreman ricky hill who said during jury selection 
that he was a christian we kept looking for something from the 
defense and we never saw it 
bakker faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and 5 
million in fines the us district court jury convicted him of all 
24 counts in the indictment which charged he oversold lodging 
guarantees called lifetime partnerships at his heritage usa 
religious retreat 
the government said 152903 partnerships were sold producing 
158 million 
the message is you cant lie to the people and use television 
and the mails to get them to send you money said prosecutor 
deborah smith it doesnt matter who you are or how well known 
you are you simply cant do it 
defense lawyer george c davis said the verdict would be 
appealed 
prosecutors said bakker diverted 37 million in ministry funds 
for personal use while knowing ptl was in financial trouble he 
used money from ptl for vacation homes in california and florida a 
lakefront parsonage a houseboat rollsroyce and mercedes cars and 
more peculiar luxuries such as an airconditioned doghouse 
bakkers wife tammy faye said she and her husband would return 
to orlando fla where they moved the diehard remnants of their 
ministry 
its not over until its over added mrs bakker during a 
news conference after the verdict hundreds of bakker faithful and 
the lunchtime curious flocked around the courthouse and mrs 
bakker serenaded them with a verse of on christ the solid rock 
i stand all other ground is sinking sand 
bakker was freed later thursday on 250000 bond imposed by us 
district court judge robert potter the judge set sentencing for 
oct 24 
im going to keep my faith in god and im going to go see 
tammy now i feel sad but encouraged in god bakker said smiling 
in a brief midafternoon statement to reporters he said he was 
still innocent of the charges against me 
potter said he granted bond reluctantly because bakker faithful 
had a jim jones mentality and might help him flee the country 
they think he could walk on water potter said 
davis declared the reference to the 1978 murdersuicide of 900 
followers of jim jones cult in jonestown guyana horrible 
absolutely uncalled for 
bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read tears 
welled in the eyes of mrs bakker who also received large bonuses 
from ptl but was not charged with any crimes 
the jury foreman said he was unswayed by bakkers testimony in 
which he defended his earnings as reasonable for someone who raised 
millions of dollars for the work of the lord 
he was a man of god he got corrupt and i feel sorry for the 
man hill said he said that in the day and a half of jury 
deliberations the most disagreement was when the fraud started 
trial testimony showed ptl paid 265000 to jessica hahn to 
cover up the sexual encounter with bakker that led to his 
resignation fom ptl in 1987 
im sorry i dont have a song to sing like tammy but i know 
this is gods amazing grace ms hahn said in a statement after 
the conviction 
i dont feel sad for what happened to bakker she said 
id like to look him in the eye and tell him get out the 
rowboat you cant walk on water 
this is going to go down in history as saying you can touch 
even the mightiest of men who are armed with bibles white collars 
and microphones she said todays verdict is not attacking 
god but the people who are abusing god 
reaction to the conviction varied among trial spectators 
i think its wonderful said beverly sparrow he deserves 
everything hes going to get 
my faith was that he would be set free on all charges said 
bill fisher of fort mill sc i still believe he will 
the trial started aug 28 and was interrupted aug 31 when 
bakker didnt come to court his attorneys told the judge bakker 
was in a fetal position with his head under a couch 
after a brief hearing about the emotional collapse potter 
ordered bakker sent to a prison psychiatric ward he was declared 
fit to resume the trial sept 6 
a key to the governments case was the sale of about 153000 
partnerships between 1984 and 1987 the partnerships typically 
promised three free nights stay annually for life in exchange for 
a 1000 donation and bakker testified that there was room for 
211000 partners government evidence showed that bakker had only 
258 rooms available 
several partners testified they were never able to use the 
lodging bakker had promised bakkers former secondincommand 
richard dortch indicated in his testimony that bakker knew he was 
making false promises 
dortch 57 pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to two counts of 
wire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy he was

an artist said he felt like he was painting on 
a global canvas when he winged copies of a rembrandt angel around 
the world via fax to mark the 320th anniversary of the masters 
death 
its kind of a spiritual dimension of computer technology 
combined with art said max alexenberg chairman of pratt 
institutes fine arts department these are rembrandt images for 
the tv generation 
alexenberg on wednesday dispatched the computer copy of the 
350yearold pen and ink drawing angel announcing the birth of 
samson to manoah from the atampt infoquest center in new york the 
city originally known as nieuw amsterdam to the rembrandt house 
in amsterdam 
the first of 24 sections of the enlarged image arrived instantly 
at the rembrandt house where alexenberg said he put a fax machine 
on rembrandts etching press this summer 
the rembrandt house relayed the computer copy to the israel 
museum in jerusalem chosen because biblical pictures were 
rembrandts major subject from there the drawing was sent to 
schools and museums in tokyo los angeles and back to new york 
alexenberg said rembrandt was something of a technology buff 
using the latest equipment and techniques then available 
rembrandt would have liked this alexenberg said

soviets long considered photocopiers as dangerous 
as guns or explosives and police strictly regulated their use 
now authorities say modern wordprocessing technology makes their 
job impossible and they want out 
the interior ministry responsible for police and law 
enforcement intends to relinquish control over the purchasing 
possession and functioning of duplicating and copying equipment 
the government daily izvestia reported wednesday night 
with the help of computers one can publish an entire 
newspaper and this in any number of copies izvestia quoted v 
vashchenko the interior ministry official in charge of policing 
the use of copiers as saying 
its impossible to control this process by any means and 
moreover do we need to 
vashchenkos remarks reflect the relaxed official attitude 
toward access to technology that could reproduce literary or 
political works hostile to state ideology and toward freer 
selfexpression in general 
limiting citizens abilities to broadcast their views has been a 
soviet obsession since the days of lenin as izvestia noted soon 
after the communists took power in 1917 even typewriters had to be 
registered with authorities and that requirement was only recently 
lifted 
in another sign of change under president mikhail s gorbachev 
a proposed law on the press being considered by the legislature 
outlaws state censorship and orders governmental bodies to answer 
questions posed by reporters 
under current regulations the purchasing installation and use 
of almost any duplicating equipment in the soviet union requires 
the ministrys special permission izvestia said 
inside the ministry about 1000 inspectors police copiers and 
duplicating equipment the paper said it wryly noted they work in 
ministry division also responsible for questions of control over 
storing firearms poisons explosives 
those specialists however are not numerous enough to patrol 
the 60000 sites possessing copying equipment so rankandfile 
policemen often have to keep unauthorized people from making 
kseroks as photocopies are called in russian 
counters on the stateowned machines record how many copies are 
made and each use must be entered in a log nevertheless izvestia 
said police find and confiscate unauthorized copies of material 
ranging from the abcs of sex to reading fortunes from coffee 
grounds 
recently commercial photocopy enterprises opened in moscow as 
part of joint economic ventures with western firms but what they 
can duplicate for their soviet customers is still limited by a 
15yearold government order 
under pretext of protecting copyrights it sharply narrows the 
circle of texts which are allowed to be duplicated a 
dvoyeglazov acting director of the 6monthold reprocenter in 
northern moscow was quoted by izvestia as saying but what 
copyrights are nobody in this country knows 
dvoyeglazov spoke wistfully of the west where anyone who 
desires can drop in a coin and print anything 
until that happens copying something will remain a headache for 
average soviets whether they are engineers who want to reproduce 
an article from a technical journal a student who needs to publish 
his doctoral dissertion or a mother who wants to send a favorite 
recipe to her daughter 
izvestia said the interior ministry was detailing how it 
proposed to get out of the copiermonitoring business but the 
newspaper did not elaborate 
lack of access to photocopiers or other means of printing gave 
rise to an entire school of soviet literature samizdat or 
the selfpublished underground dissident writings of the 1970s and 
early 1980s that gave soviets information and views not then 
reported in staterun media 
on brittle flimsy paper interlarded with carbons activists 
inscribed the works of alexander solzhenitsyn roy medvedev andrei 
amalrik and other contemporaries in typewritten texts whose lines 
were often so fuzzy and close together they made a readers head 
swim 
since gorbachev became soviet leader in 1985 many of those 
works have been reprinted in official newspapers and magazines

the bush administration said wednesday it was 
not asked and did not promise to aid in tuesdays failed coup 
against panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega but reserves the 
right to use military force on its own timetable 
amid sharp criticism from congress that the united states should 
have stepped in to help topple noriega officials said the 
administration was in the dark tuesday about what was happening in 
panama with no details about the coups chances of success there 
were suggestions though that a clear effort to restore democracy 
might have brought us help to the rebels 
us officials asking not to be identified said the rebels had 
noriega in custody for four to five hours but then let him go an 
account substantially confirmed by noriega aides in panama 
its crazy i dont understand it an official said when 
asked why the insurgents decided to free noriega 
bush was buffeted by words from congress where one senior 
republican said we blew it and a democratic colleague spoke 
scornfully of cold feet 
in the senate jesse helms rnc proposed an amendment to an 
antidrug bill to authorize bush to use us troops to forcefully 
remove noriega from power and bring him to trial in the united 
states on the drug charges already pending against him the move 
was seen as symbolic since bush already has such powers 
secretary of state james a baker iii testifying before a 
senate committee indicated the united states had kept its distance 
tuesday because the rebels had little possibility of removing 
noriega brushing aside criticism of the us reaction baker said 
its easy to be an armchair general 
the united states retains the option to use american forces 
that option has never been ruled out baker told the senate 
finance committee but if youre going to risk american lives 
its the presidents view that you do so on your own timetable 
you dont do so on the basis of someone elses plans and in 
response to rapidly changing circumstances 
defense secretary dick cheney told reporters on capitol hill 
that it was not clear at the time that noriega was being held but 
the bush administration now believes that was the case 
clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us 
cheney said 
cheney said it was not a prodemocracy group that had taken 
over the pdf it was more of a power struggle within the pdf 
itself 
cheney said there was even some doubt whether the coup attempt 
had been staged by noriega 
the individual who was reputed to be in charge of the coup was 
a man who was a noted confidante of mr noriega and most people 
looking at that set of facts who the individual was who was 
involved would conclude that it was very possible that this was a 
setup by noriega cheney said in an interview with cbs news 
in that same interview cheney also said the united states has 
given refuge to the family of one of the individuals involved in 
the coup attempt 
quoting an unidentified member of congress who attended a 
briefing by cheney the new york times said in thursday editions 
that cheney reported the us military in panama had given 
sanctuary to several officers who took part in the uprising 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the united 
states had been tipped off about a coup attempt during the weekend 
by a third party and was in touch with relatively lowlevel 
members of the rebel force during the fighting 
one administration official said the united states would have 
been happy to step in with force if it had been requested 
the us people down there were under instructions to look 
for an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up said the 
official insisting on anonymity as i understand if they were 
asked for assistance to support a prodemocracy movement they would 
have done it 
fitzwater said just about everything about the coup argued 
against us military involvement especially lack of reliable 
information 
asked if the united states might have helped the rebels if they 
had agreed to turn over noriega fitzwater said i dont know i 
can just tell you the way it unfolded 
fitzwater said the person who alerted the united states to the 
planned coup told us with an idea of seeing how we would react to 
it and basically our reaction was that we would protect property 
treaty rights and people but that was it 
baker and fitzwater refused to confirm reports that the united 
states had given refuge to coup leaders and their families in 
panama 
noriega blamed the uprising on the united states saying the 
proof is that american troops closed access routes to the barracks 
just as they closed the panamerican highway 
fitzwater said wednesday we did move forces in a position to 
secure the causeway and the bridge of the americas as a means of 
protecting us citizens who were on the base those are the major 
access routes to our base 
the us southern commands headquarters is about onehalf mile 
from the main panamanian defense forces barracks where the violent 
coup attempt occurred 
the failed attempt was a major setback for the united states 
long campaign to oust noriega from power 
the administration said there were two ways of interpreting the 
results one was that noriega had strengthened his hand by 
overcoming the coup another reading was that it had demonstrated 
opposition to noriegas leadershipas well as divisions within 
panamas military forces 
embracing the second interpretation fitzwater said that may 
be a good omen for the long term 
few in congress were putting it that way 
its a major setback for our foreign policy said rep 
william broomfield of michigan senior republican on the house 
foreign relations committee it raises questions whether people 
down there can ever have confidence in the united states 
rep ike skelton dmo likened the situation to the failed 
attempt by exiled cubans to invade at the bay of pigs in 1961 when 
us support evaporated at the crucial moment 
we had full knowledge they were going to do this im afraid 
its a matter of cold feet skelton said it was a conscious 
decision by bush not to assist im furious about it he said 
he had gotten his information about a white house decision from a 
senior pentagon official 
there were some dissenting voices 
the president was absolutely correct said rep joseph 
mcdade rpa were not an invading force wed like to see 
general noriega out but i support the president in what he did 
andrew h card jr a senior adviser to bush and deputy to white 
house chief of staff john sununu told reporters the white house 
position was that panamas military forces should do everything 
they could against noriega before there was any outside 
intervention 
we were not invited to participate card said we did not 
offer to participate

eager to present a changing face 
as a crimefighting force the kgb has asked to station an officer 
at the soviet embassy in the netherlands a dutch police official 
says 
the soviet police attache would be the first such official 
in any soviet diplomatic mission in the western world said john de 
blaey a senior hague police administrator 
de blaey has just returned from a weeklong trip to moscow 
where he said the request was made to him by kgb chief vladimir a 
kryuchkov 
officially known as the state security committee the kgb is 
believed to be the worlds most extensive secret police force and 
espionage organization 
dutch officials have warned that moscow is stepping up its 
espionage efforts especially in the area of high technology 
although expulsions of soviet citizens from the netherlands have 
been extremely rare in recent years 
the new kgb officer would be a crimefighter concentrating on 
exchanging information with dutch police on issues like extortion 
fraud and drug smuggling de blaey told the associated press on 
wednesday 
he would be a kgb figure in the new style and act in public as 
a kgb officer said de blaey 
kruychkov and moscow police chief ps bogdanov said they could 
use such a liaison officer abroad because their nation is not a 
member of interpol the worlds biggest international police 
information network de blaey said 
the interior ministry which would have to approve the request 
could not immediately be reached for comment 
mr kryuchkov said that the kgb is developing into a kind of 
fbi in addition to its traditional intelligencegathering task 
de blaey said

theres a lot of strange stuff happening 
out there tales of poltergeists swamp monsters maybe even 
dinosaurs still crashing through african jungles and mark 
chorvinsky has opened a strange hotline to hear all about it 
the world is a pretty strange place says chorvinsky 35 a 
blackclad archivist of the bizarre and investigator of the weird 
who lives on a quiet treeshaded street in this washington suburb 
everybody knows of something strange that has happened to 
them but they never talk about it he says the only time its 
safe to talk it seems is around a campfire or during halloween 
now they can dial the strange hotline at 19008208361 to 
share a scary encounter with the unknown or hear a tape of 
chorvinsky describing some of his favorites among them are the 
lizard man of south carolina the horrific winged jersey devil the 
manila vampire and a haunted stretch of rural maryland highway 
where the dreaded snarly yow has been spotted by motorists 
chorvinsky in fact recently listened to one of the most 
amazing stories ive ever heard from a taped message left by an 
anonymous hotline caller 
it was the tale of an arizona woman who bought a giant cactus as 
a house plant a few days later she was alarmed to see the cactus 
moving its prickly arms she fled the house with her children just 
before the cactus exploded releasing swarms of scorpions in her 
living room 
thats the sort of thing that sends agreeable tingles down 
chorvinskys spine and fills the pages of strange magazine a 
twiceayear compendium of weird happenings that chorvinsky founded 
and edits for an estimated 4000 avid readers 
hes also a professional magician who performed at the white 
house last year an author who is planning a biography of merlin 
the magician and a filmmaker whose movie short strange 
tangents was screened at the american film institute the 
library of congress and film festivals at cannes berlin and los 
angeles 
its about a young sorceress who tries to save her dying 
master with the help of her friend a 3foottall talking 
salamander chorvinsky says 
to help pay the bills he operates a science fiction and magic 
shop in a rockville shopping mall where customers can satisfy their 
appetites for strange schlock the shelves are stuffed with dragons 
and wizards crystal balls ninja swords tarot cards horror movie 
classics and fantasy games titled skulls and scrapfaggot green 
and for laughs batwinged bimbos from hell 
although his bushy hair beard mustache and suit all in black 
give him a slightly fiendish look chorvinsky is nobodys wacko 
hes a goodnatured skeptic who directs a global network of 
tipsters and investigators who track down reports of strange 
phenomena for scholarly discussion in his magazine 
i neither believe nor disbelieve this stuff he said in an 
interview we have many skeptics who read the magazine including 
myself i am skeptical but openminded i doubt everything but i 
accept the possibility of anything 
hes never seen a ufo landing in a corn field but knows that 
the damnedest things fall from the sky including frogs fish 
sugar crystals ice chunks and vast cobwebs spun by airborne 
spiders 
mysterious sea serpents like the loch ness monster may be the 
stuff of ancient folklore he said or they may have existed all 
along as monstrous species of marine life that somehow eluded 
discovery by scientists 
but what about the strange booms and bangs in the night the 
bizarre mirages of entire cities in the sky the spinning wheels of 
light beneath the oceans toads encased in rock but still alive 
the stories that really intrigue me are those that give me the 
greatest feeling of disquieting strangeness chorvinsky said 
the tales so strange they couldnt possibly be explained the 
kind that give you a chill down your spine or make your hair stand 
on end the sort of thing that makes you say ooooh thats 
weird

its the senates turn to decide whether to 
resist or yield to the wrath of millions of retirees angry at being 
forced to pay for expanded medicare benefits for catastrophic 
health care 
if the tally itself was any indication the house barely thought 
twice wednesday before voting to repeal the yearold catastrophic 
health insurance program 
the american people have spoken the house of representatives 
has listened sen william roth rdel observed from across the 
capitol 
the house members hardly needed to debate a deluge of cards and 
letters had sealed the programs fate before the battle was joined 
on the floor 
the 36066 knockout punch was a remarkable reversal for 
legislation that was hailed upon passage just over a year ago as 
landmark legislation the most significant expansion of medicare 
in the great society programs two decades of life 
however a feature that may have contributed to the uproar over 
the program was the fact that it called for collection of money 
from senior citizens to pay for the expanded benefits before they 
took effect 
the senate is poised to grapple with the issue as part of a 
giant budgetcutting reconciliation measure likewise the house 
vote was on an amendment to its version of the budget bill 
final resolution of the catastrophic health plan along with 
other budget issues such as child care and capital gains taxes 
will hinge on a housesenate conference committee and then a final 
vote in both houses 
lawmakers talked wednesday of ratios such as 2000to1 and 
3000to1 among their constituents in favor of repealing the 
catastrophic care plan 
much of the protest was from welltodo seniors facing an income 
tax surtax of up to 800 to help cover the cost of providing the 
new benefits to poorer elderly people some 20 million of whom 
were asked to pay only 48 this year 
congress has heard hardly at all from the poorer senior 
citizens but house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski warned 
his colleagues during the floor debate that the situation was 
destined to change 
five million senior citizens may be complaining about the 
supplemental premium and you may quench their thirst for repeal 
today he said but in the process make no mistake about it 
you will be hurting many more millions of senior citizens whose 
voices have not been heard 
mark my words my friends their voices will be heard in this 
chamber in the very near future 
the house also voted 269156 on wednesday against a plan that 
would restore a small part of the program 
although the medicare catastrophic coverage act grew more costly 
as it rolled through congress with overwhelming support last year 
the main impetus came from president reagan who appealed in his 
last state of the union speech for a plan to shield elderly and 
disabled medicare beneficiaries from the financial ruin of major 
illness 
as enacted it would pay for unlimited hospitalization after a 
onceayear deductible of 560 in 1989 previously medicare 
charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year 
the plan also would cap starting jan 1 the amount that 
beneficiaries must pay for physician services and beginning jan 
1 1991 would phase in a new prescription drug benefit

president bushs decision not to authorize 
military force for a coup attempt against panamanian ruler manuel 
antonio noriega was made amid fears the uprising might be a 
setup by his loyalists and frustrations that us troops were not 
asked to help officials say 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said leaders of the 
failed coup did not seek assistance from the united states and that 
none was offered 
we have traditionally stopped short of this kind of military 
involvement and it was a decision to do that again in this case 
he said wednesday 
however amid sharp criticism from congress about bushs refusal 
to act one administration official said the united states would 
have been happy to intervene if the coup leaders had requested it 
the us military people down there were under instructions 
to look for an opportunity to be of help and it never showed up 
said the official insisting on anonymity not only that it was 
rejected 
as i understand it if they were asked for assistance to 
support a prodemocracy movement they would have done it the 
official said you cant just march in on your own thats what 
has gotten america a bad name for 100 years in latin america 
the official noted that us forces took up positions on a key 
highway and a bridge posing an obstacle for reinforcements for 
noriegas loyalists it wasnt that we were just sitting on our 
rump the official said 
while bush has repeatedly urged the panama defense forces pdf 
to depose noriega fitzwater said we have never said or 
expressed any opinion in terms of direct involvement with a coup or 
anything like that 
defense secretary dick cheney raised doubts about the 
authenticity of the uprising particularly in light of the fact 
that the coups leader maj moises giraldi vega was a close 
confidant of noriega and had helped quash a 1988 rebellion 
this might well have been a setup cheney told reporters 
just before briefing lawmakers on capitol hill 
he did not elaborate on that point although another 
administration official said we didnt know what his giraldis 
motivation was the official who declined to be identified said 
giraldis past allegiance caused people to say can we be sure 
this guys legit 
as the coup unfolded tuesday cheney met at the white house with 
bush and other national security officials a pentagon official 
said various military options were discussed with the president 
another official said when it appeared noriega might have 
been dethroned there were several options considered none of 
which was going in and getting him 
fitzwater said that just about everything about the coup 
argued against us military involvement especially lack of 
reliable information 
he said the united states had been tipped off about the coup 
attempt during the weekend by a third party cheney said that 
in view of giraldis association with noriega it was not at all 
clear this was even a valid report 
us officials said they were astonished to learn that the 
rebels had noriega in custody for several hours tuesday but then 
released him one official said american officials told the coup 
leaders that the united states would be happy to take custody of 
noriega and have him stand trial on drug trafficking charges 
however the coup leaders said they wanted instead to make 
noriega retire 
cheney said clearly they were not of the mind to turn him 
over to us adding that the rebels intent had not been to expel 
or extradite noriega he said 
it was not a prodemocracy group that had taken over the pdf 
it was more of a power struggle within the pdf itself he said

the studio produced the blockbuster movie batman which is 
expected to generate in excess of 1 billion in revenues when all 
ancillary marketing and merchandising rights are counted and 
thats without robin products since the boy wonder wasnt in the 
movie 
production is tentatively set to begin on a batman sequel 
next year that could feature robin 
disney wouldnt kill off goofy colabuono said as a 
businessman i think it was a dumb thing to do to kill off robin 
the original robin who was known as dick grayson when he 
wasnt wearing his mask grew up and became the superhero 
nightwing in dcs the new titans comics 
in the mid1980s he was replaced by another robin who in 
street clothing was a streetwise punk known as jason todd that 
character was killed in an explosion triggered by archenemy the 
joker in an issue released last november 
the latest issues of titans and batman deal with batmans guilt 
and depression over the death 
the four issues of the series in which robin died now fetch 
anywhere from 10 to 50 a copy in mint condition compared with a 
cover price of 75 cents colabuono said 
but the 38yearold dealer whos been a batman buff since he 
first started reading comics at age 7 says many fans shed no tears 
for the punk robin and look forward to a backtotheroots version 
of the boy wonder 
he doesnt have to be a sniveling little teenager like the 
last one colabuono said i think its wonderful theres 
always a place for robin in the comic book world

the bush administration citing dramatic 
changes in poland says its ready to cut a deal with congress 
over the size of a us aid package for the new solidarityled 
government 
the numbers are all negotiable presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said wednesday after announcing a white house plan 
to give poland an additional 200 million to help restructure its 
ailing economy 
the white house package in addition to 219 million in aid 
previously announced by president bush came a day after 
democratic congressional leaders proposed a threeyear 37 billion 
package of loans grants and other incentives 
we may have a debate over the amounts but essentially we all 
want to achieve the same purpose were willing to negotiate with 
congress on the amounts and the nature of the package fitzwater 
said 
the dramatic changes in poland over the past two months have 
lent new urgency to our efforts 
the white house also announced that bush had invited both 
polands new prime minister solidarity member tadesz mazowiecki 
and communist president wojciech jaruzelski to come to washington 
at dates yet to be determined 
democrats had invited solidarity leader lech walesa to address a 
joint meeting of congress on nov 15 fitzwater said bush would 
also invite walesa to the white house during the expected visit 
wednesdays white house announcement of the new aid proposal 
follows agreement by the 12nation european community to back a 
650 million aid package for poland and hungary 
fitzwater said the us grant would complement the european 
package and serve as the us installment toward a proposed 1 
billion stabilization fund to help poland move toward a 
freemarket economy 
since this money will be a grant it will not add to the 
longterm indebtedness of the already heavily burdened polish 
people he said

family troubles usually make for soap opera not 
good plays 
a case in point is the aunts gary bonasortes dreary 
domestic drama that opened wednesday at offbroadways 47th street 
theater with three accomplished actresses mia dillon bethel 
leslie and ann wedgeworth in the leading roles 
miss leslie and miss wedegeworth play the aunts miss dillon is 
their niece and the three women make a game effort to commandeer 
the stage but bonasorte doesnt give them much help the play 
revolves around nan miss wedgeworth whose husband don is offstage 
dying of cancer her sister meg and niece pita arrive to lend 
support they should have stayed home for all the comfort they 
provide 
the plot is mostly dramatic revelation much of it not very 
surprising or even interesting nan wants to ease her husbands 
pain by feeding him brownies laced with marijuana meg attempts to 
supply don with pills so he can kill himself when the suffering 
becomes unbearable and pita just wants to get married 
much of the banter revolves around pita she is a 30yearold 
cashier stuck in a deadend relationship with her much older 
boyfriend she arrives wearing a maternity dress a fact no one but 
the audience seems to notice for the first scene or two 
the play is set in a bluecollar pittsburgh neighborhood during 
the late 1970s but theres not much sense of place or time except 
for a few references to the steelers and terry bradshaw 
the play ends with a catharsis of sorts giving miss wedgeworth 
an oportunity to emote with an capital e miss leslie comes off 
best and in her portrait of a bitter unhappy woman trapped in a 
terrible marriage there is glimmer of what bonasortes play might 
have been

archaeologists of camp humor might want to get themselves down 
to sheridan square in greenwich village for a look at big 
hotel a revival by the ridiculous theatrical company of charles 
ludlams first play but those seeking a satisfying night at the 
theater will have to dig elsewhere 
the play written in 1967 is a fractured takeoff of among 
other things the movies grand hotel and sunset boulevard 
ludlam who died two years ago had a wicked sense of the 
outrageous in big hotel hes outrageous without being funny 
so tedium sets in early 
the story which chronicles the activities of various residents 
of the hotel evaporates minutes after the curtain goes up in the 
late 60s when big hotel was first done anarchy flourished on 
stage twenty years later it seems boring and almost quaint 
everett quinton who now runs the company plays a mournful 
norma desmond who doesnt lack for theatricality no other member 
of the large cast approaches quintons inspired lunacy although 
the colorful and extravagant costumes by susan young capture 
quintons wonderful sense of the bizarre but they are meager 
pleasures in what seems like a long messy evening

members of the senate finance committee are 
not about to let something like the federal budget deficit get in 
the way of the task they enjoy most cutting taxes 
after the lawmakers agreed wednesday on the spending cuts and 
revenue increases needed to cut the deficit by 53 billion they 
saw there were still tax dollars to spend and set to work on the 
annual exercise that cynics compare to hogs slopping at the trough 
they started passing out tax benefits to special interests 
lowerincome parents got a new package of childcare credits 
banana farmers got a piece of the pie 
so did firsttime homebuyers owners of tuxedorental shops 
welloff retirees oil producers timber growers selected 
hospitals the selfemployed parents who want to adopt handicapped 
children and tavern owners 
americans who fit into the category of uppermiddleincome 
better than 50000 a year were guaranteed to be winners when 
republicans on the panel called for a cut in capital gains taxes 
and democrats recommended liberalized individual retirement 
accounts instead 
iras won in the finance committee on a 1010 tie but 
republicans and a few dissident democrats are working with the bush 
administration to reverse that vote on the senate floor this 
weekend 
its going to be a very tough fight a close fight sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the committee said wednesday 
the battle over capital gains and iras is the focus of attention 
in the deficitreduction bill but dozens of other parts added at 
the insistence of one or more finance committee members are 
likely to get little attention 
while those issues will command the attention of the senate 
many other parts of the big deficitreduction bill will not even be 
mentioned in public debate that doesnt please some members 
this bill as it has progressed has become increasingly more 
troubling sen bill bradley dnj groused as the panel wound 
up action on the legislation just before 230 am wednesday we 
end up raising 37 billion in taxes over five years to meet a 
53 billion deficitreduction goal for fiscal 1990 he said 
here are some of the scores of provisions that were tacked onto 
the bill by the committee 
new assistance to rural hospitals many of which are 
financially stressed because federal medicare reimbursements favor 
urban facilities 
expanding the oildepletion allowance for owners of wells that 
produce less than 15 barrels a day producers whose natural gas is 
in tight sand formations would get an additional incentive 
totaling 685 million over five years 
permitting banana and pineapple growers to use a more 
advantageous system of accounting a 25 million benefit 
a liberalized package of taxrelated aid to lowerincome 
families with children including a new credit for health insurance 
and supplements for families with children under age 4 
raising from 8880 to 14520 the annual amount a person age 
65 through 69 may earn without losing a portion of social security 
benefits this would help fewer than 10 percent of beneficiaries 
those whose earnings exceed 8800 at a cost of 1 billion a year

leading aids activists say theyre bewildered 
by a government decision to exclude a pioneer in communitybased 
aids research from new federal funding 
community research initiative in new york was notified by 
telephone this week that it would not be among the groups sharing 
in 9 million from the governments first program to finance 
communitybased aids drug testing said dr bernie bihari 
executive director of cri 
bihari said wednesday that he was not told why his group was 
excluded 
the awards were to be announced this afternoon 
word that cri would not receive an award was met by surprise and 
bewilderment by some in the aids research community 
its offensive and humiliating and it creates an impression 
of bad will which we did not need said mathilde krim a founder 
of the american foundation for aids research which has given cri 
money in the past 
this group conceptualized a new research institution not only 
for aids but that can be used for other diseases as well she 
said i felt they deserved a little support in recognition of 
their contribution 
cri two years ago pioneered the grassroots concept in drug 
testing that has helped move at least some clinical trials from the 
large academic medical centers into communities where local 
physicians and their aids patients participate in testing new aids 
drugs 
it was considered the model for many of nearly three dozen 
communitybased aids research groups that have begun testing aids 
drugs 
some of these groups and others that have not begun testing 
will share in the federal funding about 9 million will be 
available 
lawrence deyton assistant director for community research at 
the national institute on allergy and infectious diseases said the 
proposals were ranked by a peer review committee that included 
community nurses and doctors people with aids and aids activists 
jean mcguire of the aids action council who sat on the review 
committee said she could not talk about individual proposals but 
said i feel the process was rigorous and equitable 
she said her biggest disappointment was that there wasnt 
enough money for more groups 
cri isnt the only deserving project that didnt get money 
its an issue of too few resources she said

thousands of east german refugees in 
communistowned trains that were locked up to bar compatriots from 
joining the exodus arrived in hof early thursday after a 
delayplagued journey through czechoslovakia and their homeland 
thousands of east germans chanting we want out had flocked 
to train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of 
joining their compatriots aboard what could be the last freedom 
trains to the west 
west german journalists said they heard unconfirmed reports of 
serious injuries when east german authorities stopped some east 
germans from getting aboard the trains 
western diplomats in prague the czechoslovak capital had 
speculated that attempts by east german authorities to prevent the 
throngs from boarding the trains had caused the delays 
east germans seeking to board the trains jammed western 
embassies swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four 
east bloc nations wednesday 
on tuesday east germanys hardline leaders had for the second 
time in less than a week agreed to allow safe passage to the west 
for thousands of wouldbe emigres who had massed at the west german 
embassy in prague 
the first of eight trains that had left prague late wednesday 
arrived in this border town at 550 am it was believed to be 
carrying at least 1000 people 
east berlin on tuesday said it would allow one more exodus of 
disillusioned citizens then suspended visafree travel to 
czechoslovakia the only country to which east germans could go 
without first obtaining government permission 
the agreement covered an estimated 11000 weary refugees who had 
converged on west germanys embassy in the czechoslovak capital 
but there were reports thousands of others throughout the east bloc 
were hoping to take part 
a crowd of czechoslovaks applauded as the first group left the 
embassy area to board buses to the train station helmeted riot 
police arrived and pushed the onlookers back 
as the first of 15 trains left prague the ecstatic passengers 
cheered waved and hurled their nowworthless east german money 
from the windows 
earlier in the day thousands of people in dresden east 
germany were forced by truncheonwielding police to leave the 
train station 
east germany closed its border with ally czechoslovakia in a bid 
to end the embarrassing exodus of its young skilled citizens 
before the communist nation celebrates its 40th anniversary this 
weekend 
we knew it was our last chance one east german refugee said 
about fleeing to prague we were right now the border is 
closed 
the clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb the 
number of east germans going to reformminded hungary which 
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of east germans 
to pass through the shortest route to hungary from east germany is 
through czechoslovakia 
west german border guards noted that only 500 arrived via 
hungary on tuesday compared to 700 the day before and 1000 the 
day before that 
east germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach west 
germany where they are granted automatic citizenship 
in east berlin police wednesday scuffled with about 50 east 
germans trying to enter the us embassy witnesses said eighteen 
others made it inside the compound tuesday but agreed late 
wednesday to leave the compound with assurances their government 
will look favorable on their emigration requests diplomats said 
police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowd 
of 5000 that packed a dresden train station and lined the tracks 
chanting we want out witnesses told the associated press 
the trains traveled through east german territory via dresden to 
hof the detour through east germany was requested by east berlin 
authorities so the refugees could be formally expelled from their 
country czechoslovakia had vowed not to let east germans emigrate 
to the west across its borders 
according to reliable east german sources four east germans 
still were seeking asylum in the west german mission in east berlin 
there were also unconfirmed reports that four east germans had 
sought asylum in bonns embassy in sofia bulgaria 
in warsaw poland the number of east germans seeking asylum at 
the bonn embassy swelled to 400 about 130 arrived wednesday many 
their clothing still wet told of swimming rivers and evading 
border police to get to the embassy 
east germanys state railroad provided the trains to transport 
the 10000 east germans who had crowded the prague embassy and 
streets just outside it the trains had been scheduled to leave 
tuesday night but were repeatedly delayed 
west german officials first said technical difficulties appeared 
to be the reason however later they said it could have been due 
to the east germans lining the tracks in their own country hoping 
to join the exodus 
that would be a plausible reason that some people perhaps 
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by west german 
government spokesman hans klein told the zdf television network 
police in hof said about 1000 young east germans were waiting 
along the tracks near plauen an east german town near the 
czechoslovak border 
hungarian and west german media reported thousands more had 
crowded other spots along the route the trains were expected to 
take 
on sunday about 7000 east germans arrived in west germany 
after east germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in prague 
and warsaw to leave many of those who arrived said they had jumped 
on board as the trains passed through their homeland

the basic mandate of the 13000 american 
troops based in panama is to protect american civilians and the 
strategic panama canal 
so when several hundred american combatfatigued military men 
took up positions around the panamanian capital tuesday it was 
ostensibly for those reasons 
the move came as a small group of panamanian troops tried to 
overthrow dictator manuel antonio noriega 
noriega loyalists including provisional president francisco 
rodriguez claim the show of military might was proof of us 
involvement in the failed coup the bush administration denies any 
involvement in the coup attempt 
the american mission is outlined in the 1977 panama canal 
treaties which call for the united states to turn the 
americanbuilt waterway over to panama on dec 31 1999 and to 
maintain the neutrality of the seatosea canal 
the 10 military installations along the 50milelong swathe also 
are to be given to panama 
under the treaties us forces are allowed to patrol only their 
own bases and areas under joint uspanamanian jurisdiction 
panama charges the united states with thousands of violations of 
that order and the united states claims that panamanians have 
illegally trespassed hundreds of times in the last year on 
americanrun military bases several of the incidents resulted in 
exchanges of gunfire according to military officials 
the treaties also bar us military from interfering in internal 
panamanian affairs 
according to military rules outlined in an orientation booklet 
american soldiers are prohibited from wearing their uniforms 
outside the base areas unless they are on official business en 
route from one military installation to another or traveling from 
home to a base 
there were about 10800 us military personnel in panama early 
this year but president bush augmented that number by 2000 after 
an outbreak of violence in may sparked by controversy over the 
panamanian elections 
the troops in panama come under the us southern command 
responsible for all us military activities in central and south 
america the command is headquartered on a hillside at quarry 
heights just outside panama city in the former panama canal zone 
southcom as it is called is home for army air force navy and 
marine troops 
a southcom bulletin issued last year notes the militarys job of 
protecting the canal and 40000 american citizens but adds 
southcom also promotes mutual security plus democratic 
social and economic development among the nations of the region 
through combined planning training humanitarian assistance 
intelligence exchanges and nation building 
the southern command traces its origin to the arrival of the 
marines in panama in 1903 days after panama with the 
encouragement of washington declared its independence from 
colombia army troops arrived in 1911 three years before the canal 
opened 
us military strength hit a high of 67000 during world war ii 
in recent years southcom has been the coordination point for 
intelligence flights over central america and an antidrug drive in 
bolivia

president bush who stopped by to pay tribute 
to an educational program initiated by the families of the 
challenger astronauts is getting some praise himself for the help 
he and barbara bush gave the program 
because this couple led the way others followed june 
scobeerodgers widow of challenger commander dick scobee told a 
wednesday evening fundraiser for the challenger center for space 
science education 
they led not only in word but in deed she said telling the 
blacktie audience that the bushes opened their homes for 
receptions and made introductions that literally opened the door 
to launch the challenger center 
mrs rodgers said bush gave his personal commitment not only 
in time but financially 
the challenger center founded by families and friends of the

night stalker richard ramirez sneered at 
a jurys verdict that he die in the gas chamber for his 13 satanic 
murders muttering big deal death always went with the 
territory see you in disneyland 
the blackclad killer unrepentant to the end made his comment 
in an underground garage as he was taken back to jail moments after 
a jury recommended the death penalty for his gruesome crimes 
his disneyland comment apparently referred to the plea for mercy 
that had marked his attorneys closing argument 
mr ramirez will die in prison defense attorney ray clark 
had argued insisting that a life sentence was sufficient 
punishment 
life imprisonment without possibility of parole means he will 
never see disneyland again said the lawyer he will never be 
free again 
but the jury voted 19 times for death on each of the special 
circumstances attached to his 13 murder convictions ramirez also 
was convicted of 30 felonies including burglary and sex crimes 
those felonies and the crime of multiple murders constituted 
special circumstances warranting the death penalty 
theres no punishment that could fit this crime judi 
arnold whose parents maxon and lela kneiding were butchered said 
tearfully after wednesdays verdict 
i have to live the rest of my life seeing my parents and what 
mr ramirez did to them 
some jurors said their dreams were haunted by the grisly details 
of the murders 
i have nightmares all the time about the crimes said juror 
cynthia haden ill get over it but ill never be the same ill 
never look at people the same way 
she and others said they were horrified when they learned that 
victims throats had been slashed and one womans eyes had been 
gouged out 
the 29yearold ramirez a drifter from el paso texas was 
impassive as superior court judge michael tynan read the word 
death 19 times in announcing the jury recommendations 
the slender shaggyhaired ramirez wearing a black shirt and 
black slacks but minus his usual dark glasses rocked back and 
forth in his chair and craned his neck to peer at spectators 
tynan will formally sentence ramirez on nov 7 he has the 
option of reducing the sentence to life without parole 
he got what he deserved said deputy district attorney p 
philip halpin who spent four years prosecuting ramirez he had 
described the defendant as a miserable human being who killed 
for selfgratification 
defense attorney daniel hernandez said he was saddened at the 
verdict 
i think all human beings are deserving of our sympathy and 
should not have their lives taken in the streets in the courts or 
in the gas chamber he said 
at least two jurors felt sympathy for ramirez said the jury 
foreman felipe rodriguez who disclosed there was an initial 102 
split on the death penalty but he said sympathy for the families 
of victims was powerful enough to sway the holdouts 
it was the heinousness the brutality which convinced them 
to vote for death said juror alfredo carrillo 
the panelists who spent a year serving on the trial said they 
were shaken by the unrelated slaying of a fellow juror during their 
deliberations in the guilt phase of the trial but insisted it made 
no difference in their decision 
it was a loss a definite loss said rodriguez a lot of 
us came to realize how life really is one day youre there and 
one day youre not 
juror phyllis singletary was found slain at her home aug 15 
her livein boyfriend committed suicide a day later and left a note 
admitting he had killed her 
defense attorneys sought a mistrial but tynan appointed an 
alternate juror and deliberations resumed defense lawyers said 
wednesday the slaying would become a key point of their appeal 
claiming jurors were too upset to reach a dispassionate verdict 
on sept 20 the jury decided ramirez was the night stalker 
killer who broke into homes through unlocked windows and doors in 
the summer of 1985 
satanic symbols were left at some murder scenes and some victims 
were forced to swear to satan by the killer 
at an early court hearing in the case ramirez held up his hand 
inscribed with a pentagram a symbol of devil worship and said 
hail satan 
after his conviction he flashed a twofingered devil sign 
to photographers and muttered a single word evil

president bushs plan to spend an additional 
9 million to boost the political opposition in next years 
nicaraguan elections is headed for the senate after easily winning 
house approval 
the house voted 263156 for the aid package late wednesday in a 
rare show of agreement on us policy toward the central american 
country the measure could come up in the senate before the week is 
out 
we are not trying to buy an election we are trying to even 
things up said rep henry hyde rill arguing for the measure 
against assertions that it would again raise the specter of us 
paternalism in the region 
this is hamhanded and will backfire countered rep david 
obey dwis 
backers of the election aid package noted nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government and its incumbent president daniel ortega 
will marshal civil servants the police and military and the 
governmentcontrolled media to help assure their continued power 
by contrast the opposition coalition known as uno operates out 
of a shabby office with almost no equipment and doesnt even have a 
fully working telephone supporters argued 
the package provides 9 million for a variety of 
electionrelated activities deemed to be nonpartisan but which 
bush believes would help level the playing field for violeta 
chamorro the opposition presidential candidate 
after years of congressional battling over us policy toward 
nicaragua the relatively easy approval of bushs aid proposal 
represented rare agreement among normally divided factions 
that agreement was made possible after secretary of state james 
a baker iii and other senior officials conveyed private assurances 
to congress that if the aid goes forward the administration will 
not use cia contingency funds to secretly support the opposition 
of the total package 8 million would flow through the national 
endowment for democracy a us governmentsupported organization 
that promotes free elections around the world 
that money would go for voter registration poll monitoring 
getoutthevote activities and political party building and to 
pay the 50 percent tax on foreign political contributions required 
by nicaraguan law 
another 1 million would be used to pay expenses of three 
pollwatching groups none of the money could be used for direct 
campaign expenses such as advertising 
the money which would come from unspent balances in other 
accounts comes on top of 35 million already made available in 
the past year for the endowment to use in supporting the electoral 
process in nicaragua 
voting for president the national assembly and local posts is 
scheduled for feb 25

although gen manuel antonio noriega 
has dodged another bullet the arrests of three highranking 
officers following a coup attempt shows the deep divisions in the 
force that he depends on for survival 
the generals victory bared weaknesses in his control of the 
defense forces the top authority in a country where civilian 
governments have been a facade for military strongmen 
on wednesday col arnulfo castrejon said noriega had been taken 
hostage by commanders of the headquarters guard shortly after he 
walked into his office the day before 
according to castrejon noriega kept his captors calm and tried 
to avoid bloodshed confident the defense forces would solve the 
problem 
loyal units then moved from outlying bases counterattacked and 
forced the rebels to surrender 
that was an impressive display of loyalty to a commander who was 
out of position to command and it first appeared that he had 
quashed a coup launched by a few disgruntled junior officers 
but when the list of those arrested was released wednesday 
night it included 23 officers a much wider group than previously 
thought 
most surprising on the list were the names of cols guillermo 
wong julio ow young and armando palacios gondola they were 
members of the 20man high command that noriega had packed with his 
most trusted aides 
noriega now must restructure his top staff with the knowledge 
that there are probably many other officers who are resentful 
envious angry or ambitious even though they did not join the coup 
he must know that he cannot trust anyone now said ricardo 
arias calderon leader of the christian demcratic party and a 
former vice presidential candidate 
if i was in gen noriegas shoes id be a very nervous man 
tonight us defense secretary dick cheney told reporters 
wednesday in washington 
military infighting inspired the coup attempt as the communique 
released by rebels pointed out they said their purpose was to 
retire noriega and other members of the general staff 
but after emerging from his bulletpocked headquarters noriega 
could take pride in the loyalty of the bulk of his force even when 
he was not in position to command them 
he also saw that fully mobilized us troops in combat gear 
stood by as the coup was crushed even though the washinton has 
been trying to oust noriega for more than 1 years 
it was a clear sign to other potential plotters that the united 
states would not lend even passive aid such as blocking all 
access to defense forces headquarters to a coup 
for anyone unable to figure it out us secretary of state 
james a baker iii made it perfectly clear 
the united states retains the option to use american forces 
that option has never been ruled out baker told the senate 
finance committee but if youre going to risk american lives 
its the presidents view that you do so on your own timetable you 
dont do so on the basis of someone elses plans and in response to 
rapidly changing circumstances 
the gringos will act when it is to their own interest said 
a panamanian oppositon source not when it is in the interest of 
the panamanian opposition 
a third positive factor for the general was the passivity of the 
civilian opposition which arias said had no contact with the 
plotters 
their communique indicated they wanted noriega out and 
supported the provisional government that noriega set up arias 
said 
a victory for the plotters would not likely have been a victory 
for democracy 
in this kind of confrontation if we went on the streets we 
would be only providing the dead arias said 
noriega must have noted that another group of people beholden to 
him stood aside until they saw which way the wind was blowing 
the civilian government he appointed was silent during the early 
hours of the attempt on wednesday progovernment radio announcers 
admitted some government employees had danced with joy as they 
followed the first news bulletins 
perhaps the biggest plus for noriega is simply that he survived 
he defeated a coup on march 16 1988 he has outlasted us 
sanctions election defeats and now a much larger coup 
he has more lives than a cat an opposition source said 
we just dont know how many he has used 
who now will step forward and see

the risk of aids infection from transfusions is 
minuscule but blood banks should work harder to recruit and retain 
women donors because theyre less likely to have the aids virus a 
red cross report concludes today 
the research shows that blood from repeat female donors is nine 
times safer than from firsttime male donors 
currently 42 percent of donors are women the report said this 
proportion should be increased in part by encouraging members of 
womens organizations to give blood and by telephone recruiting 
campaigns aimed at women 
every effort should be made to recruit and retain female 
donors wrote dr paul d cumming and colleagues from the 
american red cross in washington 
however an editorial published with the study in the new 
england journal of medicine questioned this tactic 
dr jay e menitove of the blood bank of southeastern wisconsin 
said trying to establish an exclusively female donor base is 
impractical moreover he wrote in a society that advocates 
color and sexblind principles this approach is arguably 
unacceptable 
while suggesting ways to make the nations blood supply even 
safer the report found reassuring evidence that the chance of 
getting an aids infection from a typical transfusion is remote the 
odds were just 1 in 28000 two years ago and the risk is dropping 
by more than 30 percent a year largely because fewer aids carriers 
are donating 
the blood supply is probably safer now than it has ever 
been the red cross team wrote 
however another report in the journal cautions that some people 
at high risk of the disease still give blood despite appeals to 
refrain and blood banks should try harder to dissuade them from 
donating 
a third study showed that more than 95 percent of people who 
receive aidstainted transfusions become infected and half of them 
develop aids within seven years 
based on data from 17 million donations the red cross 
researchers estimated that 131 units of aidscontaminated blood 
were transfused throughout the united states despite screening 
efforts in 1987 this probably fell to 87 in 1988 
many of those who get tainted blood die of other causes before 
their infections becomes apparent only 14 clear cases of 
transfusionassociated aids have been reported to the us centers 
for disease control since widespread blood screening began in 1985 
in another study dr susan f leitman and others from the 
national institutes of health reviewed blood donations to the nih 
and red cross in washington between 1985 and 1988 from this group 
they studied 156 people who gave aidstainted blood 
most of these people had injected drugs or engaged in homosexual 
practices putting them at high risk of aids when questioned about 
why they donated 26 percent said they had changed their lifestyles 
and did not believe their earlier habits had left them at risk 
another 26 percent knew their blood would be tested for aids and 
wanted to find out whether they were infected fifteen percent said 
they felt pressured to donate only 6 percent said they did not 
read or understand brochures that should have alerted them not to 
donate 
thirtythree of the donors had gotten the virus through 
heterosexual contact none of them knew they were at risk for the 
infection 
clearly both donor education policies and interview 
strategies need to be strengthened the nih researchers concluded 
in the third study dr john w ward and others from the cdc 
studied 694 blood recipients whose donors later turned out to be 
infected they found that while almost all the recipients got the 
infection the risk of going on to get aids appeared to be highest 
if the donor developed aids shortly after making the donation

hu blonk a longtime crusader for open 
government urged editors to use their newspapers as a crowbar in a 
way to prevent encroachment on the peoples right to know 
blonk was honored wednesday as the first recipient of the 
meritorious service award of the associated press managing editors 
he had served on the apmes freedom of information committee for 
25 years played a major role in the passage of the freedom of 
information act and fought attempts by trial lawyers to restrict 
courtroom coverage 
for those efforts he earlier was honored by fellow washington 
state editors with a chromeplated crowbar to pry open the doors 
behind which no doubt skullduggery is taking place 
blonk 80 who retired as managing editor of the wenatchee 
wash world in 1974 said it was his dutch stubbornness that 
led him to fight to keep government proceedings open to reporters 
he has been involved in defending the publics right to know 
since he was a senior at the university of washington in seattle in 
1933 when he led students in defying a board of regents 
restriction by inviting a labor advocate to speak on campus he was 
among students suspended over the incident but the resulting 
outcry led to reinstatement and adoption by regents of a resolution 
guaranteeing free speech on the campus

sen wyche fowlers plan to save water by 
legislating more efficient toilets isnt going down well with 
plumbers and toilet makers who contend the public is more 
concerned with toilet performance than water consumption 
conservation efforts will ultimately fail if proper regard is 
not given to the reasonable public demand for sound performance 
standards in water supply and waste disposal said george bliss 
assistant director of training for the united association of 
plumbers and pipefitters 
bliss testified wednesday at a hearing before the senate 
commerce consumer subcommittee on legislation introduced by fowler 
dga and rep chet atkins dmass to set national water 
efficiency standards for toilets and other plumbing fixtures 
the legislation would require that all new toilets installed 
beginning in 1992 use only 16 gallons of water per flush state 
and local building codes generally have required a 35 gallon 
standard since the early 1970s 
when the amount of water is cut in half there is reason to 
doubt whether the system will operate properly bliss said 
arguing congress should not act until more research is done on such 
issues as to what extent will bowl staining become a factor due 
to low flush 
fowler said concerns such as those raised by bliss are nothing 
more than red herrings he said toilets that meet the 16 
gallon per flush standard as well as other efficient plumbing 
fixtures already exist and are proven to work 
supporters of the legislation told the senate panel that in the 
past year seven states with 40 percent of the nations population 
have adopted standards requiring that new toilets use only 16 
gallons per flush 
there is no evidence to support the claim that there would be 
a problem transporting solid waste down drain lines with low flush 
toilets said amy vickers a water resources consultant from 
boston who became known as the commode queen last year during 
her efforts to have the 16 gallon per flush standard adopted in 
massachusetts 
fowler said the bill would help reduce the strain on the 
nations water supplies by putting a stop to the massive waste of 
water in faucets water closets showerheads he said replacing 
all such fixtures in american homes with more efficient models 
would save almost 7 billion gallons of water a day 
craig selover a vice president of the delta faucet co said 
the plumbing manufacturers institute opposes the legislation 
because it would create a needless federal bureaucracy wasting 
taxpayers money and do little to promote water conservation 
the legislation would quite probably create a negative 
attitude toward water conservation among consumers thereby 
hampering important and much needed efforts to conserve precious 
potable water resources he said

transportation secretary samuel skinner says 
he has reservations about proposed laws that would set the terms 
for leveraged takeovers of domestic airlines 
skinner whose intervention forced a change in the takeover 
terms for northwest airlines told house and senate panels that 
laws governing leveraged buyouts in the airline industry could 
create more opportunity for loopholes 
i agree that the industry the investment community the 
airlines all have the right to know what the departments policy 
is skinner said wednesday 
but weve got to make sure in doing that that we dont create 
a policy that now the lawyers and investment bankers and everybody 
can get around said skinner a lawyer with buyout experience 
under an agreement announced last week klm royal dutch airlines 
said it would reduce its equity interest in the northwest takeover 
from 57 percent to 25 percent limit the powers of the klm member 
on the northwest board and drop plans for a threemember advisory 
committee the dutch airline would have controlled 
the agreement also requires regular reports on northwests 
finances in light of the fourfold increase in debt to 31 
million that would be incurred in the takeover 
the pressure to pay down the principal and to meet interest 
payments could threaten the carriers ability to meet its other 
obligations including fleet replacement aircraft repair and 
maintenance security crew training and other safety related 
expenses skinner said in testimony submitted to aviation 
subcommittees of both chambers 
skinner said klm had too large a role even though only 5 percent 
of the stock would have been voting shares the federal aviation 
act sets a 25 percent limit on foreign ownership and says the 
airline must be controlled by us citizens 
the takeover is being engineered by wings holdings inc led by 
california investor alfred checchi 
the 705 million leveraged buyout announced in june was the 
first of that magnitude in the airline industry skinner said 
klms share was to have been 400 million 
other buyout deals are pending giving rise to congressional 
concern laws have been introduced to set financial requirements 
for airlines being bought out and to regulate foreign investment 
skinner said he hadnt reviewed the proposed laws and couldnt 
say whether he supported or opposed them 
however he made it clear that he supported deregulation had no 
disagreement with the use of foreign capital which is cheaper or 
with recapitalizations that make sure shares reflect the true 
values of assets 
skinner also was reluctant to involve the transportation 
department in the consequences of takeovers on employees although 
he has agreed to investigate the issue at the urging of airline 
unions

the treasury department is planning

another initiative soon will require banks to report domestic 
currency deposits of more than 10000 on computer tapes the 
official said wednesday 
the current reports of those large deposits are made on paper 
forms banks file millions of those year in and year out it 
creates an avalanche of paper that is extremely difficult to 
handle by law enforcement agencies trying to track drug profits 
the official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was 
summarizing testimony earlier in the day by salvatore r martoche 
assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement before the 
senate foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism narcotics and 
international operations 
just as they report large domestic deposits banks report 
transfers of large sums of cash to and from foreign banks but 
there is no requirement to report international wire transfers

after 15 million spent 124 witnesses and 
more than 1000 pieces of evidence both sides have rested in the 
2yearold mcmartin preschool molestation trial the longest 
criminal proceeding in us history 
superior court judge william pounders who often expressed fear 
the 6yearold case would end in a mistrial scheduled closing 
arguments to begin oct 12 he said the jury should get the case by 
nov 1 
congratulations judge defense attorney danny davis said as 
he left the courtroom 
im going to wait to accept that until i get a verdict the 
judge replied adding that he expects the rest of the case to take 
up to three months 
ive got three months to keep 12 jurors together and that 
makes me nervous 
pounders skepticism is the result of the long and troubled case 
that began in the fall of 1983 as the largest child molestation 
prosecution ever 
seven teachers at the once prestigious and nowdefunct preschool 
in manhattan beach were arrested and charged with 207 separate 
counts prosecutors alleged hundreds of children had been molested 
during a fiveyear period 
former pupils testified that teachers molested them at the 
school while playing games known as naked movie star 
tickle and the alligator game 
one 10yearold boy testified that children had been taken from 
the school and molested animals were mutilated during trips to a 
farm and at a church the boy said 
defense attorneys argued the children were brainwashed by 
therapists from the childrens institute international a 
childabuse detection and treatment center into believing they had 
been molested 
after an 18month preliminary hearing district attorney ira 
reiner dismissed all charges against five of the defendants the 
hearing cost the government 6 million 
only raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
62 remain accused they are charged with 64 counts of molestation 
and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged molestations of 
11 children at their familyowned school 
in april the trial itself itself became the longest criminal 
trial in us history surpassing the twoyear record of 
californias hillside strangler case 
and with the 15 million spent it is the most expensive case 
ever tried in los angeles 
fears of a possible mistrial plagued the case in recent months 
since the trial began in april 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup 
panel of six alternates has dwindled due to illness and employment 
problems 
the last alternate was used recently to replace an ailing juror 
a panel of 12 is required for a verdict in a criminal case 
this is almost as exciting as the day we started jury 
selection deputy district attorney roger gunson said after both 
sides had rested

a presbyterian minister whose trip to 
communist north korea for reunification talks created a political 
uproar in south korea was convicted today of aiding an enemy power 
and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
rev moon ikhwan walked out of seoul district court in protest 
before judge chung sanghak sentenced the dissident leader to 10 
years in jail on various charges of aiding north korea moon said 
he refused to recognize the courts authority and returned to his 
cell 
sentence me as you please after i leave the court although i 
am not concerned about the penalty the 71yearold clergyman 
said before leaving the courtroom 
about 100 dissidents sitting in the courtroom clapped when moon 
walked out the dissidents clapped derisively when the judge 
announced the sentence 
yoo wonho a businessman who accompanied moon on the trip to 
pyongyang in march was also sentenced to 10 years in jail 
thr prosecution which had demanded a life sentence said the 
punishment was too light and it would appeal to a higher court for 
a tougher sentence defense lawyers said they would appeal to have 
the term reduced 
judge chung said moon and yoo while acting out of idealistic 
hopes of reuniting the peninsula had aided the norths attempts to 
undermine south korea by sowing internal dissent the north poses a 
grave military threat to south korea and there could be no excuse 
for moons actions chung said 
chung also noted moon had backed north koreas call for 
withdrawal of the 43000 us troops based in the south and this 
was part of communist attempts to undermine south korea moon and 
other dissidents claim the united states keeps troops in the south 
to block reunification of the peninsula 
the judge said he had not imposed the full sentence because of 
moons age and because of the defendants desire for reunification 
moon has served jail sentences in the past for antigovernment 
activity 
moon a prominent antigovernment leader made a secret trip to 
north korea to meet top communist leader kim il sung and call for 
reunification of the divided korean peninsula moon got to north 
korea by going first to tokyo and then to beijing 
south korean officials denounced moon for supporting north korea 
and many south koreans were shocked that the dissident leader had 
associated himself with the totalitarian north television pictures 
of moon embracing kim outraged south koreans public support for 
dissident groups plummeted 
the government cracked down on dissident groups after moon 
appeared in north korea and scores of top dissident leaders were 
jailed moon was arrested in april when he returned to seoul 
the two koreas are technically still at war since no peace 
treaty was signed at the end of the threeyear korean war in 1953 
many south koreans fear the north is determined to reunite the 
peninsula by conquest 
south koreas tough national security laws ban any contact with 
the north without government permission the korean border is 
sealed and the two sides have frequently clashed over the years 
many south koreans want reunification but fear the north would 
attempt to impose its rule on the entire peninsula the two sides 
have held occasional talks on reunification but have never made 
progress 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by us and soviet 
forces that ended the japanese occupation

the head of cbs news denied allegations that the 
network broadcast fake afghanistan war footage in 1984 but 
acknowledged the tape did misidentify one plane 
after extensive conversations with persons in the united 
states and abroad as well as a searching discussion with 
freelance photographer michael hoover cbs news is satisfied that 
allegations it broadcast fake combat footage from afghanistan in 
the mid1980s are simply not true cbs news president david burke 
said in a memo to staff 
the new york post accused cbs evening news of broadcasting 
staged or recreated scenes shot by hoover the posts editor said 
wednesday the newspaper stands by its story 
burkes memo made available by cbs news did concede the 
unintentional use of a misidentified aircraft burke did not 
return phone calls 
hoover flown to new york by cbs for a meeting tuesday with 
burke and burkes top assistant joseph peyronnin said 
absolutely nothing was staged in any war footage he provided 
cbs news he said there was an inadvertent misidentification of a 
pakistani jet as a soviet jet bomber flying over a border area 
between pakistan and afghanistan 
that footage was used in a 1987 cbs news documentary the 
battle for afghanistan which was narrated by dan rather anchor 
and managing editor of the cbs evening news rather did not 
return calls wednesday seeking comment 
asked if the plane was flying over afghanistan at the time it 
was filmed hoover replied that i couldnt swear to that 
but the videotape was shot from inside afghanistan he said and 
the plane could have been on either side 
the post had quoted david isby a defense consultant who also 
writes for janes military aviation guidebooks as identifying the 
jet as a chinesemade plane used by the pakistani air force 
jerry nachman the posts editor said the newspaper was very 
very comfortable with what weve printed he said he was a 
little surprised at cbs stand 
i would have thought they would have done a lowlevel mea 
culpa he said he explained that he had thought cbs might make 
excuses or say the reporter or cameraman was wellintentioned 
but may have unwittingly violated news guidelines 
the posts allegations are absolute rubbish hoover said 
it comes down to my word against what their sources word is and 
this is a guy by the name of etabari 
in the post story etabari an afghani whom the newspaper said 
had acted as hoovers translator was quoted as saying he had seen 
hoover staging several scenes including the destruction of power 
line pylons leading to the capital kabul 
hoover said etabari whom a rebel group had assigned him as a 
translator had left him two days after both men entered 
afghanistan with a guerrilla group and wasnt present when the 
pylons were destroyed 
he said the cbs producers who originally had checked his afghan 
footage harry radliffe and al ortiz rechecked it before his 
meeting tuesday with burke and peyronnin

president corazon aquino today vowed 
to go ahead with a trip to the united states and canada despite a 
purported assassination plot and allegations followers of ferdinand 
marcos plan to foment unrest 
mrs aquino issued the statement after officials said they had 
uncovered an alleged plot to kill the president by agents 
apparently linked to marcos 
the military chief of staff today said that other assassination 
targets included defense secretary fidel ramos government and 
military figures and foreigners 
all we can say for now is that intelligence reports indicate 
plans by rightist and leftist elements to take advantage of the 
divisiveness that would result if the remains of mr marcos were 
allowed to be brought home at this time mrs aquino said 
i am going to canada and the us as planned she added 
mrs aquino is to make the trip next month 
on wednesday the cabinet endorsed mrs aquinos decision to ban 
the body of the former president after ramos briefed members on the 
alleged plot and other threats to the country 
marcos supporters have offered to be jailed during burial of 
marcos if mrs aquino allows the body to return from hawaii where 
he died sept 28 
marcos son ferdinand bongbong said today that the family 
will keep pressing for 10 years if necessary to return marcos body 
to his homeland marcos ruled for 20 years before his ouster in a 
1986 civilianmilitary uprising that propelled mrs aquino to power 
sen neptali gonzales chairman of the proaquino struggle of 
the democratic filipino party said the alleged plot against the 
aquino government was uncovered during 10 months of surveillance by 
government agents gonzales attended a briefing saturday by ramos 
on the security threat 
assassination was only a portion of that briefing because it 
is one of the components to destabilize the country gonzales 
said in a radio interview i think that is the easiest way to 
destabilize the government 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa today said 
intelligence agents had been monitoring the alleged plot for about 
a year but did not specify whether the conspirators were marcos 
followers 
de villa said that other targets included ramos civilian and 
military officials and foreigners but did not elaborate 
gonzales said ramos gave details of the threat during a twohour 
briefing he attended saturday at the presidential palace he would 
not elaborate 
in hawaii bongbong marcos said the family would continue 
pressing the government to bring his fathers body home to his 
native ilocos norte province 
the old man had only one wish and that is be buried in ilocos 
norte the younger marcos told radio station dzrh and that we 
will do if we have to wait for 10 years we will do that

a new superintendent fired top 
administrators of jersey citys public schools and promised to 
unravel the quagmire after the nations biggest state takeover of 
an urban school district 
ellen j scambio on wednesday became steward of the school 
system just west of new york city after the state board of 
education gave final approval to the takeover ending a fiveyear 
legal battle 
gov thomas h kean applauded the move saying jersey city 
students were victims of educational child abuse 
now the community can put politics and patronage aside and 
get on with the business of learning kean said 
the state cited political intrusion in hiring practices poor 
test scores failure to provide a safe and clean environment for 
students violations of bidding laws failure to provide for 
disabled children and unauthorized use of state funds as reasons 
for the takeover 
the districts problems were deeprooted and endemic board 
vice president robert a woodruff said reading a resolution the 
jersey city board of education totally failed to meet its 
obligations 
moments after being confirmed to a threeyear term ms scambio 
fired seven top administrators including school superintendent 
franklin williams and repeated her vow to unravel the quagmire 
that exists in jersey city 
the state boards action also disbanded the jersey city board of 
education state education commissioner saul cooperman is expected 
to appoint a new board by december 
under new jerseys takeover law the state has five years to 
make improvements national education groups say they will monitor 
the progress of the takeover closely 
the move gives new jersey extraordinary powers over the 
district the states second largest with 28000 students ms 
scambio will be able to fire administrators a power she was quick 
to exercise and set policy 
ms scambio said she would consider eliminating between 100 and 
150 staff positions upgrading buildings and improving community 
relations to make the district a national model of urban education 
the district has a staff of 3322 and a budget of about 180 
million enrollment is 44 percent black 34 percent hispanic and 13 
percent white 
the idea of takeover does not come easily to me cooperman 
said ive always believed the role of the state department is to 
help others help themselves 
jersey city officials bitterly fought the takeover saying the 
problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state 
trumped up its case against the district 
in a society that offers little enough to bolster the 
selfconfidence of urban children the campaign to take over the 
jersey city schools has only further lowered the selfimage of our 
students said williams who will be allowed to teach in the 
district despite being stripped of the superintendents job 
williams said test scores improved in recent years and one of 
the districts high schools was one of five in the state with a 100 
percent passing rate on the high school proficiency test 
he also charged that heavily democratic jersey city was being 
targeted by the republican kean administration for political 
reasons 
jean mcdonald a researcher for the national governors 
association said kentucky south carolina texas and new mexico 
have laws that allow state takeovers of failing school districts 
besides new jersey new mexico and kentucky have used the law to 
take control of school districts

a meat processing company agreed to pay a 
record 1 million fine after admitting it sold hams with an 
excessive amount of water to stores around the country and bribed 
federal inspectors 
sandy mac food co and three corporate officers on wednesday 
pleaded guilty in us district court to conspiracy and fraud 
charges that also involved mislabeling hams and falsifying federal 
records 
indictments of six us department of agriculture officials 
meanwhile were unsealed 
officials of the pennsaukenbased company built a false back to 
a usda vault at the plant and replaced random samples of ham with 
specially manufacture ones that complied with federal regulations 
said us attorney samuel a alito jr 
the sandy mac officers realized that there was a lot of money 
to be made by pumping excess quanities of water into those hams 
alito said 
the scheme was uncovered in 1987 and the hams were recalled 
alito said the hams did not pose a health hazard 
it was a fraud on consumers who were getting an awful lot of 
water rather than what they thought they were purchasing alito 
said 
under federal guidelines hams can contain up to 10 percent 
water said wilson horne deputy administrator for the usda in 
washington 
the 1 million penalty for the company is the largest criminal 
fine for adulterating meat products in the agriculture departments 
history said alito 
the three company officers also face fines totaling 1 million 
as part of the plea agreement the company was sold in september 
said assistant us attorney paul zoubek 
the officers are merton zitin 64 president of sandy mac his 
38yearold son michael and nephew robert zitin 45 all of the 
philadelphia area they were released on 50000 bail each 
the five inspectors and their former supervisor are accused of 
accepting bribes between 10000 to 30000 alito said they were 
released on bond and face arraignment oct 16 
they are willard jones 62 of turnersville james siciliano 
46 of somerdale angelo macrina 58 of runnemede henry hodoruk 
60 of mount laurel julian drinkard 62 of pennsauken and carmen

noshers of the world dont have to feel so guilty 
a study published today suggests that nibbling may be healthier for 
the heart than gorging 
researchers wrote in the new england journal of medicine that 
snacking all day rather than eating three big meals may lower blood 
cholesterol 
the university of toronto researchers said this means that 
cholesterol levels may be lowered by increasing meal frequency 
alone with no alteration in the nature or amount of the food 
eaten 
but they did not advocate putting people on the diet they 
tested which they described as an extreme model of nibbling 
in the study seven men ate 2500 calories a day for one 
twoweek period they got their food in three ordinarysize meals 
for another two weeks they got the same amount of calories in 17 
daily snacks eaten once an hour 
the nibbling diet lowered their cholesterol levels by 9 percent 
and their levels of hazardous lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol 
or ldl by 14 percent 
nutritionists generally discourage people from eating this way 
because snackers tend to take in more calories over the course of 
the day and put on weight 
but the researchers said their study directed by dr david ja 
jenkins backed up other research that suggested those who eat 
frequently rather than gorging have healthier hearts 
the toronto researchers werent sure why but speculated that 
nibbling might lower insulin levels or prompt the liver to make 
less cholesterol

the war on drugs got a shot in the arm 
as three raids in five days resulted in the seizure of nearly 35 
tons of cocaine the latest an 18000pound haul at a house near 
the mexican border 
narcotics agents this morning were searching for the owner of a 
house that was literally stuffed with 9 tons of cocaine the 
second largest seizure of cocaine in us history authorities 
said on wednesday three men were arrested at the house five 
miles north of the border 
earlier in the day the coast guard made what it called the 
largest cocaine confiscation at sea and the third largest in us 
history when it boarded a panamanian supply vessel and uncovered 
11500 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated 525 million 
the two hauls came just five days after agents entered a 
suburban los angeles warehouse and found 20 tons of cocaine the 
worlds largest seizure worth between 2 billion and 20 billion 
depending on the method of processing 
we had a real lull after things in colombia went crazy 
coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson said in washington referring to 
the colombian governments crackdown on drug traffickers that began 
aug 18 
after a long lull things are moving again 
lt waylon bullard chief narcotics agent with the texas 
department of public safetys harlingen office said the operation 
uncovered in the house didnt appear to be connected with the los 
angeles cocaine operation 
the 9 tons seized worth an estimated 1 billion probably 
wont affect the national supply of cocaine much bullard said but 
he added we sure hurt somebodys pocketbook 
following an informants tip state investigators had expected 
to find 1500 pounds of cocaine in the house surrounded by citrus 
groves outside harlingen they found duffel bags of the drug 
stacked so high that there were only two narrow aisles through the 
threebedroom house 
the house was just literally stuffed with cocaine wrapped in 
plastic and newspapers from bogota colombia dps spokesman mike 
cox said 
lt tony garcia said the house was believed to be staging area 
for repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the united states 
onekilo packages were being packed into 30inchtall cardboard 
containers when agents arrived garcia said agents also found two 
copies of a list of seven intended recipients of the cocaine he 
added 
it looks like a real intelligence bonanza from other evidence 
found at the scene cox said 
the three arrested were as hermenegildo rivas sosa 51 of 
matamoros mexico alfonso tristan gonzalez 36 of san antonio 
and guadencio garcia 38 of mcallen 
the three who hold resident alien status in the united states 
were to be arraigned today and the 17950 pounds of cocaine was to 
be transported to austin officials said 
the houses owner and two others are being sought bullard said 
meanwhile authorities raided five el paso homes wednesday in 
connection with the los angeles seizure and found records of 
cocaine shipments canceled checks photos and account records 
said agent bob sternaman of the us drug enforcement 
administration 
at least two of the homes belonged to hector tapia anchondo 38 
who was arrested in las vegas last weekend six others have been 
arrested in connection with the los angeles seizure 
federal investigators have identified a warehouse in el paso and 
three homes across the border in ciudad juarez as part of the 
distribution network that brought the cocaine to los angeles 
in new orleans the 185foot zedom sea was due to arrive under 
coast guard escort today and the nine people arrested were to be 
turned over to the dea said rear adm william f merlin commander 
of the coast guards 8th district 
its by far the biggest single seizure on the high seas 
merlin said 
simpson said the guards seizures in the four days since the 
current fiscal year began sunday including a 1000pound haul near 
puerto rico on monday already exceed the total of 12000 pounds 
seized in all of the previous year

a female jogger who was raped and beaten almost 
to death by a gang of youths in central park has offered to talk to 
prosecutors about the attack according to a medical report 
prosecutors had feared the 28yearold investment banker would 
be unable to help because of the injuries and impaired memory she 
suffered from the april 19 assault 
the woman now in physical and psychiatric rehabilitation at 
gaylord hospital in wallingford conn was smashed several times 
in the head with a rock as the teenagers took turns raping her 
authorities said six youths have been indicted 
a metropolitan hospital psychiatric report dated june 2 said 
the victim was able to appropriately discuss the idea of speaking 
to the district attorney if it will help with the investigation 
she spontaneously offered that while it was not pleasant the 
investigation was necessary for the case said the report signed 
by dr mary ann cohen and obtained wednesday 
but at another point the report appeared to justify 
prosecutors fears i dont know what happened cohen quoted 
the victim as saying and maybe i will never know but i know i 
was attacked and i will just have to accept it and deal with it 
district attorney robert morgenthau said no decision has been 
made about whether to call the woman as a witness 
the victim made her comments barely six weeks after the attack 
and two days after she began to discuss the incident with family 
and doctors 
hearings on motions to suppress the youths statements to police 
and on the validity of chemical tests of their bodily fluids will 
be held tuesday

pulitzer prizewinning journalist seymour hersh 
had a responsibility to write that former indian prime minister 
mararji desai was a cia informant his lawyer said at the close of 
a libel trial 
attorney bernard j nussbaum said hersh based his claim about 
desai on interviews with half a dozen high level government 
sources 
when you have that kind of information doesnt the journalist 
have a responsibility to publish it nussbaum said in his closing 
argument wednesday 
but desais lawyer contended that hersh used his pen as a 
sword and libeled the former prime minister in his 1983 book 
the price of power kissinger in the nixon white house 
desai worked 72 years of his life to earn honor from his 
countrymen his family his children and his grandchildren 
cyriac d kappil said 
with the stroke of a pen mr hersh assassinated his 
reputation his honor he said 
the case was expected to go to the jury today after us 
district judge charles r norgle instructs the panel on libel law 
to reach a finding that libel occurred the jury must conclude 
that hersh knowingly printed false material with malice or with 
reckless disregard of whether or not it was false 
kappil asked the sixmember jury to award his client now 94 and 
living in bombay 35 million that was far less than the 150 
million the lawsuit originally requested and the 50 million it 
recently cited 
kappil said hersh fabricated notes to back up the assertions 
about desai which he knew all along were false but used to put 
some flavor some curry into the book so it would sell 
nussbaum countered by saying the brief accounts in the book that 
pertained to desai were based on interviews with high level 
sources whose identities were not disclosed 
the concept that mr hersh would forge notes to sell books 
that he would knowingly make false statments is an obnoxious 
concept nussbaum said it is entirely out of keeping with his 
career as a journalist 
hersh 52 wrote that desai had been paid 20000 a year by the 
cia for information about the indian government and was a valuable 
asset to the us government during the administrations of 
lyndon johnson and richard nixon 
desai who headed indias government from 1977 to 1979 and was a 
bitter rival of the late prime minister indira gandhi has denied 
he served in such a role 
former secretary of state henry kissinger in testimony monday 
said he didnt believe desai was a cia informant but he 
acknowledged he couldnt be absolutely sure because he wasnt told 
the names of informants 
hersh won the pulitzer prize for international reporting in 1970 
for his coverage of the my lai massacre in vietnam

graham chapman a founding member of the zany 
british comedy group monty python died of cancer at age 48 as his 
former colleagues talked to him about the good old days his 
adopted son said today 
chapman was rushed to maidstone general hospital in southeast 
england from his nearby home on tuesday and died there wednesday 
night said his manager don epstein funeral arrangements have not 
been announced 
when chapman died fellow monty python comics michael palin and 
john cleese were at his bedside said the adopted son john 
tomiczek another member of the troupe terry jones visited him 
earlier 
chapman an admitted homosexual and reformed alcoholic who 
smoked a pipe told reporters in august that a dentist found a 
cancerous growth on his tonsils during a routine examination 
later tests showed he was also suffering from cancer of the 
spine he said 
he returned to his home last month and was quoted as telling the 
sun britains largest circulation newspaper that he had beaten 
the disease 
tomiczek said graham had been ill for some time he had been 
given the all clear once but it was a very virulent strain of the 
cancer 
he said he sat with chapman for five hours on wednesday but left 
for a moment to allow cleese and palin a few moments alone with 
their friend 
john cleese was with him and so was michael palin when he 
died michael was talking to him when he died tomiczek said i 
wasnt there at that time i had just left 
chapman was educated at cambridge university and qualified as a 
doctor before turning to comedy 
in 1968 he teamed up with cleese palin jones eric idle and 
terry gilliam to film the television series monty pythons flying 
circus 
the show made its debut on the british broadcasting corp on 
oct 5 1969 in a slot previously filled by a sunday religious 
discussion the last original show was broadcast in december 1974 
the groups madcap and irreverent approach to comedy was a hit 
both in britain and abroad 
chapman often appeared as a stuffy army officer with a comical 
upperclass accent he sometimes appeared in full uniform to

a b1b bomber crew unable 
to get the aircrafts nose gear unstuck guided the plane halfway 
across the continent to a whiteknuckle landing in the desert 
where it billowed dust as it ground to a halt 
the 280 million bomber which wasnt carrying its nuclear 
weapons sutained some damage but did not catch fire wednesday as 
it scraped its nose for more than 30 seconds along the 12milelong 
dry lake bed in the mojave desert 
the fourman crew escaped injury said tech sgt donn clarius 
an edwards spokesman 
the sac crew exhibited tremendous skill and firstclass 
airmanship in bringing to a successful conclusion what was at 
best a difficult situation said a statement from strategic air 
command headquarters at offutt air force base neb 
the flight began nearly 12 hours earlier as a training mission 
over texas but quickly turned tense when the nose landing gear 
jammed 
after attempting to jar the nose wheel lose with a touchandgo 
landing on the main gear at dyess air force base near abilene the 
crew refueled in the air and flew to 1200 miles to california 
the air force opted to land at edwards 60 miles north of los 
angeles because of the forgiving nature of the clay surface and 
the wide open spaces on the desert base which is used for space 
shuttle landings and is often a haven for troubled aircraft 
ground crews were assessing damage to the bomber clarius said 
dale punter a resident of nearby lancaster and an aerospace 
buff said radio traffic between the pilots and controllers 
described the landing as perfect 
it was real nice structure looking good punter quoted the 
pilot as saying just after the landing 
lt anu sjaardema an edwards spokeswoman said the bomber 
wasnt carrying nuclear weapons 
aboard were capt jeffrey k beene 30 aircraft commander 
assigned to 337th bombardment squadron capt vernon b benton 30 
copilot capt robert h hendricks 31 offensive systems officer 
and lt col joseph g day 38 an instructor and offensive systems 
officer 
the plane took off at 638 am pdt from dyess one of four 
bases in the country where the b1 is stationed the aircraft 
started circling dyess about three hours later as mechanics from 
dyess and the planes manufacturer rockwell international worked 
with the crew to try get the nose gear down 
the bomber left for california five hours later and landed at 
615 pm 
the b1b with a maximum speed of 1000 mph and range of more 
than 7000 miles is 147 feet long and 137 feet wide when its 
swingwings are extended it weighs 477000 pounds fully fueled and 
armed it is the most sophisticated bomber on active duty the b2 
stealth bomber is still in the test stage 
despite its critical role the b1 has been plagued with 
problems including fuel leaks and complaints about performance of 
its electronic warfare components 
there have been three b1b crashes and the crash of a b1 
prototype 
the most recent crash was in november 1988 in south dakota an 
air force report blamed the pilot and copilot saying they lost 
track of altitude when they strained to line up their landing 
approach in heavy overcast the crew ejected 
the crashes left the air force with 97 b1bs the first bomber 
added to the strategic air command in about 25 years production 
has been completed for 205 billion 
in february the general accounting office said problems persist 
in performance and fuel leaks probably could not be corrected 
fixes could cost 400 million per aircraft if the air force decided 
to do them all the gao said

poland and hungary

tibetans danced and sang in the streets 
of this himalayan town today after their spiritual leader the 
dalai lama won the 1989 nobel peace prize 
shops closed and excited people rushed out singing folk songs 
in praise of the dalai lama who has been living in exile in 
dharmsala since he fled from his homeland in 1959 
the tibetan governmentinexile announced a holiday for its 
offices and called for a public prayer service friday in the main 
buddhist temple theken choaling 
the dalai lama who won the coveted prize for a nonviolent 
struggle to free his himalayan nation from chinese rule is 
currently in the united states 
i feel it has been long overdue said sonan topgyal the 
general secretary of the tibetan information and international 
relations in dharamsala 
it will be one step closer to tibetan independence he 
said 
the dalai lama who was born tenzin gyatso on june 7 1935 was 
cited by the nobel committee for shunning violence and advocating 
peaceful measures to liberate tibet 
china moved in its army and occupied tibet in 1950 in march 
chinese troops imposed martial law in tibet following the most 
recent round of proindependence rioting at least 38 people have 
been reported killled 
the nobel prize has given a new dimension to the tibetan 
struggle said lhasang tsering the president of the tibetan 
youth congress which has long advocated an armed independence 
struggle however he said our call for an armed struggle will 
not be affected it will remain 
the chinese insist tibet has been an integral part of china 
since the 13th century the beijing government has said it is ready 
for talks if the dalai lama renounces tibetan independence 
the dalai lama has proposed a compromise offering o keep tibet 
as an autonomous chinese territory and to relinquish control of 
foreign affairs to beijing

china regards the dalai lama winner of the 1989 
nobel peace prize as a separatist whose followers have instigated 
violence and discord in his native land of tibet 
chinese government offices were closed tonight and there was no 
immediate reaction to the exiled tibetan spiritual leaders winning 
the coveted prize 
china was certain however to be displeased as the immediate 
reaction of an embassy official in oslo indicated 
wang guisheng an official at the chinese embassy in the 
norwegian capital was quoted as saying this has hurt the 
chinese peoples feelings he reiterated the claim that tibet has 
always been an integral part of china 
in china premier li peng expressed the chinese position toward 
the dalai lama last year when he said the government would only 
conduct talks with the dalai lama when he abandons his splittist 
activities and maintains the unification of the motherland 
beijing rejected the dalai lamas compromise proposal made in a 
june 1988 speech to the european parliament for the creation of a 
selfgoverning tibet in which china could station troops there and 
have control over the regions foreign affairs 
the dalai lamas proposals the authoritative beijing review 
said attempt to tamper with history distort reality and deny 
tibets status as an inalienable part of chinas territory under 
chinese sovereignty 
china rarely attacks the dalai lama directly for the 
intermittent antichinese proindependence violence that has hit 
the tibetan capital lhasa over the past two years 
but when riots break out as they did in march when about 30 
people were killed the government invariably blames the dalai 
lama clique of buddhist monks and followers of the spiritual 
leader based at his homeinexile in dharamsala in northern india 
china imposed martial law in lhasa on march 7 to quell the 
disturbances and avoid a further violence on march 10 the 30th 
anniversary of a failed uprising against the chinese army that led 
to the dalai lamas flight to india 
martial law remains in effect in the city and tibetan hostility 
to chinese rule shows no signs of abating chinese who have been in 
lhasa recently report random attacks on chinese on the streets 
china insists that tibet has been an integral part of china 
since the 13th century but many tibetans are deeply resentful of 
the chinese presence because of chinas past suppression of tibetan 
religion and customs particularly during the leftist 196676 
cultural revolution 
the dalai lama is still revered by the tibetan people who ask 
foreign tourists for his picture and talk of the day when he will 
return to be their leader again 
china has invited the dalai lama to return but only after he 
gives up all claims to tibetan independence it is not clear 
whether he would be allowed to return to live in lhasa 
china has also insisted that any negotiations with the dalai 
lama not include foreigners or members of his 
governmentinexile the chinese stress that any talks would be 
strictly a chinese internal affair 
the dalai lamas political activities abroad have invariably 
angered the chinese china blamed the first major outbreak of 
violence in lhasa in the fall of 1987 on the dalai lamas 
impassioned plea for tibetan rights in a washington meeting with 
members of congress

the state house turned back an attempt to gut 
massachusetts firstinthenation universal health insurance law 
but voted to delay its key provision for a year 
in an uncommon move house speaker george keverian a democrat 
left the rostrum wednesday and took to the floor to offer an 
amendment to preserve the program a centerpiece in gov michael 
dukakis 1988 presidential campaign 
keverian saved the bills key provision a mandate that 
businesses with six or more employees provide health insurance 
worth 1680 to each worker by delaying its effect until 1993 
the bill goes next to the senate 
rep peter forman a republican had won preliminary house 
approval in july to repeal the key provision he had argued the 
plan would cost between 400 million and 1 billion in tax dollars 
and could harm businesses with the added burden 
under the plan the state would subsidize health insurance for 
workers whose employers opt not to buy coverage for their 
employees it would also help provide insurance to the 
selfemployed and to businesses with fewer than six employees 
keverian argued against repeal and pleaded instead for a delay 
in implementation to study the laws funding the 
democraticcontrolled house agreed 9653 
dukakis spokeswoman mindy lubber credited keverians great 
leadership with preserving the program to provide insurance to 
the uninsured 
the keverian amendment would also keep in place a provision that 
would take effect next year to provide insurance to jobless workers 
collecting unemployment compensation that plan would be financed 
by a 1680ayear fee which businesses with six or more workers 
would pay for each employee 
the plan has already provided health insurance to about 77000 
of the estimated 600000 massachusetts residents who did not have 
insurance when the plan was passed last year 
of that total 17000 are people moving off welfare into jobs 
that dont provide health insurance as well as disabled adults and 
some children with serious disabilities the 60000 others are 
college students who were required this school year to have health 
insurance either through their parents or through group plans 
offered through colleges

request to join the adoptahighway antilitter program also turned

owner of the pennyrich bra patch in fayetteville everybody wears

at least 18 young sinhalese were 
beheaded or shot to death and their bodies were dumped in a central 
sri lankan university campus a government official said today 
elsewhere a leader of a tamildominated province in sri lankas 
northeast said an army of 30000 tamils is training to replace 
indian peacekeeping troops scheduled to withdraw by dec 31 
four bodies were found on the lawn of the peradeniya university 
and 14 more were found nearby outside a lecture hall early today 
said residents of kandy where the university is located it was not 
immediately known if the victims were students 
the killings apparently were in retaliation for the 
assassination wednesday of the universitys assistant registrar 
edward nagahawatta according to residents and a government 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
two gunmen on a bicycle killed nagahawatta a volunteer soldier 
inside the campus 55 miles northeast of colombo authorities 
blamed sinhalese radicals of the peoples liberation front an 
antigovernment guerrilla group 
sri lankan human rights groups say the military and 
progovernment death squads routinely kill sympathizers of the 
sinhalese radicals the government denies the charge 
the governments defense adviser gen sepala attygalle said he 
was aware that 18 bodies had been found in the univeristy but he 
did not have details 
meanwhile vartharajah perumal chief minister of the 
northeastern provincial council said an army is being set up to 
protect the tamil people and the democratic system now existing 
in the northeast the council is a form of local government 
we are not increasing the militarization of the north and the 
east we are creating a legitimate armed force he told reporters 
permuals eelam peoples liberation front a former separatist 
rebel group fears its members will face armed attacks by the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the dominant guerrillas fighting 
the indian soldiers 
the tamil tigers refused to join the political mainstream when 
most other militias including perumals group agreed to abide by 
an indiamediated peace accord in july 1987 
the accord promised limited autonomy to the minority tamils in 
the northeast in exchange for the surrender of arms by the 
guerrillas which was to be supervised by the indian peacekeeping 
soldiers 
the tamil tigers reneged on the accord and began attacking 
indian soliders 
other tamil groups that gave up fighting say president 
ranasinghe premadasas government dominated by the countrys 
sinhalese majority has not fully turned over the political powers 
promised in the accord 
india plans to have withdrawn its 40000 peacekeeping troops in 
the islands northeast by dec 31 
the indian troops deployment also angered sinhalese rebels in 
the south who launched a campaign of assassinations and terror to 
overthrow the government saying the indian presence compromised 
the countrys independence 
sinhalese radicals also contend the government gave the tamils 
most of whom live in the northeast too many concessions in the 
july 1987 accord 
more than 5000 people have been killed in two years of violence 
inspired by the southern rebels the tamil insurgency that began in 
1983 has claimed the lives of 11000 people including 1000 indian 
soldiers 
tamil demands for a separate state grew out of complaints of 
discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people tamils make up 18 
percent of the population

the navy says the captain of the uss iowa and 
three subordinates are being cited for violating administrative 
procedures but that their dereliction of duty didnt 
contribute to an explosion that killed 47 men 
the citations resulted from admirals mast hearings conducted 
earlier this week on board the iowa in the mediterranean by vice 
adm joseph s donnell iii 
it should be stressed that although deficiencies in the iowas 
training documentation weapons handling requirements and adherence 
to safety procedures were found within the weapons department the 
investigation determined that these shortcomings did not cause or 
contribute to the explosion the navy said in a statement 
each of the four was charged with a dereliction of duty under 
the uniform code of military justice as a result of administrative 
deficiencies found in the uss iowa investigation the navy said 
defense secretary dick cheney said today that the disciplinary 
actions were correct 
all the procedures were not adhered to cheney said on 
abctvs good morning america program those flaws did not 
contribute to the explosion but when you discover those types of 
administrative foulups you want to take action thats what the 
navy did i thought the action was appropriate 
the navy said the lax procedures were found during an 
investigation of the april 19 explosion 
the navy concluded earlier that the explosion in the 
battleships no 2 gun turret was most likely triggered when 
gunners mate clayton hartwig inserted a detonator between two 
powder bags 
however that report has been criticized by members of congress 
and by hartwigs relatives 
kathy kubicina of cleveland hartwigs sister said she was not 
surprised by the navy action 
they got merely a slap on the wrists if they would have 
gotten something harsher the navy would have had to admit their 
own guilt i was prepared for this which is absolutely nothing 
she said 
during the investigation other alleged violations were found 
including experimentation with extrastrength gunpowder and 
projectile loads the navy said those allegations prompted the 
admirals mast hearings 
capt fred p moosally commander of the battleship and his 
operations officer cmdr robert finney were subject to 
administrative corrective measures the navy said 
stiffer penalties went to cmdr robert j kissinger the weapons 
officer and master chief petty officer stephen skelly the fire 
control gunner they were given careerdamaging punitive letters of 
admonition and suspended fines 2000 for kissinger and 1000 for 
skelly 
the navy said the action against moosally was less severe 
because subordinates were held accountable for deficiencies in 
their specifically assigned duties 
all four men may appeal

country but moslem warlords said the peace parley was destined to 
fail 
any political settlement reached by members of lebanons divided 
legislature would have to be acceptable to the militia leaders who 
have battled for 14 years 
the 30 moslem and 33 christian members of parliament planned to 
begin debating today syrias role in the war conference sources 
said 
christian deputies were demanding that syria withdraw its 40000 
troops from lebanon as a condition for accepting reforms designed 
to give more power to moslems 
syria and many of its lebanese moslem allies advocate putting 
the reforms into effect first to be followed by a syrian pullout 
the reforms are intended to rectify the balance of power in 
lebanon where maronite christians have held the presidency as well 
as leading posts in the army and judiciary since independence in 
1943 
a threeman arab league mediation committee has submitted a 
compromise proposal for a phased syrian withdrawal first from the 
immediate beirut region eventually pulling back to the bekaa 
valley in eastern lebanon 
the timing was left flexible and conditional on the 
reinstatement of a central government although a twoyear 
timetable has frequently been mentioned 
a total pullout of syrias forces from the bekaa valley and 
lebanon would follow the conclusion of a security pact between 
damascus and beirut at a later stage 
christian deputy farid sarhal said in a speech he distributed to 
fellow legislators and the press that there can be no syrian 
solution to the lebanese problem and there can be no solution 
without syria and without agreement with it 
this is a political fact which we cannot escape or deny 
the conference sources said mediators including host saudi 
foreign minister prince saud alfaisal have been working 
intensively to try to get christians to water down their demand for 
a syrian pullout to precede implementation of reforms 
the mediators also lobbied moslem deputies to try to persuade 
them to drop their opposition to any such linkage said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in tehran the leaders of four lebanese moslem factions issued a 
statement thursday blaming the christian leader gen michel aoun 
for the crisis in their country the official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
in a dispatch monitored in cyprus it paraphrased the statement 
as saying any plan that ignores the interests of the lebanese 
nation is bound to fail 
the statement said the taif conference was doomed to failure and 
called for the overthrow of aoun the agency said 
it was issued by nabih berri leader of the shiite amal 
movement druse chieftain walid jumblatt sheik subhi tufaili a 
leader of the shiite hezbollah or party of god and sheik saeed 
shaaban head of a syrianbacked sunni fundamentalist faction 
iranian leaders are calling for the bulk of political power in 
lebanon to be handed to the moslems who are generally believed to 
make up about 55 percent of the countrys 4 million people 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted jumblatt as saying 
we believe that the taif conference is no more than a break in 
the fighting to give the maronites a chance to rearm their forces 
it also paraphrased berri as saying no solution was possible in 
lebanon without the destruction of maronite rule 
it was not clear whether the tough statements from irans and 
syrias moslem allies were meant as a warning of impending warfare 
or simply designed to shore up the moslem militias position during 
the taif talks

jurors said they acquitted a rape 
defendant because the alleged victims clothing a tank top a 
sheer short skirt and no underwear suggested she had asked for 
it 
the womans lawyer called the decision scary 
i thought this was 1989 said alexander siegel every time 
a female goes out alone does she have to look in the mirror and 
think is the dress appropriate or does it risk violence to her body 
and mind 
on the night the 22yearold coconut creek woman said she was 
raped she wore a tank top and a short white lace skirt without 
underwear according to testimony 
she asked for it said juror roy diamond the way she was 
dressed with that skirt you could see everything she had she was 
advertising for sex 
the woman was not in court wednesday when the jury of three men 
and three women found steven l lord 26 not guilty the woman 
said lord abducted her nov 6 from a parking lot and forced her 
into her car pulling over twice to rape her at knifepoint 
siegel said the verdict was especially painful because the woman 
had been jailed for six days for refusing to testify that action 
had angered victims rights advocates 
she said the jury was obviously several generations older than 
her and if they would go out to nightclubs they would see that how 
she was dressed was not provocatively but similar to many other 
women siegel said 
and if being in style is asking to be raped she said thats a 
sad statement on society 
lord testified that the woman traded sex for money and cocaine 
and defense attorney timothy day argued her intentions were borne 
out by the way she dressed 
i have to question why she wore a semiseethrough skirt with 
no underwear he said 
a juror dean medeiros said we felt she was up to no good 
the way she was dressed 
she was obviously dressed for a good time but we felt she may 
have bit off more than she could chew said juror mary bradshaw 
jurors also described the woman as arrogant and not credible 
lord faces assault charges in three other cases and was ordered 
returned to georgia for trial

trainloads of elated east germans 
rolled into this border town today and thousands of their 
desperate countrymen battled police in dresden while trying to 
board the freedom trains to the west 
eight trains packed with 7600 refugees arrived after an 
overnight journey from prague czechoslovakia where they had 
sought refuge in hopes of following other east germans who were 
allowed to emigrate during the weekend 
out of hell finally shouted one young man from a train 
window as one of the trains pulled into this northern bavarian town 
shortly after dawn today some of the refugees had spent 14 hours 
on board the trains 
in poland meanwhile another 600 east germans who sought asylum 
in the west german embassy in warsaw were told today they also will 
be allowed to flee to west germany west german foreign ministry 
spokesman juergen chrobog announced 
when trains from prague began arriving in hof today thousands 
of refugees leaned out train windows cheering and clapping while 
others burst into tears of joy relief workers handed out food and 
clean clothing 
east germany agreed to allow the exodus from the west german 
embassies in prague and warsaw the second in five days on 
tuesday it then tried to stop the refugee flood by closing its 
border with czechoslovakia the only nation where east germans 
could freely travel 
east germany made the move to end the exodus of its young and 
skilled citizens before the hardline communist country celebrates 
its 40th anniversary this weekend 
in a facesaving move the trains traveled from prague back into 
east germany before heading into west germany so the government in 
east berlin could officially expel the refugees 
many east germans tried desperately to reach prague and join the 
exodus but 200 who made it there decided not to take the trains to 
west germany instead accepting an offer from the east berlin 
government to return home with a guarantee of emigration within six 
months 
east germany had made the offer last week in an effort to get 
the refugees who had converged on the prague and warsaw embassies 
to leave it was not known why the 200 who accepted the offer 
bypassed an immediate opportunity to leave on the trains but 
family considerations in east germany may have played a role 
despite the closed border with czechoslovakia another 20 east 
germans arrived at the prague embassy after the trains had departed 
on wednesday they too were seeking asylum 
west german embassy officials initially estimated the number of 
refugees in the embassy at 1000011000 and said they would be 
traveling on 15 trains to hof only eight trains arrived with 7600 
in the east german city of dresden people fought running 
battles with police overturned cars and smashed windows of the 
main ralroad station wednesday night witnesses said 
we want out we want out the wouldbe refugees screamed as 
police swinging truncheons charged to drive them back from the main 
railroad station 
an incredible amount of time passed before we could go through 
dresden i think there must have been some disturbances said 
26yearold refugee guido albrecht of potsdam 
witnesses said police also used a water cannon to try to 
disperse the crowd as the refugee trains passed through they said 
the police broke up the demonstration after midnight 
british tourist adrian maitland said he saw police charge the 
crowd several times from a hotel overlooking the railway station 
it looks like a battleground he told the british 
broadcasting corp by telephone there are fire engines all 
around there are ambulances ive seen youths being carried off 
with blood streaming down their face 
police had also clashed with 5000 wouldbe refugees in dresden 
on tuesday night 
thousands of east germans had flocked to train stations and 
lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of joining the refugees 
aboard what could be the last freedom trains to the west 
the trains journey west was plagued by delays as police 
dispersed the crowds before the trains came through passengers 
arriving in hof said they stopped for some time before going 
through the dresden 
saying goodbye like that was indescribable feeling one 
young refugee said in hof of the trip through his homeland 
as the first train rumbled into hof at dawn a deafening cheer 
rang out from hundreds of wellwishers who had spent hours waiting 
in freezing weather 
interior ministry official horst waffenschmidt told reporters 
the trains doors had been locked in prague to prevent anyone else 
from boarding 
on sunday 7000 east germans arrived in west germany after east 
germany allowed those crowded in embassies in prague and warsaw to 
leave many said they had jumped onto the trains as they passed 
through east germany 
the clampdown on travel was also likely to severely curb the 
number of east germans going to reformminded hungary which 
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of east germans 
to pass through to the west the shortest route to hungary from 
east germany is through czechoslovakia 
east germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach west 
germany 
in east berlin police wednesday scuffled with 50 east germans 
trying to enter the us embassy witnesses said eighteen others 
made it inside the compound tuesday but agreed late wednesday to 
leave with assurances their government will look favorable on their 
emigration requests diplomats said

chicagos aldermen exempted themselves from a bid 
by mayor richard m daley to ferret out corruption 
the city council voted 461 wednesday in favor of a watereddown 
version of daleys suggested ordinance to create an inspector 
general 
the inspector general would investigate corruption among the 
citys 38000 employees except aldermen and their staffs 
i think we are sending the wrong message to our constituents 
which is that its ok to investigate wrongdoing just dont 
investigate us said alderman david orr who tried to include 
aldermen in the ordinance 
but alderman burt natarus argued the system is already working 
since 15 aldermen have been convicted of criminal wrongdoing over 
the past two decades 
daley whose late father was mayor for more than 20 years said 
he got 95 percent of what he wanted in the legislation even though 
many aldermen usually loyal to daley opted not to stand with him on 
the issue 
i pushed as hard as the cubs did to get into the world

president bush will undergo minor surgery 
friday at walter reed army medical center to remove an apparently 
noncancerous cyst from the middle finger of his right hand the 
white house announced today 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president who is 
lefthanded would be given a local anesthetic for the procedure 
expected to take about an hour 
bush joked about the operation at a picturetaking session in 
the oval office telling reporters i have to have this finger 
operated on were making a federal case out of it 
the cyst on the end of his middle finger just below the nail 
has bothered the president for about three years and it simply 
has reached the point where it has gotten larger and noticeable in 
daily activities fitzwater said 
its not really painful but its a nuisance the spokesman 
said 
fitzwater said that in medical termonology bush will have a 
mycoid cyst removed from the distal interphalangeal joint space 
of the finger 
he will undergo a local anesthetic called a digital nerve block 
and will remain awake throughout the onehour procedure 
fitzwater said 
the surgery will be performed by the top hand specialists from 
walter reed and georgetown university hospital the spokesman said 
the doctors clinical observation indicates that the cyst is 
benign there will of course be a routine pathalogic examination of 
the tissue he said 
asked by photographers during a picturetaking session with 
angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi to show his injured finger bush 
said dont tempt me but then he pointed his finger downward 
to show the cyst 
i will show you my scar afterwards he said 
asked if it would keep him from attending a world series game 
the president said no no life goes on i will continue through 
this awesome burden continue what im doing 
the last time bush was in the hospital was may 10 when he 
underwent a routine physical examination at that time the cyst 
was drained and doctors said it had been present for many years and 
did not present a medical problem 
in 1986 the president had a basal cell skin cancer removed from 
his face the same year he had a small noncancerous polyp 
removed from his colon 
fitzwater said bush would spend two or three hours at walter 
reed and then fly in the early afternoon to the presidential 
retreat at camp david md for the weekend 
he said that removing the cyst would require stitches in bushs 
finger

israels decisionmaking inner cabinet today 
debated an egyptian proposal for peace talks with palestinians but 
took no action 
members of the leftleaning labor party headed by vice premier 
shimon peres proposed accepting egypts suggestions israel army 
radio reported but ministers of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc reportedly objected shamir was expected to 
resume the debate friday 
meanwhile palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
began a twoday general strike today in solidarity with arabs 
refusing to pay taxes as part of their nearly 22monthold 
rebellion against israeli rule 
soldiers shot to death a 20yearold protester during a clash 
with palestinian stone and bottlethrowers the army said four 
youths were reported wounded in separate incidents in the occupied 
lands 
arab reports said a 55yearold arab man was found stabbed to 
death in gaza city and slogans spraypainted on walls nearby 
accused him of collaborating with israel 
the fatalities raised to 584 the number of palestinians who have 
been killed by israelis during the uprising and to 127 the number 
of arabs killed by palestinians as suspected collaborators with 
israel 
the sixhour cabinet session reportedly centered on a proposal 
by us secretary of state james a baker to host talks between 
israel and egypt over the composition of a palestinian delegation 
for peace negotiations 
egyptian president hosni mubarak wants negotiations held in 
cairo 
bakers idea was raised by foreign minister moshe arens of 
likud who returned wednesday after holding a series of meetings 
with us and egyptian leaders in new york and washington 
arens reportedly recommended that the cabinet support bakers 
idea but the meeting broke up after he met stiff opposition from 
likud hardliners led by industry minister ariel sharon 
sharon was quoted as demanding that arens show the ministers the 
minutes of his meeting with baker and labor ministers then 
recommended they recess until friday for arens to bring the notes 
the labor ministers reportedly presented a proposal they drew up 
wednesday night to adopt mubaraks call for israelipalestinian 
talks 
the egyptian ambassador to israel mohammed bassiouny said 
today that an egyptianisraeli summit would depend on israels 
acceptance of participation by palestinians deported from the west 
bank and gaza by israel or other former residents of the 
territories 
without palestinians from outside it will never work 
bassiouny told the associated press 
egypt was offering to negotiate with israel and the united 
states on the principles of who should be included in the 
palestinian delegation not on the specific delegates which was 
the responsibility of the plo bassiouny said 
likud leaders opposed that 
the egyptian plan in its current version speaks of leading us 
into talks with a plo delegation so it must be rejected 
transport minister moshe katsav of likud said on israel radio 
during a break in the meeting 
israel says the palestine liberation organization is a terrorist 
organization and refuses to negotiate with it 
yossi ahimier spokesman for shamir said the likud ministers 
united behind a shamir proposal to refuse any contacts with the plo 
he added that likud members accept it generally that the prime 
minister will be in contact with the americans and will hear their 
proposals and we will judge later on what is good for us what we 
can adopt and what not 
shamir and his allies have said that they would hold talks with 
a palestinian delegation approved by israel but the two sides 
would only discuss procedures for holding elections in the disputed 
lands 
elections in the territories are a key element of the israeli 
government peace initiative announced in april 
the vote is meant to choose representatives to negotiate with 
israel on an interim fiveyear period of selfrule for 17 million 
palestinians who live in these lands the final status of the 
territories would be decided later

soviet troops in armenia have begun restoring rail 
shipments of food fuel and other basic goods that were cut off for 
two months by striking azerbaijani rail workers a news agency said 
today 
the troops were sent to the armenian capital yerevan after the 
supreme soviet legislature on tuesday ordered the ministries of 
defense and interior to restore rail traffic between the two 
feuding transcaucasian republics 
the troops began arriving wednesday night avel pogosyan an 
editor at the armenpress news agency in yerevan said in a 
telephone interview trains were moving today 
striking rail workers in azerbaijan motivated by ethnic 
demands imposed a virtual economic blockade of armenia by blocking 
rail lines and sabotaging cargo news reports said armenia depends 
heavily on trains for its supplies 
in august and september 32000 rail cars with food fuel and 
construction materials failed to reach armenia from azerbaijan due 
to sabotage moscow radio said in azerbaijan bridges were 
burned and trains were attacked with fire to prevent them from 
reaching armenia 
as a result of the blockade and sabotage workers in armenia 
attempting to rebuild housing demolished by decembers devastating 
earthquake do not have fuel and supplies to continue the newspaper 
socialist industry said 
thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as a 
result even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel 
the newspaper said as winter approaches restoration plans are 
not being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leaving 
construction sites 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda quoted azerbaijani deputy 
prosecutor r safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation for 
armenian sabotage of azerbaijan railroads in july and august 
this actually provoked the strike by railroad workers and 
the blockade itself safaraliev said however he added i want 
to emphasize that these measures cannot be justified 
the supreme soviet voted 3646 to adopt an emergency resolution 
giving the military and police authority to maintain railroad 
security in the transcaucasus the measure was weaker than one 
favored by president mikhail s gorbachev who wanted to ban all 
strikes in the nation for the next 15 months 
radio moscow said military and police would be assigned to 
protect certain sections of the main rail lines between the two 
republics locked in a bitter dispute over the armenian enclave of 
nagornokarabakh inside azerbaijan 
control over nagornokarabakh an enclave of mostly christian 
armenians situated inside moslemdominated azerbaijan is the focal 
point of the dispute that has claimed 117 lives since violence 
began 19 months ago

two months before his first meeting with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev pope john paul ii today urged 
soviet authorities to grant immediate legal status to the 
longsuppressed ukrainian catholic church 
john paul said the church had been forced into the catacombs 
more than 40 years ago and that he hears with ever greater 
urgency and frequency the cry of ukrainian catholics seeking the 
right to pray in public 
the readiness and good will of the authorities must be brought 
to bear so that they may after decades of neglect solve the 
problem of the recognition of the rights of the ukrainian catholic 
church 
the holy see expresses the hope that competent authorities 
will proceed without delay to the recognition of the rights of your 
church the pope said 
john paul said the terms of the human rights document approved 
in january at the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
should also be applied to the ukrainian church 
he specifically called for free access to places of worship the 
right of the church to organize its own hierarchy and the 
possibility of maintaining free contact with the faithful at home 
and abroad 
john paul said continued suppression of the ukrainian church 
contradicts programs of political and economic reform under way in 
the soviet union 
the campaign of hostility and accusations against this church 
and her pastors does not help reforms he said on the 
contrary it hinders them without the legalization of the 
ukrainian community the process of democratization will never be 
complete 
the ukrainian church was forcibly merged with the russian 
orthodox church under soviet dicator josef stalin in 1946 the pope 
noted that churches and monasteries were closed and some bishops 
and priests were killed deported or arrested 
but the eastern rite church has flourished underground and today 
counts 2 million to 4 million followers ukrainian catholics have 
rallied in recent weeks to demand legalization of the church 
the pope is expected to raise the ukrainian issue with gorbachev 
during his nov 29dec 1 visit to italy it would be the first 
meeting between a pope and a supreme kremlin leader 
in another sign of improved relations with the east bloc the 
pope today accepted the credentials of polands first ambassador to 
the holy see in more than 40 years 
the vatican in july restored full diplomatic relations with 
poland a first for a warsaw pact country relations had been cut 
by the communists who took power in poland in 1945

the dalai lama the exiled spiritual and 
political leader of tibet won the 1989 nobel peace prize today for 
his nonviolent struggle to free his himalayan nation from chinese 
rule 
the norwegian nobel committee praised the dalai lamas message 
of universal reverence and respect for all living things china 
condemned the selection 
though he preached peace his followers repeatedly joined bloody 
clashes with chinese authorities in lhasa the tibetan capital in 
the last two years 
i very much appreciate that kind of recognition about my 
beliefs the exiled tibetan monk said in newport beach calif 
where he is visiting in fact i always believed in love 
compassion and a sense of universal respect every human being has 
that potential 
the chairman of the norweigan nobel committee egil aarvik said 
the selection of the buddhist monk could also be seen as a signal 
of encouragement for the prodemocracy movement in china itself 
which was crushed in june 
the committee wouldnt have anything against them interpreting 
it like that aarvik said after reading the citation to reporters 
if i was a chinese student i would be fully in support of the 
decision he said referring to the students who led the 
prodemocracy movement that was violently suppressed in beijing in 
june 34 
the chinese embassy in oslo denounced the nobel committee 
decision as interfering in chinas internal affairs and called the 
dalai lama a political figure intent on splitting the 
fatherland 
embassy official wang guisheng was quoted by the national ntb 
news agency as saying this has hurt the chinese peoples 
feelings and he reiterated the claim that tibet was always an 
integral part of china 
tibet was independent from 1911 until the new communist 
authorities in china regained control in 1950 
the dalai lama born tenzin gyatso in 1935 had been nominated 
for the coveted nobel peace prize for at least the last three 
years ntb reported 
in march chinese troops imposed martial law in tibet following 
widespread rioting to protest the chinese occupation in 1987 38 
people were reported killed in fighting in lhasa more 
demonstrations have been reported since 
in dharmsala india where the dalai lama now lives tibetans 
danced and sang in the streets to celebrate shops closed and 
excited people rushed out singing folk songs in praise of their 
leader 
kjeld vibe ambassador from norway went to congratulate the 
dalai lama at the exclusive estate of ketchup scion clifford heinz 
early today the dalai lama has been staying at the newport beach 
home while attending a conference in southern california 
my case is nothing special i am a simple buddist monk no 
more no less he told vibe 
the religious leader dressed in red and orange robes and 
wearing sandals said he hopes the nobel prize will focus attention 
on compassion in every human being 
this prize may open in more peoples eyes to look at their own 
quality the softspoken dalai lama said 
the religious leader said he would like to go to oslo for 
presentation of the nobel prize on dec 10 
last year the dalai lama proposed a compromise for ending 
chinas occupation of tibet offering to keep it as an autonomous 
chinese territory and to relinquish control of foreign affairs to 
beijing 
chinas government said in august that its door is always open 
to talks with the dalai lama but that he must renounce tibetan 
independence china stressed it would talk to him only as an 
individual not as a representative of the tibetan government in 
exile which china has never recognized 
the dalai lamas persistent campaign to free tibet has sometimes 
embarrassed countries he visited that hoped to improve ties with 
beijing including norway 
during a visit in september 1988 appointments with several 
norwegian officials were canceled without explanation the chinese 
embassy reportedly had protested the visit to the government 
the committee said the dalai lama in his struggle for the 
liberation of tibet consistently has opposed the use of violence 
he has instead advocated peaceful solutions based upon tolerance 
and mutual respect in order to preserve the historical and cultural 
heritage of his people 
ninety people and organizations were nominated for this years 
prize which carries a cash award of 3 million swedish kronor or 
469000 
the 14th dalai lama was chosen when he was 5 years old as the 
reincarnation of tibets godking making him both the religious 
and political leader of the isolated mountain kingdom until the 
1950 chinese takeover 
a revolt occurred in 1956 and sporadic fighting continued for 
years the dalai lama and 100000 of his supporters fled tibet in 
1959 and established a governmentinexile in dharamsala india in 
the foothills of the himalayas 
in recent years he has offered to relinquish any political role 
for himself in tibet saying he preferred to see a democratic 
government while he led simple life of a buddhist monk 
let the young intelligent tibetans carry the responsibility 
for leading the government he said last year during a visit to 
stockholm sweden 
lhasa remains under martial law and tibet is closed to foreign 
reporters 
tibetan hostility to chinese rule shows no signs of abating 
chinese who have been in lhasa recently report random attacks on 
chinese on the street 
committee sources confirmed that two czechoslovak dissidents 
playwright vaclav havel and jiri hajek were among the candidates 
for the nobel peace prize other contenders included south african 
black leader nelson mandela soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and former president reagan for their disarmament efforts 
the prize was established by dynamite inventor alfred nobel to

president bush assured angolan rebel leader 
jonas savimbi today that the united states supports his staying in 
power despite calls for his exile by other african leaders 
bush who has been seeking to settle a dispute between savimbi 
and zaires president mobutu sese seko met with the angolan leader 
for 30 minutes in the oval office 
i consider my visit here a success savimbi told reporters 
he said bush assured him of continued us support and that the 
administration does not accept the conceptions of exile which 
mobutu advocates 
us officials said earlier that bush would ask savimbi chief 
of the union for the total independence of angola or unita to 
settle his differences with mobutu in an effort to salvage the 
faltering accord reached through zaires mediation to end the 
14year civil war in angola 
first of all he will reassure him of our support and he will 
urge him to work with mobutu and all the parties involved said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bush delivered a similar message to mobutu at a 30minute oval 
office meeting wednesday convened at white house insistence mobutu 
flew to washington in the morning and returned immediately to new 
york to address the un general assembly 
the president reiterated the strong us support for unita and 
our appreciation of president mobutus efforts to try to help bring 
about national reconciliation in angola fitzwater said 
the president urged president mobutu to work out any 
differences which he might have with unita so that the goal of 
national reconciliation can be met he added 
the spokesman declined to discuss claims by conservative sen 
jesse helms rnc that mobutu had stopped shipping ussupplied 
arms to unita to pressure savimbi into accepting the angolan 
governments peace terms angolan foreign minister pedro van dunem 
made a similar claim at a meeting with reporters wednesday saying 
mobutu said he had stopped the shipments in keeping with his role 
as a neutral mediator 
unita is one of the largest recipients of covert us military 
aid estimated at more than 40 million annually the arms are 
delivered mainly through zaire which was on good terms with 
savimbi until mobutu began supporting the angolan governments 
views of the ceasefire accords reached in june at gbadolite zaire 
the united states is conducting intensive behindthescenes 
efforts to avert the collapse of the ceasefire agreement that has 
already been violated numerous times by both sides the two sides 
have refused to negotiate facetoface on restoring the ceasefire 
and discussing permanent peace accords 
savimbi said wednesday he would present bush with a new 
ceasefire agreement that would put the negotiations with the 
sovietbacked angolan government back on track 
although mobutu savimbi and van dunem were all in town 
wednesday they did not meet each other savimbi and van dunem took 
their case to members of congress and the media each accusing the 
other of reneging on the gbadolite accords 
savimbi is not willing really to commit himself to a process 
of peace van dunem said 
at issue is the question of what happened at a closeddoor 
meeting between savimbi and angolan president eduardo dos santos at 
the gbadolite summit 
mobutu supports dos santos version of events that savimbi 
promised he would go into temporary exile and integrate his forces 
into the angolan army 
savimbi denies it why should i do that we havent been 
defeated he told reporters wednesday 
the united states backs his position which calls for a 
ceasefire followed by free multiparty elections angola contends 
free elections can only be held after unita is integrated into the 
angolan military and peace is consolidated 
a multiparty system now is unthinkable savimbi said

i very much appreciate that kind of recognition about my 
beliefs the tibetan monk said early today in fact i always 
believed in love compassion and a sense of universal respect 
every human being has that potential 
my case is nothing special i am a simple buddhist monk no 
more no less 
the dalai lama was awake when word came around 3 am pdt that 
he won the peace prize for his nonviolent struggle to free his 
himalayan nation from chinese rule 
the norwegian nobel committee praised his message of universal 
reverence and respect for all living things china condemned the 
selection 
kjeld vibe ambassador from norway went to congratulate the 
dalai lama at the estate of ketchup scion clifford heinz the dalai 
lama who has been living in exile in india has been staying at 
the heinz home during a california visit 
during a meeting with the dalai lama in the living room of the 
home the ambassador extended congratulations from his countrys 
prime minister

great reverence for all things living and upon the concept of 
universal respect embracing all mankind as well as nature

attorney general dick thornburgh today blamed 
his difficulty finding a civil rights chief on the senate judiciary 
committees rejection of his original choice william lucas 
once burned twice shy thornburgh said we saw someone i 
felt was an appropriate candidate roughed up pretty badly in the 
judiciary committee frankly that has scared off some people who 
might otherwise be interested 
thornburgh said he is still looking for a candidate two months 
after the senate judiciary committee on a pair of tie votes 
rejected lucas nomination to be assistant attorney general for 
civil rights 
we are anxious to get someone nominated and confirmed its 
just on the basis of recent experience its going to be a little 
bit challenging thornburgh told reporters 
the difficulty was signaled wednesday when thornburghs 
spokesman david runkel said we dont have a short list of 
candidates the last guy who was nominated for that position took a 
few knocks there are not a lot of people volunteering 
the delay raises the possibility that president bush will not 
submit a new name to the senate before congress adjourns later this 
fall 
its not an easy position to fill and part of the reason was 
the way bill lucas was treated runkel said 
lucas a black republican who was sheriff and later chief 
executive of the michigan county that includes detroit encountered 
sharp criticism of his professional qualifications and his lack of 
civil rights experience during senate confirmation hearings 
opponents noted lucas is a lawyer who has never tried a court 
case during questioning lucas appeared to have trouble discussing 
some of the finer legal points of civil rights confessing at one 
point he was new to the law 
several senators expressed dismay over lucas defense of a 
series of supreme court decisions on employment discrimination that 
civil rights attorneys contend will make it harder to win lawsuits 
thornburgh blamed lucas rejection on raw politics and 
accused the panel of applying a litmus test that required lucas 
to criticize the supreme court cases 
lucas was quickly appointed to head the justice departments 
office of liaison services where he deals with the same civil 
rights groups that opposed his nomination to be assistant attorney 
general 
since lucas rejection about a halfdozen people have been 
interviewed by the justice department which recommends a candidate 
to the white house runkel said he offered no response when asked 
if anyone had turned the job down 
no names have been submitted to the fbi for a background check 
which is a part of the screening process before any nominees name 
is sent to the senate runkel said 
washington civil rights lawyer william taylor rejected runkels 
argument that lucas experience before the senate judiciary 
committee discouraged other candidates 
i couldnt accept the notion that lucas demise in the 
committee makes it difficult to fill the job said taylor who 
spoke against the nomination there are hundreds of lawyers with 
civil rights experience in the country who would not have any 
difficulty passing muster with the committee 
acting assistant attorney general james turner is heading the 
civil rights division in the interim

gen manuel antonio noriega said 
today that he urged rebel troops to release him and abandon their 
coup telling them to surrender or were all going to die right 
here 
loyalist troops killed 10 rebels and arrested dozens of top 
officers and soldiers while crushing the attempt to topple noriega 
who was help prisoner for several hours on tuesday the military 
said 
an overnight curfew kept the streets of panama city quiet for 
the second day in a row today 
a war communique said all but one of those killed were 
officers and that 25 people were wounded the casualty list 
released wednesday night was the first issued by the government 
since the attempted coup 
the communique said security forces arrested three members of 
the high command and about 35 other officers and soldiers the 
arrests of men supposedly among noriegas most trusted aides 
suggested the revolt may have had wider support than originally 
thought 
there were indications the coup attempt also came closer to 
toppling the defense forces chief and panamas de facto leader than 
first believed 
a defense forces officer said the plotters succeeded in 
capturing noriega and holding him for four or five hours at defense 
forces headquarters a lawyer for noriega initially had denied that 
the general was taken captive 
the surrender came when loyal officers took command of the 
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the 
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences said 
lt col arnulfo castrejon director of the defense forces security 
and defense committee 
one defense forces source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the rebels had wanted to take noriega alive which gave him 
time to take shelter in a bunker inside the compound and call for 
help by radio 
noriega said today on state television that he initially 
resisted the rebels but finally came out unarmed to talk with them 
i told them that either they surrendered or were all going 
to die right here noriega said their strategy was to take 
control and turn over all power to the rebels opposition 
i was unarmed during this time im a man of peace i fire 
on my enemies not against my brothers 
castrejon said noriega was held for four or five hours it was 
unclear if noriega gained freedom before or after troops loyal to 
him counterattacked the headquarters and forced the rebel surrender 
noriega had tried to calm his captors during the time he was 
held trying to avoid a bloodshed castrejon said 
the rebels rejected a us offer to take noriega out of the 
country saying they wanted to retire him defense secretary dick 
cheney said today on cbs this morning 
we were not given the opportunity to take him off their hands 
we would have been happy to do so had that been an option but they 
clearly were not of a mind to have that happen cheney said 
in washington president bush came under mounting criticism 
about the passive role played by us troops who stood fully armed 
a few hundred yards away and watched the rebellion fail 
the united states has been trying to topple noriega since he was 
indicted on us drug trafficking charges in february 1988 but the 
bush administration said it had no role in the coup attempt 
im afraid its a matter of cold feet it was a conscious 
decision not to assist said rep ike skelton dmo im 
furious about it 
it raises questions whether people down there can ever have 
confidence in the united states said rep william broomfield 
rmich the senior minority member of the house foreign relations 
committee 
members of the civilian opposition in panama noted that the 
group that staged the coup attempt did not back democratic reform 
their communique indicated they wanted noriega out and 
supported the provisional government that noriega set up said 
ricardo arias calderon an opposition vice presidential candidate 
in may 7 elections that noriega annulled after international 
observers said his candidates had lost by a landslide 
despite that noriega continued to blame the united states for 
his troubles noriega says it is all part of a us plot to hold 
onto the panama canal due to become panamas at the end of the 
century 
the gringo piranhas want to do away with me the general 
said wednesday during a brief tour of the street outside his 
headquarters 
the war communique only listed those arrested wounded or 
killed during the coup it did not give any specific reason for the 
arrests of col guillermo wong the head of state security and two 
other members of the 20member high command the panamanian 
equivalent of a general staff 
defense forces spokesmen were not available for comment on the 
arrests according to people who answered phones at headquarters 
among those killed was maj moises giroldi vega leader of the 
urraca battalion that launched the uprising the war communique 
said no dead were listed as belonging to loyalist forces 
of the wounded 18 were from forces loyal to noriega three from 
the rebel forces and five civilians the communique said 
the communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge at 
fort clayton a us base a few miles from panama city us 
officials refused comment on that report 
as reports of noriegas narrow escape circulated the general 
appeared to be enjoying himself when he appeared at a window in his 
headquarters to receive the cheers of several thousand supporters 
most of them government workers 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity in 
washington said they were mystified by the rebels apparent 
decision to let noriega go 
its crazy i dont understand it said one us official

the senate today approved a ban on burning or 
otherwise defacing the american flag but added a 
republicansponsored change that democrats said could make the bill 
vulnerable in any future court challenge 
the ban previously approved by the house cleared the senate 
919 it was returned to the defense and we never saw it said jury foreman 
ricky hill 
his testimony did not weigh on me one bit the foreman said 
i believe he began in earnest he was called by god but 
eventually the money became too much for him 
he was a man of god hill added he got corrupt and i feel 
sorry for the man 
as they awaited the verdict in the courtroom several bakker 
supporters held bibles opened to psalm 17 which reads thou hast 
tried me and shalt find nothing 
prosecutors contend bakker raised 158 million by selling 
lifetime partnerships at his heritage usa retreat near fort 
mill sc but used the money for projects other than the lodging 
he promised partners typically paid 1000 for the promise of 
three nights lodging annually at the theme park 
bakker resigned from the ministry in 1987 in a sex and money 
scandal 
you cant lie to people to send you money its that 
simple prosecutor deborah smith told the jury 
you cant tell halftruths if you do it if you use the 
postal service and the public airwaves you will find yourself in 
federal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud thats why 
were here today because thats just what mr bakker did 
bakkers attorneys said he was a devout man of god 
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud said attorney 
george davis he was conducting a ministry he was doing what he 
thought was vital to the survival of his ministry

the senate today approved a ban on burning or 
otherwise defacing the american flag but added a 
republicansponsored change that democrats said could make the bill 
vulnerable in any future court challenge 
the ban previously approved by the house cleared the senate 
919 it was returned to the house for consideration of changes 
made by the senate 
key votes came on two gopsponsored changes in wording that 
democrats said would skew careful phrasing that was designed to 
beat back expected court challenges to the bills constitutionality 
republican critics say the bill already is likely to fail such a 
court test they call for a constitutional amendment as urged by 
president bush after the supreme court in june overturned the 
criminal conviction on texas flagburner gregory lee johnson on the 
ground his freedom of speech had been violated 
the ruling resulted in a public reaction that fueled 
congressional action 
the skirmishing on the senate floor however was between 
democrats seeking to push through their bill through and 
republicans hoping replace it with the proposed amendment that 
measure comes up later this month 
in rapid succession the senate first refused 6931 to kill an 
amendment offered by sen pete wilson rcalif that would make it 
a crime to physically defile the flag it then adopted by a 
wide margin wilsons measure which democratic sponsors said would 
nudge the bill toward constitutional problems on freespeech 
grounds 
the senate then voted 5347 to kill a proposal by minority 
leader bob dole rkan to exempt flag defacement that took place 
in private sponsors also said that could make the measure 
vulnerable 
those voting against the final bill were dole and sens john h 
chaffee rri charles grassley riowa orrin hatch rutah 
gordon humphrey rnh edward m kennedy dmass bob kerrey 
dneb howard m metzenbaum dohio and daniel p moynihan dny 
the bill calls for up to a 1000 fine and year in jail for 
anyone who burns and american flag or defaces it in any one of 
several other ways 
federal law already bans flag burning but senators say the law 
contains constitutional pitfalls similar to the ones in the texas 
statute 
conservative republicans urge the amendment on grounds that it 
would settle the issue once and for all it could not be 
challenged in court 
many democrats retort that amending the constitution should be 
only a last resort and that one act of burning is no cause to limit 
the freedom of speech 
of all things today in the united states of america we need 
to encourage our people to be less afraid speaking what they 
believe letting their hearts and minds give rise to what they 
truly think ought to be done said sen bob kerrey dneb 
proponents of a constitutional amendment however scoff at the 
notion that any statute can be drawn that would survive a court 
challenge on freedom of speech grounds 
the statutory approach in my opinion is a futile and 
ineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test at 
all said sen orrin hatch rutah 
some senators say they detect a distinct cooling of the issue in 
the months since the supreme court ruling 
theres no grass roots firestorm for jailing flag burners nor 
for amending the constitution said sen howard m metzenbaum 
dohio 
but metzenbaum said enough passion remains that lawmakers are 
wary of opposing a ban 
i think that some of us are afraid to stand up for our 
principles afraid the people wont understand that he said 
i think were afraid that our opponents in the next election will 
be even less understanding 
he and sen edward m kennedy dmass said they would oppose 
both the bill and the constitutional amendment saying either would 
take away rights 
patriotism is not the issue kennedy said free speech 
is 
sen howell heflin dala was among lawmakers who planned to 
vote for both the bill and the amendment 
the flag represents the very heart of what it means to be an 
american and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power be 
undermined through legal desecration heflin said

scientists have pushed down 
temperatures to a record low of only two billionths of a degree 
above absolute zero the low temperature laboratory at the helsinki 
university of technology said thursday 
absolute zero minus 45967 fahrenheit is unattainable 
according to the laws of physics scientists say 
two billionths of a degree corresponds to two nanokelvins nk 
the previous record of 30 nk which is in the guinness book of 
world records was set by the same laboratory in 1984 said 
professor olli lounasmaa head of the research team 
the new record was not an aim in itself but a side product of 
the research we are engaged in our main aim is to study the state 
of matter as close to absolute zero as possible lounasmaa said 
the experiment was conducted in a nuclear demagnetization device 
by dr pertti hakonen from the helsinki university of technology 
and dr shi yin from michigan state university 
the record low temperature was reached in the atomic nuclei of a 
onegram silver specimen the previous record was set by using a 
copper specimen lounasmaa said 
the new mark appears to be a record for the cooling of the 
nuclei or cores of atoms in a solid said robert richardson of 
cornell university in ithaca ny that is different from chilling 
an entire chunk of material and the record for that mark is 10000 
times warmer he said 
experiments at extremely low temperatures enable us to study 
atoms more individually lounasmaa said the experiment may 
also have some future practical applications but above all it 
will give us new knowledge about the state of matter 
low temperature research already is being used in for instance 
the study of signals in the human brain

parthenon temple in the early 19th century by british diplomat 
lord elgin who shipped them to london 
ms mercouri who has made a plea for the return of the elgin 
marbles said in may that she hoped they would be featured in the 
new museum

among the entries by jan31 1990 from these the committe will 
select 10 plans and then choose the winner in october

pressure is building on president 
corazon aquino to allow ferdinand marcos to be buried here and 
some analysts believe the president is in a nowin situation 
pressure to lift the ban on returning marcos body from hawaii 
where he died sept 28 has come not only from avowed supporters of 
the late president but also from some of mrs aquinos supporters 
several said that if mrs aquino holds fast the standoff will 
continue if she relents she will appear indecisive 
i must say in spite of the fact that i am a member of the 
ruling coalition as a filipino the inclination should be in favor 
of the right of mr marcos to be buried in his homeland said 
sen aquilino pimentel one of mrs aquinos campaign managers in 
the 1986 election 
mrs aquino banned the body because of fears of unrest by marcos 
supporters on wednesday the cabinet endorsed the decision after 
hearing reports of alleged threats against the government 
in the only public opinion poll since marcos death 69 percent 
of the 950 manila residents surveyed supported allowing the former 
presidents body to be buried here 
the survey was conducted between sept 30 and oct 4 by vox 
populi a research firm under commission by vice president 
salvador laurel laurel supports the bodys return 
seven of the governments 23 senators have called publicly for 
the return of the body before marcos died 103 of the 199 members 
of the house of representatives signed a petition urging the ailing 
marcos be allowed to come home to die 
this week the supreme court agreed to hear a motion to overturn 
the marcos ban 
there are clear signs mainstream politicians sense the publics 
sympathy for allowing a former president to be buried in the land 
he once ruled 
sen leticia ramosshahani chairwoman of the senate foreign 
affairs committee and sister of defense secretary fidel ramos 
urged mrs aquino to begin talks with the marcos family on 
conditions for the bodys return 
mrs ramosshahani a marcos cousin and aquino supporter 
suggested marcos body be flown to his home province of ilocos 
norte 250 miles north of manila and buried quietly there 
on tuesday the manila city council adopted a resolution asking 
mrs aquino to lift the ban in the interest of total 
reconciliation and national unity 
the moderator of the popular television public affairs show 
viewpoint asked his audience tuesday night to telephone their 
opinions on the issue 
the moderator ricardo puno said 61 percent of the callers 
supported allowing marcos a burial in his homeland he did not say 
how many people called 
president aquino is losing touch with the public pulse 
wrote columnist alvin carpio in the philippine daily globe she 
may not realize it but she is playing right into the hands of the 
opposition which cannot be blamed for exploiting a popular cause 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa claims troops could 
handle any serious threat to stability but mrs aquino has said 
any disorder could discourage vital foreign investment 
financial analysts believe the uncertainty over the burial will 
discourage investors until the issue is resolved 
unless this thing is plugged we can see more cautiousness in 
the market said vincent yanwaria a research analyst at citicorp 
scrimgeour vickers a brokerage firm 
since his death promarcos demonstrations have been small and 
peaceful critics claim mrs aquino has either overreacted or is 
motivated by vindictiveness 
mrs aquinos husband sen benigno aquino jr was imprisoned 
for seven years by marcos until he was allowed to leave for the 
united states he was assassinated at manilas airport on aug 21 
1983 as he stopped off a plane upon returning to challenge marcos

earleen fisher who as ap bureau chief in new 
delhi has reported on tibetan affairs for the past two years last 
interviewed the dalai lama on march 16 the eve of the 30th 
anniversary of his escape from chineseoccupied lhasa at his 
headquarters in dharmsala 
</TEXT>

the dalai lama winner of the 1989 nobel 
peace prize for his nonviolent quest to free tibet from chinese 
rule combines the piety of a simple priest with the pragmatism of 
a politician 
three decades after he fled his palace in the tibetan capital 
lhasa the buddhist spiritual leader has lived in exile in india 
and travels the world to assert the cause of his people 
when news of the nobel award was released in oslo norway the 
dalai lama was in california on one of the us visits he makes at 
least twice yearly to minister to buddhist faithful and stoke 
international awareness of the tibetan struggle 
fearful that chinas heavyhanded rule and the influx of chinese 
settlers to his ancient himalayan homeland could soon obliterate 
tibets language culture and religion he has offered a series of 
concessions to beijing 
fifteen months ago he dropped his demands for full independence 
for tibet publicly proposing for the first time that china 
continue to wield responsibility for military and foreign policy in 
exchange for greater tibetan autonomy 
so far there have been no concessions by china beijing before 
becoming preoccupied with its own prodemocracy uprising said it 
was willing to discuss tibet but would not give up its assertion 
that it is an integral part of china 
tibetans personified by the 54yearold dalai lama trace the 
history of their homeland to the founding of a tibetan kingdom in 
127 bc more than a millennium later a theocratic state emerged 
through a series of dalai lamas 
according to tibetan beliefs the first dalai lama a title 
meaning ocean of mercy was born in 1391 after the earthly 
death of each dalai lama a new godking is revealed through a 
series of dreams and symbols 
the current and 14th dalai lama was born june 7 1935 one 
of seven children of a poor farmer and named tenzin gyatso when 
tenzin was 2 buddhist holy men arrived in his village of tagtser 
carrying beads that had belonged to the 13th dalai lama after the 
little boy discerned the beads under a monks cloak and correctly 
answered a series of questions he was declared the new dalai lama 
he was taken away to study and on nov 17 1950 assumed full 
temporal and spiritual powers less than 10 months later chinese 
troops marched into lhasa on march 10 1959 tibetans attempted to 
revolt and were crushed 
one week later his palace surrounded by chinese troops the 
dalai lama slipped out of lhasa disguised as a chinese soldier with 
a rifle on his shoulder and fled through the snowcovered mountains 
to neighboring india where 100000 tibetans now live in exile 
today attired in the sleeveless maroonandsaffron robes of an 
ordinary buddhist monk he exudes an aura of holiness and 
unflinching belief in the goodness of mankind he continued to 
profess patient optimism that eventually china would negotiate on 
the fate of tibet even when the beijing government responded with 
increasing harshness to tibetan proindependence demonstrations in 
lhasa 
the crackdown on dissent in beijing in early june when chinas 
troops and tanks killed hundreds perhaps thousands of chinese 
during prodemocracy demonstrations in the capital did not 
diminish his optimism 
the crackdown in beijing the dalai lama said july in new york 
was a temporary setback in tibets efforts to cast off 39 years 
of chinese occupation 
eventually things will improve he said the desire for 
democracy and freedom are basic human desires in the human blood 
though he preached peace his followers repeatedly joined bloody 
clashes with chinese authorities in lhasa in the last two years 
martial law remains in the capital and travel by foreign reporters 
to tibet is forbidden 
in addition to using armed police to put down political protest 
in lhasa the chinese employed less overt force by attempting to 
cultivate some senior buddhist clergy 
the panchen lama second only to the dalai lama in the tibetan 
religious hierarchy remained behind in tibet when the dalai lama 
fled long viewed as little more than chinas stooge the panchen 
lama redeemed himself in the eyes of tibetan nationalists only a 
few days before he died in january when he termed chinese rule 
repressive 
in an interview with the associated press in march in dharmsala 
the indian seat of his governmentinexile the dalai lama said 
in the last 30 years they the chinese have used every 
repression we lost everything in the last 30 years but we still 
remain we are the same tibetans the chinese bullied 30 years ago 
in the english he speaks fluently he said i am quite sure 
next five years 10 years more positive things will happen 
while young tibetan exiles sometimes express impatience with the 
governmentinexiles bureaucrats and what they see as the dalai 
lamas political naivete he maintains nonviolence is the only 
path to salvation 
he speaks unfalteringly of his belief that there is good in all 
mankind he touches blesses and bestows filmy white prayer scarves 
on those who wait outsie his bungalow for audiences 
tibetan buddhists worldwide make continual pilgrimages to his 
mountaintop abode at mcleod ganj a ridge of dark gray stone in

louisiana voters get a second chance 
saturday to judge several proposals from gov buddy roemers 
sweeping tax revision package that was overwhelmingly defeated in 
april 
voters also face amendments aimed at increasing the number of 
black judges 
in contrast to last springs oftenacid debate on the tax plan 
regarded by many as a referendum on roemers first year in office 
the campaign for 13 proposed constitutional changes has been low 
key 
roemers favorite proposition calling for a highway trust fund 
is being boosted as an incentive for economic development the 
same theme voiced throughout the tax package campaign 
two other proposals a special fund to stop coastal erosion and 
repeal of the 3 limit on auto license plate fees also are 
leftovers from the fiscal package that failed april 29 attempts to 
repeal the license plate limit have been rejected by voters three 
times in recent years 
unlike aprils referendum voters will be able to judge the 
proposals separately voters have not approved a change in the 
states 1974 constitution since 1987 
secretary of state fox mckeithen predicted tuesday that about 35 
percent of the eligible voters would participate about 47 percent 
turned out for the april vote 
the legislature drew up the proposed constitutional amendments 
to revamp elections for state judges earlier this year following a 
federal court ruling that black voting strength is illegally 
diluted in district and appellate courts 
one proposed amendment would add a supreme court justice and a 
majority black district in the new orleans area while another 
would create up to 35 blackmajority districts for district and 
appellate courts 
federal courts could draw up new plans if the amendments are 
rejected by voters 
roemer who was at the forefront of the fight for the tax 
package has remained largely on the sidelines speaking mostly in 
favor of the transportation trust fund 
the proposed amendment would set aside the current 16cent motor 
fuel tax for public works projects including road building 
that would bar the legislature from raiding funds earmarked for 
highway construction a common occurrence during the 1980s as state 
revenue dropped following the collapse of oil prices federal 
highway officials pulled 350 million of the states highway 
funding earlier this year because of poor road maintenance but 
restored the money after the legislature approved the proposed 
amendment 
the amendment also would impose an additional 4cent motor fuel 
tax levy to fund a 14 billion transportation improvement program 
the program involves expansion of major highways to four lanes and 
expansion of ports and the new orleans international airport 
roemer said the plan would create thousands of construction jobs 
immediately boost efforts to attract new industry to the state and 
erase the states potholemarred roads 
the coastal trust fund would receive at least 5 million 
annually for antierosion projects in louisianas environmentally 
sensitive marshlands erosion is blamed for the loss of 50 square 
miles of marshes annually 
a coastal trust fund was established by the legislature earlier 
this year the proposed amendment would bar lawmakers from using 
the funds for other purposes 
unless you live along the coast you dont realize that were 
losing 50 square miles of our valuable marsh each year said 
state sen ben bagert the legislative sponsor of the proposal 
twenty percent of this state will be gone in 50 years unless we 
do something

the government will free 
jailed black leader walter sisulu but is irritated by western 
pressure to negotiate with his african national congress guerrilla 
movement according to news reports thursday 
foreign minister pik botha as well as several progovernment 
newspapers criticized comments this week by us state department 
official herman cohen who said he expects the whitecontrolled 
government to legalize outlawed groups and begin talks with them 
within nine months 
the state broadcasting company belittled a french plan to invite 
south african officials and leaders of the african national 
congress to a conference in paris 
sisulu 77 the outlawed groups general secretary was 
sentenced in 1964 along with nelson mandela and other anc leaders 
to life in prison for plotting antigovernment sabotage 
the citizen a johannesburg daily quoted an unidentified 
government source as saying the cabinet had decided to free sisulu 
but said the source refused to give a date the newspaper said 
black activist oscar mpetha 80yearold leader of the united 
democratic front also was likely to be released 
mandela considered by many blacks as their paramount leader is 
unlikely to be freed this year the citizen said 
the daily mail newspaper in london quoted diplomatic sources 
wednesday as saying sisulu and mpetha would be freed before british 
prime minister margaret thatcher goes to malaysia for the annual 
commonwealth summit conference on oct 18 mrs thatcher has been 
criticized by other commonwealth leaders for her refusal to impose 
tough sanctions on south africa 
despite the possibility of prisoner releases the government has 
given no sign of softening its attitude toward negotiations with 
the african national congress 
president fw de klerk since his inauguration last month has 
reiterated that such talks cannot take place until the group 
renounces the use of violence as a means to end apartheid south 
africas system of segregation that denies blacks a vote in 
national affairs 
botha in a statement thursday criticized remarks made in 
washington by cohen assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs cohen told the senate foreign relations committee he 
expected south african officials to act by next june to legalize 
organizations repeal remaining segregation laws and open 
negotiations with credible black leaders 
south africans should retain the right not only to create our 
own constitutional future but to do so without threats or time 
limits imposed from outside botha said i trust that mr cohen 
will also urge the perpetrators of violence to end their violent 
campaign in a determined time frame 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp criticized the 
plan for the paris conference planned for november by french first 
lady danielle mitterand to discuss south africas political future 
it said such a conference would amount to no more than an attempt 
to boost the african national congress image 
also thursday the chamber of mines marked its centennial by 
issuing a report that depicted itself as a progressive force 
working to eliminate discrimination in the mining industry 
we have the opportunity in the mining industry to break down 
racial barriers and build bridges said the chambers 
president kenneth maxwell 
but the national union of mineworkers which represents black 
miners said the centennial marks 100 years of toil and poverty 
the chamber serves as mouthpiece research institute and 
bargaining agent for six giant corporations that control 90 percent 
of south africas mining operations and generate more than 20 
percent of the countrys total wealth

floridas supreme court today struck 
down a law requiring girls to get parental consent before an 
abortion ruling it violates the right to privacy 
the decision comes less than a week before the legislature is to 
convene in special session at gov bob martinezs request to 
restrict access to abortion 
we can conceive of few more personal or private decisions 
concerning ones body that one can make in the course of a 
lifetime the court wrote 
the challenged statute fails because it intrudes upon the 
privacy of the pregnant minor from conception to birth 
the court said the state constitutions guarantee of privacy 
outweighed the 1988 law requiring consent of a parent guardian or 
judge for a girl under 18 to get an abortion 
the decision comes in the case of 15yearold lake county girl 
initially denied permission for an abortion by a judge a state 
appeals court later found the law unconstitutional and the us 
supreme court refused to hear the case 
court records showed the teenager legally ended her pregnancy 
while the appeal was pending she was identified in court records 
as a high school student was worried that news of an abortion would 
kill her ailing mother 
the state high court said of the law such a substantial 
invasion of a pregnant females privacy by the state for the full 
term of the pregnancy is not necessary for the preservation of 
maternal health or the potentiality of life 
the florida constitution is one of the few in the country that 
expressly and in strong terms guarantee a right to privacy the 
court said 
ken connor president of florida right to life called the 
decision a big defeat for the unborn child 
jerri a blair the girls attorney hailed the ruling calling 
it a direct and very explicit endorsement of the right to 
privacy it provides extra insulation to right of choice in 
florida 
four of the seven justices joined in the majority opinion two 
wrote concurring opinions and justice parker mcdonald wrote that 
the decision goes against common law provisions that say minors do 
not have the right to enter into contracts 
in july the us supreme court gave states more latitude to 
regulate abortions 
the governor called a special session for oct 1013 to consider 
more stringent abortion laws including mandatory testing of 
fetuses at 20 weeks to determine if the fetus could live outside 
the body and a ban on use of public funds personnel or facilities 
for abortions

a quarter century after they entertained john 
f kennedy the storied scottish black watch band returned to the 
white house on thursday and performed for a delighted president 
bush 
after listening to the skirl of the bagpipes and other music 
both haunting and martial bush inspected the troops of the massed 
bands of the black watch and the argyll amp sutherland highlanders 
garbed in kilts and wearing their trademark headwear towering 
black feather bonnets with a single crimson plume 
he shook hands and offered his thanks to several of the company 
then received a gift bonnet himself 
bush withstood the temptation of putting it on but with the 
help of his wife barbara recruited two 5yearold girls from a 
crowd of sightseers to model the bonnets 
the first child michelle beshudi shied at donning the massive 
bonnet but laurin woloshin a classmate at the montesorri school 
of mclean va happily let bush put it on her slightly askew it 
toppled and the girl was dispatched back to her class on the 
sidelines 
nineteen bagpipers and nine dummers as well as eight highland 
dancers were in the company of 90 that performed for bush 
the black watch recently embarked on a threemonth tour of the 
united states it performed at the white house in november 1963 a 
few weeks before kennedy was assassinated 
a few weeks later the kennedy family called the bagpipers of 
the black watch back to play at the funeral of the 35th president

a newsroom receptionist fired for her 
antiabortion activities including picketing says her rights have 
been infringed but the newspaper says her actions violated its 
longstanding ethics policy 
the milwaukee journals dismissal of diane dew has prompted the 
filing of a grievance by the newspaper employees union an 
investigation by a state agency and complaints by a religious 
freedom organization 
but deputy managing editor howard fibich said the journal stands 
by its decision to fire ms dew even though the new york times and 
washington post did not discipline employees in similar 
circumstances 
she was part of the news process fibich said she did not 
report the news but she handled the news she took dictation from 
reporters and that type of thing 
the newspapers ethics code established in 1973 prohibits 
newsroom employees from participating in many outside political 
activities and also from accepting gifts from outside sources the 
newspaper said 
the reason that it code is there is to make sure that we are 
able to maintain an image of objectivity fibich said in my 
judgment our credibility is a precious asset and nothing must 
compromise that 
attorney craig parshall who represents ms dew said his client 
was fired as a parttime receptionistsecretary in july after she 
refused to sign a statement promising to end her antiabortion 
activities 
parshall said ms dews activities were brought to the 
newspapers attention after a reporter saw her participating in an 
antiabortion protest 
ms dew said she feels compelled to protest abortion and that 
the newspapers restrictions violate her right to free speech and 
religion 
i cant just choose not to believe what i believe she said 
im responsible to speak out because i feel that abortion is 
murder and murder is wrong 
bob dye communications manager for journalsentinel inc the 
newspapers parent company said ms dew was warned that her 
actions violated the ethics code and was offered another job 
outside the newsroom with no loss in pay but turned it down 
the rutherford institute a milwaukeearea group that 
specializes in cases of religious liberty filed a religious 
discrimination complaint on ms dews behalf 
the state equal rights division is investigating to determine if 
ms dew was a victim of discrimination said john kimble program 
supervisor of investigation in the agency milwaukee office if the 
division finds there is probable cause to rule discrimination 
occurred the case will go to a hearing he said 
the milwaukee chapter of the newspaper guild a labor union 
filed a grievance with the journal challenging the dismissal 
we argued that her activities were protected by our contract 
and that the company violated the contract by trying to force upon 
her a different set of working conditions local president mike 
kuchta said 
fibich said ms dews position on abortion played no role in her 
dismissal if she was a prochoice activist the newspaper would 
have taken the same action he said 
he cited an abortion rights march in washington last spring in 
which reporters from the new york times and washington post 
participated 
i thought that was unacceptable he said if it had 
happened here the people involved would have been somehow 
reprimanded 
times editors disagreed with supreme court correspondent linda 
greenhouses decision to participate in the march but they took no 
punitive action assistant managing editor warren hoge said 
richard harwood ombudsman at the post said no disciplinary 
action was taken against the few reporters who were involved in the 
abortion rights march 
people were reminded that this was inappropriate and that you 
are not to take part in political activities if you work for the 
washington post he said 
harwood said the posts ethics code does not mention newsroom 
secretaries and he could not say for certain if they are bound by 
the code

the attorney general dropped contempt proceedings 
thursday against a bookstore owner who defied a government ban and 
refused to stop selling spycatcher the memoirs of a former 
british spy 
at a twominute private hearing at the high court action was 
formally dropped against peter marsh who owns bilbos bookshop in 
bath the attorney general will pay marshs 2760 legal costs 
the attorney generals office said the public interest no longer 
required the case against marsh to be pursued 
last year prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
government lost a threeyear court battle to ban the book by peter 
wright who worked for britains mi5 intelligence service from 1955 
to 1976 
the government banned the book because it said wright had 
violated an mi5 agreement to never reveal his activities in the 
agency 
marsh said he felt he had taken a stand for freedom he sold 
copies of spycatcher printed in the united states and ireland 
risking an unlimited fine and a twoyear jail term for contempt of 
court 
i am happy they have got egg on their faces he said they 
have not dropped the action out of any spirit of clemency but 
because the consequences if they had tried to proceed would have 
been disastrous even if they had sent me to prison they would 
still have lost

new yorks public service commission 
rerouted a proposed natural gas pipeline around property owned by 
dr joyce brothers 
the 407 million 399mile pipeline which would bring canadian 
gas to new york new jersey and connecticut was approved wednesday 
by the psc the project is now under review by the federal energy 
regulatory commission 
the previous pipeline route would have gone straight through 
land owned by the psychologist and advice columnist in dover north 
of new york city 
neighbors accused the panel of celebrity siting for avoiding 
the her land 
calls to brothers office today went unanswered 
last month the regulatory board voted on all of the pipeline 
route except for segments that would run through property owned by 
brothers and by a firm whose owners include robert dyson brother 
of john dyson a former top state official and unsuccessful 
candidate for the 1986 democratic us senate nomination 
psc commissioners harold jerry and henry williams recommended 
the pipeline route skirt brothers land and go through dysons 
property 
they said the new route was preferable because it follows a road 
a pipeline opponent dr anne marie mueser said brothers had 
told the psc that the underground pipeline shouldnt go through her 
land because of its archeological and environmental features 
mueser said brothers had failed to provide any new information 
to the psc

east germanys attempt to staunch the 
hemorrhage of its fleeing citizenry is bound to create bitterness 
frustration and anger in those left behind in a country even less 
able to compete with the allure of the west american experts say 
this is an economic disaster for them says political 
scientist melvin croan assessing the impact of the 
votewiththeirfeet exodus of tens of thousands of east germans on 
the leaders of that country the economic star of the communist 
world it is a disaster when you have electricians and plumbers 
and nurses leaving in a zero population growth society 
the departures heighten the delimma facing east germanys 
leaders if they try to liberalize their country becomes a pale 
imitation of west germany with no real reason to exist if they 
crack down they fan the urge to flee 
they say if we downgrade marxismleninism why dont we just 
become a state of the federal republic says economist phillip 
bryson of brigham young university an expert on the east german 
economy so if they pursue a policy of democrization and 
openness where does it leave them 
on the other hand a hardline approach will not only increase 
the temptation of east germans to find a way out but provoke 
mikhail gorbachev who wants better relations with west germany 
gorbachev visits east germany this weekend to help celebrate the 
40th anniversary of the establishment of the german democratic 
republic 
how they use that visit will be an indicator says stephen 
burant associate editor of problems of communism a magazine 
published by the us information agency 
if they allow street demonstrations in support of gorbachev 
and glasnost that may be a signal that there will be some 
political changes in east germany he says by contrast if 
they keep gorbachev away from the people that would be a signal 
that the hardline would be maintained 
the experts agreed that life will be harder for those left 
behind now that as many as 100000 have left a country with an 
aging population a low birth rate and a labor shortage according 
to a secret west german study leaked to the press this summer 15 
million east germans nearly one in 10 had applied for exit 
visas before this falls dramatic events 
i would bet that hundreds of thousands of the best minds left 
in east germany now and for the foreseeable future are going to be 
doing nothing but concentrating on schemes to escape says joshua 
muravchek a writer on human rights issues at the american 
enterprise institute a washington research house 
the east germans until now have been very aware of not having 
the same things west germans had both materially and spiritually 
and thats grated on them he says now they see both the poles 
and hungarians getting what they dont have political freedom 
peggy knutson a program associate for the german marshall fund 
of the united states who spent two years teaching english in east 
germany says the departures create bitterness among those left 
behind 
if youre a doctor youve got to take over for the doctor who 
just left if youre a teacher you suddenly face twice the load i 
dont know if those who are left are angry with those who leave 
but they are the ones who must deal with the consequences 
adds jeffrey gedmin a researcher at the american enterprise 
institute there must be a feeling of bitterness and 
resentfulness toward those who have left and also toward a 
government which seems paralyzed that hints that the result 
probably will be greater disturbances or rumblings for change 
burant sees little likelihood of political upheaval if only 
because the organized political opposition is still very small and 
the regime has kept very close tabs on it what theyve done is to 
deport the dissidents to west germany 
but croan chairman of the soviet and east european studies 
program at the university of wisconsin says the departures have 
emboldened those left behind to speak out and call for reforms 
you had a mass protest this week in leipzig amazing this is 
not poland this is east germany the east germans had been scared 
but the feeling now is that the cops are not going to break their 
skulls with the eyes and ears of the world on them and gorbachev 
about to visit

scandals at the department of housing and 
urban development are not unique and reflect a wide failure of 
government agencies to fix management problems budget director 
richard darman told congress thursday 
there are analogous problems in other agencies said darman 
director of the white houses office of management and budget 
darman said his agency shares in the blame with executive branch 
departments for not following up on systemic management problems or 
weaknesses reported by the inspector generals within each 
department or the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm 
he declined to name departments or agencies with unreported 
management problems on the scale of the scandals at hud where the 
cost of mismanagement influence peddling fraud and other problems 
has been estimated at 7 billion 
i dont think we should be advertising the highrisk areas 
he told reporters after making his comments to the senate 
governmental affairs committee to do so he said would amount to 
an open invitation to abuse 
darman told the panel he has established new management systems 
that establish responsibility for following up on problems found in 
audits of agencies 
im afraid that what used to happen is an awful lot of 
inspector generals reports would not be taken seriously enough 
within their own departments by the political leadership within 
their own departments darman said 
elements of the problems at hud were the subject of audit 
reports and warnings by the departments inspector general going 
back several years no adequate action was taken darman said 
the recently exposed hud problems are not unique not merely 
peculiar to a particular agency under what some have described as 
absentee management darman said nor are they peculiar as 
some have suggested to the socalled greed decade the 80s 
the history of such problems is at least as old as the american 
government iteslf 
darmans remarks to the committee followed a series of hearings 
in which it has brought attention to management problems reported 
by the independent audits 
sen john glenn dohio the chairman said there were 
shocking management problems involving department of energy 
contractors nasa spending the labor department the environmental 
protection agency the food and drug administration and other 
agencies 
darman also cited a washington cultural problem is 
discussing the federal governments management problems 
i call it the hollywood east syndrome there are too many 
people in positions of political responsiblity who are infatuated 
by the lure of glitter and lights or the often illusory chance to 
make policy he said at the expense of more pedestrian work 
of nutsandbolts management

dick gregory the comedian who 
became an activist and then an entrepreneur in the weightloss 
business blames his generosity for the 15 million in losses 
sustained by his diet center 
gregory said wednesday that the beachfront dick gregory diet amp 
health resort near this florida panhandle city would close thursday 
and reopen in cottonwood ala 
i think the biggest problem with this operation was probably 
me as far as finances were concerned gregory said 
he said that by friday he would pay 40000 in debts which he 
blamed on his unwillingness to turn away severely obese people who 
could not afford his 1000aweek weightreduction program 
gregory denied that criticism by former clients and health 
experts played any part in his decision to move to the former sealy 
springs spa in alabama 
exclients complained the center failed to deliver on promises 
of luxurious accommodations professional services and special 
rates while some clients have succeeded in huge weight losses 
medical and nutritional experts have contended gregorys program is 
unsafe and ineffective 
gregory said the new site 80 miles to the northeast near the 
alabamaflorida state line offered a more easily controlled 
environment theres no nearby grocery and they wont be able to 
call me at home in the middle of the night and have me overrule the 
director he said

armand hammer the 91yearold chairman 
of occidental petroleum co has sued to stop publication of a 
biography in europe and threatened to do likewise in the united 
states 
armand hammer the untold story was written by university of 
missouri journalism professor steve weinberg who says he 
interviewed nearly 700 people but got no cooperation from hammer in 
his research 
weinberg says the book published by little brown is already on 
bookstore shelves and that efforts to halt publication now may 
actually stir interest in the biography 
letters from hammers lawyers obtained by the wall street 
journal termed the book beyond redemption by correction and 
said it was riddled with falsehoods 
the industrialist a frequent intermediary between the soviet 
union and the west generally has been portrayed in the media as an 
influential adviser to presidents and a humanitarian 
weinberg says he uncovered new information questioning hammers 
clout in washington and detailing a questionable bankruptcy filing 
by hammers father weinberg said his book should not destroy the 
mans reputation i think it is a very balanced account of his

striking machinists expressed determination to 
hold out for a richer offer from the boeing co while the worlds 
no 1 builder of passenger jets today worked to keep assembly lines 
running 
we are setting about the business at hand to start working 
on those aircraft that are far enough down the line that our 
supervisory people can complete them so those airplanes can be 
delivered company spokesman paul binder said 
the machinists union boeings largest representing 57800 
workers around the country struck early wednesday after members 
overwhelmingly rejected a threeyear offer that included their 
first wage increase in six years 
the strike hits boeing in its fifth consecutive year of record 
jetliner orders so far this year boeing has had orders for 736 
commercial jets worth 385 billion boosting its order backlog to 
80 billion 
the orders have pressured the company to maintain delivery 
schedules and the heavy overtime required of workers has become a 
major issue in the strike 
when my kids found out about the strike they said oh boy 
we get to see daddy said bob junka who was on a picket line at 
a plant in renton south of seattle 
no talks were scheduled boeing spokesman harold carr said this 
morning the companys operations are continuing he said but 
one obviously needs to recognize that were operating without 
43000 people who are normally here 
federal mediator douglas hammond said he was trying to get both 
sides to resume talks soon because of the large number of workers 
and the potential for economic havoc with a long strike boeing is 
the states largest private employer and the nations leading 
exporter 
boeing took out fullpage advertisements in seattlearea 
newspapers to outline its contract offer describing it as 
substantial providing for continued growth in compensation and 
benefits 
members of other boeing unions reported to work as usual 
wednesday but some unionized workers for a subcontractor stayed 
away from a plant in the seattle area after unexpectedly finding 
pickets at the gate 
in wichita kan where 12000 machinists are on strike boeing 
secured a judges order to limit the number of pickets at plant 
gates and prohibit pickets from speaking in an abusive or 
intimidating manner to people trying to report for work 
the order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headed 
toward the plant and attempted to persuade the occupants to honor 
strike lines traffic delays of three hours or more were reported 
no problems were reported this morning 
two motorists were detained for questioning by sedgwick county 
sheriffs deputies after allegedly bumping people with their cars 
no one was seriously injured 
in the washington tom baker machinists district president 
went from plant to plant in the puget sound area and talked with 
pickets 
everybodys spirits are high the union leader said i 
just tell them to keep dug in 
thats what we like to see hes right out here with us 
striker blake lalonde said of baker 
lalonde 23 and his fellow pickets cheered with each honk of 
support from passing motorists 
boeing offered a salary hike totaling 10 percent over three 
years plus bonus pay but machinists said they want more money and 
were upset at having to work mandatory overtime the proposal would 
have cut mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 200 hours 
most people we talked to were basically insulted by the 
contract said picket bryce bushby who spoke outside boeings 
south seattle headquarters boeing machinists havent gotten a 
raise in six years but received yearly bonuses 
pickets marched in 45degree weather outside the plant waving 
signs as motorists and truck drivers honked horns 
in addition to those in the seattle and wichita areas 1700 
machinists in portland ore and smaller numbers in a halfdozen 
other locations are on strike 
worldwide boeing employs 164000 people including 106000 in 
western washington 
binder said he didnt know how many airplanes were far enough 
along that they could be completed by supervisory personnel 
before boeing can deliver any airplanes completed during the 
strike the federal aviation administration will require the 
company to demonstrate its compliance with an faaapproved quality 
control program kirotv reported 
the faa said it would increase onsite production surveillance 
at boeing plants during the strike

usfunded radio free europe long

allowed to open a bureau in poland a government official said 
thursday 
a delegation of the munichbased radio station discussed the 
possibility of opening a bureau wednesday with jacek ambroziak 
director of the office of the council of ministers and chief 
assistant to prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
they did not apply officially as far as i know but i think 
that if they apply for it the answer will be positive ambroziak 
said in a telephone interview 
the polish government preliminarily agreed on the application 
for our accreditation we anticipate that in a few weeks we will be 
able to open our second bureau in eastern europe a ross 
johnson director of radio free europe and radio liberty said in 
the prosolidarity paper gazeta wyborcza 
radio free europe and radio liberty opened their first east bloc 
bureau in budapest hungary on sept 27 
radio free europe broadcasts in local languages to bulgaria 
czechoslovakia hungary poland and romania radio liberty 
broadcasts in 12 languages to the soviet union they have an 
audience of about 55 million 
jamming of the broadcasts has ended in most eastern european 
countries in recent years under the influence of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
throughout most of the 1980s the polish government attacked 
radio free europe as biased propaganda designed to undermine the 
state 
but official attitudes reversed after solidaritys landslide 
election victory in june and the creation of the new noncommunist

the bush administration on thursday signaled 
its intention to push for a permanent capitalgains tax cut in the 
senate as early as this weekend 
richard g darman director of the white house office of 
management and budget said the administrationsupported 
capitalgains cut approved by the house last week is flawed because 
its full impact would be in effect for only 27 months 
nevertheless darman said under questioning by the senate 
governmental affairs committee the house plan is better than 
none at all because we could extend it that is what the 
administration hopes to do in the senate he added 
sen bob packwood of oregon senior republican on the 
taxwriting finance committee said he is trying to put together a 
capitalgains cut that can get the support of democrats and 
republicans 
i believe there is a significant number of senators both 
democrats and republicans who are interested in supporting some 
type of capitalgains proposal packwood said in a statement 
the finance committee earlier this week defeated on a 1010 vote 
a packwood proposal that would have cut capitalgains taxes for 
individuals and corporations 
thus the deficitreduction bill written by the committee 
contains no capitalgains cut but a substitute favored by most 
democrats that would attempt to encourage increased saving by 
liberalizing taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
the senate will begin debate on the bill as early as friday 
under the law that governs consideration of such 
deficitreduction bills some congressional aides say it will 
require 60 votes not just a majority of the senators voting to 
add a capitalgains cut to the bill on the senate floor 
republicans are challenging that interpretation 
bush won the votes of all but one republican and of one of every 
four democrats when the house approved a cpaitalgains reduction 
last week but that was not a straight yesorno vote on capital 
gains because the alternative was to vote for a tax increase on 
highincome americans to finance liberalized iras 
senate democratic leaders are pushing the same ira provision but 
are steering clear of anything that could be interpreted as a tax 
increase 
the packwood proposal that failed in the finance committee and 
which is likely to be the basis of any plan presented to the 
senate would provide a lower tax on stocks land and other 
investments that are held for longer periods of time by individuals 
for example if an investment is sold after being owned only a 
year and a day 95 percent of the profit from the sale would be 
taxed but if the investment were held for six years only 70 
percent would be taxed 
present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates applying 
to wages and other income 
democratic leaders are fighting a capitalgains cut on grounds 
that 80 percent of the tax saving would go to people with annual 
incomes over 100000 they say allowing more workers to have 
taxdeductible iras would be more effective in encouraging saving 
present law authorizes fully deductible iras only for workers 
who are not covered by a company pension to covered single people 
with incomes under 25000 and covered couples under 40000 
the democratic proposal would allow any worker regardless of 
income or company pension to deduct half of an annual contribution 
of up to 2000 half of a contribution would be taxed at the 
current rate and the other half along with interest earned by the 
account would escape tax until withdrawn for retirement to buy a 
first home or pay for a college education

the man convicted of killing prime minister 
olof palme knew what he was doing and does not need a psychiatric 
examination the prosecutor told an appeals court thursday 
prosecutor anders helin asked the svea court of appeals in his 
summation to uphold the life sentence for christer pettersson and 
to stiffen a second charge from endangerment to attempted murder in 
the wounding of palmes wife lisbeth 
pettersson clearly irritated after helins arguments pushed 
his way out of the courtroom and said why do you think im 
denying this do you think im afraid of jail 
the nearly three weeks of appeals hearings are nearing an end 
and the defense is to sum up its case monday 
palme was shot in the back at close range feb 28 1986 as he 
walked home from a movie with his wife 
pettersson who has a history of violent crime was convicted by 
a lower court in july 
helin said there was no need for a psychiatric examination since 
pettersson 42 had undergone several such tests in recent years 
those tests failed to prove he was not responsible for his 
behavior helin said 
if found to be insane a convict could have his prison sentence 
commuted to psychiatric care for an unspecified period

president bush on thursday praised the valor 
of east germans fleeing their homeland and said he looked forward 
to a time when they will not have to climb fences to enjoy 
the fruits of a free society 
we are riveted and i am moved by the tens of thousands of east 
germans sacrificing all that they own leaving everything behind to 
find their way to a west that offers the promise of freedom and 
opportunity bush said at a rose garden ceremony where he signed 
a germanamerican day proclamation 
he made the comments shortly after trainloads of east german 
refugees arrived thursday in west germany from prague 
czechoslovakia where they had sought refuge in embassies before 
following other east germans who were allowed to emigrate during 
the weekend 
many of the refugees had resisted czech police to climb over the 
fences of western embassies 
i read today of thousands of people people who had waited for 
10 years to buy a car and just left them on the street handing 
the keys to whoever wanted them taking with them only the 
possessions they could carry and climbed over an embassy fence to 
wait for a freedom train bush said 
as we celebrate germanamerican day i want to praise the 
actions of the federal republic in rising to the challenges 
presented by these events i also look forward to the day that 
germans will not have to climb fences freeze in embassy courtyards 
or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a free society 
a handful of legislators from the west german parliament were on 
hand for the ceremony 
rita sussmuth the president of the parliament or bundestag 
said the day was a manifestation for free partners in a free 
world 
she was asked later by reporters if she expected to see a 
crackdown on reformers in her country 
we do have some great fear that the reform movement is going 
to be repressed she said adding that the upcoming visit of 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev could give impetus to more 
reforms in her country 
we hope that the visit of gorbachev will be supportive of the 
reforms in the german democratic republic and we hope that 
gorbachev is going to explain to the leadership in the german 
democratic republic that reforms are unavoidable she said

a 10fold increase in the agriculture 
departments 50 million competitive research grant program was 
recommended thursday in a report by the national research council 
a 500 million boost in usda research spending is needed to 
revitalize and reinvigorate one of the leading industries the 
agricultural food and environmental system in its broadest 
sense the report said 
the united states also faces new and aggressive competition 
from abroad in trade which the report said has weakened the 
strong role that agricultural exports play in the us balance of 
payments 
dietary risks from eating too much saturated fat pesticide 
residues in fruits and vegetables contamination by food poisoning 
organisms and pollution of air and water were cited as other major 
problems 
solving the problems of competitiveness a highquality food 
supply and natural resources and the environment will require much 
more new knowledge than was required to solve previous problems 
the report said 
the necessary new knowledge is unlikely to be acquired and 
expediently applied without substantial new funding it said 
the nrc report was specific recommending that research 
support for agriculture food and the environment should be 
increased by 500 million annually and that the entire increase 
should support competitive grants administered by the 
department 
funds should come from new monies not from the redirection or 
reallocation of existing research and education programs the 
report said 
assistant secretary charles e hess who oversees usda science 
and education programs said he agreed with the reports basic call 
for stepped up effort in agricultural research however hess 
declined to endorse a specific funding level 
i would very much like to be able to endorse the funding 
program proposed in the initiative hess told reporters but 
as you realize we operate within the constraints of the federal 
budget 
hess said the usda however will be considering how and to 
what extent the proposal can be addressed in preparing future 
spending blueprints submitted for white house approval 
the office of management and budget is aware of the proposal 
but at this point we are only talking with omb about our research 
budget for fiscal year 1991 which will begin a year from now he 
said 
hess was asked if the departments 1991 budget would include 
500 million for research 
again i cant make that prediction hess responded as i 
speak for my own preferences i would of course be very pleased 
to see that size of an investment because of the challenges 
facing us agriculture 
six program areas were identified for the expanded research 
effort plant systems animal systems nutrition food quality and 
health natural resources and the environment engineering 
products and processes and markets trade and policy 
further the report said the grants should average at least 
100000 annually and should be for at least three years and as 
many as five 
currently usda competitive research grants average 50000 and 
are for two years 
in contrast the report said the average grants by the national 
science foundation are 71300 annually and those by the national 
institutes of health are 154900 a year both are for three years 
or more 
the report acknowledged the fiscal realities of federal 
budget deficits and that some potential tradeoffs might have to be 
considered including raising the 500 million by canceling some 
other usda research 
other possible tradeoffs could be savings from reduced 
spending for commodity price supports or shifting money from other 
parts of the federal budget 
but the report stood fast against canceling or draining other 
usda research programs contending that the departments research 
budget which is about 12 billion has not increased for 25 years 
because actual monetary increases have barely kept up with 
inflation

the swift response of forces loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega during tuesdays attempted coup in panama 
caught the rebels and american military forces by surprise us 
officials said today they said the us commands lack of 
flexibility was a major factor in the failure of the overthrow 
meanwhile on capitol hill sen jesse helms rnc told the 
senate he had just received information that the officer identified 
as the leader of the coup maj moises giroldi had been executed 
and that noriega personally shot the rebel leader 
helms said he based his account on information collected by his 
staff from unspecified sources 
an administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the government believes giroldi is dead but does not have 
confirmation 
helms also alleged that while the rebels had noriega in custody 
they asked us authorities to take custody of him and remove him 
to the united states 
defense secretary dick cheney denounced helms claim as 
hogwash 
according to us officials who declined to be identified 
forces loyal to noriega surprised the rebels and the us military 
by flying in a company of troops to an air strip near the military 
headquarters which the insurgents had seized tuesday morning 
shortly after the pronoriega forces moved in on the 
headquarters a key battalion that had not declared itself threw 
its support to the panamanian leader the us officials said 
according to the officials the us southern command could have 
prevented the takeoff of the aircraft carrying the pronoriega 
forces by filling the sky over the airbase with american aircraft 
but the command did not have the discretionary authority to take 
that action and did not get the required approval from washington 
the officials said 
during an appearance on capitol hill cheney was asked about 
helms claim that us officials turned down an offer to take 
custody of noriega 
any charge that we were somehow offered noriega and didnt 
take him is hogwash the secretary replied 
cheney said in an interview with cbs earlier today that rebels 
had refused in a facetoface contact with a us military 
officer to turn over noriega during the coup attempt 
the administration has insisted the rebels were not interested 
in turning noriega over to the united states but wanted him simply 
to retire and remain in panama 
cheney said that at one point during the uprising shortly 
before the coup collapsed contact between one of our military 
officers and two junior officers that were involved in the coup 
occurred at fort clayton a us facility in panama 
asked about the meeting cheney said it was a facetoface 
contact and that was where they made it clear to us that they 
would not turn noriega over to us he did not name the 
individuals involved 
president bush has come under sharp criticism from some 
republicans as well as democrats in congress for not intervening on 
the side of the coup leaders the critics claim he missed a 
precious opportunity to oust noriega who faces drug charges in 
this country 
they wanted certainty rep ike skelton dmo said of the 
administration you do not get an engraved invitation to a coup 
they just lacked boldness 
but cheney a former house member brushed aside congressional 
criticism as monday morning advice 
the same people whod be criticizing us if we had intervened 
are now criticizing us for not intervening he said 
cheneys comments were part of a campaign by the administration 
to defend bushs actions on tuesday the defense secretary was on 
two morning talk shows after granting an interview to cbs for 
broadcast on wednesday night and talking with reporters on capitol 
hill on wednesday 
this is an issue where its open to disagreement but i think 
on the whole we found the support to be very strong and very broad 
actually white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today to 
have a handful of congressmen suggest it was the wrong course is a 
pretty minor response 
at the same time the administration was moving to underscore 
its continued opposition to noriega 
vice president dan quayle met today with guillermo ford an 
opposition vice presidential candidate in last mays panamanian 
election 
ford did not answer directly when asked if the united states 
should have intervened in behalf of the insurgents instead he 
called on the panamanian military to try again 
we were surprised by the coup attempt but we feel that the 
defense forces should put their act together and get rid of mr 
noriega ford said 
speaking on cbs this morning cheney also said the united 
states has given sanctuary to the family of one of the coup leaders 
a communique issued in panama by noriegas government said five 
coup leaders had taken refuge at a us army base near panama city 
but the administration has not confirmed that account 
alluding to a charge made against bush during the 1988 
presidential campaign rep dave mccurdy dokla added theres 
a resurgence of the wimp factor 
a large crosssection of lawmakers both democrats and 
republicans voiced bitter disappointment at the us failure to 
send in military force to support tuesdays shortlived uprising 
against noriega by 200 to 300 dissident panamanian defense forces 
troops 
not all lawmakers were critical however 
im convinced we did the right thing said rep earl hutto 
dfla a member of the house armed services committee it would 
have been foolish for us to take military action with loss of 
lives in the face of an obvious lack of intelligence 
in public statements and briefings on capitol hill bush men 
portrayed their caution as the only responsible approach to a 
situation fraught with confusion and conflicting information 
the president made the right decision said cheney 
cheney said the initial report that the coup was to be led by 
giroldi a close noriega confidant raised doubts this might 
well have been a setup he said

a former nursing home employee was charged 
with attempted murder for allegedly tying a knot in the oxygen tube 
of an 81yearold woman who died four days later authorities said 
a ninecount indictment returned against olian small 36 of 
nobleboro also alleges he endangered the lives of that woman and 
four others at amenity manor by failing to give them medication and 
then writing in medical records that he had done so assistant 
attorney general joe wannemacher said thursday 
small was arrested wednesday evening 
wannemacher said the death in april of helen ada potter was not 
attributed to the actions of small ms potter was one of the five 
women who allegedly were not given medication by small wannemacher 
said 
by failing to give the medication that doesnt prove that he 
did that deliberately to try to kill these women wannemacher 
said on the other hand tying a knot you can kind of come to 
that conclusion without straining too hard 
amenity manor administrator mitch rousseau did not immediately 
return a phone call thursday the nursing home was not charged 
wannemacher said the indictment against small contains one count 
of attempted murder two counts of aggravated assault and six 
counts of endangering the welfare of patients 
he said experts might argue over the seriousness of the 
consequences of tying the oxygen tube so there were several 
charges made 
youre not cutting off the air but youre cutting off the 
supplemental oxygen supply which is not like suffocating 
somebody wannemacher said 
the woman went without oxygen for about 30 minutes wannemacher 
said he was unsure what caused her death

they shivered under blankets their 
faces streaked with tears they waited in lines for food for 
telephones for the chance to pick through secondhand clothing 
they were tired and dirty men and women clung to small bags 
that held their only belongings crying children clutched stuffed 
toys 
but for the thousands of east germans who flooded into this 
border town thursday the chaotic and crowded surroundings of a hof 
train station brought only joy pure and unbridled 
their grueling sometimes harrowing trip to freedom was a 
memory this was paradise 
we left the car in prague but who cares said guido 
albrecht 26 who fled with his wife kerstin 28 the main thing 
is that were here 
trains carrying 7600 east germans arrived here bringing the 
second wave of a historic refugee exodus they had fled their 
homeland into czechoslovakia seeking asylum at the west german 
embassy in the capital there 
east germany grudingly agreed to let them go but first they had 
to travel by trains back through their homeland so they could be 
officially expelled 
now they would begin to fashion new lives in west germany 
where they were granted automatic citizenship and welcomed 
regina pfeiffer 23 held the hand of her 4yearold son 
michael 
we decided at the last moment to go to prague we left on 
tuesday morning and got through just before they imposed the travel 
restriction to czechoslovakia the former erfurt resident said 
i was so tired but i kept on thinking about my son 
east germany agreed to this exodus tuesday then closed the 
border with czechoslovakia the only nation east germans could 
travel to without government permission 
mrs pfeiffers husband stefan also 23 said we really 
didnt have much time to think there was speculation at home that 
they may close the ceczhoslovak border 
pfeiffer a construction worker said he didnt know where the 
family would end up in west germany maybe well go to 
rhinelandpfalz he said jokingly rhinelandpalz is the german 
name for chancellor helmut kohls home state of rhineland 
palatinate 
most of the refugees are in their 20s and 30s most say they 
were dissatisfied with east germanys hardline communist system 
red cross workers shivering in the freezing dawn spooned out 
hot goulash and soup and poured tea and coffee for the refugees 
the first hot meal for most of them since wednesday noon in 
czechoslovakia 
among the refugees where at least 1000 young children looking 
dazed and bewildered by the commotion in the hof train station 
many were crying tightly hugging teddy bears and other stuffed 
toys 
many of the refugees hugging each other some crying and others 
smiling broadly waited in long lines for telephones to call 
relatives in west germany and east germany 
most of the east germans in this northern bavarian town were put 
on other trains within an hour of their arrival thursday for 
transport to refugee centers in other parts of west germany 
hundreds of them dazed and exhausted sipped beverages handed 
them as they waited to leave for the centers 
most of them carried only hand baggage with their entire 
belongings many were dressed in blue jeans and other light 
clothing unsuited for the chilly weather 
some sorted through clothing stacked high on yellow railway 
carts by the red cross workers looking for something warm to wear 
others told of how they fled their communist homeland 
the albrechts who came from potsdam said they crossed the 
border just an hour before the east german government closed the 
border with czechoslovakia 
it was hell on the train it was crowded and even some of the 
children had to stand in the corridors where it was bitterly 
cold he said 
but now i think it was worth it

the first american 
rocket built and designed entirely with commercial funds fizzled 
and burned on the launch pad today the projects backers said 
we lighted it up and for one reason or the other it didnt 
lift off said jim bennett president of american rocket co of 
camarillo the launch team tried to disengage the rocket but it 
caught fire he said 
the 58foot rocket used in the 2 million experimental launch 
was to have flown on a 15minute suborbital flight to test star 
wars missile detectors and a heat shieldparachute that might help 
astronauts escape a space station emergency 
there was fire on the pad which is now close to burning itself 
out bennett said the air force said there was minimal damage to 
the launch pad which belongs to the air force but the vehicle 
is nonflyable 
the 33400pound rocket is powered by a hybrid engine that runs 
on a combination of liquid oxygen and a rubberlike solid fuel 
american rocket said its booster was the first designed and 
built only with commercial funds rockets in other commercial 
launches this year were built under government programs but later 
sold for commercial use according to the company 
todays launch was scheduled so the rocket could release a cloud 
of inert gas as the pentagons delta star satellite passed 
overhead the satellite contains sensors that someday may be part 
of a strategic defense initiative system in which satellites would 
detect incoming warheads so they could be destroyed 
defense department spokesman maj william oconnell said earlier 
that the pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected the 
booster 
the rocket also was scheduled to deploy a test model of an 
8footwide parashield a combined heat shield and parachute that 
someday might be part of an escape system to allow space station 
astronauts to return to earth 
david akin assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics 
at the massachusetts institute of technology had his design class 
build the 390pound model

eight months after the start of a murder 
trial jurors spent 14 hours in court before deciding on a death 
sentence while one juror endured the start of labor contractions 
i just took my time looked at all the facts and we sat and 
talked said susan kilby i wasnt really rushing im not a 
worrywart 
late tuesday ms kilby and the 11 other jurors condemned robert 
j breton to death for killing his exwife and teenage son 
the verdict was returned about five minutes before the jurors 
were scheduled to take an extended recess so ms kilby could give 
birth and two others could get married and one could go on 
vacation 
ten hours later after a sleepless night ms kilby gave birth 
to a healthy 8pound boy her second child 
in a telephone interview from her hospital room wednesday she 
described the stress of weighing a mans life while her body told 
her a baby was coming 
i was getting a lot of contractions she said but we had 
to get that trial done this case has been lingering around for 
months we had all the facts everything in front of us 
we werent going to make that decision unless it was 
unanimous now we can all go on with our lives 
lawyers said ms kilbys condition must have put pressure on her 
fellow jurors to reach a verdict but jury foreman john sherman 
said the jury felt no pressure to finish that night 
when ms kilby was chosen in february as a juror she told judge 
maxwell heiman she was expecting a child in october 
the judge wasnt concerned murder trials dont often last 
eight months 
the jury convicted breton in april but the sentencing phase was 
delayed six months while the state supreme court reviewed heimans 
ruling early in the trial that the states death penalty law was 
unconstitutionally vague 
by the time the supreme court ruled and the jury finally 
reconvened to consider whether breton should be sentenced to death 
or to life in prison ms kilby was very pregnant in addition two 
other jurors had planned fall weddings and a fourth was preparing 
for a long vacation 
heiman in a move challenged unsuccessfully by bretons lawyers 
decided to have the jury deliberate for one day to be followed by 
a twomonth recess if no decision could be reached by 11 pm 
tuesday 
as the hour neared tension built in the courtroom heiman 
pacing in the courtroom joked at one point i hope she doesnt 
have the baby tonight the jury returned its verdict at about 
1055 pm ending a 14hour day filled by closing arguments the 
judges instructions to the jury and five hours of deliberations 
ms kilby 32 a psychiatric technician at waterbury hospital 
where the baby was born said she drew on her professional 
experience to get through the last day of the trial 
im trained to deal with stress with people and problems 
she said it was easy enough for me i think the other jurors 
were really more worried about me making it through 
breton wont formally be sentenced until oct 27 but the jurys 
decision leaves heiman no choice but to sentence breton to death 
the sentence will automatically be reviewed by the state supreme 
court 
richard kelly a public defender who represented breton said 
the pressure ms kilbys pregnancy put on the jury would be cited 
in the appeal 
i suppose the concern is not just the pressures that might 
have existed on that juror but the pressures that her situation 
placed on other jurors said alan mcwhirter another defense 
attorney 
i think a logical argument can be made that this jury was 
rushed said diane randall a lobbyist for the connecticut 
network against the death penalty

the afternoon kansas city star and the 
morning kansas city times will merge to form a single morning paper 
called the kansas city star 
no date was set for publication of the merged newspaper said 
james h hale publisher of the two papers 
he and editor joe mcguff said today that no employees will be 
laid off because of the merger 
the two papers have been owned by capital citiesabc inc since 
1977 but compete in news coverage 
the merger will mark the end of 109 years of afternoon 
publishing by the kansas city star co which was started in 1880 
as a twopenny fourpage paper by william rockhill nelson and 
samuel e morss 
nelson later bought morss interest and purchased the times in 
1901 and ran it as the morning edition of the star 
mcguff said the change was brought about by declining 
circulation and shifting readership preferences 
readers are telling us they have less time for reading for 
watching television and for leisure activities than ever before 
mcguff said they want their information in one convenient 
wellorganized easytoread package 
the decision to drop afternoon publication follows a trend among 
metropolitan newspapers around the country 
the 1989 editor amp publisher yearbook gives the daily times 
circulation at 280000 the stars at 185000 the sunday stars 
circulation is a little more than 400000

pope john paul ii set the stage for a 
historic meeting with mikhail s gorbachev by saying thursday the 
soviet union should legalize the longbanned ukrainian catholic 
church without delay 
his remarks indicated john paul will raise the issue during the 
soviet presidents visit to italy on nov 29dec 1 when they plan 
the first meeting between supreme leaders of the vatican and the 
kremlin 
in remarks thursday to ukrainian bishops living in the west the 
pontiff said their church had been forced into the catacombs 
referring to its suppression by dictator josef stalin more than 40 
years ago 
without mentioning gorbachev by name john paul said continued 
hostility and accusations against the ukrainian church hinder 
the reforms the president has put into motion 
without the legalization of the ukrainian community the 
process of democratization will never be complete the pope said 
in 1946 the eastern rite ukrainian church was forcibly merged 
with the russian orthodox church the pope noted that churches and 
monasteries were closed and some bishops and priests were killed 
deported or arrested 
the ukrainian church flourished underground however and today 
has an estimated following of 2 million to 4 million ukrainian 
catholics have held several rallies in recent weeks demanding 
legalization 
with ever greater urgency and frequency the cry of these 
ukrainian catholics reaches rome the pope said thursday 
help us they ask so that we may be able to pray in public no 
longer in hiding but in the churches we built the bishop of rome 
the pope must heed these pleas 
the readiness and good will of the authorities must be brought 
to bear so that they may after decades of neglect solve the 
problem of the recognition of the rights of the ukrainian catholic 
church 
the holy see expresses the hope that competent authorities 
will proceed without delay to the recognition of the rights of your 
church 
john paul said the terms of the human rights document approved 
in january at the vienna conference on european security and 
cooperation should be applied to the ukrainian church 
he called for free access to places of worship the right of the 
church to organize its own hierarchy and the possibility of 
maintaining free contact with the faithful at home and abroad 
the pope urged the officially approved russian orthodox church 
to overcome prejudices and to come to the aid of their catholic 
brethren who are in need he addressed 18 ukrainian bishops who 
have been holding a twoweek synod in rome 
vaticansoviet relations have improved steadily under gorbachev 
as exemplified by the popes recent success in naming new bishops 
in byelorussia lithuania and communist czechoslovakia 
another sign of improved relations with eastern europe was the 
polishborn popes acceptance thursday of the credentials of jerzy 
kuberski polands first ambassador to the holy see in more than 40 
years 
the vatican restored full diplomatic relations with poland in 
july a first for a sovietbloc country relations were broken when 
the communists came to power after world war ii 
in remarks to the new ambassador john paul did not refer to the 
new noncommunist government of poland but said his homeland had 
become once again the country of courage and events that have 
prophetic force especially for those parts of the world where man 
still suffers

communist reformers and orthodox 
marxists traded charges and threats thursday as they prepared for 
what could be the most turbulent and important party congress in 41 
years of communist power here 
recent commitments by reformminded communist leaders to 
democracy a market economy and international human rights have put 
hungary on the forefront of liberalism within the soviet bloc 
but they have resulted in growing polarization within the party 
and conservatives have said they will seek to oust reformist 
leaders at the congress that opens friday 
a groundswell of sentiment against reform and a return to 
marxist orthodoxy would in turn doom plans for free elections 
agreed to by communists leaders and the political opposition 
the reformers want to cleanse the commmunist hungarian socialist 
workers party of orthodox elements and do not discount a split if 
that proves impossible 
they also favor changing the partys name some suggest calling 
it the hungarian socialist party or the socialist democratic union 
conservatives vehemently oppose removing all reference to workers 
both sides clearly drew the demarcation lines in statements 
published thursday 
the marxist unity platform in a manifesto published in the 
communist party daily nepszabadsag urged party members to break 
with bourgeois and liberal distortions and remain true to 
marxistleninist teachings 
the rightwing leadership that has assumed power is dissolving 
socialist unity it warned 
stating the reformist view premier miklos nemeth told the 
government daily magyar hirlap that the party has to be freed of 
those people who do not agree with the need for radical 
change 
if we have to split in order to rejuvenate thats something 
we have to face nemeth said 
nemeth one of the prime advocates of change joined coleaders 
imre pozsgay and rezsoe nyers in endorsing a conference of 
reformists last month but not all top officials share their views 
karoly grosz the fourth member of the party presidium sent a 
message of support to a conference of orthodox marxists opposed to 
radical change they met separately from the reformists to plan 
strategy for the congress 
former politburo member janos berecz who was ousted from the 
partys executive panel this summer also opposes broad change 
while reformists appeared to be in the majority within the 
21member politburo ahead of the congress many of the 113member 
central committee the partys top policy formulating body 
remained publicly uncommitted 
the process to institute bolder changes in place of relatively 
modest attempts to tinker with the oneparty system and the 
staterun economy began about two years ago it gained steam after 
janos kadar was ousted in may 1988 
reformists associate kadars last decade in power with 
stagnation while some conservatives still hail the late leaders 
32year era 
the pace of reform in recent months has at times moved hungary 
ahead of poland the only soviet bloc country not dominated by 
communists 
warsaw has been cautious about not offending its more hardline 
warsaw pact partners but hungary has alienated three repressive 
warsaw pact allies east germany romania and czechoslovakia 
with its liberal policies 
joining the critics from abroad are orthodox hungarian marxists 
angry about a central committee draft manifesto prepared for the 
congress that would radically change the makeup of their party 
the 20page manifesto foresees a constitutional state based on 
a multiparty system in which the source of power is the will of 
the people manifested at free elections and an efficient 
market economy 
voting on the draft is one of the key tasks of the 1200 
delegates but they also face other key decisions 
one reform proposal suggests fully democratic elections to 
leading party positions balloting in the past has been limited to 
congress delegates

chinese prisons china has occupied tibet since 1950

the head of a national commission seeking 
solutions to americas health care needs said thursday the panel 
wont be deterred by congressional moves to roll back medicare 
catastrophic illness coverage 
sen jay rockefeller dwva said it was hogwash to 
suggest the pepper commissions work will be an empty exercise 
because of controversy over a catastrophiccare package that came 
under fire from the elderly 
it is precisely the opposite rockefeller said we have 
the chance the obligation to put catastrophic protection in a 
larger context of comprehensive reform and to make solid bold 
recommendations 
the house voted 36066 on wednesday to scrap the catastrophic 
program and there also is strong sentiment for repeal in the 
senate some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that 
congress will be wary of tackling the longterm care problem after 
getting swamped with complaints about the catastrophic care plan 
rockefellers commission known formally as the us bipartisan 
commission on comprehensive health care is charged with developing 
solutions to two of the nations most pressing healthcare 
problems the need of 9 million americans for longterm care at 
home or in nursing homes and the lack of insurance coverage for 
more than 31 million americans 
at a commission hearing thursday rockefeller said the need for 
longterm care protection is a problem obviously crying out for 
solution and which will not go away because of the catastrophic 
controversy 
we will not be intimidated or for one moment put off about all 
our responsibilities for long term care in all of its forms he 
said we simply must forge ahead and mold a solution to longterm 
care that has real prospects and that obviously can pass the 
congress 
several groups appearing before the commission renewed calls for 
a new social insurance program to protect americans against the 
staggering costs of longterm care saying private insurance alone 
cannot provide adequate and affordable coverage for all 
richard gehring chairman of the board of directors for the 
alzheimers association said that despite the furor over the 
catastrophic package a nationwide longterm care program would be 
welcomed if the costs were spread across society and the benefits 
were available to all 
americans understand that longterm care needs could strike 
their family gehring said in poll after poll and by 
overwhelming margins americans say they would be willing to pay for 
longterm care protection 
paul willging executive vice president of the american health 
care association which represents nearly 10000 nursing homes 
called for a publicprivate longterm care program akin to the mix 
of retirement benefits provided social security and private 
pensions and for increased social security taxes to finance the 
new government expenses 
more than anything else providers want to help bring about a 
system whereby patients do not have to become impoverished in order 
to qualify for benefits and where we dont have to turn them away 
because of an inability to pay willging said 
carl j schramm president of the health insurance association 
of america which represents 350 commercial insurers said it would 
be irresponsible to place the financing burden primarily on the 
federal government schramm said the private insurance market 
could be stimulated by making changes in the federal tax code 
the commission made up of six senators six representatives and 
three white house appointees is scheduled to report on its 
proposals by march 1

tv evangelist jim bakker was convicted 
today of fleecing followers of 37 million so that he could 
surround himself with everything from rollsroyces to goldplated 
swanshaped bathroom fixtures 
a federal jury deliberated a day and a half before convicting 
him on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy for overselling time 
shares or partnerships at his ptl empires resort hotels to 
loyal followers of his ministry 
the 49yearold babyfaced preacher could receive up to 120 
years in prison and 5 million in fines at sentencing oct 24 
us district judge robert potter freed bakker on 250000 bail 
but said he did so reluctantly because of bakker supporters jim 
jones mentality a reference to the 1978 murdersuicide of 900 
cult followers in jonestown guyana 
defense attorney george c davis said he would appeal 
bakker showed little emotion as the verdict was read tears 
welled in wife tammys eyes as the couple left court mrs bakker 
who was not charged in the case sang on christ the solid rock 
i stand all other ground is sinking sand 
then she said its not over until its over 
prosecutors said bakker diverted donations and accepted fat 
bonuses to live in style buying fancy cars rolex watches 
diamonds an airconditioned doghouse and homes with gigantic 
walkin closets motorized bedroom drapes and a 500 shower curtain 
the message is you cant lie to the people and use television 
and the mails to get them to send you money said prosecutor 
deborah smith it doesnt matter who you are or how well known 
you are you simply cant do it 
jury foreman ricky hill said the prosecution did an excellent 
job we kept looking for something from the defense and we never 
saw it 
i believe he began in earnest he was called by god but 
eventually the money became too much for him hill said he was 
a man of god he got corrupt and i feel sorry for the man 
as they awaited the verdict in the courtroom supporters held 
bibles opened to psalm 17 which reads thou hast tried me and 
shalt find nothing 
prosecutors contend bakker raised 158 million by selling 
partnerships at his heritage usa theme park near fort mill sc 
partners typically paid 1000 for the promise of three nights 
lodging annually at the park 
the government charged that ptl sold 153000 partnerships from 
1984 to 1987 but that it made only 258 rooms available that one 
large hotel and other promised facilities were never completed and 
that many partners couldnt get rooms 
the prosecution had portrayed bakker as a con man who cynically 
used the nations airwaves to fleece his followers the softspoken 
bakker depicted himself on the stand as a man of god who was in 
over his head when it came to business 
my faith was that he would be set free on all charges said 
bill fisher a bakker supporter in fort mill i still believe he 
will i know jim thinks the same way and god will see him through 
it 
the rev robert dugan a spokesman for the national association 
of evangelicals said the conviction may help dispel the 
disenchantment many americans had developed toward religious 
broadcasting in general 
if he had managed to get off the hook it probably would have 
left the public with some doubts he said 
the rev dean m kelley director for religious liberty of the 
national council of churches said of the scandal it sort of 
elmer gantryd all of us a reference to the sinclair lewis 
novel about a con manpreacher 
the rev jerry falwell who briefly took over ptl after bakkers 
downfall said he was sorry for the bakkers and others hurt in the 
scandal but pleased that this dark chapter of religious history 
has concluded 
i am confident that the work of god which is far bigger than 
any one man or church will flourish in the days and years ahead in 
an unprecedented way he said 
the verdict came after a tumultuous fiveweek trial that began 
aug 28 
bakker was committed to a mental hospital for a psychiatric 
evaluation aug 31 after lawyers said he was hallucinating and 
cowering with his head under a couch he was pronounced competent 
to stand trial sept 6 after a government psychiatrist said he had 
had a panic attack the attack came one day after a ptl 
executiveturnedgovernmentwitness collapsed on the stand 
before the collapse of their 180 million evangelical empire and 
bakkers resignation in 1987 in a sex and money scandal jim and 
tammy bakker were among the most successful of the tv preachers 
they produced the ptl club show and built the 2300acre theme 
park 
bakker quit ptl when it was revealed that he had a hotel room 
liaison with onetime church secretary jessica hahn in 1980 and that 
she was paid more than 250000 in hush money he later was 
defrocked ptl went into bankruptcy and heritage usa was closed 
after its sale to a canadian businessman fell through 
the bakkers now live in orlando fla and have been 
broadcasting the jim and tammy show from what had been an 
abandoned shopping center 
you cant tell halftruths prosecutor smith told the jury 
if you do it if you use the postal service and the public 
airwaves you will find yourself in federal court answering charges 
of mail and wire fraud thats why were here today because thats 
just what mr bakker did 
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud said davis he 
was conducting a ministry he was doing what he thought was vital 
to the survival of his ministry 
three former bakker aides already convicted in the case 
testified against him 
his former secondincommand richard dortch testified that 
bakker purposedly misled his viewers into buying partnerships he 
knew they would never be able to use and said he considered the 
partnerships a gold mine 
dortch pleaded guilty in a plea bargain and drew an eightyear 
prison term and a 200000 fine 
former aides david taggart and his brother james the ministrys 
decorator were convicted of evading taxes on 11 million in ptl 
money used for personal expenditures david got more than 18 years 
in prison and james more than 17

president bush on thursday urged angolan rebel 
leader jonas savimbi to return to the negotiating table and work 
out a ceasefire agreement with angolas sovietbacked government 
savimbi promised to comply 
at the 30minute white house meeting bush pledged us support 
for savimbi and his union for the total independence of angola 
unita but he also admonished the guerrilla chief to end his feud 
with zaire president mobutu sese seko 
bush has been trying to restore peace between the two sides 
whose dispute in recent weeks has threatened the truce agreement 
reached last june through mobutus mediation bush met with mobutu 
wednesday and delivered a similar admonition 
the president urged dr savimbi to work with president mobutu 
and others in the region to foster the peace process said a 
white house statement he noted our longstanding support for a 
ceasefire and facetoface negotiations and ultimately free and 
fair elections it said 
the reference to facetoface negotiations was directed at 
savimbi who rejected us urgings to attend a negotiating session 
between the sides in kinshasa zaire last month one us official 
said 
president bush used the occasion of todays visit to stress 
the united states continued support for unita the statement 
said the organization has been getting 40 million or more in 
covert us assistance to help it fight the angolan government 
sen jesse helms rnc complained this week that mobutu has 
disrupted the arms shipments which flow primarily through his 
territory in order to pressure savimbi into negotiating with 
angolas government 
mobutu while saying publicly that he has received everything 
the united states promised indicated to reporters wednesday that 
he and the united states are divided on the question of continued 
us supplies to unita 
the administration under heavy pressure from conservatives in 
congress has vowed to continue aiding the rebels until the 
government agrees to hold free elections that would give unita a 
chance at the polls 
angolas government argues that priority must be given to 
savimbis ouster and consolidation of a peace agreement with unita 
before embarking on a change in the oneparty system and eventual 
elections 
the feud between savimbi and mobutu revolves around conflicting 
claims of what was agreed to by angola and unita at the gbadolite 
summit attended by 18 african leaders angolan president eduardo 
dos santos backed by mobutu contends savimbi undertook to step 
down from his post and to integrate his forces into angolas 
military 
savimbi has denied that interpretation contending he would not 
have agreed to such terms in light of unitas superiority on the 
battle field 
he said bush too had assured him that he does not accept those 
conceptions of exile integration 
but emerging from his talk with bush savimbi also said he was 
ready to resume negotiations with angola under zairean mediation 
i think very soon we are going to come together he said 
savimbi said he would also meet very soon with mobutu and 
all the problems will be sorted out

the rev jesse jackson plans to be the host of a 
weekly onehour television program scheduled to begin next fall 
that will give a platform to those whose voices have been locked 
out 
plans for the syndicated program voices of america with jesse 
jackson were announced thursday at a news conference by jackson 
and dick robertson president of warner bros television 
distribution which will market the show 
jackson said his goal on the show will be to create access 
precipitate ideas and be fair 
its not so much the national conclusions that we seek as we 
seek the national debate to open up the great and critical issues 
of our day said the civil rights leader and former presidential 
candidate 
jackson said he wanted to break the narrowness of current 
television in which fewer and fewer people talk about more and 
more and often know less and less 
he suggested that along with powerful political voices from 
abroad he also would offer access to such people as striking coal 
miners or to family farmers and the rural bankers who must 
foreclose on them or teachers who face a coming generation of 
crackaddicted children 
neither a format nor a home base for the program has been worked 
out nor has warner begun lining up stations said robertson 
van gordon sauter former president of cbs news and quincy 
jones the musician and recording executive will be executive 
producers of the program 
sauter said it is likely that the show will combine elements of 
the talk magazine and interview formats 
i think given the uniqueness of the talent jackson the 
breadth of his curiosities of his knowledge of people and his 
contacts it is not a broadcast that is going to easily fit into 
what are the normal categories said sauter 
jackson declined to disclose what he would earn from the show 
were into private enterprise now you know well let you know 
at the appropriate time he said

randall terry the former used car 
salesman who founded the antiabortion group operation rescue is 
no stranger to jail even listing his 35 arrests on a resume he 
distributes to reporters 
the 30yearold activist has spent more than 90 days in jail for 
his role in demonstrations in binghamton atlanta and los angeles 
that length of time soon could be extended terry offered the 
option of paying a fine for criminal trespass and unlawful assembly 
in atlanta during the democratic national convention in 1988 said 
thursday hed rather spend two years in jail 
i think he will use the experience to his advantage in terms 
of a martyr image said margaret johnston administrator at the 
southern tier womens services in binghamton a clinic that 
performs abortions where terry was first arrested in 1986 for 
chaining himself to a sink 
terry was born and raised outside rochester ny he left home 
at age 17 for a crosscountry trip dreaming of being a rock 
musician he returned a bornagain christian 
he and his wife cindy who met at bible school have one 
biological child and three foster children they settled in 
binghamton and terry began selling cars a job he gave up when 
operation rescue became too timeconsuming 
the terrys began their antiabortion crusading by standing 
outside johnstons clinic in 1984 trying to talk women out of 
entering as supporters joined them the clinic was used as a 
testing ground for new demonstration techniques 
operation rescue demonstrators stand or sit in front of abortion 
clinics refuse orders to leave and force police to drag them away 
we cry that abortion is murder its childkilling and yet we 
carry a picket once or twice a year and write a few letters thats 
not an adequate response to murder the lean bushyhaired terry 
said in an interview a logical response to murder is physical 
intervention on behalf of the victim 
terry spent most of a 22day jail term in binghamton in 1986 
writing a book on his cause like his hero martin luther king 
hes working on another book said spokeswoman barbara magera 
i do think jail will be a real hardship for him johnston 
said i know that when he was in jail in binghamton he really 
hated it i think he just hates that kind of discipline and 
authority and you cant get around that in a jail

the rise and fall of television evangelist jim 
bakker had elements of a tragedy played out on a stage where 
religion in america particularly evangelicalism was an unwitting 
participant 
its a tide that lowers all boats said the rev dean m 
kelley director for religious liberty of the national council of 
churches it sort of elmer gantryd all of us 
bakker was convicted thursday on 24 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy but before his resignation 2 years ago he had ridden 
a wave of success building a single television station the ptl 
satellite network and a multimilliondollar empire 
his crowning achievement was to be the heritage usa christian 
theme park but instead it led to his downfall he was convicted of 
fleecing followers of 37 million by overselling time shares at 
his ministrys resort hotels 
religion observers were divided thursday over the impact of the 
bakker affair which has drawn substantial media attention since 
march 1987 when bakker resigned as ptl president after confessing 
to a sexual encounter with former church secretary jessica hahn 
church leaders at the assemblies of god which defrocked bakker 
in may 1987 declined to comment on the fallen evangelists 
conviction 
the church did what it had to do in 1987 and we feel we have 
put that behind us and we are going on with the business of the 
church said juleen turnage spokeswoman for the 25 
millionmember denomination 
the church last month established a 10year decade of harvest 
program to evangelize 5 million people open 5000 new churches and 
train 20000 new ministers 
james m wall editor of the christian century a liberal 
protestant publication said bakker was using religion to sell 
his product i never have felt that it was religion on trial here 
while the element of religion may have heightened public 
interest in the case wall said it just means that the 
institution of religion like the institution of law the 
institution of medicine has people in it that are going to take 
advantage of their profession to cheat the public 
others said the bakker affair left more permanent scars 
the significance is that unfortunately it has disenchanted 
many americans with religious broadcasting in general said the 
rev robert dugan director of public affairs for the national 
association of evangelicals 
but dugan said bakkers conviction may provide an opportunity 
for religious groups to put the episode behind them 
if he had managed to get off the hook it probably would have 
left the public with some doubts dugan said 
though he compared bakker to gantry the title character in 
sinclair lewis novel about a fallen evangelist kelley said he 
never thought bakker was a charlatan 
i think that it has elements of tragedy about it in the sense 
that he was maybe still is a very gifted personality kelley 
said 
the evangelist could receive up to 120 years in prison and 5 
million in fines at sentencing oct 24 may have just been 
overwhelmed by the fiscal demands of his empire according to 
kelley 
i guess it was kind of like juggling cannonballs and he may 
have been distracted by some mundane temptations and they came 
through the floor and brought down the house as it were

for the activists said they had no weapons but embassy sources 
said they were armed and initial police reports said some were 
heavily armed 
several embassy workers remained inside the building but it was 
not immediately clear if they were being held hostage 
no violence was immediately reported 
we are here to denounce human rights violations and so that 
the costa rican government pressures cirstiani to end the 
repression against the people a spokeswoman for the activists 
said in an interview

the title character of sweetie an 
australian tragicomedy which recently opened at the new york film 
festival is not on the surface easy to like 
played by genevieve lemon making her film debut sweetie is a 
frightened possibly schizophrenic young woman barely capable of 
taking care of herself vulnerable openly suffering she receives 
little support from her withdrawn sister kay karen colston and 
her wellintentioned but insensitive parents john darling and 
dorothy barry 
but as lemon explained at a news conference following a recent 
screening of the movie she saw the positive qualities of sweetie 
her need for love and understanding her desire to connect with a 
family that doesnt seem to want her around 
karen colston and i would have discussions lemon said 
and we would come to the positions of defending our characters 
we would defend them so strongly she would say her character 
had to live with such a difficult person i would say people were 
so cruel to sweetie 
lemon worried that the audience would be cruel as well that 
sweeties obesity and crudity would produce laughter in the wrong 
places it was her job the actress said to make sure that sweetie 
was viewed sympathetically 
im pleased sweetie isnt such a repugnant character lemon 
said i think its important not just to get laughs but to have 
some dignity as well 
colston barry and director jane campion also make their feature 
film debuts in sweetie and though not credited trees are 
supporting stars as well 
theyre referred to in dialogue trees scare me they have 
hidden powers kay says at the beginning they are a symbol of 
hope for kays boyfriend tom lycos and provide a haven for 
sweetie when the world threatens to overwhelm her 
lemon said one of the films themes was how the characters were 
unable or unwilling to open up to each other 
australians are reluctant to seek help of any kind 
pyschoanalysts are not part of australian culture for sweetie it 
so easily could have been another way but the attitude was at 
all costs dont bring in outsiders 
the film is dedicated to campions sister lemon quickly noted 
to much laughter that the directors sister was not like 
sweetie but was actually a filmmaker 
the character was inspired by a relative of gerrys 
screenplay writer lee jane knew him also and they developed his 
character into sweetie 
actually during the filming there was a family crisis and 
janes sister really came through that made the dedication even 
more touching 
sweetie is scheduled for an early1990 release by avenue 
pictures

the house today approved a 227 billion 
expansion of federal aid for child care after beating back an 
effort by republicans and southern democrats to strip out 
requirements for health safety and quality standards 
on a 230195 vote democratic leaders defeated an 
administrationendorsed substitute by rep charles stenholm 
dtexas aimed at striking provisions to make states regulate child 
care centers and provide annual training for their workers 
the vote left the house carrying two separate child care 
measures into negotiations with the senate which approved its own 
version in june 
both packages provide twothirds of the new child care aid 
through an expansion of earned income tax credits for poor families 
with children but one of them would extend direct subsidies now 
limited to the poor to middleincome families as well 
the legislation is attached to a deficitreduction bill that has 
become a vehicle for a wide variety of unrelated proposals 
including a reduction in capital gains taxes and the repeal of a 
yearold catastrophic health care program for the elderly 
to defeat stenholms approach democratic leaders had to promise 
they would abandon language prohibiting aid for any sectarian 
activity 
churches now provide about onethird of the nations child care

more than 600 east germans chanting 
deutschland and shouting thanks left a warsaw train station 
thursday for new lives in the west rejecting east germany on the 
eve of the communist states 40th anniversary 
poland contributed two extra cars to a sixcar east german train 
sent to carry the refugees to west germany where they 
automatically will be accepted as citizens 
the train pulled out of gdansk station in northern warsaw at 
722 pm on board was johannes bauch the no 2 diplomat at west 
germanys embassy in warsaw to guarantee their safe passage 
through east germany to helmstadt on the west german side of the 
border 
it was the second train of refugees to leave poland in less than 
a week a train carrying 809 left early sunday 
thousands more were allowed to emigrate to west germany after 
packing the west german embassy in prague czechoslovakia 
according to west german diplomats there were at least 633 
refugees on the latest train to leave warsaw 
east germany largely sealed off the border to poland this week 
and many refugees swam the oder or neisse rivers or hiked overland 
across the border to reach warsaw others were allowed into poland 
by virtue of previously issued documents or close family ties here 
i dont think it is going to be the last train i wish for the 
sake of all future refugees that there will be more trains said 
andrzej szczerba 38 a naturalized east german citizen who has 
lived and worked in east germany since 1983 he left with his wife 
i had everything in east germany except for freedom said 
another man a polish citizen who had lived in east germany 15 
years and was fleeing to west germany with his east german wife and 
two teenage sons 
in the cars waiting to leave many of the east germans munched 
sandwiches or sipped beer one burly german spotting polish tv 
cameras leaned out the window and shouted in heavily accented 
polish thank you polonia 
the sentiment was repeated by west german ambassador franz 
joachim schoeller after the train pulled out 
i think what the poles have been doing for us is just 
wonderful and they have been helping from the very first moment 
since the movement started he said 
the polish government the first east bloc government not led 
by communists has promised west germany that none of the refugees 
will be sent back home against their will 
but it also has tried not to strain relations with east germany 
a warsaw pact ally that controls polands land access to western 
europe and is celebrating its 40th anniversary this weekend poland 
said the problem of the refugees should be solved between the two 
german states 
for many refugees the train trip was a step into the unknown 
a 27yearold woman who said she swam the oder river into 
poland on thursday morning said she came emptyhanded 
i dont have any baggage no underwear or socks not even 
shoes all i have are my papers she said 
i have a good head and a good pair of hands in east germany

marlon brando says that the studio which made 
his new movie a dry white season weakened the films 
antiapartheid message in order to make more money 
in an interview to be shown on saturday night with connie 
chung this weekend brando says mgmua excised crucial scenes 
from the movie 
in my view they made decisions about cutting a dry white 
season which i think diminished the value of the picture and they 
did not take into consideration the benefits that might befall 
people in africa who are suffering as a result of the policies of 
apartheid says brando according to a transcript supplied by cbs 
news 
i think they made a money decision if i know corporate 
executives especially in the movie business i know they were 
thinking of the money 
mary stevens hardy mgmuas director of corporate 
communications did not return a telephone call seeking comment 
brando has blasted mgmua in the past few days telling the 
trade newspaper variety that he had asked the studio to replace the 
cut scenes and they had refused 
theyre hoping i will go away like some evil wind brando 
tells miss chung but theyre mistaken because im not gonna go 
away this is life and death this is real life were talking 
about human relations were talking about human rights were 
addressing ourselves to racial issues and thats why i care 
because its not for money

the number of cases of lyme disease doubled in a 
years time and precautions such as bug spray may not be practical 
for people at risk for months on end federal health officials said 
thursday 
the national centers for disease control reported a record 4572 
cases of the tickborne disease last year chiefly in the 
northeast thats nearly twice as high as in 1987 when 2368 cases 
were reported and up more than ninefold from 1982s 492 cases 
certainly it is on the increase said dr robert craven a 
coloradobased lyme disease specialist with the cdc everyone who 
lives in an area where lyme disease is probable should be aware of 
it and take the necessary precautions 
in 198788 80 percent of the us cases were reported in six 
northeastern states new york new jersey connecticut 
pennsylvania rhode island and massachusetts new york state alone 
reported 56 percent of the 1988 cases and two counties in the 
suburbs around new york city westchester and suffolk reported 
44 percent 
the disease can cause rash aches and even lifethreatening 
heart disturbances most cases occur in the warm weather months 
when the tick problem is worst 
the increasing case count is probably due not only to spread of 
the disease but also to increased awareness and reporting the 
agency noted 
health professionals recommend protective clothing and insect 
repellent to guard against ticks carrying the disease but in some 
highrisk areas that may not be realistic the atlantabased cdc 
said 
in suburban areas where lyme disease is endemic infection 
may be acquired principally around residences and risk of 
exposure may be continuous during the transmission season the 
agency noted 
under these circumstances certain personal protection 
measures such as the daily application of repellents may not be 
practical 
the cdc also said thursday that health officials in new york and 
connecticut have reported five cases of seizures in people who used 
insect repellent products containing nndiethylemtoluamide or 
deet 
deet present in many bestselling bug sprays has been marketed 
in this country since 1956 and is used by 50 million to 100 million 
people each year the cdc said 
obviously this needs to be looked at in perspective craven 
said 
four of the five seizure patients all of whom recovered 
quickly were under 8 years old three of the cases were reported 
by the same pediatric neurologist 
the cdc recommended not applying insect repellent in large 
quantities to exposed skin especially in children 
the developments have left researchers wondering how best to 
attack the lyme disease problem 
thats the area were actively looking at right now what 
sort of modifications to the environment around the home can be 
made craven said 
its recommended that suburbanites clear their yards of leaves 
and debris which can harbor tickcarrying rodents scientists also 
are studying ways to wage chemical warfare against ticks he said

a team of federal investigators began 
work thursday to determine the cause of an explosion touched off 
when a fishing boat struck a submerged pipeline killing three 
people and leaving eight missing 
three people including the pilot and captain were injured 
we want to document what has happened before the vessel is 
moved said mike benson a spokesman for the sixmember team from 
the national transportation safety board the main task is to 
secure perishable information and tap the memories of the survivors 
while the incident is still fresh 
the 160foot fishing vessel north umberland blew up tuesday less 
than a mile off sabine pass while trawling in about 5 feet of 
water authorities have speculated that its nets snagged the 
16inch natural gas pipeline and ruptured it triggering the blast 
and virtually incinerating everything on the boat 
theres a good chance there is little if any of the logs on 
board benson said but we want to see any documentation 
some navigation charts of the area list all submerged pipelines 
while others are not as detailed the boat was not in a restricted 
area coast guard lt scott larochelle said 
the federal investigators along with owners of the ship and the 
pipeline and officials from the us department of transportations 
office of pipeline safety split up into small teams thursday to 
inspect the ship and the broken pipeline and to interview the 
survivors two of whom were hospitalized in nearby beaumont 
the coast guard suspended the search for the missing crewmen 
wednesday about 24 hours after the blast texas department of 
parks and wildlife rangers however continued to patrol sections 
of remote beach thursday in fourwheeldrive vehicles looking for 
bodies that could have washed ashore said bob heitman a 
department game warden 
officials said everything on the ship that could burn was burned 
and reduced to ashes in the intense blaze and suggested the missing 
crewmen either were incinerated or blown off the boat 
a coast guard team that specializes in hazardous materials 
boarded the ship wednesday to make certain toxic anhydrous ammonia 
used as a refrigerant on the fishing boat did not linger in the 
air or water 
the cameron labased pogy boat caught pogy or menhaden 
inedible fish used for poultry feed and fertilizer and was owned 
by zapata heynie corp of houston 
the pipeline is owned by natural gas pipeline of america inc

news coverage of the abortion debate too 
often focuses on extreme positions and ignores the uncertain 
middle a panel told newspaper editors today 
mary ann glendon a harvard law school professor and vice 
president of the international society of family law compared the 
abortion debate to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich between two 
hard pieces of bread 
i would favor a little more coverage of the peanut butter and 
jelly people of the world she told an audience at a panel 
discussion of abortion coverage during the associated press 
managing editors convention 
she said she was referring to people with ambivalence on the 
issue the uncertain middle 
she also said there is room for political compromise on the 
issue as seen in western europe where legislative bodies have 
made abortion readily available in the early weeks of pregnancy 
with the procedure becoming more regulated as the pregnancy 
progresses such laws are in line with a 1973 supreme court ruling 
now under attack 
if you turn the matter over to the legislatures the roof does 
not cave in she said 
cory richards vice president for public policy for the alan 
guttmacher institute and a board member of such organizations as 
the national abortion rights action league said abortion is just 
one family planning option he called it the last stop on the 
train and that it is not enough to present the issue as being 
one people can be only for or against 
it is not fair to equate abortion with reproductive rights said 
richards who urged editors to explore related issues such as 
teenage pregnancy sex education contraceptives safety and the 
progress of family planning legislation in congress 
editors have the power to either increase polarization or 
encourage debate on the issue said mary mahowald a professor of 
biomedical ethics at case western reserve university in cleveland 
she said she is annoyed when a pollster asks if a person is for 
or against abortion without providing choices for different 
circumstances such as the stage of the pregnancy or the health or 
wellbeing of the woman 
abortion is an issue filled with opportunity for bias she 
said 
i see lots of coverage of extreme behavior by both sides 
but whats inappropriate is to present those biases as if they 
represent the whole picture

about 150 million worth of gold recovered 
from a 19thcentury shipwreck came ashore and was loaded into 
armored trucks thursday under the eyes of armed guards and happy 
investors in the salvage project 
several hundred people watched while crewmen of the recovery 
ship arctic discoverer unloaded crates bearing more than a ton of 
gold coins and bars found in the wreckage of the ss central america 
the sidewheel steamer sank about 200 miles off south carolina 
during a hurricane on sept 12 1857 it was carrying california 
gold to new york when it went down killing 425 of the 578 people 
aboard 
the columbus america discovery group which has more than 120 
investors located the wreck three years ago and found the main 
gold storage area this summer 
it is a magnificent national treasure to be cherished to be 
shared bob evans a project director said during a welcoming 
ceremony where a sampling of the shiny gold coins and bars sat on a 
table 
the group expects to recover more gold from the wreck at a 
depth of 1 miles when the weather improves next summer 
the booty will be shared among the investors if us district 
court grants them ownership said richard robol attorney for the 
group the court already has given the group rights to ship 
artifacts including a 300pound bell recovered before june 30 
robol said 45 insurance firms have filed claims for the 
treasure contending they have ties to the 19th century insurance 
companies that paid more than 12 million in claims after the ship 
sank 
not all of the ships gold has been recovered and its exact 
value has yet to be determined the ship was carrying more than 
three tons of gold which would be worth about 450 million at 
todays prices 
in addition many passengers were carrying individual fortunes 
they had made in california so the ships total treasure could be 
worth up to 1 billion shipwreck experts have said 
tom thompson the projects principal director said 120 
investors have rights to twothirds of the booty with the rest 
going to a small group of the project participants including 
himself evans and barry schatz another project director they 
were reluctant to talk about how much money they hope to make from 
the salvage operation which has cost about 10 million 
we hope to be rich thompson said simply 
it was an interesting fascinating gamble said bill cook a 
columbus ohio businessmen who was one of the original investors 
im not feeling smug i feel lucky 
investors paid from 5000 to 50000 for a share of the project 
thompson an ocean engineer said much of the gold remains 
hidden at the bottom of the wreck but salvagers were surprised 
that so much of the treasure was easily visible at the site 
the gold is on top of beams and falling off beams he said 
were recovering coins from the central america that look as 
if they were minted yesterday evans said

israeli leaders met for six hours thursday but 
failed to decide whether to accept an egyptian offer to hold peace 
talks with palestinians in cairo 
the leftleaning labor party of vice premier shimon peres 
proposed accepting such a meeting to discuss israels plan to start 
the negotiating process with elections for the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied territories 
but prime minister yitzhak shamir and his rightwing likud bloc 
opposed the participation of palestinians from outside the occupied 
lands especially deported activists as suggested by egyptian 
president hosni mubarak 
the 12man inner cabinet the decisionmaking body of the 
coalition government was scheduled to continue its discussion on 
friday 
shamir and his supporters said the presence of outside 
palestinians would implicitly recognize the palestine liberation 
organizations demand to allow millions of exiled refugees to 
return to what is now israel 
but mohammed bassiouny egypts ambassador to israel said in an 
interview without palestinians from the outside it will never 
work 
in cairo mubarak said he would agree to a summit with shamir 
when the ground was adequately prepared foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid said us envoys would soon be dispatched to egypt and 
israel 
the most likely compromise for winning majority support was a 
proposal by secretary of state james baker to foreign minister 
moshe arens that called for threeway consultations on the 
composition of a palestinian delegation according to ministers who 
spoke after the meeting 
yossi ahimier a spokesman for shamir said likud had accepted 
the idea that the prime minister will be in contact with the 
americans and will hear their proposals and we will judge later 
what is good for us 
the proposal by likuds arens appeared workable labors moshe 
shahal we would like to see it in writing and then maybe it can 
be accepted by the majority 
speaking to reporters after the session shahal said if the 
government rejects the proposal to talk to palestinians labor 
would pull out of the unity government and call for early israeli 
elections which are not scheduled until 1992 
but peres said the party wants to avoid a crisis that would 
break up the coalition government please stop withall your 
nonsense about us trying to make the government fall that is not 
our intention peres told reporters 
labor has embraced mubaraks proposal for the meeting and a 
10point plan that calls for trading territories for peace his 
plan also calls for a freeze on jewish settlements and 
participation of east jerusalem arabs in the voting

a jogger who was raped and beaten almost to 
death by a gang of youths on a rampage in central park has offered 
to talk to prosecutors about the april attack 
prosecutors had feared the victim a 28yearold investment 
banker would be unable to help them because of the injuries and 
impaired memory she suffered in the assault 
the woman now in physical and psychiatric rehabilitation at 
gaylord hospital in wallingford conn was smashed several times 
in the head with a rock as the teenagers took turns raping her 
six youths have been indicted in the assault 
a metropolitan hospital psychiatric report dated june 2 and 
signed by dr mary ann cohen which prosecutors will likely offer 
as evidence said the victim was able to appropriately discuss 
the idea of speaking to the district attorney if it will help with 
the investigation 
but the report a copy of which was obtained wednesday also 
appeared to justify prosecutors fears i dont know what 
happened cohen quotes the victim as saying and maybe i will 
never know but i know i was attacked and i will just have to 
accept it and deal with it 
a defense lawyer who spoke on condition his name not be used 
said the only reason the prosecution would call the victim with her 
impaired memory would be for the emotional effect on the jury 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau says no decision 
has been made about whether to call the jogger as a witness 
in another development a 15yearold boy charged in the rampage 
pleaded guilty to robbery thursday and implicated six other 
teenagers in an attack the same night on a male jogger in central 
park 
the plea the first in the case was entered by jermaine 
robinson 15 as part of a deal with the prosecution to drop six 
other counts

the dalai lama spiritual and temporal 
leader of tibet whose title means ocean of mercy won the 1989 
nobel peace prize on thursday for decades of nonviolent struggle 
to free his country from china 
my case is nothing special i am a simple buddhist monk no 
more no less he said adding he hoped the award would focus 
attention on compassion in every human being 
one clear purpose of the norwegian nobel committee was to 
deliver a message of support to the prodemocracy movement in 
china the beijing government called the award an insult and 
interference in its internal affairs 
analysts also said the committees action might eventually help 
break the deadlock between china which has occupied the himalayan 
nation since 1950 and the dalai lama who leads an exile 
government based in india 
the prize worth 469000 at the current exchange rate will be 
awarded in oslo on dec 10 
in its citation the nobel committee mentioned the dalai lamas 
rejection of violence and his preachings of respect for all living 
things it praised his constructive and forwardlooking proposals 
for the solution of international conflicts 
past prizes have been used to encourage human rights activists 
and support peace efforts polish solidarity leader lech walesa won 
in 1983 the 1987 prize went to president oscar arias of costa rica 
for his central american peace plan and un peacekeeping forces 
were given last years award 
the dalai lama 54 was born tenzin gyatso the son of a poor 
farmer he was named spiritual and temporal ruler as the 14th dalai 
lama at age 15 just before the chinese army marched into tibet he 
fled tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against chinese rule 
in los angeles where he was attending a conference the dalai 
lama said i very much appreciate that kind of recognition about 
my beliefs in fact i always believed in love compassion and a 
sense of universal respect every human being has that potential 
this prize may open more peoples eyes to look at their own 
quality said the buddhist leader who wore sandals and 
traditional redandorange robes 
tibetans today are facing the real possibility of elimination 
as a people and a nation he later told a news conference 
the dalai lama said he had no idea what he might do with the 
money and that he did not know the exact amount of the award 
do you know how much money he asked a reporter some of 
my friends told me with this prize there was some money 
in the himalayan town of dharmsala india the base of the exile 
government tibetans danced and sang in the streets 
despite the dalai lamas teachings of nonviolence bloody 
clashes with chinese authorities have occurred in lhasa the 
tibetan capital over the past two years 
up to 30 people were killed in march and lhasa has been under 
martial law since then demonstrations were reported as recently as 
last month 
wang guisheng of the chinese embassy in oslo said this has 
hurt the peoples feelings the dalai lama is not only a religious 
leader but also a political figure in exile who carries out 
political activity aimed at splitting the fatherland and 
undermining national unity 
egil aarvik chairman of the norwegian committee that awards the 
nobel peace prize said the buddhist leader was nominated in 
previous years but events in the east particularly in china in 
the last year have made the dalai lamas candidacy more timely now 
than before 
he referred to the army crackdown on student prodemocracy 
demonstrators june 34 and declared to reporters if i were a 
chinese student i would be fully in support of the decision 
after chinese tanks drove the protesters from tiananmen square 
members of the norwegian parliament proposed student leader chai 
ling for the peace prize she was ineligible this year however 
because nominations closed feb 1 
in june 1988 the dalai lama abandoned his demand for the 
independence of tibets 6 million people in favor of 
demilitarization speaking to the european parliament he called 
for a selfgoverning tibet with china in charge of defense and 
foreign affairs 
china which considers tibet an integral part of its territory 
rejected the plan as an attempt to distort history 
in addition to putting down political protest in lhasa the 
chinese have used less overt methods by trying to cultivate senior 
buddhist clergy 
the panchen lama second in the religious hierarchy remained 
behind in tibet when the dalai lama fled tibetan nationalists 
considered him little more than a chinese stooge but he redeemed 
himself in their eyes by calling chinese rule repressive a few 
days before his death in january 
china has said it will talk with the dalai lama if he does not 
negotiate as leader of an exile government the two sides have yet 
to agree on the terms and participants 
harald boeckman of the institute of east asian affairs at oslo 
university said the prize could strengthen the tibetan leaders 
bargaining position and speed up the process toward a 
settlement by bringing about a creative and productive chaos 
next week the swedish nobel committee will name the winners of 
the medicine economics physics and chemistry prizes no date has 
been announced for the literature award 
alfred nobel the swedish industrialist who made a fortune from 
his invention of dynamite established the prizes in his will he 
died in 1896 and the first awards were made in 1901

television evangelist pat robertsons 1988 
presidential campaign committee was turned down thursday in a bid 
for an additional 675000 in federal matching funds 
the federal election commission rejected an appeal by americans 
for robertson which had resubmitted a request for matching funds 
that had previously been denied 
the commission staff had denied the request after reviewing a 
sample of the contributions to be matched and determining that they 
were not eligible for matching funds 
in resubmitting its request the robertson committee asked the 
commission to identify the sample contributions that had been 
rejected 
the committee maintained that by correcting the errors that had 
made these contributions ineligible it should be entitled to 
recover the value of its original submission about 689000 
the committee however accepted the recommendation of its staff 
that the robertson committee was entitled only to the value of the 
sample items or 14873 
it also refused a request by the robertson committee that it be 
permitted to resubmit the request a second time 
robertsons original matching requests totaled 97 million 
in yearend papers filed with the commission the robertson 
campaign reported it was nearly half a million dollars in debt 
robertson unsuccessfully sought the republican nomination for 
president in his 1988 campaign

former panamanian vice presidential candidate 
guillermo ford said at the white house thursday that the panamanian 
defense forces should get their act together and overthrow gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
ford who met with president bush briefly and with vice 
president dan quayle also appealed to world democracies to join in 
trying to oust the dictator but was not specific on what they 
should do he declined to fault the united states for failing to 
intercede during this weeks failed coup 
as to what his group can do now he said its pretty hard to 
knock a tank over with a piece of rock thats why were looking on 
the world democracies to get help i am not going to allow 
noriega to wear a medal made with the blood of the panamanian 
people so were going to find other means to get rid of noriega 
ford was physically assaulted by noriega forces after last mays 
election which observers said was actually won by opponents of 
noriega but which he invalidated 
ford said the political opposition in panama was surprised by 
the attempted coup mounted by insurgents in the defense forces 
there is no relation whatsoever between the opposition and the 
military he said 
ford was asked about congressional complaints that the united 
states should have intervened to back up the insurgents effort to 
topple noriega i think the panamanian defense forces should take 
upon themselves the solution to oust their leader he told 
reporters outside the white house 
i think it can be done definitely he said i dont think 
we should look upon the united states alone to do it 
earlier in a photo session with quayle he said we feel that 
the defense forces should get their act together and get rid of mr 
noriega 
ford said he spoke briefly with bush and that the president 
repeated his position that the united states has no quarrel with 
the panamanian defense forces even apparently those that stuck 
with noriega in the coup but that the administrations goal is to 
get rid of noriega 
the may 7 election in which ford was a vice presidential 
candidate was roundly condemned by foreign governments and 
independent groups as being rigged to favor noriega but even 
still the voters overwhelmingly voted against noriegas 
candidates the observer groups said

former president reagan said in an interview 
released thursday that he favors a closer look to see if some 
compulsory retirement ages shouldnt be changed 
i think that physically people arent as old as the numbers 
indicate any more said reagan 78 in an interview 
reagan discussed retirement with peter hackes host of the 
mature focus radio program of the american association of 
retired persons the interview is scheduled for broadcast saturday 
and oct 14 on the mutual broadcasting system 
when asked what changes he thought needed to be made to 
accomodate an aging us population reagan said well i wonder 
if we shouldnt take a closer look at our various and many 
collective age retirement limits 
he said that if people are aging differently that would be a 
very major thing raising the need to see if some compulsory 
retirement ages shouldnt be changed 
under legislation passed by congress in 1986 most employes can 
no longer be forced to retire because they have reached age 70 the 
law exempted tenured university faculty members and state and local 
police officers fire fighters and prison guards for seven years 
in addition said david certner a legislative representative 
for the aarp the federal aviation administration has a rule 
barring airline pilots from flying after age 60 
some states also require judges to retire at age 70 and the 
supreme court declined on monday to review such a requirement in 
the state of pennsylvania

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan on thursday reiterated the bush administrations strong 
opposition to a move in congress to make the social security 
administration an independent agency 
this would be devastating for senior americans because it 
would disrupt services to the elderly sullivan told a national 
press club luncheon audience 
he also said it would mean the serious and legitimate concerns 
regarding care and support of our senior citizens will lose cabinet 
level advocacy 
social security is now part of the department of health and 
human services 
supporters of the proposals in congress say that making social 
security an independent federal agency would give social security 
increased visibility and would protect its trust funds from being 
tapped for other uses 
measures to make social security independent of hhs are in the 
budget reconciliation bill passed by the house on thursday and in 
the senates reconciliation bill that will be acted on soon 
if the system aint broke dont fix it sullivan said and 
we maintain that the system social security is working better 
than ever

the state department acted thursday to block a 
news conference called in new york by a visiting palestine 
liberation organization delegation to the united nations 
a us official said the conference amounted to political 
activity beyond the bounds of the visas the five plo officials 
were granted in order to enter the country from tunisia to attend 
the united nationsl general assembly 
john bolton the assistant secretary of state for international 
organizations made the determination and the state department 
notified the un secretariat of the finding said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the news conference had been scheduled by the palestine 
solidarity committee for thursday evening at the united national 
church center across from the united nations the topics included

east german media ignored reports of fights 
between police and wouldbe emigrants in dresden and officials 
concentrated thursday on dressing east berlin in banners extolling 
40 years of socialist triumph 
witnesses in dresden said police used clubs and water cannons to 
disperse thousands of people who hoped to board freedom trains 
bound for west germany with more than 7000 east germans who took 
refuge at the west german embassy in prague czechoslovakia 
it was a horrible scene said a dresden woman who asked not 
to be identified for fear of reprisals people were trying 
desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks but the police 
forced them back 
it was the second violent clash outside dresdens main railroad 
station station in two days 
official media have turned their attention to celebrations 
friday and saturday of the communist nations 40th anniversary but 
east germans are able to watch reports of the mass emigration on 
west german television 
most coverage of the emigration is devoted to criticizing west 
germany neues deutschland the communist party daily accused the 
west german government of breaking international law by harboring 
refugees in its eastern european missions 
a ranking party ideologue otto reinhold complained in a 
newspaper commentary of a hateful and slanderous campaign against 
east germany 
reinhold told western reporters thursday that east germany 
rejects a dialogue with opposition groups seeking democratic and 
economic reforms 
we have no intention to talk with any group whose foundations 
are not rooted in socialism he said 
east germanys aging leaders have rejected political and 
economic reforms similar to those in poland and hungary and are 
nervous about the liberal attitude of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who arrives friday for the anniversary ceremonies 
gorbachev is popular with many east germans who hope his 
influence will bring change to their tightly controlled society 
rolf henrich of the illegal opposition group new forum said he 
hoped gorbachev would put pressure on east german leader erich 
honecker to implement reforms 
it would be a shame if he came only to praise those whose 
policies hes trying to fight at home henrich said 
he and other opposition leaders harbor little hope that the 
gorbachev visit will bring change in the near future 
it looks like were going to have to reach rock bottom before 
we work our way up henrich said

the rocky flats nuclear arms plant which is 
under investigation by the fbi for possible criminal violation of 
environmental laws poses no imminent threat to public health the 
energy department concluded in a study released thursday 
the report raised doubts however about the accuracy of 
measured concentrations of plutonium in the air surrounding the 
364acre manufacturing complex near denver it said the air 
samplers are outofdate prone to breakdowns and not properly 
located 
the 1inchthick report based on a sixweek special 
investigation by energy department experts cited a series of 
weaknesses in rocky flats programs aimed at identifying and 
correcting serious environmental problems at the plant 
energy secretary james d watkins ordered the special assessment 
of conditions at rocky flats on june 6 the same day that dozens of 
fbi agents and environmental protection agency investigators raided 
the plant looking for evidence of illegal dumping and incineration 
of hazardous wastes a special grand jury was impaneled in denver 
on aug 1 but has not yet issued any indictments 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary told a senate 
committee thursday the fbi has provided no information about its 
investigation he said it had promised to alert the department to 
any healththreatening conditions it might find 
at a separate congressional hearing george b merrick vice 
president rockwell international corp which earlier this month 
agreed to withdraw as manager of rocky flats said his company also 
had been unable to get information on the fbi probe 
the separate energy department investigation was concluded july 
21 
no situations which pose an imminent threat to public health 
or the environment were observed the report said 
the highly technical documentation provided in the report 
painted a picture of deeprooted problems in management of rocky 
flats including poor communication and planning a lack of quality 
assurance and the absence of a comprehensive strategy for bringing 
the plant into compliance with state and federal environmental laws 
among the investigators findings 
the plants method of monitoring emissions into the open air 
from exhaust ducts are deficient these flaws may adversely 
affect determination of radioactive materials released into the 
atmosphere including plutonium it said 
no soil samples were taken after the release june 3 of a fluid 
containing the hazardous material polychlorinated biphenyl pcbs 
were banned by the government in the 1970s after laboratory tests 
determined they caused cancer in animals although the material is 
still in widespread use in electric transformers 
bags of asbestoscontaining materials are not covered with soil 
after being dumped in landfills asbestos is a fibrous material 
suspected of causing lung disease 
there are no formal procedures in place to minimize the risk of 
spills and overflows during transfers of materials from underground 
storage tanks there also is no written procedure for requiring 
constant monitoring of such transfers 
discharges from a cooling tower are allowed to form a pool of 
standing water in a courtyard between buildings eventually this 
water percolates into the ground carrying with it any contaminants 
that could enter the groundwater

futures traders and brokers who cheat their 
customers could be sued for up to three times the amount stolen 
under legislation introduced in the senate thursday 
the proposed futures trading practices act of 1989 also would 
hold retail brokerages liable for customer losses caused by 
wrongdoing of the floor broker it picked to handle the customers 
trade 
our futures markets work only if people have confidence in 
them said sen patrick leahy dvt one of the bills sponsors 
leahy chairman of the senate agriculture nutrition and 
forestry committee said he will hold a hearing on the proposal 
oct 17 
in the past nine months the futures industry has suffered 
what some have called a nervous breakdown he said citing the 
indictment of more than 40 traders and brokers on the nations two 
largest futures exchanges these events add up to one inescapable 
conclusion the system is not working 
the bill was cosponsored by sen richard g lugar rind the 
committees ranking republican 
the greatest thing that the commodity exchanges in our country 
have to offer is expertise and integrity said lugar who joined 
leahy at a news conference announcing the bills introduction 
turning aside previous criticism that the bills strict 
recordkeeping requirements will drive the futures market overseas 
lugar said my fear is if we do not pursue the stateoftheart 
to the ultimate other nations will 
the bill also beefs up the funding and the enforcement powers of 
the federal agency that oversees futures markets the commodity 
futures trading commission 
under the bill the cftc budget would increase 60 percent over 
the next five years going from 41 million next year to 66 
million in fiscal year 1994 
a reauthorization bill passed by the house last month would only 
cover the next two fiscal years going to 445 million in 1991 
cftc appropriations for 1989 were 347 million 
the bill also expanded cftc power to collect service fees for 
monitoring the exchanges to ensure their trading practices are 
honest

antiabortion activist randall terry began 
serving what could be a twoyear jail sentence thursday after 
saying he would not pay two 500 fines for trespassing and unlawful 
assembly 
judge john bruner of fulton county state court suspended two 
oneyear sentences on condition that terry founder of the new 
yorkbased operation rescue pay the fine up front and stay out 
of the atlanta metropolitan area for two years 
in good conscience i cannot pay the fine terry told the 
judge in a courtroom packed so full that some spectators sat on 
others laps 
thats entirely up to you sir bruner replied 
terry who rode an elevator to the courthouse basement with a 
deputy who carried his overnight bag only nodded when asked if he 
was going to jail 
atlanta lawyer jay sekulow who said he would handle terrys 
appeal said there were no immediate plans to post a 2000 appeal 
bond which would free terry until the matter is resolved 
that isnt to say there wont be an appeal sekulow said 
terry who is not a lawyer but acted as his own attorney was 
one of 139 people arrested july 19 1988 outside the atlanta 
surgicenter where abortions are done the gathering was one of 
the demonstrations that began during the democratic national 
convention and continued into the fall resulting in more than 
1200 arrests 
terry asked bruner for leniency saying he already had spent 12 
days in jail after the arrests the maximum penalty was a year in 
jail and a fine of 1000 on each of the two charges 
terry attempted several times to defend his activities as 
intended to stop the killing of unborn children bruner stressed 
that this issue was not before the court im not going to be 
preached to he said sharply i dont want another sermon 
bruner said he would consider cutting the sentence from two 
years to one based on a recent georgia court of appeals ruling that 
a person cannot be convicted of criminal trespassing and unlawful 
assembly in the same incident 
before the sentencing tom pocock a jail administrator 
testified that the 139 arrested spent a total of 1001 days in jail 
at a cost to the county of more than 41000 
during crossexamination of margie pitts hames the clinics 
attorney terry tried to establish that she and others had objected 
to a speedy resolution of the cases and thus were responsible for 
the high costs 
im not very impressed with any of this bruner said 
later ms hames said she thought the sentence was fair 
it serves no purpose to send him to jail she said if he 
chooses not to pay the fine then it is his choice to go to jail i 
assume his flock will raise the money to have him out of there in 
24 hours 
david andrews executive vice president of planned parenthood in 
new york said i am delighted to receive the news that justice 
has been served in the case of operation rescue terrorist randall 
terry 
operation rescue activists try to blockade entrances to clinics 
where abortions are performed and persuade women often through use 
of graphic photographs not to have abortions 
the group says more than 34000 of its activists have been 
arrested since it was founded in november 1987

the man directing the federal effort to assist 
victims of hurricane hugo defended his agency thursday saying that 
while it has been stretched to the limit much has been done and 
the government will continue working until the storm is just a bad 
memory 
this has been an extremely horrendous disaster far above what 
we would expect to see in decades in the united states said 
grant c peterson associate director of the federal emergency 
management agency 
we are strained absolutely to the limit but i think were 
where we should be said peterson responding to criticism that 
his agency has been slow and bureaucratic 
after leaving a trail of disaster across puerto rico and the 
virgin islands hugo hit the coast sept 21 damaging and 
destroying homes businesses schools and municipal buildings in 
both south and north carolina 
peterson said his agency has 19 field offices open in south 
carolina is taking calls on 20 tollfree hotlines is using a 
singlepage form to accept requests for assistance and generally is 
processing these requests and issuing checks within four or five 
days 
the agency could not begin its response until governors asked 
for a presidential disaster declaration said peterson but once 
that was done fema called in the defense department for assistance 
and immediately took action he said 
asked to respond to critics of his agency peterson said that 
their comments are unfortunate and have added nothing to the 
recovery effort 
the leading congressional critic of femas response sen ernest 
f hollings dsc said he was unconvinced 
he called the agency a totally inept outfit with the 
unmitigated gall to come forward and say on oct 5 two weeks after 
the disaster that were doing a grand job and we havent even 
opened up in 10 disaster counties 
hollings also said he sent a letter to president bush on 
thursday asking him to inform fema that the federal government 
should assume 100 percent of the reimbursement of the cost of 
relief in the wake of hugo 
his letter quoted the law as saying the federal share of 
assistance shall not be less than 75 percent he said that at every 
corner of the cleanup effort there is a fema percentage wrangle 
rather than assistance 
noting that some members of congress have called for a general 
accounting office investigation of femas disaster effort peterson 
quipped that when the agency saw the storm coming ashore it knew 
that hugo would be accompanied by two things a gao investigation 
and congressional hearings we welcome both he said 
but peterson said let us be forthright nobody can recreate 
life in the caribbean or the carolinas exactly as it was before 
hugo 
hugo packed a powerful and deadly punch it is likely to be 
the most devastating natural disaster in decades and perhaps this 
century making things right will not happen overnight it will 
take time patience and mutual support and you have our dedicated 
commitment that all that can be done will be done peterson 
said

to some poles who gathered at the west 
german embassy this week to see off east german refugees it was 
strictly business 
sniffing a bargain more than a dozen poles were on hand 
thursday to look over east german cars being abandoned by the 
refugees and maybe buy one for peanuts 
it is a real bargain said one man at the embassy late in 
the day as the last refugees were being boarded onto buses to 
deliver them to the train to west germany 
you can buy a trabant for 400 or 500 marks 200 or 250 and 
someone bought a trabant that had a suitcase in the trunk with a 
portable stereo inside he paid only 450 dms 225 said the 
man who like other prospective buyers refused to give his name 
the trabant is an east german compact model car 
east german refugees who traveled to poland by car all had to 
leave their vehicles at least temporarily because the only 
transport to west germany was by special train most refugees 
turned over their car keys to embassy officials and the west 
german auto club was to arrange to transport the vehicles to west 
germany later 
but some east germans apparently preferred a bit of hard 
currency now rather than the uncertain prospect of having their car 
delivered sometime later besides the tiny east german trabants 
would not be the car of choice in west germany where powerful 
mercedes and bmws rule the highways and cow smallcar drivers 
on the polish car market a used trabant usually costs around 
1100 
bargains were also reported in other makes a used sovietmade 
lada samara which normally costs about 3500 went for 500 
according to one pole standing outside the embassy 
the wouldbe buyers showed no trace of remorse for taking 
advantage of the refugees they said the shoe was on the other foot 
when poles fled their homeland following the imposition of martial 
law in 1981 
this is just the same thing as with polish cars in austria in 
the past said one they also had to sell their cars for 
nothing

despite strong us protests the french 
government plans to trade brazil sensitive rocket technology that 
could be used by us enemies to make ballistic missiles 
government and industry officials said thursday 
france has promised to give brazil the technology of a liquid 
fuel motor called viking which powers the ariane space launch 
vehicle the officials said in return the french company 
arianespace would be awarded a 60 million contract for the launch 
of two brazilian communications satellites they added 
the us officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
said french president francois mitterrand personally made the 
decision to give the technology to brazil promising that 
safeguards would be placed to prevent use of the motor for lethal 
purposes 
but a statement issued by the government in paris denied a final 
decision had been made the definitive contract will be submitted 
to the government for approval and this contract has not yet been 
given to the government the statement said 
this contract will have to follow certain purposes and 
restrictions regarding technology transfers it said 
the united states however is doubtful such safeguards can be 
implemented effectively 
if someone like libya wants to use this motor to harmful 
purposes who will stop them asked one official 
libya has been seeking to buy from brazil equipment and knowhow 
in an effort to develop a ballistic missile arsenal capable of 
delivering chemical weapon warheads according to us experts 
brazil one of an estimated 20 third world countries which have 
some form of ballistic missile capability has been exporting some 
missile technology while and attempting to develop a more accurate 
and sophisticated arsenal of its own 
word of the planned french sale was first reported by signal 
magazine published by the armed forces communications and 
electronic association 
representatives of mcdonnell douglas corp the st louisbased 
firm competing for the brazilian launch contract against 
arianespace were informed of the french proosal by brazilian 
officials and conveyed the information to the defense department 
officials said 
a spokesman for mcdonnell douglas bob obrien said that if the 
french transfer is made obviously it wouldnt enhance our 
chances to win the contract he said brazil had been expected to 
announce its decision already but has not done so yet 
the united states first protested the planned french sale last 
july during the sevennation economic summit in paris one official 
said 
for while it appeared the protest had stopped the french plan 
the official said but the french government reconsidered when it 
appeared france stood to lose the lucrative satellite launch 
contract he said 
the united states has warned france the technology transfer 
would violate the missile technology control regime a 1987 
agreement to stem the proliferation of such weapons of which 
france is a signatory the official said 
but france contends the viking motor will be used for peacefull 
purposes and would not violate the agreement 
the united states is still reviewing whether it can stop the 
deal the official said

washington ap energy secretary james d watkins said thursday 
hell ask seven states to store radioactive waste from a colorado 
nuclear weapons plant threatened with shutdown unless waste sites 
are found by march 
watkins said he had not yet selected the states but they 
apparently would include colorado and idaho and possibly new 
mexico nevada and washington which are key links in the energy 
departments troubled nuclear weapons complex 
the two other nearest states with nuclear weapons sites are 
texas and california 
in testimony before the senate energy and natural resources 
committee watkins said he must ask the states to accept the waste 
totalling as much as 4900 cubic yards over a twoyear period 
starting next march 1 because a planned permanent waste dump in 
new mexico cannot be opened until next july at the earliest 
the new mexico repository was supposed to have opened a year ago 
but has been repeatedly delayed by a series of environmental 
technical and regulatory problems 
watkins said he expected the problem of finding a temporary 
storage site for the rocky flats weapons plant waste to become a 
very contentious issue as he begins outlining his sevenstate 
plan with governors and members of congress next week 
people are going to say not in my state watkins said 
adding that perhaps there are seven states out there willing to 
help ease the waste crunch 
eddie binder a spokesman for new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
said the governors position as stated two weeks ago had not 
changed at that time carruthers said theres no way ill 
accept any other waste than what is already in this state for 
temporary storage 
the waste generated at rocky flats near denver is contaminated 
with plutonium which remains radioactive for 240000 years the 
plant recovers plutonium from retired nuclear weapons and 
reprocesses it to make triggers for new ones 
colorado gov roy romer has set a wasteaccumulation limit at 
rocky flats that watkins said will be reached by march 1 romer has 
said that after that date additional waste will have to be shipped 
elsewhere or rocky flats will be closed down 
idaho had been storing part of the rocky flats waste but gov 
cecil andrus on sept 1 closed his states borders to further 
shipments in protest of the energy departments failure to open the 
800 million waste isolation pilot project a planned permanent 
repository in salt caverns near carlsbad nm 
watkins said he had received a letter from washington gov booth 
gardner that said in essence dont look my way in seeking a 
temporary waste storage site he added later however that he had 
received some informal indications from some unspecified states 
that they might consider dropping their opposition if a multistate 
agreement was reached to spread the waste burden 
on a related subject watkins said his department was about to 
release the results of an internal investigation at rocky flats 
that concluded there were no accidental nuclear reactions at the 
plant situated about 18 miles northwest of denver 
the possibility of an inadvertent chain reaction had arisen 
earlier this year following the discovery of manmade radioactive 
elements produced only by splitting atoms there are atomsplitting 
reactors at the plant but the presence of manmade radioactive 
elements could have been explained by piling too much plutonium 
close together 
watkins offered no details beyond saying the departments 
investigation had found no evidence of a chain reaction at rocky 
flats his chief adviser on nuclear waste leo duffy told 
reporters later that the probe did uncover management problems at 
rocky flats and some safety practices that needed to be corrected 
he did not elaborate 
watkins also told the senate committee he was creating an office 
of nuclear safety to provide independent oversight of safety at the 
weapons plants he said the office would have the authority to 
impose fines for safety violations

deadlocked house and senate negotiators 
decided thursday to give the food and drug administration 
conflicting advice over whether it should ban the food additive red 
dye no 3 as a cancercausing substance 
if i were in the fda i would be totally confused said sen 
wyche fowler dga who had urged fellow conferees to instruct the 
agency to follow existing law in deciding whether to ban the dye 
that gives maraschino cherries their brilliant color 
senate conferees accepted fowlers amendment but their house 
counterparts led by rep jamie whitten dmiss refused to budge 
from the house position that the fda should conduct further studies 
of the food additive before deciding whether to ban it 
fowler demanded a recorded vote but whitten the house 
appropriations committee chairman who has been in congress since 
1941 insisted that appropriations conferences never resolve their 
disputes by voting 
in the end the two sides agreed to include both the house and 
senate language in the conference managers report which does not 
carry the force of law but usually is followed by the agency 
involved 
we will have another day fowler said after the conference 
on the 421 billion spending bill for rural development 
agriculture and related agencies spending bill moved on to other 
issues 
the controversy over red dye no 3 dates back to 1960 when 
congress first called for a ban on foods that cause cancer in 
laboratory animals the dye was put on a provisional list that 
permitted it to remain on the market for two years pending further 
study 
since 1962 fowler said the fda has granted some 40 extensions 
of the provisional listing to try to give the industry every 
opportunity to show this is not a carcinogenic agent they have 
failed to do so 
the fda decided in 1984 to remove red dye no 3 from the 
provisional list after tests showed that it caused cancer in 
animals but that decision was overruled by thensecretary of 
health and human services margaret heckler

army engineers on bulldozers began 
rebuilding sand dunes thursday along south carolinas 
hurricaneravaged coast preparing for abnormally high tides later 
this month 
about 550 soldiers and marines hauled sand in 100 dump trucks to 
build up eight miles of dunes between myrtle beach and pawleys 
island where the high tides arriving oct 14 pose the greatest 
threat of erosion said corps of engineers spokeswoman carol todd 
the moons closest approach to earth in years will push tides at 
least 2 feet above the normal 5foot range and northeasterly winds 
could push them even higher the dunes are the only shield for 
seaside homes and businesses 
gov carroll campbell said he hopes to have 65 miles of dunes 
rebuilt along south carolinas 187mile coast before that time 
damage estimates from hurricane hugo meanwhile have soared to 
at least 4 billion and officials considered increasing the 
gasoline tax to pay cleanup costs 
in pawleys island 20 miles south of myrtle beach residents did 
not wait for federal aid to begin rebuilding dunes the island was 
sliced in half by hurricane hugo and dozens of homes were damaged 
or destroyed 
weve had experience with the bureaucratic way said hassie 
forrester one of 16 landowners who hired a contractor to bulldoze 
new dunes in front of their homes were told one thing one day 
and another the next thats why were going ahead 
at least 30 other residents have signed up for the contractors 
services he said 
hugo hit the coast sept 21 leaving at least 18 dead in south 
carolina and damaging and destroying homes businesses schools 
and municipal buildings in all 29 people were killed on the us 
mainland and at least 33 in the caribbean 
damage initially estimated in south carolina at 3 billion is 
now estimated at between 4 billion and 5 billion campbell said 
thursday 
it will cost an estimated 2147 million to clean up the debris 
and wreckage left behind by the storm the state expects to pay 25 
percent with the federal government covering the rest 
the state highways and public transportation commission said it 
would consider raising the gasoline tax one penny per gallon to pay 
for the cleanup campbell said he didnt like that idea and would 
first shift money from other programs 
it may well be down the road we need revenue i dont know 
he said 
ten miles outside charleston the corps worked to repair the 
toppled ben sawyer bridge the only link between the mainland and 
isle of palms and sullivans island 
on wednesday the swing bridge was pulled out of the 
intracoastal waterway where one end had been at a 45degree angle 
since the storm 
a broken cable prevented barges from positioning the bridge back 
on the road and workers predicted the span would not open to 
traffic until friday 
the american red cross meanwhile announced that only seven 
evacuation shelters housing 454 people are still open around the 
state since the storm approached 453 shelters had housed 87230 
people 
about twothirds of south carolina electric amp gas cos 150000 
customers in the charleston area have power and almost all 
customers in other areas of the state are on line officials said 
charleston mayor joseph j riley jr said power was restored to 
enough of the city to eliminate a curfew from 9 pm to 5 am

a woman accused of helping engineer her 
husbands helicopter escape from a colorado prison was sentenced 
thursday to one to three years in prison for her role in a chase 
and shootout that followed 
i only want to say that im truly sorry patricia a 
gonzales said before her sentencing my intentions were not to 
hurt anyone i just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong 
time 
mrs gonzales 41 pleaded no contest last month to a reduced 
charge of being an accessory to a felony in a plea bargain with 
nebraska authorities 
phelps county district judge stephen r illingworth said he was 
not imposing the maximum fiveyear sentence because mrs gonzales 
was not involved in any shooting or driving the vehicle used in the 
chase 
mrs gonzales her husband frederico gonzales and another 
couple were arrested aug 18 after a bulletpunctuated chase in 
this southcentral nebraska town 
the shootout occurred about eight hours after gonzales and ralph 
p brown fled from the arkansas valley correctional facility in 
ordway colo in a helicopter 
colorado authorities also have issued arrest warrants for the 
two couples charging the men with escape and their wives with 
kidnapping and aiding an escape 
phelps county attorney glenn clark said mrs gonzales probably 
will be extradited to colorado in the next two months 
in nebraska brown and gonzales were originally charged with 
attempted murder use of a firearm to commit a felony and being 
felons in possession of a firearm the women were originally 
charged with attempted murder and using a firearm to commit a 
felony 
gonzales waived his preliminary hearing in phelps county court 
on wednesday after reaching a plea agreement in which he will plead 
guilty to a reduced charge of being an accessory to a felony clark 
said the state agreed to dismiss the rest of the charges 
brown and his wife rebecca brown were being held at a jail 
here and are in the process of appealing various rulings

white house aide richard c breeden the 
presidents choice to head the securities and exchange commission 
spent thursday taking congratulatory calls on his senate 
confirmation and planning when he would take office 
breedens nomination was approved by the senate on a voice vote 
late wednesday night hours after he was unanimously recommended by 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee 
technically breeden is replacing departing sec member charles 
c cox but he is expected to be named by president bush after he 
is sworn in to head the agency that oversees securities markets 
regulates the sale of stocks bonds and stock options and enforces 
securities laws 
david ruder the previous chairman returned to teaching law at 
northwestern university on sept 30 
in the interim bush has appointed sec member edward h 
fleischman as acting chairman 
breeden 39 has served bush in a variety of capacities most 
recently as an architect of the legislation that helped bail out 
the nations ailing savings and loan industry 
breeden sailed through confirmation hearings before the banking 
committee last month explaining that while he held a free market 
philosophy he also believed in strict enforcement of securities 
laws 
he told the committee that illegal activities such as price 
fixing or insider trading are an attack on the market itself 
in lengthier answers to written questions from senate staffers 
breeden a 1975 graduate of harvard law school said vigorous 
prosecution of securities law violators is one of the most 
effective means to increase individual investor confidence and 
participation in the stock market 
from 198285 breeden was deputy counsel to thenvice president 
bush 
he was a banking specialist with a new york law firm before 
that and between government assignments worked in the washington 
office of a houston law firm

the soviet union will be unable by 1991 to mount a 
surprise attack if mikhail s gorbachev makes his promised cuts in 
conventional military forces the international institute for 
strategic studies said thursday 
the situation is already in the process of significant 
change the institute said in the military balance 198990 its 
annual survey of military forces the unilateral reductions will 
once complete virtually eliminate the surpriseattack threat which 
has so long concerned nato planners 
after the cutbacks it would take the soviets one to two weeks 
to marshal the forces for an attack institute director francois 
heisbourg told a news conference wednesday 
in shorthand that translates as no surprise attack he 
said soviet withdrawals from eastern europe now under way include 
units needed in lightning attacks heisbourg added 
tass the official soviet news agency carried a lengthy 
dispatch on the institutes report 
in a speech to the united nations on dec 7 gorbachev promised 
to reduce the soviet armed forces by 500000 troops and to 
eliminate 10000 tanks 8500 artillery pieces and 800 combat 
aircraft by 1991 
the institute said it discovered because the kremlin answered 
its questions for the first time that the soviet union had 6700 
more main battle tanks than previously estimated bringing the 
total to about 60000 it said the additional tanks probably were 
in storage 
the sovietled warsaw pacts huge tank force is a key element in 
what the 16nation nato alliance calls its overwhelming numerical 
superiority in conventional forces the institutes new survey 
showed nato with 34400 tanks and the warsaw with 78200 
of these nato has 21900 tanks deployed and the warsaw pact 
58500 the survey said 
troop levels excluding reserves were shown as about equal in 
the area with nato having 224 million active service personnel 
compared with 23 for the warsaw pact 
the survey said the longrange strategic nuclear arsenals of the 
united states and soviet union remained in rough parity 
institute officials said their estimates of conventional forces 
did not include soviet cutbacks since gorbachev announced the 
planned reductions 
heisbourg gave no figures for withdrawals so far but said the 
soviets have begun pulling out crack units and that moscow had said 
frontline divisions deployed in east germany would be withdrawn 
some of these divisions are divisions which any nato planner 
would like to see removed heisbourg said but he cautioned that 
the soviets would be capable of major sustained offensive 
operations even after the promised cutbacks 
he said the warsaw pact had been weakened by political upheaval 
and disagreement with poland and hungary implementing sweeping 
reforms and east germany sticking to communism both reformers and 
hardliners have maintained military ties with moscow but relations 
are strained heisbourg said 
it would be a very hardy analyst who would consider hungary 
and east germany still to be allies in any meaningful sense he 
told the news conference 
the institute is an international nongovernmental center for 
research on security and arms control it is financed by private 
foundations membership fees and sales of its publications

louisiana officials will try to persuade a 
panel of federal judges friday to revive state laws that could 
sentence doctors who perform abortions to prison for 10 years 
but state attorney general william guste said police wont be 
hauling physicians off to jail any time soon no matter what the 
three judges rule after fridays hearing 
either way the decision goes friday it will be appealed 
everybody knows that guste said in an interview earlier this 
week 
guste and new orleans district attorney harry connick will ask 
the panel of us district court judges to lift a 1976 injunction 
prohibiting enforcement of three louisiana antiabortion laws 
including one making abortion a crime 
fighting the effort will be the american civil liberties union 
louisiana is a major battle ground said shirley peddler 
director of louisianas aclu chapter it is the first state to 
try to criminalize abortion even without grounds to do so 
guste said the intent of the case is to get the question before 
the us supreme court and settle once and for all whether the 
justices will overturn roe vs wade the 1973 decision establishing 
a womans right to an abortion 
connick who has declined comment on the matter this week 
started the effort to revive the louisiana laws in july shortly 
after a us supreme court ruling upheld restrictions on abortions 
in missouri 
both connick and guste who joined the case later said the 
ruling in the missouri case was a signal that the supreme court may 
be willing to overturn roe vs wade 
why not find out where we stand instead of waiting for another 
shoe to fall he said in a july 11 interview 
womens rights groups have attacked connick and guste saying 
their efforts to lift the injunction could turn back the clock on 
womens rights 
michelle gross of the national organization for womens new 
orleans chapter said connick was guilty of political grandstanding 
mr connick doesnt care anything about women he doesnt care 
anything about fetuses he cares about harry connick she said 
the 1976 injunction prohibited enforcement of three laws deemed 
unconstitutional in light of roe vs wade 
one law prohibited performing an abortion and called for 
violators to spend one to 10 years in prison the second prohibited 
advertising abortion services and provided for a maximum oneyear 
prison term and a 500 fine the third prohibited distribution of 
any drug or device designed for use in performing abortions the 
penalty for violation is six months in prison and a 500 fine 
the missouri abortion law upheld in july banned abortions in 
public hospitals and stopped public employees from counseling women 
about abortions it also required doctors planning to perform 
abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks old to determine if 
it could live outside the womb despite the roe vs wade standard 
that said a woman is entitled to an abortion until the fetus has 
reached 24 weeks 
guste said the ruling in the missouri case changes the basis for 
judicial review of abortion laws if the state can show a 
rational basis for such laws the laws can be upheld he said 
in louisiana he said that rational basis exists in civil 
and criminal statutes giving fetuses all the rights of any 
louisiana citizen from the time of conception 
the supreme court already has agreed to study abortion disputes 
from minnesota ohio and illinois 
minnesota and ohio laws require doctors to notify parents of 
unmarried minors who seek an abortion an illinois law would 
require abortion clinics where the overwhelming majority of 
abortions are performed to provide services and equipment now 
found only in hospitals

health secretary louis sullivan said thursday 
the country needs a new ethic of personal responsibility to do 
what government cannot do in the battle against aids drug abuse 
and other problems 
only when individuals themselves realize that they are 
responsible for their own behavior only when they work to 
strengthen qualities of character like motivation selfcontrol and 
selfdiscipline will we be able to put a halt to aids as well as 
other selfdestructive behaviors like drug abuse teen pregnancy 
and homicide sullivan said 
he said americans deperately need to cultivate a new ethic 
of personal responsibility a new culture of character he said 
at a national press club luncheon 
such a change cannot come from a federal law or regulation he 
said but must be fostered by public as well as private 
institutions including neighborhood organizations fraternal 
lodges schools and churches 
these social institutions will play the paramount role in 
shaping personal values in a free nation he said

a new ethanolbased fuel additive that 
president bush brought to public attention this summer got a boost 
from a senate committee that approved a tax break estimated to cost 
the government up to 550 million 
the senate finance committee voted 128 early wednesday morning 
to insert into its huge budget reconciliation bill the tax break 
for a blend of gasoline and ethyl tertiary butyl ether or etbe 
the tax break could make it more economical for oil companies to 
make the ether additive from ethanol rather than methanol a 
product of natural gas according to the renewable fuels 
association a group that promotes ethanol use 
that would benefit the farm belt as etbe manufacturing could 
require as much as 50 million bushels of corn a year the group 
estimates 
bush touted the additive during a trip to nebraska in june 
where he drove a etbepowered car following the announcement of 
his cleanair legislation bush has proposed requiring the sale of 
a million cleanfuel cars in the nations nine most polluted cities 
etbe improves engine performance while reducing harmful 
emissions experts say 
the reconciliation bill still must be approved by the full 
senate and a housesenate conference committee the house has not 
approved a similar tax break 
sen tom daschle dsd had trouble getting the measure 
through the senate committee because of concerns about whom would 
get the tax savings and the estimates of lost revenue according to 
daschles staff 
aides to the finance committee and the joint committee on 
taxation said the government could lose as much as 550 million 
over five years and that most of the savings would go to one 
company illinoisbased archer daniels midland 
albert buckberg an economist with the joint committee declined 
to say thursday whether archer daniels would be the main 
beneficiary of the tax break but noted that it is the nations 
biggest ethanol manufacturer 
renewable fuels lobbyist bob dinneen said thursday its not a 
tax break thats going to benefit any one company adding that 
the committtees revenue estimates are absurd 
etbe will be manufactured only by oil companies because a key 
ingredient isobutylene is a byproduct of refining petroleum he 
said 
he said the tax break would cost no more than 100 million over 
five years 
archer daniels chief spokesman richard burket was out of the 
office and no other company officials were available for comment 
thursday 
the internal revenue service had been asked to rule 
administratively that etbe was entitled to the same tax break as 
ethanolblended gasoline 60 cents per gallon of additive 
irs attorneys could not agree whether the agency could take that 
action according to a treasury department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity

running skirmishes with helmeted riot police who fired tear gas 
grenades and used water cannon mounted on armored trucks to break 
up the groups 
on oct 5 1988 voters rejected a proposal that pinochet who 
seized power in a 1973 coup remain president until 1997 the 
result obliged the rightwing military president to call elections

protests 
skirmishes persisted for hours 
police said 15 bombs exploded wednesday night causing a brief

million of chiles 12 million people reside 
targets included eight highvoltage power towers five bank

government television asked viewers thursday night 
to provide any information they have on raoul wallenberg a swedish 
diplomat who saved 100000 hungarian jews from the nazis and is 
said to have died in a soviet prison camp 
contrary to previous soviet practice the report on the evening 
news program vremya did not dismiss rumors that wallenberg may be 
alive and even noted that the kremlin version of his fate had 
varied over the years 
wallenberg arrived in budapest hungary in july 1944 on a 
ussponsored mission to save jews and disappeared after the red 
army swept into the hungarian capital in january 1945 the case has 
been an irritant in swedishsoviet relations 
moscow replied in a rather contradictory way to official 
inquiries about him from stockholm first that he was alive and 
well and in good hands then that he was not on soviet territory at 
all and finally that raoul wallenberg died in 1947 in a jail cell 
at the lubyanka kgb prison of a myocardial infarction vremya 
acknowledged 
in september 1988 soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov told a news briefing the soviets arrested wallenberg in 
budapest in 1945 for reasons now unknown that he died in a soviet 
prison in july 1947 and was cremated without an autopsy 
in its report vremya said wallenbergs sister had heard reports 
in the west that he might still be alive and was flying to moscow 
nina lagergren asks all soviet people that if anyone knows 
anything about raoul wallenberg to call and report it vremya 
said it gave a moscow telephone number that it said belonged to 
the raoul wallenberg society 
i hope to get true information about his fate from the soviet 
people wallenbergs sister said in an interview taped at the 
stockholm airport he saved thousands of people and regardless 
of what happened 45 years ago im convinced hes alive 
despite soviet insistence that he died in prison reports 
persist that wallenberg has been seen in soviet jails swedish 
author kenne fant in a recently published book on wallenberg said 
he spoke to a very trustworthy source who heard of a prisoner 
in the soviet union who must be wallenberg 
fant said the prisoner was seen in 1986 in a labor camp at 
blagoveshchenka an area closed to foreigners 200 miles southeast 
of novosibirsk siberia 
fant also cited sources in the united states who said wallenberg 
was treated for a heart ailment in hospitals in moscow and 
leningrad in 1982 and 1983 
andrei d sakharov the soviet human rights advocate reported 
in an article earlier this year that he had searched the area 
around moscow for evidence of wallenberg but found nothing

premier michel rocards government won a battle 
with prison guards who gave up a weeklong strike but tens of 
thousands of civil servants marched in the capital thursday in 
another labor dispute 
in eastern france police went to a peugeot auto plant in case 
they were ordered to expel militants and the government appointed 
a labor expert to mediate the strike 
unions representing nurses police officers firefighters and 
public transport workers have either threatened walkouts or staged 
short work stoppages this week 
rocard a socialist told the national assembly on wednesday 
that the disputes were worrisome very worrisome in some 
respects but far from being catastrophic 
the justice ministry said most of the 15000 prison guards who 
struck sept 27 had heeded a union leaders call to return to work 
jacques vialottes head of one of the four unions representing 
the guards declared the walkout a failure since the government had 
refused steadfastly to negotiate higher overtime pay 
the government had sent in riot police to assure no prisoners 
escaped and to break up crowds of strikers blocking gates at 
several prisons 
i no longer want to send my boys into a danger zone 
vialottes said we will find another solution 
about 30000 civil servants from the finance ministry marched 
through central paris to rocards office to press their demands for 
higher pay and better working conditions 
finance minister pierre beregovoy said he will meet with union 
leaders friday to address their demands 
the strike began in june when tax collectors walked out their 
union says uncollected taxes have cost the government at least 55 
billion in sales taxes alone 
striking peugeot metalworkers welcomed the appointment of labor 
expert francis blanchard who will try to resolve the impasse 
between the workers and company president jacques calvet 
calvet has refused to negotiate with strikers at factories in 
mulhouse and sochaux as long as they disrupt production 
peugeot called on police thursday to uphold a court order that 
several hundred strikers in mulhouse vacate a forge they had 
occupied for about a week 
calvet says peugeot cannot afford a pay raise of more than 38 
percent this year if the company is to modernize its plants and 
compete with japanese automakers 
but this argument lost some credibility among workers after 
french newspapers reported that in 1988 calvet received a raise of 
46 percent over two years for a salary of about 335000

anatoly karpov adjourned with a winning advantage 
against fellow soviet artur yusupov in the third round of the world 
chess championship candidates semifinal thursday after yusupov 
blundered in a dominating position experts said 
in the second semifinal jan timman of the netherlands and 
british grandmaster jon speelman drew a wild 47move game in the 
third round of the world chess championship candidates semifinal 
to leave timman leading by two points to one 
karpov and yusupov were tied 11 after two games but chess 
analysts said they expected yusupov to resign before play resumes 
in the adjourned position on friday a victory would move karpov 
into a 21 lead in the eightgame contest 
tension rose during the sixth and final hour of play at the 
sadlers wells ballet theater as yusupov playing white seemed to 
be closing in on a brilliant giantkilling victory over karpov who 
held the world title for 10 years from 1975 until 1985 
but with both players short of time yusupovs nerve appeared to 
snap and on the 59th move he dramatically threw away a bishop 
when play adjourned two moves later mihai suba a romanian 
grandmaster who defected to britain last year said karpov had 100 
percent winning chances 
the winner of the candidatess cycle will challenge world 
champion garri kasparov for his title in a 24game match beginning 
october 1990 the winners of the semifinals will face off in the 
candidates final in london next march 
a win scores one point and a draw a half 
playing white yusupov gave up a rook for a bishop and two pawns 
on the 16th move to open up the defenses around karpovs king 
but from moves 20 to 30 karpov unraveled his position and gained 
a big advantage when he entrenched a knight in the center 
at move 34 kasparov telephoned the championship press room from 
france to check on developments and pronounced karpovs position as 
winning 
but karpov allowed yusupov to exchange queens and relieve the 
pressure and in the fifth hour of play yusupov won a third pawn 
and began to throw two passed pawns up the board 
as the pawns continued their relentless advance grandmasters 
huddled around video monitors and predicted a yusupov victory 
with his back to the wall karpov produced a tricky 52nd move 
defense activating the rook that eventually seized whites bishop 
after he screwed up karpov defended very well said british 
grandamster nigel short the thirdranked player in the world 
the timmanspeelman encounter was a hardfought battle riddled 
with tactical tricks 
experts said speelman playing black had gained an advantage in 
the early middlegame but missed his way in the complications and 
led timman gain a dangerous initiative 
the dutch grandmaster sacrificed a knight to rip open speelmans 
kings defenses but the englishman beat back the attack to hold a 
draw 
the fourth round will be played saturday

miss deluca said the boy then told the class to go sit with

sexual assault counselors and 
womens groups reacted with anger and disbelief thursday to a 
jurys acquittal of a rape suspect on the grounds that the woman 
wore a lace miniskirt without underwear 
its a fairly horrendous verdict said ellen vargyas at the 
national womens law center in washington dc no one 
regardless of how they are dressed should be allowed to be raped 
under a knife 
the three male and three female broward circuit court jurors 
publicly justified their verdict wednesday to acquit a 26yearold 
drifter who then was ordered returned to georgia to face several 
rape and assault charges 
we felt she asked for it for the way she was dressed said 
jury foreman roy diamond the way she was dressed with that 
skirt you could see everything she had she was advertising for 
sex 
she was obviously dressed for a good time but we felt she may 
have bit off more than she could chew said juror mary bradshaw 
the detective who handled the initial phase of the case called 
the acquittal very disappointing 
i honestly believe as a police officer that he raped her that 
he forcibly had sex with her said detective tom white of the 
indian river county sheriffs department 
the 22yearold woman testified that steven lord abducted her at 
knifepoint from a fort lauderdale restaurant parking lot in 
november 1988 and raped her repeatedly during a trip north on 
interstate 95 she said she escaped five hours later in indian 
river county about 120 miles north 
defense attorney tim day told jurors the woman agreed to have 
sex with lord in exchange for 100 and cocaine but later changed 
her mind 
jurors said they also were swayed by the womans calm demeanor 
in court compared to the emotional testimony of a 24yearold 
georgia woman who claims lord raped her at knifepoint last year 
when the georgia woman testified my heart sank said juror 
dean medeiros but when the other one testified she didnt 
appear to be shaken up basically we didnt believe her story 
i thought this was 1989 said alexander siegel attorney for 
the woman who was jailed six days in june after failing to answer 
subpoenas for court appearances i guess this means every pervert 
and nut out there has a license to rape any person who dresses in a 
manner they think is provocative 
the whole idea that a woman is asking for it is horrendous 
said dorothea gallagher of the national organization for womens 
broward county chapter 
several activists noted that rape suspects often use the 
argument of a victims attire or mannerisms for their defense in 
1984 four men in new bedford mass were convicted of a barroom 
gang rape after a widely publicized trial that included allegations 
the woman enticed the men the incident was the basis for the movie 
the accused 
this verdict tells women that if they dress in a certain way 
or go alone into a bar they are somehow open for assault said 
joanne richter director of the broward county sexual assualt 
treatment division in fort lauderdale 
with this type of attitude they should close the beaches in 
fort lauderdale said christine edmunds spokewoman for the 
washingtonbased national organization for victim assistance 
sally goldfarb staff attorney at the now legal defense and 
education fund in new york believes the jurors sentiments are not 
unusual although few make such public posttrial comments 
in most rape trials its the victim not the suspect thats 
on trial said ms goldfarb theres a perception that nice 
women dont get raped nice women dont go certain places and nice 
women dont wear certain clothes these attitudes are still 
very much alive among both men and women

former housing secretary samuel r pierce jr 
urged an aide to arrange financing for a new york city project 
after receiving a written appeal from another reagan administration 
official documents released thursday show 
pierces handwritten instruction to former executive assistant 
deborah gore dean to check into this and try to get it through 
suggests a more active role than pierce has acknowledged in 
securing federal housing subsidies for individuals who made 
requests to him personally 
in response to freedom of information act requests hud on 
thursday released more than 20000 pages of documents from the 
files of dean whose position made her a key official at hud and 
who has refused to testify before congress on constitutional 
grounds 
in the files were letters showing dean received requests for 
help on projects from members of congress including democrats and 
other officials the files also show thendefense secretary caspar 
weinberger and white house aides were among the politically 
connected who contacted pierce and dean regarding hud projects and 
another occassion in which former hud secretary carla hills 
convinced pierce to overrule subordinates in favor of her clients 
in testimony before a congressional panel last spring pierce 
said he received many requests for aid from friends and political 
allies and that he always referred them to appropriate staff 
members with the instruction that they were to receive careful 
consideration 
pierce who last month refused to testify again before congress 
citing his constitutional right against selfincrimination said in 
his may appearance that his instructions were not a recommendation 
or order to approve funds 
over time people ask me to help them get all kinds of 
benefits and things like that and my answer to them has always been 
the same thing pierce said its been basically that well 
give your request very careful consideration and if your request 
suits all of our requirements youll have a chance of getting what 
youre seeking 
the new york project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note to 
pierce from the department of commerces assistant secretary for 
productivity technology and innovation urging hud to back a 
proposed housing project in the morningside heights area of 
manhattan near columbia university 
at the bottom in pierces handwritting was written to 
debbie check into this and try to get it through it bears 
pierces initials srp jr 
the note to pierce was addressed simply sam and signed 
bruce on stationery of the assistant secretary of commerce 
d bruce merrifield who held that commerce position at the 
time could not be reached in calls to his home or the american 
electronics association where he is a consultant the commerce 
officials note said he was familiar with the project through his 
church which had supported the project 
the 56 million 99unit seniorcitizen housing project was 
granted 12 million in rental subsidies according to francine 
kellman spokeswoman for the hud regional office in new york 
pierces attorney paul l perito said he had not seen the 
letter to pierce and was not familiar with the project but he said 
there was nothing incriminatory in that situation 
any cabinet secretary occupies a political position and there 
may be a range of reasons why in his judgment he thought it was a 
worthy project perito said and in any project in which he has 
shown an interest he has never asked anyone to deviate from 
responsible professional government standards 
at the time the commerce official recommended the project to 
pierce developers were proposing to mix elderly housing with 
student housing for columbia university kellman said the student 
housing proposal was dropped and the project was developed by the 
ecumenical community development organization 
stuart weisberg staff director of the house subcommittee 
probing the hud scandals said the letter was one of several the 
panel has that suggest some people got more than careful 
consideration from hud under pierce 
on another occasion documents showed that after a private 
research company wrote pierce to complain that several of its bids 
for hud work had been rejected the secretary wrote to dean 
lets try to help this fellow i think he and his company have 
been unfairly treated 
it could not be immediately determined whether that firm later 
got hud work 
weinbergers name surfaced on two notes by aides discussing a 
project he had recommended to pierce one of the aides said the 
project had not been awarded funds but will be a good candidate 
for the secretarys discretionary fund it could not be 
immediately determined whether the project was ultimately given hud 
money 
mrs hills now the bush administrations trade representative 
appealed to pierce after a california client trying to sell a 
hudbacked development was told it would have to pay 13 million 
into reserve accounts before the deal could be approved pierce on 
deans recommendation agreed to reduce the amount to 855000 the 
records show 
the five boxes of files shed additional light on ms deans 
power at hud and her frequent contacts with prominent republicans 
developers with hud dealings pierces former law partners and 
others 
she once rewrote a draft of a speech the white house had 
prepared for a visit by president reagan to an elementary school 
please excuse our crassness she said in a note to the white 
house accompanying her revised version 
in a handwritten note to pierce ms dean said the departments 
office of general counsel can find no document that says you have 
ever delegated authority over mod rehab to anyone 
the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program was found by the 
departments inspector general to have been to be riddled with 
political influence pierce has said he delegated the power to 
award the lucrative subsidies to a threemember committee that 
included dean 
while members of congress have expressed outrage at the power 
she held deans files show she was frequently lobbied by members 
and their staffs mayors other local officials and prominent 
republicans also frequently wrote her to support hud proposals or 
applicants for jobs at the department

soldiers guarded rail shipments of food fuel and 
other vital supplies shipped through azerbaijan to armenia that 
have been blocked for two months in a violent ethnic feud between 
the two republics official media said thursday 
the official tass news agency said troops also escorted 43 
trucks 13 carrying food to destinations in nagornokarabakh 
the predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan that is the main 
point of contention 
although many shipments got through the situation remains 
tense in azerbaijan and the blockade of armenia continues tass 
said thursday night citing reports from the interior ministry 
which is in charge of law enforcement 
in august and september 32000 rail cars failed to reach 
armenia from azerbaijan due to sabotage moscow radio said in 
azerbaijan bridges were burned and trains were attacked with 
fire to prevent them from reaching armenia 
it said troops were sent after the supreme soviet legislature 
adopted an emergency resolution tuesday ordering the ministries of 
defense and interior to restore rail traffic between the southern 
republics in the caucasus mountains 
on thursday night tass said 21 freight trains totaling 603 cars 
101 carrying fuel went to armenia through the caucasus but it 
said 171 freight cars were still idled in azerbaijan including 89 
originally destined for armenia 
most supplies for armenia must pass through azerbaijan 
the blockades were said to be an outgrowth of the dispute over 
which republic should control nagornokarabakh a christian 
armenian enclave which has been part of moslemdominated azerbaijan 
since 1923 the dispute has claimed 117 lives since violence 
erupted 19 months ago 
avel pogosyan an editor at armenpress news agency in yerevan 
armenias capital said in a telephone interview that troops began 
arriving wednesday night he gave no information as to how many 
striking rail workers in azerbaijan motivated by their 
governments demands that it retain control over nagornokarabakh 
created a virtual economic blockade of armenia by blocking rail 
lines and sabotaging cargoes news reports said 
in azerbaijans capital of baku an editor at the official 
azerinform news agency said no sign was seen of troops in the 
caspian sea port city and trains there were not being guarded he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfilyev said he had no 
information on deployment of troops in the republics 
because of the blockade and sabotage workers in armenia do not 
have fuel and supplies to continue attempts to rebuild housing 
demolished by the dec 7 earthquake that killed 25000 people 
sotsialisticheskaya industriya said 
thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as a 
result even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel 
the newspaper said as winter approaches restoration plans are 
not being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leaving 
construction sites 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda quoted azerbaijani deputy 
prosecutor r safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation for 
purported armenian sabotage of azerbaijan railroads in july and 
august 
this actually provoked the strike by railroad workers and 
the blockade itself safarliev said but he added i want to 
emphasize that these measures cannot be justified

senate leaders thursday night began exploring 
the possibility of stripping from a massive deficitreduction bill 
every extraneous provison a move that could doom for the time 
being president bushs proposed capitalgain tax cut 
unless that is done senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine told colleagues it is virtually certain that arbitrary 
acrosstheboard cuts in most federal programs will be triggered on 
oct 16 
for us to allow a sequester automatic cuts to take place i 
believe destroys confidence in government and destroys confidence 
in those who are responsible for governing said sen james 
sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
the suggestion that all nondeficit provisions be removed from 
the deficitcutting bill known as the reconciliation bill was 
embraced immediately by sen bob packwood of oregon senior 
republican on the finance committee 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said he would 
discuss the proposal with bush friday morning there may be an 
opportunity here he said 
the bill is made up of revenue increases user fees and 
generally small cuts in a variety of spending programs such as 
medicare that are not subject to annual appropriations 
in writing the bill committees especially the taxwriting 
finance committee have tacked on scores of popular ideas these 
range from a major improvement in childcare benefits to allowing 
social security beneficiaries to earn more in retirement 
the finance committee earlier this week added dozens of 
miscellaneous tax breaks for a host of special interests 
the biggest issue of all on the bill is whether to encourage 
increased saving by cutting capitalgains taxes as bush proposes 
or by expanding taxdeductible individual retirement accounts as 
recommended by democratic leaders 
weve got a crisis in this country mitchell said in a 
speech on the floor outlining his proposal what we must do is 
restore a sense of responsibility in dealing with the deficit 
senate leaders of both parties began meeting immediately to see 
if the proposal is workable should mitchells idea prove 
successful the senate might avoid meeting over the weekend and 
might be able to salvage the recess scheduled next week 
otherwise the senate is expected to begin work on the bill 
friday night work at least on saturday and probably give up most 
of the recess

us officials describing the aborted panama 
coup as the administrations first crisis operation said 
thursday the effort to overthrow gen manuel antonio noriega was 
doomed by misjudgments by the rebels as well as by american forces 
lack of flexibility 
every administration has a shakedown in one way or another and 
weve learned some things about our operation that we need to 
improve said a senior administration official who insisted on 
anonymity and well improve them 
this is our first bloodletting if you will he said the 
first kind of a crisis operation 
another us official evaluating the events of the past two 
days said the american forces in panama were prepared for any 
contingency from the maximum all the way to the minimum but 
this official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
constraints were placed on gen maxwell thurman of the southern 
command who assumed his duties in panama just two days before the 
insurrection 
evaluations also were beginning on capitol hill where sen david 
boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence committee said 
his panel and the senate armed services committee were conducting 
an investigation of the administrations handling of the coup 
were going to get to the bottom of this said boren who 
was among the earliest to criticize bush for inaction 
the senate adopted 99 to 1 a resolution proposed by sen sam 
nunn dga that expressed support for bushs efforts to 
democratize panama through a full range of economic diplomatic 
and military options sen mark hatfield rore was the lone 
dissenter 
while the official postmortems were under way defense 
secretary dick cheney said it was hogwash to suggest that the 
united states had refused an offer from the rebels to take custody 
of noriega 
but sen jesse helms rnc did just that telling the senate 
they the rebels told the us officers that they were holding 
noriega captive and requested us assistance to take custody of 
noriega and remove him to the united states 
cheney said that rebels refused in a facetoface contact 
with a us military officer to turn over noriega during the coup 
attempt 
helms also said that coup leader maj moises giroldi had been 
executed in panama adding i have received reports from panama 
that noriega personally shot the major 
us officials agreed that giroldi probably was killed but added 
they were not certain 
a state department source speaking on condition that he not be 
identified said us officials are working on the belief that 
reports of giroldis death are solid information 
he and at least two others have been shot the story is they 
were trying to escape the source said adding that the 
administration officials do not give much credence to allegations 
of an attempt to escape 
one official speaking anonymously said if the rebels had 
delivered noriega to a us military facility he would have been 
flown to florida before nightfall tuesday to face federal drug 
charges dating to february 1988 
cheney and other administration officials continued their 
defense of bushs handling of the coup attempt and the decision 
not to become involved militarily white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said to have a handful of congressmen suggest it was 
the wrong course is a pretty minor response 
at the same time the administration emphasized its continued 
opposition to noriega by arranging for former opposition vice 
presidential candidate guillermo ford to meet with bush vice 
president dan quayle and secretary of state james a baker iii 
in an appearance at the capitol ford said guillermo endara 
whose election as panamas president was nullified by noriega had 
taken refuge in a party headquarters building which was surrounded 
by noriega security forces 
mr endara feels hes been detained by the defense forces 
said ford he is a very brave man we are going to fight the 
dictatorship no matter what 
he said democracies must help panama adding its very hard 
to overthrow a dictatorship with rocks in your hand 
helms was not alone in criticizing the administration 
sen alfonse damato rny called the administrations story 
a weakkneed explanation for failure and said the united states 
had botched the handling of the coup its an incredible 
stain on us he said 
speaking only on condition they not be identified by name us 
officials placed primary responsibility for the failure of the coup 
on the rebels 
it was their failure not ours one said 
bushs personal involvement in tuesday mornings events was not 
clear but the officials said his heavy schedule prevented him from 
devoting full time to the subject 
two hours after the first shots were fired bush went to the 
white house south lawn for the arrival ceremony of mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari and much of the late morning 
was devoted to salinas 
the rebels were described by one us official as extremely 
naive in their assumptions and judgments cited specifically were 
the decision to release noriega after holding him for several hours 
and the assumptions that a key battalion would not come to 
noriegas aid and that the panamanian people would join the 
rebellion 
washingtons reluctance to give us commanders the flexibility 
to deal with rapidly changing developments also was cited as an 
important factor in the failure of the coup 
the us southern command having been alerted about 30 hours in 
advance that a move against noriega was afoot began blocking key 
access routes to the military headquarters before dawn on tuesday 
shortly after sunrise an estimated 200 rebels seized control of 
the defense force headquarters and took noriega into custody 
most of the access routes pass through us military 
installations and us commanders acted within their authority in 
blockading them the officials said 
but the pronoriega forces surprised the rebels by using a 
boeing 727 and some smaller aircraft to fly about 100 troops to an 
airstrip near the headquarters shortly thereafter battalion 2000 
to the surprise of the rebels threw its support to noriega after 
refusing to take sides in the early going 
the us officials said that although the us military command 
in panama had troops on key routes they lacked the discretionary 
authority to counter surprise moves by forces loyal to noriega 
as officials described it the worst misjudgment of the rebels 
was to set noriega free after the headquarters was surrounded 
if noriega had been flown out the loyalist forces wouldnt 
have anybody to be loyal to and the postnoriega era would have 
begun in panama one official said 
defending the bush administration against charges that it acted 
timidly in not coming to the aid of the rebels cheney said in an 
interview with cbs that the coup leaders had no intention of 
forcing noriega from the country this was not a situation where 
we had a prodemocracy movement trying to topple a dictator and 
restore democracy to panama he said

prisoners and disappeared people stormed the costa rican 
embassy and seized 19 hostages thursday to protest against 
salvadoran president alfredo cristianis rightist government 
we are here to denounce human rights violations and so that 
the costa rican government pressures cristiani to end the 
repression against the people a spokeswoman for the mostly women 
activists said in an interview

special national police units surrounded the sixstory central 
american building but no violence was reported the embassy is on 
the third floor 
costa rican ambassador jesus manuel fernandez told the 
associated press by telephone from the embassy that he asked 
military authorities at the scene to lift the cordon around the 
building he said his request was being considered monsignor 
arturo rivera damas the roman catholic archbishop of san salvador 
entered the embassy shortly after nightfall presumably trying to 
resolve the standoff 
consul general humberto murillo and first secretary rene aldama 
also were held most other hostages were people visiting the

central american peace plan spoke at a news conference in san

embassy and taken people hostage and that they are heavily armed 
with rifles and even hand grenades 
the activists went past security guards pretending they wanted 
to apply for visas to go to costa rica starcewic said in a 
telephone interview 
more than 70000 people have been killed since a leftist 
guerrilla war began a decade ago and human rights groups say a

a federal judge upheld hialeahs ban on animal 
sacrifice thursday saying the constitution protects only the 
santeria religions beliefs not its practices 
us district judge eugene p spellman upheld ordinances passed 
in 1987 after a santeria priest ernesto pichardo announced he 
would open a church that would include in its ritual the sacrifice 
of chickens goats and other animals representatives of the 
afrocuban religion said there would be an appeal 
spellman said the citys witnesses during the august federal 
court trial established that the regulation of animal sacrifice had 
valid purposes such as safeguarding public health and animal 
welfare 
the ordinance is not targeted at santeria followers but is meant 
to prohibit all animal sacrifice whether it be practiced by an 
individual or a religion or a cult the judge wrote 
officials in hialeah a largely hispanic miami suburb said they 
were delighted with the ruling 
we spent substantial time in drafting ordinances that we felt 
addressed the issues to minimize the effect on religious practice 
of the church said deputy city attorney richard gross we hope 
the church is able to continue to practice its beliefs 
pichardo said his church would make a formal announcement of its 
legal plans on friday 
the ruling is biased pichardo told the associated press 
and it becomes broad now where it directly affects the jewish 
faith the muslim faith all afrocaribbean religions and all 
asian religions in the united states 
it literally makes them all outlaws he said 
pichardos attorney maurice rosen who represented santeria 
followers said the group would appeal all the way to the us 
supreme court if necessary 
robyn blumner head of the american civil liberties union in 
florida said santeria beliefs and practices cannot be separated 
we have today seen that a community can bar certain religions 
because they find their orthodoxies distasteful she said 
she also noted that the us supreme court is considering a case 
this term on the right of american indians to take peyote a piece 
of cactus that is chewed for the drug mescaline as part of their 
religion and said that decision could affect the santeria case 
in his ruling the judge referred to santerias 400year 
history tracing its roots from africa to cuba and into the united 
states saying the religion now has an estimated 50000 to 60000 
followers in south florida 
spellman wrote that the us melting pot has absorbed cultures 
from around the world and noted the first amendment protected the 
beliefs of immigrants who follow widely varying religions 
but freedom of religion is not absolute when we are dealing 
as here with the manner in which the religion is conducted rather 
than the beliefs of those seeking to exercise it spellman wrote 
reasonable regulation of those practices as hialeah did by 
banning sacrifices is not discriminatory the judge said 
santeria is considered a lowerclass religion by many cubans and 
was largely underground until pichardo announced the founding of 
the church and touched off the legal controversy 
animal sacrifices performed only by santeria priests are used 
to invoke the spirits for a blessing good luck and in faith 
healing

a geologists chance discovery of the earths 
oldest known rocks will help researchers open a window on the solar 
system in its infancy scientists say 
the rocks are only about 600 million years younger than the 
earth itself which scientists believe was formed about 46 billion 
years ago 
its quite remarkable said jim cole a geologist with the 
us geological survey weve known for a long time that rocks 
are 32 34 billion years old but these are quite a bit 
older 
its just rare to be able to lay your hands on a piece of 
stone that has survived intact for almost 4 billion years 
samuel bowring a geologist at washington university stumbled 
on the granitic rocks in 1986 during a summer of ordinary geologic 
investigation in a remote area of canada 
i picked up the rock and said boy this is a goodlooking 
rock lets collect it said bowring who has been conducting 
research in canadas northwest territories since 1979 
to date the rocks bowring extracted tiny crystals of the 
mineral zircon from them and analyzed it with a sensitive high 
massresolution ion microprobe at the australian national 
university in canberra 
that instrument put the age of the rocks at 3962 billion years 
give or take 3 million years bowring said 
the results of his research in collaboration with two 
australian scientists ian williams and william compston are to be 
published in the november issue of geology a publication of the 
geological society of america 
geologists say that studying the chemistry of the rocks will 
give them insight into the early history of earth and its fellow 
planets 
with this new discovery we are a giant step further in our 
search for knowledge of what happened in the earths first 800 
million years bowring said 
few rocks of this age are left since the earths surface has 
been churned and recycled by meteorites volcanoes erosion and the 
slow but constant movement of the continents scientists said 
scientists reckon the first dinosaurs began to roam the land 
about 200 million years ago and the first human ancestors who used 
tools didnt show up until about 2 million years ago

the 36 tons of cocaine seized over the last 
week is a clear indication that colombias war on drugs is creating 
chaos for cocaine kingpins federal officials said thursday 
were seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaines 
moving out because its not safe to leave it in colombia any 
more transportation secretary samuel k skinner said at a news 
conference in front of a boat on which more than six tons of 
cocaine was found 
drug cartels used to keep large stockpiles of cocaine in 
colombia and move it gradually to the united states he said but 
theyre now moving it in huge lots 
thats because of the pressure from the government in 
colombia he said colombia has cracked down heavily on drug 
traffickers since a leading presidential candidate was assassinated 
aug 18 
skinner spoke in front of the zedom sea a rusty dented 
185foot offshore supply boat turned freighter the coast guard 
seized the boat monday in the gulf of mexico then handed over the 
cargo and the crew of nine colombians eight men and a woman 
thursday to the drug enforcement administration 
the nine were arraigned later on charges of importing cocaine 
and possession with intent to distribute cocaine us magistrate 
alma chasez ordered each held without bond and appointed a public 
defender to represent them 
if convicted of the charges they could be sentenced to life 
imprisonment 
we will throw the book at them said us attorney john 
volz we will try to get as much prison time as we can 
also thursday dea spokesman billy fernandes said cocaine found 
aboard the zedom sea originally estimated at 11500 pounds 
actually totaled 12208 pounds and had a street value of nearly 
5549 million 
the cocaine on the zedom sea was one of four major finds in less 
than a week 
texas state troopers found nine tons of the drug wednesday in 
harlingen stacked in a house believed to be a center for 
repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the united states three 
mexicans were arraigned thursday on charges of engaging in 
organized criminal activity and aggravated cocaine possession 
about 20 tons was found late last week in a los angeles 
warehouse in what was described as the largest haul ever and the 
coast guard seized about 1 tons near puerto rico over the weekend 
it is not business as usual in the drug business today 
said skinner the efforts in colombia are creating what id 
call chaos and were taking advantage of that and were seizing 
cocaine that otherwise would have been transmitted in smaller 
groups and probably would not have been detected 
in addition he said the various us government agencies that 
fight the drug trade are far more cooperative than they used to be 
the turf fighting that i used to see many years ago i dont 
see now he said 
with the gulf of mexico and puerto rican seizures the coast 
guards total take in the first four days of fiscal year 1990 is 
more than that of all that the coast guard seized the previous 
fiscal year officials said federal fiscal years begin oct 1 
and there may well be more on the zedom sea said ruben monzon 
special agent in charge of the deas new orleans office 
the cocaine was found in two of 10 boxcarsize freight 
containers stacked on the deck but the coast guard was able to 
search only the containers on top dea agents planned to search the 
others he said 
the zedom sea was heading west from the yucatan peninsula when 
the crew of the cutter cushing boarded it 
its likely that the ship was on a route known as the 
trampoline from colombia to mexico and from there to 
california or west texas said monzon 
the route is being used more these days because steppedup 
patrols in florida and along the mexican border have increased the 
danger of smuggling along more direct routes he said

a seoul criminal court sentenced the 
rev moon ikhwan to 10 years in prison thursday for making an 
illegal trip to communist north korea after the dissident leader 
walked out of the courtroom in protest 
sentence me as you please after i leave the court although i 
am not concerned about the penalty the 71yearold moon said 
before leaving 
about 100 relatives and dissidents in the courtroom applauded 
when the presbyterian minister walked out they also clapped 
derisively when the presiding judge chung sanghak announced the 
sentence 
yoo wonho a businessman who accompanied moon on the trip to 
north korea in march was also sentenced to 10 years imprisonment 
after walking out with moon in protest 
defense lawyer han sunghon said he would appeal the 
prosecution which sought a life sentence also said it would 
appeal for a tougher penalty 
moon said later through his lawyers that he could not recognize 
the courts authority he gave no reason but he sent a written 
statement to the court wednesday accusing it of having been 
subservient to the administration 
the court held that while acting out of idealistic hopes of 
uniting the peninsula moon and yoo aided north koreas attempts to 
undermine south korea by encouraging dissident movements 
chung also noted that moon had backed the norths call for 
withdrawal of 43000 us troops based in the south under a mutual 
defense treaty 
public polls indicate most south koreans support the us 
military presence as a deterrent to a north korean military threat 
moon and other dissidents say washington keeps troops in south 
korea to block unification of the peninsula 
the judge said he did not impose a longer sentence because of 
moons age and because of the defendants desire for reunification 
moon has served jail sentences in the past for antigovernment 
activity 
moon secretly traveled to north korea by way of tokyo and 
beijing to meet communist leader kim il sung and call for 
unification of the divided korean peninsula 
south koreas national security laws ban its citizens from 
making unauthorized trips to north korea 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was 
divided in 1945 they are still technically at war since no peace 
treaty was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953

canneries in the philippines china and 
malaysia may be selling salmon illegally caught in the north 
pacific to european fish traders federal law enforcement officials 
said in memos obtained thursday 
the national marine fisheries service said earlier that a thai 
cannery was offering thousands of tons of illegal salmon to french 
brokers at prices 30 percent below similar us products federal 
agents also believe korean canneries may be involved in such sales 
according to one memo traders in the united kingdom imported 
241 metric tons of canned salmon last year from the philippines and 
61 metric tons from china a metric ton is about 2205 pounds or 10 
percent larger than a us ton 
the memos were made available to the associated press by 
congressional sources who insisted on not being identified 
under international law salmon may not be taken on the high 
seas except by fishing fleets of the country where they spawn 
it is likely that the philippine and chinese product was 
canned from imported pacific salmon illegally harvested by the 
taiwanese the memo said 
a separate memo indicated that a malaysian firm was offering 
french brokers canned pink salmon at 38 per carton or about 20 
below what us products sell for in europe a carton contains 48 
halfpound cans 
this is the cheapest salmon offered this season the memo 
said adding that us traders believe this was the first time a 
malaysian firm has offered canned salmon on the world market 
the salmon processed by the malaysian cannery was reportedly 
imported from singapore the memo said 
several hundred tons of illegally harvested frozen pink salmon 
earmarked for thailand was said to be in coldstorage in singapore 
in mid1988 the memo said when the contract for this 
particular shipment fell through the salmon was purchased by 
malaysian processors 
us fishermen have claimed that drift net vessels from taiwan 
south korea and japan have been illegally catching salmon in the 
north pacific under the guise of fishing for squid the fish are 
then allegedly laundered through middlemen in hong kong and 
singapore to avoid detection by taiwanese korean and japanese 
enforcement officials 
the middlemen in turn sell the salmon to canneries in the far 
east which process the fish and offer them for sale on world 
markets in direct competition with us products 
up until now it was thought that thai canneries were the 
leading processors of illgally caught salmon 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said thursday he would introduce 
legislation that would require that the united states seek to 
establish an international certificate of origin program for 
salmon being sold in world markets 
drastic action is needed to stem proliferation of illegal 
canning murkowski said if the trend is allowed to continue 
it would place the legitimate canned salmon industries of the us 
canada and the soviet union at extreme risk

developer donald trump stunned the airline world 
thursday by offering a record 7 billion for the parent company of 
american airlines capping weeks of takeover speculation about the 
nations biggest carrier 
stock in amr corp shot higher after the company disclosed a 
letter from the flashy tycoon to chairman robert l crandall 
offering 120 cash for each of amrs 589 million outstanding 
common shares 
it would be the biggest airline buyout ever if completed trump 
said his offer expires oct 20 
amr finished up 1687 at 9987 a share in heavy trading on 
the the new york stock exchange other airline stocks also jumped 
in related speculation 
amr also said its board would consider the proposal in due 
course but indicated probable rejection 
in the letter released by trumps office in new york trump 
said he had made a substantial investment in amr and was 
prepared to commit at least 1 billion of equity to the transaction 
the letter did not disclose trumps stake but trump officials 
said he hasnt notified the securities and exchange commission as 
required if his holdings exceeded 5 percent of amrs outstanding 
shares 
susan heilbron executive vice president of the trump 
organization said further financing details would be discussed 
with amr officials when they meet with trump although no meeting 
has been set 
earlier this year trump acquired eastern airlines profitable 
northeast shuttle for 365 million adding it to an empire built 
mainly on huge real estate holdings that include hotels and 
atlantic city nj casinos 
trump said his experience with the shuttle has given him 
substantial insight into airline competition 
he praised amr management and said he intended for it to 
continue running amr and work with me to build on the companys 
reputation as the premier airline in the industry 
amr has enjoyed strong financial results in recent years and has 
an industryleading 218 percent domestic market share its also 
engaged in a major expansion that includes buying 23 billion worth 
of planes analysts said any attempted buyout could prove difficult 
the recent wave of airline takeovers including the 365 
billion buyout of northwest airlines parent nwa inc and pending 
675 billion employeemanagement takeover of united airlines 
parent ual corp has brought renewed government scrutiny of the 
business 
on wednesday transportation secretary samuel skinner reiterated 
his opposition to buyouts dependent mainly on borrowed money on 
grounds that high debt can detract from important investments in 
safety and a modernized fleet 
analysts also were skeptical of trumps intentions especially 
considering his past record 
trump in recent years has acquired stakes or said he planned to 
in pan am corp golden nugget allegis corp and federated 
department stores inc but other than a takeover of resorts 
international inc in 1988 he generally has not done so 
in each case he accumulated shares in the company sometimes 
indicating he might be interested in mounting a buyout and later 
sold all or some shares at a profit after the price rose on 
takeover speculation or when another bidder emerged 
kevin burke who follows the airline industry for first union 
corp a bank holding company in charlotte nc said the 120 
offer was at the high end of analysts estimates of amrs worth 
the company also has enjoyed steady earnings growth in the six 
months ended june 30 amrs profit rose to 2789 million or 443 
a share from 2098 million or 349 a share a year earlier 
revenue rose to 517 billion from 413 billion

boeing co supervisors worked thursday on 
production of jetliners close to delivery as a strike by 57000 
machinists union members continued with no new talks in sight 
boeing chairman frank shrontz apologized in a telegram to 
defense secretary richard cheney for any delays the strike might 
cause in delivery boeing manufactures structural components for 
the b2 bomber and other military planes 
if the strike continues delivery delays of our products will 
be inevitable but we will keep you apprised of our progress 
shrontz told cheney we hope the strike will be shortlived 
also thursday industry analysts said the strikes outcome could 
set a trend for contracts at other aerospace companies 
no new negotiations were scheduled in the boeing strike that 
began wednesday when a threeyear labor contract expired without 
agreement over a new pact 
strikers include 43300 in the seattle area 12000 in wichita 
kan 1700 in portland ore and smaller numbers at a halfdozen 
other locations 
boeing spokesman harold carr said company officials met 
wednesday to discuss the strike but im not going to characterize 
them as to what was discussed nor would i want to go into any 
detail as to what might happen next he said he was not aware of 
any further meetings thursday 
union officials have said theyd be willing to resume talks at 
any time but havent heard from boeing 
the company is mute said spokesman jack daniels theyre 
doing their aristocratic aloof act 
carr said boeings operations were continuing without the 
machinists who represent the bulk of the companys production 
workers but one obviously needs to recognize that were 
operating without 43000 people who are normally here 
supervisory personnel were trying to finish aircraft close to 
delivery including a malaysian airlines 747400 jumbo jet due to 
be delivered friday 
the machinists want a larger share of boeings financial 
prosperity and fewer hours of mandatory overtime at the company 
which is pressing hard to increase aircraft production because of 
record aircraft orders 
boeings offer included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 
percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 annual bonuses of 8 percent 
of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next plus 
reduced mandatory overtime 
the last machinist walkout at boeing in 1977 lasted 45 days 
elsewhere in the country talks have been extended in a 
machinist contract that expired sunday with lockheed corp in 
marietta ga and the unions contract with mcdonnell douglas 
boeings only us competitor for jetliners is up oct 22 
industry analysts said that what happens at boeing could 
influence those talks although jim carroll a spokesman for 
machinists at marietta said they could live with an offer similar 
to boeings 
everyone else is going to see what boeing is going to settle 
for said william whitlow an analyst with dain bosworth inc in 
seattle thats not to say they will match it 
members of other boeing unions which have nostrike clauses in 
their contracts have been reporting to work as usual worldwide 
boeing employs 164000 people including 106000 in western 
washington

several hours earlier eight gunmen had fired in the air outside 
the office where endara was staying dispersing scores of 
supporters gathered outside still earlier in the day uniformed 
troops and civilians had surrounded the building 
some of the gunmen entered endaras office and took his 
secretary with them but the secretary was later released 
the former opposition presidential candidate told reporters 
earlier thursday he would continue his hunger strike as part of a 
campaign to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega survived a coup attempt tuesday and in a televised 
speech thursday he said he had evidence the united states planned 
to install endara as president after the coup 
this hungerstriking buffoon sneaks out to eat tuesday so he 
can be well fed when he takes over the presidency but hes 
screwed noriega said 
noriega said he was going to present his handpicked provisional 
president francisco rodriguez with a package of war laws 
dealing with security because panama is living in a moment of 
emergency 
noting that us troops stood by and watched as the rebellion 
failed noriega said the united states left its agents in the 
lurch he said the bungled coup was another bay of pigs for the 
united states referring to the ciasupported invasion of cuba that 
failed in 1961 
they mistakenly believed that everyone has a price and that 
everyone is a traitor he said the speech from the provincial 
town of santiago 
the civilian opposition and the united states have denied any 
role in the coup attempt 
the united states recognizes endara as the legitimate president 
because of his victory in may 7 elections that were annulled by 
noriega 
endara was drinking only water taking prescribed medicine and 
eating only the wafer of mass but he appeared healthy when 
reporters interviewed him at his office 
accusations of bungling the coup attempt were flying in 
washington where congressional leaders accused the bush 
administration of botching the coup attempt 
sen jesse helms rnc said the coup leader maj moises 
giroldi vega had been executed 
i have received reports from panama that noriega personally 
shot the major said helms 
noriega didnt mention any executions in his speech but the 
panamanian defense forces said nine of the 10 rebels who died in 
the aborted coup were officers the wednesday night communique said 
no loyalist troops died 
here we have a new bay of pigs noriega said they the 
united states left its agents in the lurch and nothing was 
accomplished because dignity is superior to brute force 
noriega said he had come under heavy fire in defense forces 
headquarters during the coup attempt tuesday and described talking 
to the coup leaders he did not give details of the situation 
inside the barracks 
lt col arnulfo castrejon said thursday that noriega had been 
taken hostage other sources said noriega had taken refuge in a 
bunker and managed to call for help 
noriega described the rebel officers as confused and said 
they were led by members of the general staff who were totally 
suborned confused but traitors 
i told them they would have to kill me before i handed over 
the national liberation movement of the panamanian people he 
said 
noriega maintains he is the victim of a us plot to renege on 
the 1977 treaties that turn the panama canal over to panama at the 
end of the century noriega said he had advance knowledge of a coup 
plot 
more than 35 officers and soldiers including three members of 
noriegas general staff were arrested the panamanian defense 
forces said they said five rebels have taken refuge at a us 
military base 
southern command and the us embassy have refused to comment 
about the five who reportedly sought asylum or about anything 
else since tuesday

thousands of east german refugees 
arrived in this border town from prague today after a trip through 
their homeland in trains that were tightly locked to bar 
compatriots who tried to board en route 
some said they feared there were serious disturbances during the 
night in the east german city of dresden because their train had 
stopped for some time before passing through the city 
thousands of east germans chanting we want out had flocked 
to train stations and lined tracks in their homeland in hopes of 
joining the refugees aboard what could be the last freedom 
trains to the west 
east germanys state railroad had provided the trains for a 
second time in less than a week to transport thousands of east 
germans who had crowded the prague embassy and streets just outside

the risk of aids infection from transfusions is 
minuscule but blood banks should work harder to recruit and retain 
women donors because theyre less likely to have the aids virus a 
red cross report concludes today 
the research shows that blood from repeat female donors is nine 
times safer than from firsttime male donors 
currently 42 percent of donors are women the report said this 
proportion should be increased in part by encouraging members of 
womens organizations to give blood and by telephone recruiting 
campaigns aimed at women 
every effort should be made to recruit and retain female 
donors wrote dr paul d cumming and colleagues from the

night stalker richard ramirez sneered at 
a jurys verdict that he die in the gas chamber for his 13 satanic 
murders muttering big deal death always went with the 
territory see you in disneyland 
the blackclad killer unrepentant to the end made his comment 
in an underground garage wednesday as he was taken back to jail 
moments after a jury recommended the death penalty for his gruesome 
crimes 
his disneyland comment apparently referred to the plea for mercy 
that had marked his attorneys closing argument 
mr ramirez will die in prison defense attorney ray clark 
had argued insisting that a life sentence was sufficient 
punishment 
but the jury voted 19 times for death on each of the special 
circumstances attached to his 13 murder convictions ramirez also 
was convicted of 30 felonies including burglary and sex crimes 
those felonies and the crime of multiple murders constituted 
special circumstances warranting the death penalty

savers and investors at all stages of life are 
likely to find both opportunities and new uncertainties lurking in 
the capitalgains tax changes that congress is debating 
no one yet knows for sure the specifics of the final proposal 
that might be sent to president bush who has been a vocal advocate 
of a tax break for capital gains as a stimulus to investment 
but the odds appear increasingly to favor a restoration in some 
form of the special treatment for longterm gains that was 
eliminated with the tax reform act of 1986 
a version passed by the house late last month would temporarily 
allow people who realize profits on investments held for more than 
a year to exclude 30 percent of the gain from federal income tax 
the break would apply to assets for example stocks mutual 
fund shares or a house but not collectibles like antiques or 
old baseball cards sold any time after sept 13 of this year 
through the end of 1991 
with the arrival of 1992 longterm gains would no longer 
qualify for a special rate although a new formula would go into 
effect then to adjust the tax obligation for future inflation 
the senate now is taking its turn on the proposal and if all 
goes according to the standard routine a housesenate conference 
committee would work out any differences before sending a bill to 
the president 
until a new measure gets down to specifics experts on matters 
of personal finance say there isnt much concrete action 
individuals can take to capitalize on this latest shift in the 
political winds 
for example to go ahead acting on the assumption that the final 
legislation will keep the houses sept 14 starting date would be 
a little dicey observes hugh johnson an investment analyst at 
first albany corp in albany ny 
still advisers say its by no means too soon to start planning 
how you might want to capitalize on a period of lowered 
capitalgains tax rates 
under the house plan the effective maximum tax rate on 
longterm capital gains would fall from 28 percent to 196 percent 
for someone who sold a longheld asset such as a house for a 
gain of 200000 uncle sams cut of the profit would thus be 
reduced from 52000 to 39200 in the absence of any other 
special breaks for home sales 
so anyone looking to trade down to a smaller house might benefit 
materially from timing the sale of the old property to fit into the 
window period of lower capital gains rates 
a similar strategy might appeal to people looking for an 
opportune moment to cash in appreciated assets to pay for some 
discretionary item whether it be a boat or elective surgery 
most observers agree it would be a mistake to expect a 
capitalgains tax cut especially one scheduled for only a limited 
run to serve as a powerful positive force for the prices of 
financial assets 
in fact many analysts say the change approved by the house 
would probably exert some downward pressure on assets like stocks 
especially in the last few months of the window period in 1991 
however many of the profits cashed in at that time would most 
likely be reinvested quickly the effect either way would be 
mitigated by the dominance in modern markets of pension funds and 
other institutions that are not subject to income tax 
concludes johnson at first albany i dont think most 
longterm investment strategies are going to be significantly 
changed

the israeli government is issuing 
gas masks to civilians in an experiment that grew out of concern 
that chemical weapons could be used by the enemy in a future war 
the government maintains that a precedent for the use of 
chemical weapons in the middle east was set by iraq in its war 
against iran in the persian gulf 
the distribution of gas masks is part of a yearlong 
civildefense experiment involving about 7000 israelis in ramat 
hasharon near tel aviv and in the settlement of shelomi on the 
border with lebanon 
israeli analysts say that in the middle east it may be difficult 
to eliminate chemical weapons as proposed by president bush and 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
one reason is that arab states view such weapons as their only 
counter to what they believe is an extensive israeli nuclear 
capability 
israel is considering a proposal to equip the entire nation of 
45 million with gas masks and other protective equipment but 
first the army is conducting a test to make sure israeli civilians 
will take the chemical threat seriously 
qvadia yemini who lives in ramat hasharon has four gas masks 
in a closet one each for himself his wife and two sons 
we guard them in case god forbid there would be a war and we 
would have to put them to use said the 50yearold assistant 
city treasurer in this affluent suburb of about 40000 
it is very important that we were given the masks of course 
it brings some anxiety 
the army is collecting data on peoples attitudes toward the 
chemical threat and compliance with instructions on the care and 
use of protective equipment army spokesmen said 
we know that if there is another war there will be the threat 
of chemical weapons said gad penini deputy mayor of ramat 
hasharon and a reserve air force captain 
mayor yehuda lankri of shelomi said that in his town of about 
3000 everybody took it very seriously 
the military conducted a smiliar more limited test two years 
ago in another town on the border with lebanon but some residents 
used the masks for costumes at parties or as protection while 
spraying agricultural chemicals 
penini said he is certain ramat hasharon is taking the test 
seriously with some residents storing the masks under their beds 
i know it because we have checked even people who were not 
in the sample group came and asked us for the masks 
in addition to gas masks in adult and childrens sizes the army 
also has distributed plastic tents for infants cribs they are 
equipped with air filters antidote injectors and decontamination 
powder 
according to a study by the independent jaffee center for 
strategic studies at tel aviv university syria has large 
stockpiles of mustard and nerve gas as well as sovietmade scud 
missiles that put tel aviv and jerusalem well within striking range 
its no real secret that syria has threatened to use chemical 
weapons said joseph alpher deputy head of the jaffee center 
syria one of israels fiercest enemies has no nuclear weapons 
but believes israel does and regards chemical weapons as a poor 
mans atomic bomb alpher said 
the israeli government never has confirmed it but it is widely 
believed abroad that israel possesses both nuclear and chemical 
weapons as well as longrange missiles 
iraq which has fought in all of the wars against israel used 
chemical weapons not only in its war with iran but also against 
kurdish rebels in iraq 
with iraq one would have to assume chemical weapons are a 
standard part of their arsenal and doctrine alpher said 
experts also say egypt libya and iran are believed to have 
chemical weapons

located southwest of da nang it once was 
fertile land the vietnam war made it a miserable battered killing 
field nicknamed the arizona territory dennis sheehy a marine 
grunt then knew it well 
he was badly wounded near there in 1967 later recuperating in 
a navy hospital he made a decision as he notes in a pbs special 
to return someday to asia and instead of search and destroy 
maybe build and reconstruct 
he did just that not in vietnam but in china in inner 
mongolia where he worked on a government program to help save the 
windswept grasslands for three consecutive years he lived there 
during each years sixmonth growing season joined each june by 
his wife marcie and their three kids 
his story and theirs will be told monday on pbs in the 
cowboy in mongolia a onehour documentary made in 1987 by andy 
duncan and dave king faculty members at oregon state university in 
corvallis 
now 42 sheehy an oregon native is an assistant professor at 
texas a amp m university he has undergraduate degrees in asian 
studies and mandarin chinese and masters and doctoral degrees in 
rangeland management 
an odd combination but its just as odd that his interest in 
the orient was kindled by his first trip to asia one seen from a 
grunts perspective in fields filled with booby traps shell 
craters and enemy bunkers 
its hard to explain concedes sheehy a shy softspoken 
man he thinks his interest probably began with tales of the orient 
he heard from his father a navy veteran hes an 
anchorclanker of world war ii 
being there in vietnam even though it wasnt the best of 
times did kind of expand this desire of mine to learn more about 
asia he says 
but it took a while starting with his first classes in 1968 
the ultimate goal was to see china at one point though hed 
almost given up hope of getting there 
then in 1985 chinese officials to whom hed sent a resume 
hired him to work at a grasslands protection project on a 
15000acre pilot area in inner mongolia he and his family lived 
in a commune called yihenoer sumu 
working on projects sponsored by chinas government and various 
organizations including the united nations and the world bank 
sheehy so far has made six trips to china he plans to return there 
in december 
he was in beijing in early june when prodemocracy 
demonstrations led by students were crushed in the bloody 
internationallytelevised show of force by government troops around 
tiananmen square 
all day sunday i heard ambulance sirens shooting and a pall 
of black smoking was hanging over the city recalls sheehy who 
stayed put at his hotel located a short walk from the square 
the sounds of violence gave him an eerie 
ivebeenthroughthisbefore feeling 
yeah it did he says its funny in a way because i got 
wounded in vietnam on june 2 and this happened on june 3 he 
chuckled i remember commenting to the people with me that i 
wasnt going to go abroad anymore during early june 
like many who served in vietnam sheehy would like to go back 
there someday walk peacefully where he once fought visit what 
once was the dusty occasionally rocketed marine base at an hoa 
southwest of da nang 
even though i hated vietnam when i was there hated being 
scared to death all the time theres a certain fascination about 
the place he says yeah id go back there 
his links with the marines he knew best in the violent past and 
the mongolian friends hes made in the peaceful present are quietly 
noted near the end of mondays pbs show with one sentence that 
appears on screen 
this film it says is dedicated to the men of foxtrot 
company 2nd battalion fifth marines 1967 and the herding 
families of yihenoer sumu

in 1990 and again in 1992 the most 
sophisticated space probe ever built will visit a planet with vast 
oceans a churning molten interior and a rocky surface scarred by 
earthquakes and active volcanoes 
that planet is earth 
the galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch aboard the space 
shuttle atlantis on thursday is ultimately bound for jupiter but 
its long looping trajectory will sling it twice around its home 
planet before dispatching it to jupiter 
that makes galileo the first spacecraft to approach earth from 
interplanetary space 
its showing people what the earth would look like to an 
extraterrestrial said torrence johnson project scientist on the 
galileo mission weve never conducted a mission to planet earth 
like this before were going to go in and see what this place 
looks like 
in addition to making observations concerning the greenhouse 
effect and the antarctic ozone hole galileo will film what 
scientists are calling the earth movie proposed by astronomer and 
writer carl sagan of cornell university 
in the movie the earth will appear as a thin distant crescent 
then gradually fill the frame and expand until surface objects 10 
feet across are visible 
as the spacecraft pulls away from earths sunlit side it will 
take a backwardlooking shot showing five days of the earths 
rotation with the moon silently sweeping past as the earth recedes 
a continuous zoom movie like that would be it seems to me 
spectacular in reminding us of our position in space of the tiny 
planet that were on sagan said 
galileo will also at sagans suggestion use its 
stateoftheart instruments to map the atmosphere for methane 
carbon dioxide and other gases responsible for global warming and 
on its first pass it will peer directly down into the ozone hole 
over antarctica 
galileo has such capable and novel instruments it seemed to 
me important to do something about understanding the dangers to the 
global environment sagan said 
galileo is returning to earth only to pick up a boost in speed 
from earths gravity as it begins its sixyear journey after its 
launch galileo will get a gravity kick by passing around venus 
pick up more speed with the two passes by earth and then begin its 
primary mission to orbit jupiter explore its moons and dispatch a 
probe into jupiters atmosphere 
we wouldnt do anything on the earth encounters if we thought 
it would jeopardize the primary mission said fraser p fanale of 
the university of hawaii who is in charge of galileos earth 
science objectives 
scientists say the 14 billion probes investigation of jupiter 
and its moons will be the most scientifically rich that 
interplanetary exploration has witnessed the 1979 voyager views of 
jupiter and its satellites were fascinating but galileos images 
will be 1000 times clearer they say 
in 1995 a smaller probe is to be fired by galileo into 
jupiters cloud layers and make the first direct sampling of the 
jovian atmosphere the probe will transmit data until it is crushed 
and vaporized by extreme heat and pressure 
galileo will orbit the planet gathering information on 
temperatures magnetic fields radiation cloud characteristics 
gravity fields and the dynamics of a weather system that produces 
such phenomena as the mysterious great red spot a centuriesold 
storm larger than earth 
the spacecraft was initially scheduled for launch in 1982 on a 
direct course to jupiter but it has been delayed repeatedly as 
congress and the white house wrangled over nasa financing and as 
the space shuttle program fell far behind schedule 
on sept 28 activists filed a suit seeking to prevent the 
launch of the spacecraft because it is powered by plutonium they 
said a shuttle accident could spread toxic plutonium in populated 
areas but nasa said its evaluations indicated the risk of 
contamination was very low 
galileo will do more than observe the earth as it makes its way 
to jupiter it will be the first spacecraft with modern instruments 
to observe the dark side of the moon there are a lot of things 
we dont know about the far side of the moon said johnson 
its been very difficult and frustrating to try to put together a 
picture of the whole moon from the data we have 
galileo will also search for ice in the shaded craters near the 
moons north pole and study the soil for clues to the evolution of 
the moons crust and its interior 
the spacecraft will be active as it passes by venus searching 
for cloud patterns and possibly lightning and it will visit at 
least one and maybe two asteroids in the asteroid belt between mars 
and jupiter 
its observations of the earth and moon may help resolve a debate 
about the space snowballs hypothesis of louis a frank of the 
university of iowa 
the theory holds that the earths lakes and oceans come from 
precipitation caused by the melting of small comets bombarding the 
earths atmosphere at the rate of 10 million a year 
if thats true galileo should be able to spot hydrogen clouds 
around the earth and the moon the result of the comets water 
molecules disintegrating it should also detect water vapor rising 
from the moon as comets collide with its surface 
galileo will make the most accurate measurements yet of the 
earths mass and it will study the sparkling ultraviolet 
airglow caused by the interaction of solar radiation with the 
atmosphere 
it may also show whether the earth is shadowed by a ring of 
interplanetary dust around the sun as some scientists have 
proposed 
all of these observations have another purpose too we may 
learn things about using the spacecraft that would be valuable at 
jupiter said johnson 
finally the earth observations have what johnson calls the 
surprise component the two voyager flights to the outer planets 
consistently revealed features of the planets that hadnt even been 
imagined could a fresh look at earth do the same 
i would not want to bet against finding some things people 
hadnt thought about johnson said who knows

thirtynine nations meet in paris this week on 
the controversial future of antarctica an ap correspondent who has 
been to the disputed continent reports on what is at stake 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
antarctica the last place on earth where nature 
reigns over man is facing a showdown between those who want to tap 
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched 
under ice 
the majestic continent at the bottom of the world larger than 
united states and mexico combined is still peopled by scant 
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes 
although 16 nations fly flags in antarctica and seven claim 
slices of it no one holds title no one needs a passport it is a 
vast global common ruled only by the harsh unforgiving elements 
but statesmen scientists and environmentalists must decide soon 
whether antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen miners 
commercial fishermen hotelkeepers and possibly colonists 
in paris bginning monday 39 nations will review the 1959 
antarctic treaty that expires in 1991 they also will examine the 
remains of the antarctic minerals convention signed in may 1988 
the convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil 
exploration replacing a voluntary moratorium but australia one 
of seven claimant nations with a veto decided not to ratify it 
the united states the soviet union and japan among others are 
pressing for a minerals accord france echoing australias 
concerns wants antarctica to be an unspoiled world park 
delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise the 1988 
convention took six years to negotiate 
proponents say a world short of resources has no choice 
antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold platinum and other 
strategic metals along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the 
billions of barrels 
detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably 
pollutes a reserve crucial to mans survival upsetting its 
delicate balance they say will have consequences no one can 
predict 
undeniably the world is already muscling in penguin livers are 
tainted with pesticides and plastics centuryold garbage litters 
pristine panoramas antarctica has had its first oil spill 
trash thrown into the north sea will eventually settle in 
antarctica the french oceanographer jacquesyves cousteau once 
told the associated press the world is a closed system 
in a more recent interview he railed against plans to exploit 
the last untamed place on earth 
that would be almost criminal at least stupid he said 
it would be a catastrophe 
scientists worry that tourists whose numbers now approach 
10000 a year endanger fragile ecosystems huge ice floes menace 
ships hulls adding a threat of oil pollution 
yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent largely 
unexplored for all of historys daring expeditions that make it 
such a disputed prize 
antarctica is 98 percent under ice but it is no more a white 
continent than africa is a dark one 
old ice grows blue then rich turquoise as the sun shifts its 
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond antarctica is aglow 
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas 
penguin colonies like rushhour crowds dressed in black tie 
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously seals frolic and 
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds 
for all the beauty arguments focus on survival of the planet 
president francois mitterrand of france making the case for a 
world wilderness area told scientists from 40 countries at a june 
meeting its not just the forests the prairies or rivers that 
are in danger its the entire earth 
specialists regard antarctica as the worlds weather factory 
for 10 years scientists there have measured the earths 
thinning ozone layer letting through radiation that risks 
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels 
a new zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over 
antarctica was much more serious than previously believed 
cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites 
calamity for example just scraping the surface of the earth 
spreads dust that alters reflectivity raising temperatures and 
melting ice 
human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds 
and marine mammals scientists say fishing threatens a delicate 
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill a tiny 
shrimp 
in antarctica with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds 
accidents are common once damage is done experience shows it is 
very difficult to correct

nasa starts the countdown monday 
but thursdays launch of the space shuttle atlantis depends on 
whether a federal judge permits its five astronauts to dispatch the 
nuclearpowered galileo probe to jupiter 
antinuclear activists have sued to halt the flight arguing 
that a launch accident could spread radioactive plutonium over 
densely populated parts of florida the space agency maintains the 
danger is almost nonexistent 
both sides will argue their cases in us district court in 
washington dc at 10 am tuesday judge oliver gasch then will 
decide whether to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the 
launch or to let the countdown proceed this is the first time 
anyone has gone to court to stop a nasa launch 
the plutonium argument overshadows the fact that the mission 
involves the most expensive most sophisticated unmanned space 
probe ever built a vehicle one mission official calls the 
rollsroyce of spacecraft 
after a sixyear outward journey galileo priced at 14 
billion is to shoot a probe into jupiters atmosphere and then 
orbit the planet for two years 
mission planners say its investigation of jupiter and its moons 
will be the most scientifically rich that interplanetary 
exploration has witnessed the 1979 voyager views of jupiter and 
its satellites were fascinating but galileos images will be 1000 
times clearer they say 
the countdown is to start at 8 am monday if gasch does not 
rule quickly the count will pause at the 11hour mark for several 
days if necessary awaiting a decision several critical steps 
including fueling the shuttle occur after that point 
if gasch gives the green light and no other problems arise 
atlantis is scheduled to blast off at 129 pm thursday 
the activists vow that if they lose in court they will 
physically try to stop the liftoff 
we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on 
the launch pad said bruce gagnon coordinator for the florida 
coalition of peace and justice one of three groups that filed the 
suit 
extra security measures have been in force several days 
including closing to the public several roads approaching kennedy 
space center these roads are normally closed only on launch days 
nasa officials are concerned that thursdays brief 10minute 
launch window would vanish if protesters penetrate the launch zone 
with a boat or plane in the counts final minutes 
at issue are galileos two generators and their fuel 48 pounds 
of radioactive plutonium238 dioxide 
the activists say that if the space shuttle crashed or exploded 
as the challenger did in 1986 the poisonous plutonium would be 
released into the air 
nasa has said the highest probability of launcharea release 
of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1 in 2500 and 
such a release would have no appreciable adverse effects on the 
population 
the agency quotes health physicists who say this type of 
plutonium is relatively harmless unless a particle is inhaled or 
lodges in an open wound where it could cause cancer generally the 
particles do not travel far in air and can be stopped by a piece of 
paper or unbroken human skin 
in tests empty graphite plutonium containers have been blown 
up shot at and burned to determine how they survive all types of 
accidents they have withstood pressures far greater than those 
generated by the challenger explosion say nasa and the energy 
department which took part in the testing 
the space agency notes that similar generators have flown on 22 
space vehicles including five manned apollo moon missions and 
that in three instances the wellprotected devices survived severe 
accidents two unmanned rockets that blew up in the 1960s and the 
explosion aboard apollo 13 in 1970 which forced abandonment of a 
moon landing 
plutonium 238s normal decay gives off intense heat which 
galileo will convert to electricity no other power source is 
practical for space missions too far from the sun to use solar 
energy 
the five astronauts who will fly the mission say they are not 
concerned about flying with plutonium 
i have no absolutely no qualms about the devices said 
commander donald williams 
pilot mike mcculley was more blunt i dont see how it can 
hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head and thats pretty 
remote i think it is a complete nonissue except as a 
philosophical issue to some people 
my family is going to be down there watching the launch as 
well as other people that i love and so im not concerned about 
it i feel its safe said mission specialist ellen baker 
the other crew members mission specialists shannon lucid and 
franklin changdiaz expressed similar feelings 
six hours after liftoff the astronauts are to release galileo 
from the cargo bay an hour later an attached motor will start the 
6700pound craft on a sixyear trip that will cover 24 billion 
miles on the path to jupiter the largest planet in our solar 
system 
along the way galileo will obtain flyby data about the moon 
venus and at least one asteroid gaspra it will make two return 
swings to within 600 miles of earth 
in december 1995 a 737pound probe released from the spacecraft 
is to plunge into jupiters cloud layers at 115000 mph and make 
the first direct sampling of the jovian atmosphere slowed quickly 
by the thickening atmosphere the probe will pop a parachute and 
transmit data to the galileo mother ship for about an hour as it 
descends about 360 miles before it is crushed and vaporized by 
extreme heat and pressure 
galileo will fire into orbit about the planet and its 10 
scientific instruments will gather information on temperatures 
magnetic fields radiation cloud characteristics and gravity 
fields 
of particular interest will be the dynamics of a weather system 
that produce the everchanging bands whirls and plumes seen from 
earth and from the two voyager spacecraft 
the weather includes storms up to 25000 miles across that have 
raged for centuries among them is the mysterious great red spot 
which the voyagers determined is a tremendous atmospheric storm 
similar to earths hurricanes 
the voyagers also found that jupiter 318 times more massive 
than earth is a whirling ball of mostly liquid hydrogen topped by 
an atmosphere that is mostly hydrogen and helium they discovered a 
narrow ring of debris around the planet and found three new moons 
raising the toal to 16 
the four largest moons bear the same relationship to their 
planet as planets in our solar system do to the sun the nearest 
being solid rock like mercury and the farthest being a slush ball 
with a rock in the center like gaseous neptune 
thus galileo will examine data and transmit pictures of a 
miniature solar system as it orbits jupiter said edward c stone 
professor of physics at the california institute of technology who 
is one of the mission scientists 
galileo will give us more than just snapshots in passing as 
the voyagers did stone said being there and observing over a 
period of nearly two years will allow us to sort out the dynamics 
of jupiter and its moons

once a final deal is cut on taxes the 
republican administration and the democrats who run congress will 
have to find a way to make peace if theyre going to deal with the 
budget crisis 
that will be at least as difficult as the housesenate 
negotiations this week on the misnamed reconciliation bill that is 
supposed to bring the current budget into line with congressional 
goals the tax measure is part of the budget reconciliation bill a 
catchall of contentious issues on which final terms are to be 
worked out this week in conferences working under the pressure of 
an oct 15 deadline 
mutual promises of bipartisan harmony have frayed in the 
struggle over bushs campaignpromised drive for a cut in capital 
gains taxes a twoyear cut from the current maximum of 33 percent 
to 196 percent is on the conference table by house vote a roll 
call on which 64 democrats deserted their new floor leaders 
it got there after a dispute that bruised both sides richard g 
darman the budget director accused the democrats of kamikaze 
politics aimed at forcing a tax increase on bush rep richard a 
gephardt of missouri the majority leader said bush apparently 
agreed with leona helmsley that only little people should pay 
taxes after the house victory bush said he was displeased with 
gephardt for making the issue really kind of personal 
the democratic leadership first had considered tackling the bush 
capital gains measure headon in an upordown test but their own 
vote counts showed them taking a lopsided beating so they 
countered with a retirement account tax break for the uppermiddle 
class plus a tax increase on the wealthiest taxpayers and lost 
anyhow 
the 2000 tax deduction for individual retirement accounts was 
revived in the senate finance committee and the final package could 
include versions of both that tax break and the capital gains 
reduction the senate panel also tossed in an assortment of special 
interest tax breaks and that is likely to complicate the 
congressional negotiations 
the reconciliation bill is an annual exercise that is supposed 
to reduce the budget deficit which keeps going up anyhow even as 
deficit estimates and targets keep going down because of the law 
that is supposed to compel real reductions even if that takes 
automatic spending cuts we have to stop this deficit said 
sen herbert h kohl dwis we have to stop fooling ourselves 
with grammrudman claims of progress which just hide deficits that 
have never declined 
that problem is going to remain after the bill is passed 
whatever the settlement on taxes house speaker thomas s foley 
thinks it may get worse because of the tax fight 
foley said that if the capital gains cut becomes law i am 
worried that it will sap the ability of the two parties to work 
together on meaningful deficit reduction 
there are pressures on both sides to do more campaigning and 
less compromising the democrats new leadership has been 
criticized for lack of a game plan with a clear set of goals as 
alternatives to the bush program activist house republicans 
frustrated at what seems permanent minority status see 
confrontation as a way to start winning more seats 
but foley also thinks it essential that there be a grand 
compromise between the parties in order to deliver a real 
solution to the deficit speaking in minneapolis before the capital 
gains vote the speaker said the parties must be able to cooperate 
so that each can provide the protection to the other party to 
make the hard choices necessary for meaningful deficit reduction 
to do it he said democrats would have to protect republicans 
willing to vote for cuts in costly entitlement programs in order to 
control spending the biggest of the entitlements is social 
security on the other side of the ledger foley said republicans 
would have to be willing to give democrats political cover if they 
were to support higher taxes to reduce deficits 
that would not only be a grand compromise it would be a 
political miracle

if anyone has a surefire way to take the risk 
out of farming without boosting costs to taxpayers let congress 
and the agriculture department know right away 
every year as sure as mother nature changes season floods 
droughts insects and diseases chew away at crops that farm 
families and the rest of the country depend on 
and each year as sure as politicians like to get reelected 
congress comes up with plans to bail out farmers 
economist joe glauber is head of an agriculture department team 
studying ways to change the current federal crop insurance program 
which provides catastrophic risk coverage for farmers 
but glauber who works for the departments economic research 
service says there is a perception among many farmers that if 
there is a widespread natural disaster congress will legislate 
onetime assistance to help the affected producers 
experience since 1980 has proved the perception correct 
a general accounting office study released last month showed 
that the government spent 176 billion from 1980 to 1988 on aid to 
farmers who lost crops because of drought or other natural causes 
the gao report which was requested by a house agriculture 
subcommittee said only about 25 percent of farmers buy federal 
crop insurance because they expect congress to come to their rescue 
whenever there is a major crisis 
as a result of last years drought for example about 4 
billion in direct payments went to farmers under the disaster 
assistance act of 1988 an additional 900 million will go to 
farmers under a 1989 version 
the gao said that in the 198088 period usda spent 69 billion 
on direct assistance to farmers suffering crop losses 64 billion 
on emergency loan programs and 43 billion on subsidies for crop 
insurance 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the subcommittee said 
65 percent to 70 percent participation would be necessary to make 
the usda crop insurance program successful 
government crop insurance there is a federal crop insurance 
corp in usda to handle it goes back decades congress overhauled 
the program in 1980 and for a while there was a widely accepted 
belief that crop insurance should replace disaster assistance 
but record losses to the program and low participation by 
farmers have shown otherwise so as congress gets deeply involved 
in writing an omnibus 1990 farm bill crop insurance is one of the 
major challenges 
one of the major changes in 1980 was an extensive expansion of 
federal coverage before the 1980 act the program operated only in 
selected counties and for selected crops farmers paid the full 
cost of premiums and increases in enrollment were slow because of 
restrictions on selling the insurance in highrisk areas 
but the 1980 law permitted the usda agency to insure any farm 
commodity grown in the united states if yield histories for the 
area were available the program was handled as much as possible by 
private companies 
to encourage greater participation the law allowed a 30 percent 
subsidy of premiums for policies that guarantee farmers 50 percent 
or 65 percent of their normal yields and a somewhat smaller 
subsidy if 75 percent guarantees are selected 
in the usda study economist glaubers team looked at four 
alternatives to the current system including compulsory crop 
insurance for farmers enrolled in federal commodity programs that 
provide price supports and other benefits another plan would make 
compulsory crop insurance free to farmers 
the third alternative would replace crop insurance with a 
permanent disaster payment program and the fourth would provide a 
catastrophic risk management program tied to commodity programs 
and based on target revenues 
a report in this months farmline magazine looks at the glauber 
study including pros and cons of each 
high participation by farmers in the commodity support programs 
would ensure high participation in crop insurance under the 
compulsory package glauber found it also would negate the need 
for disaster assistance for crop producers 
there is however a chance that compulsory crop insurance 
might have little effect toward meeting the governments goal of 
eliminating ad hoc congressionally legislated disaster 
assistance the report added 
even so the study found that total costs to the government 
under the compulsory option would likely be less than the combined 
cost of the current program and ad hoc assistance provided by 
congress 
free crop insurance could boost farmer participation in annual 
commodity programs meaning government costs would increase for 
price support operations 
a permanent disaster assistance program to replace crop 
insurance would be the most expensive of all possibly exceeding 
the 4 billion paid to farmers in 1988 glauber found 
looking at the target revenue option the chief attraction would 
be income stability for farmers he said the program would replace 
both the crop insurance and the direct subsidy or deficiency 
payment used in the annual commodity programs 
depending on the specifics federal costs of a target revenue 
program could soar by more than 30 percent from current levels 
glauber said

business executives expectations for higher 
sales and profits in the coming months have dropped to the lowest 
levels in four years according to a national survey 
after two years of consistently strong expectations business 
executives are getting skittish joseph w duncan corporate 
economist and chief statistician for dun amp bradstreet corp said 
wednesday in a statement announcing the results 
the nationwide quarterly survey of 1500 executives in 
manufacturing retailing and wholesaling concerned their outlook 
for the last three months of 1989 
a welcome sign was that while optimism about sales and profits 
faded expectations for higher prices and inventories also dropped 
thus two of the major factors that have fueled recent 
recessions inflation and excess inventories appear to be well 
under control duncan said 
retailers expectations for gains in sales and profits in the 
fourth quarter dropped sharply to the lowest levels since the 
fourth quarter of 1983 
retailers were surprisingly optimistic in the fourth quarter 
last year and this years expectations are more in line with 
recent retailsales statistics duncan said 
for the executives as a whole the sales optimism index of the 
outlook for the fourth quarter fell to 60 down seven points from 
this years third quarter and 10 points from the fourth quarter of 
1988 it was the lowest since a reading of 55 in the second quarter 
of 1983 
the profits optimism index fell to 54 down seven points from 
this years third quarter and down 13 points from the fourth 
quarter of 1988 the index has not been lower since the second 
quarter of 1983 it was at the same level at the end of 1985 
among the other measures expectations for price and inventory 
increases were at the lowest since 1987 and expectations for 
employment increases were at the lowest since the end of 1986 
the indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of 
respondents expecting decreases from the percentage expecting 
increases

international business machine corp 
chairman john akers says ibms lowerthanexpected 1989 earnings do 
not point to a management problem within the computer giant 
its not totally unusual that technology companies such as ibm 
have those types of problems akers said wednesday of the recent 
announcement to delay introduction of ibms highpowered disk drive 
for data storage 
last week ibm said its earnings for the third quarter and 1989 
would fall below market analysts expectations the announcement 
sent ibm stock tumbling 
akers told reporters this reflected no management problem in 
addition to the diskdrive delay he mentioned the rise of the 
dollar which reduced the dollar value of foreign profits and 
increased use of leasing which spreads out the revenue received 
from equipment placements 
akers said he expected ibms growth in europe to outpace that of 
its competitors ibms business in europe is growing in 
european currencies at 15 percent or better he said 
yet he said ibm has no plans to expand its 109000strong 
european workforce he said the highest growth market was asia 
where ibm continues to expand its workforce 
worldwide the company employs about 387112 people 
in the last five years ibm has cut its workforce without 
layoffs by about 25000 in the united states where the market has 
been growing at half the pace of europe akers said 
he said ibm will continue to carefully observe our 
manufacturing operations and overhead structure within the us

ibm is negotiating to participate in european programs to 
develop semiconductor technology including the 4 billion

a new generation of digital audio tape recorders 
including one small enough to slip into a purse and others capable 
of nearflawless direct digital recordings from compact discs 
debuted at the japan audio fair 
the models are the first to be introduced since record and 
electronic industry groups agreed in july on a new worldwide dat 
standard that opens the way for widespread marketing of the 
highquality recording equipment 
aiwa said wednesday its new hdx1 dat recorder is the smallest 
on the market at 37 inches by 57 inches with an extra adapter 
the 13pound machine also can record video up to 3600 still 
images on a twohour tape 
the model will go on sale in japan on oct 21 for 555 aiwa 
spokesman kohji morino said the cheapest previous dat machines in 
japan cost about 720 
but like japanese dat recorders manufactured before the july 
agreement the hdx1 cant make direct digital recordings from cds 
and instead must convert their signals to analog form resulting in 
a slight degradation of sound quality 
aiwa expects to redesign the hdx1 after official approval is 
given to the new international dat standard and wont export it 
until then morino said 
both dats and compact discs use digital technology to reproduce 
music with low noise and distortion and high dynamic range 
but sales have been disappointing during dat equipments 2 
years on the market in japan because of high prices and initial 
opposition from record industry groups which feared that dats 
ability to make highquality tape recordings would encourage 
pirating 
under the july agreement new dat equipment will be able to make 
nearperfect direct digital recordings from digital sources such as 
cds but will add a flag signal to the tape to prevent any 
secondgeneration copies from being made 
jvc pioneer sony technics and other makers displayed new dat 
models meeting the new standard but said marketing would be 
delayed until government agencies in japan and overseas give their 
approval 
companies in the lead hope to market their new models by 
january or february said naomichi kohri of jvc and i think 
were one of the companies out in front 
kohri said jvc hopes to sell the cheapest of its three new dat 
models for less than 720 but were not sure whether well be 
able to manage it yet 
dats havent caught on because their cost is still rather 
high a denon official said but were optimistic that the 
market will start improving soon after the new recorders come 
out 
like new models from other firms sonys new recorder shows that 
dats have become a technically mature product inside the sony 
model there no longer is a maze of wires since much of the complex 
circuitry has been incorporated into new integrated circuits 
but with sales of dats finally expected to rise sony officials 
displayed what they said will become the ultimate sound recording 
device a compact disc recorder 
technically its ready but were facing the same copyright 
problems as dats said gen ichimura a sony technician well 
have to wait until they are solved 
the machine called a rewritable compact disc magnetic optical 
recorder uses the same digital circuitry as cd players but in 
addition to playing regular cds it can record on disks made of a 
special alloy by magnetizing minute spots on the surface that then 
deflect light corresponding to the pits on the surface of a cd 
sony says the disks can be rerecorded 10 million times and have 
the same life as a regular cd the cd magnetic optical recorders 
will cost about the same as current cd players while the special 
disks will be cheaper than regular cds ichimura said

deloitte haskins and sells say they will merge their british 
practices creating britains largest accounting firm

combination of deloitte haskins and sells and touche ross 
international to be known as deloitte ross tohmatsu 
the deloitte partners in britain announced tuesday they had 
decided not to take part in that merger and to link with coopers

and fee income of about 670 million a year 
similar deals might be made at other coopers and deloitte firms 
around the world partners of the two firms said at a london news 
conference they declined to be more specific 
the merger would be beneficial to both companies because of 
strategic compatibility and similar chemistries said john 
bullock senior partner at deloittes london office 
a name for the newly created firm hasnt been chosen bullock 
said 
the touche ross firm in britain which has 4000 employees will 
be the only british arm of deloitte ross tohmatsu 
officials of deloitte and touche in the united states who are 
trying to put together the firms global merger declined comment on 
the defection of the british arm of deloitte 
two other major accounting firms arthur andersen and price 
waterhouse last month ended merger talks which would have created

federal reserve board governor martha r seger 
says that the central bank has achieved a hopedfor soft 
landing in the nations economy and that inflation does not 
appear to be a major threat 
inflation should continue to be reasonably wellcontained 
through 1990 barring any dramatic developments in food and energy 
markets or sharp moves in the dollar she said in remarks 
prepared for delivery wednesday in new york there are many 
reasons to be pleased with our economic performance over the past 
year she said in her prepared text 
she spoke at the 29th annual business outlook conference 
sponsored by the conference board a private business research 
group 
the recent data suggest that we have succeeded in achieving 
such a soft landing she said in her prepared remarks pointing 
to the 2 percent economic growth estimated for the first half of 
1989 and the modestgrowth predictions for the remainder 
a soft landing is a term often used by economists in 
describing a condition when economic growth slows just enough to 
keep inflation in check but not enough to topple the country into a 
recession 
despite some softness in the goodsproducing industries labor 
demand overall has remained firm seger said the unemployment 
rates has held steady at about 525 percent since late 1988 the 
lowest since the 1970s 
the underlying rate of inflation which seemed to be ticking 
up earlier this year has edged back down consumer spending 
seems to have recovered some momentum and housing activity appears 
to have bottomed out 
seger said the feds decision to tighten its credit policy by 
driving up interest rates in late 1988 and early this year played 
a key role in defusing inflation concerns she said the feds 
strategy will continued to be centered on stable prices 
but seger hinted that she and other fed members were concerned 
about what effect the dollars rise and fall in foreign exchange 
will have on future interest rates and the economy in general 
a higher dollar could hurt the growth of exports and appears to 
have already had some effect she said the limited information 
on foreign orders points to some slowing in the months ahead 
in setting policy we must be realistic about the effects of 
such developments seger said 
the dollar had risen sharply against major foreign currencies 
over the summer due to firmness in us interest rates it has 
fallen off recently following a concerted effort by the fed and 
other major central banks to drive it down

pfizer inc says it has begun marketing 
procardia xl extended release tablets a drug available by 
prescription for onceaday treatment of angina and hypertension 
analysts say wednesday the drug should be even more successful 
than the original procardia because it sharply reduces side effects 
of the threetimesaday capsules such as dizziness flushing an 
accelerated heart rate and nausea 
we anticipate that procardia xl will become the most 
significant cardiovascular drug in the united states market said 
richard stover a new yorkbased analyst for alex brown amp sons inc 
pfizers announcement of the drugs availability comes nearly a 
month after the food and drug administration approved procardia xl 
for the treatment of both conditions 
in the interim pfizer said that the new drug was shipped to 
pharmacies and is now available should physicians decide to 
prescribe it for their patients 
pfizer said about 25 million people in the us suffer from 
angina and 60 million from hypertension 
procardia xl is a formulation of pfizers calcium channel 
blocker procardia nifedipine which has been marketed in the 
united states for the treatment of angina since 1982 
but it offers some differences compared with procardia capsules 
which pfizer says are one of the most widely prescribed medications 
in the country 
in addition to its approved use in treatment of hypertension as 
well as angina procardia xl makes use of a novel drug delivery 
system that releases the medicine into the body at a steady rate 
over a full 24hour period 
dr john jefferis a senior vice presidentmedical at pfizer 
pharmaceuticals said procardia xl is also economical with an 
equivalent daily dosage priced lower than that charged for other 
capsules 
pfizer said for instance that the average daily cost to a 
patient for procardia capsules was estimated at 147 a day in 
midseptember compared with 121 for the same number of milligrams 
of procardia xl

us policy makers must guard against creating 
a society of haves and have nots as they consider how to 
nurture development of sophisticated voice data and video services 
in the 21st century a house panel was told 
the government also must make sure that average taxpayers dont 
end up footing the bill for futuristic telcommunications services 
they dont really need said janice obuchowski assistant secretary 
of commerce for communications and information 
we have to sort of guard against technological elitism 
obuchowski said wednesday citing the potential of a future in 
which only a few major institutions and large corporations have 
access to supercomputers and advanced communications networks 
historically the government has had to assure there is no 
havesorhavenots situation she told the house energy and 
commerce telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
in communications that has meant giving all citizens universal 
access to telephones the government now must decide she said 
whether the concept of universal service should extend to services 
in which fiberoptic transmission systems will be capable of 
carrying mountains of voice data and video signals directly to 
homes and businesses 
at the same time the government as it decides whether to be a 
leader coordinator or adviser in this telecommunications 
revolution must see that the consumer as obuchowski said has 
happened in japan does not pay a premium for something they 
dont need just to benefit overseas competitiveness 
rep edward markey dmass saying that development of such 
services is critical to the future of the united states 
pressed obuchowski on what the bush administration planned to do to 
make sure the united states does not get left behind by japan and 
western europe which are spending billions in the rush to build 
21st century telecommunications highways 
she said the commerce departments national telecommunications 
and information administration which she heads was preparing a 
report that would lay out the administrations position on how it 
should aid the us telecommunications industry either as 
financial backer coach or leader 
the administration last month proposed a fiveyear 19 billion 
program to promote advanced computing technology including the 
creation of a very highspeed national research and education 
network to link the nations supercomputers 
sen albert gore dtenn and rep doug walgren dpa also 
have proposed a similar program which would commit 175 billion 
over five years 
but markey and rep don ritter rpa said they feared an 
advanced computing network would be useful only to the elite at 
major universities and research centers and a few large businesses 
without providing onramps and offramps for the average 
citizen or small college or business

the machinists union after sparking a 
paralyzing walkout at eastern airlines earlier this year has made 
another bold move by striking against boeing co 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers 57000strong at boeing and a major force in the airline 
industry remains fiercely loyal to traditional trade unionism 
during an era of union compromises wage concessions and 
employeemanagement buyouts 
in addition to the boeing walkout machinists union members 
wednesday entered the eighth month of their strike against eastern 
and were holding out against joining pilots and management at ual 
corp in a proposed 675 billion buyout of that company the 
parent of united airlines 
they are probably the most militant of the unions said 
louis marckesano an airline analyst at the philadelphia brokerage 
janney montgomery scott inc they are a tough union 
they can afford to be members of the 850000worker union have 
skills that often give them an edge in the job market and make them 
difficult to replace 
at seattlebased boeing the worlds biggest commercial aircraft 
manufacturer the union represents the bulk of the companys 
production workers they perform tasks ranging from riveting 
wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and 
machinetool maintenance 
they have a much better labor market than everyone else 
said peter cappelli an associate professor of management at the 
university of pennsylvanias wharton school 
for the last decade or so the machinists have been the union 
most strongly opposed to wage concessions and changes in the 
traditional adversary relationship between labor and management 
cappelli said 
thats why they have refused so far to participate in the 
planned buyout of ual which proposes worker wage concessions in 
return for a majority ownership stake but the machinists are 
expected to ask ual soon to negotiate a new labor contract and the 
union could use the issue of its participation as a bargaining chip 
in the talks 
industry analysts believe the pilotmanagement takeover could 
succeed without the machinists who have had a rocky relationship 
in recent years with the pilots at united 
in contrast at eastern the pilots walked out in sympathy with 
the machinists temporarily shutting down the miamibased carrier 
and driving it into bankruptcy court in early march but that 
strike has left thousands of machinists pilots and flight 
attendants without jobs as eastern hired and trained replacement 
workers 
eastern and boeing are worlds apart the aerospace giant is 
prosperous with an order backlog of nearly 1600 commercial jets 
worth about 70 billion the machinists at boeing are much younger 
on the average than their counterparts at eastern and the union 
leadership at boeing didnt have a clear idea beforehand of whether 
they would vote to strike according to a union operative who asked 
not to be identified 
machinists leaders and spokesmen at their national headquarters 
in washington were unavailable for comment wednesday 
despite the bitter setback at eastern the strike strengthened 
the resolve of machinists around the nation and made them more 
willing to fight for their demands union activists say 
william f genoese director of the teamsters unions airline 
division suggested that airlines waiting for their new jets also 
might apply pressure to boeing by threatening to turn to other 
manufacturers 
boeing is a different type of situation and i think its going 
to be very effective said genoese who is based in new york i 
think the machinists are in a pretty good situation to get what 
they want 
unlike the teamsters the machinists union is marked by the 
autonomy of its local chapters charles bryan the leader of the 
machinists at eastern exercised a strong leadership role and was a 
thorn in the side of former eastern chairman frank borman and 
current boss frank lorenzo 
still machinists have long looked to their national leadership 
for inspiration and tactical direction 
william winpisinger the unapologetic outspoken machinists 
leader often labeled a socialist by critics recently retired 
after 12 years as the unions president his successor former 
union vice president george kourpias is expected to maintain the 
traditions 
while winpy has been the ideological standardbearer of the 
union its tactical chief in airline matters is john peterpaul a 
vice president who once worked as an airline mechanic and has a 
commercial pilots license

automakers have closed the books on the 1989 
model year pleased as sales came in a little higher than expected 
but perhaps worried about what lies ahead 
domestic and overseas automakers reported they sold nearly 153 
million cars and light trucks in the united states during the 1989 
model year which began oct 1 1988 and ended saturday it 
appears that when heavy truck sales are reported in a few weeks 
1989 will become the fifthbest model year in automotive history 
auto company executives and analysts had predicted that 1989 
modelyear sales would be about 15 million stemming from a 
softening economy and slackening demand for cars 
clearly the dire predictions expressed by many analysts 
during the spring and early summer did not materialize said 
robert rewey vice president for sales for fords north american 
automotive operations 
the 1989 sales figure 19 percent lower than 1988 sales was 
helped by an 87 percent rise in domestic car and truck sales 
during the sept 2130 period over the same time last year 
general motors corp said wednesday its late september light 
truck sales soared 453 percent over last years levels ford motor 
cos truck sales during the period were down 9 percent from last 
year while chrysler corps were up 6 percent 
for all of september gm reported light truck sales ran 423 
percent ahead of last years pace truck sales at ford fell 44 
percent and chryslers were up 08 percent for the month 
industry truck sales may increase for the eighth consecutive 
model year with gm truck sales approaching 18 million and setting 
an industry record said james fitzpatrick vice president of the 
gm marketing and product planning staff 
gm led the modelyear truck charge with sales 61 percent ahead 
of last year chryslers truck sales were up 16 percent while 
fords were down 18 percent for the 1989 model year 
on the car side among the big three only ford reported a gain 
during the 1989 model year with sales rising 32 percent over the 
1988 figure gms car sales were off 18 percent and chryslers 
were down 75 percent 
for late september gm car sales were up 137 percent and were 
up 106 percent for the entire month at chrysler lateseptember 
sales were down 126 percent and down 25 percent for the month 
fords lateseptember sales were up 60 percent and for the month 
ford car sales were up 21 percent 
despite the seemingly healthy numbers some analysts recently 
have expressed concern that sales during the third quarter of 1989 
were fueled by consumers who had planned to buy in the current 
quarter but acted early out of fear of 1990 price increases and the 
possibility of fading incentives 
what scares me a little bit is i think the faucet will shut 
off general manager alan helfman of river oaks chryslerplymouth 
in houston said wednesday but he said as soon as they hit some 
rebates on those 90s that faucet is going to open up again 
each of the big three already has offered incentives on a 
limited number of 1990 vehicles but they arent being offered to 
consumers at the same level as were rebates and lowinterest 
financing deals just three or four months ago 
however some widespread dealer incentives are in effect 
especially at gm the nations largest carmaker

california did not deliberately underpay 
thousands of secretaries nurses clerks and other women workers a 
federal judge ruled in dismissing the countrys largest 
comparable worth lawsuit 
wednesdays ruling dealt what could be a fatal blow to the 
lawsuit filed on behalf of 60000 or more past and present women 
employees by the california state employees association which 
claimed the state deliberately discriminated against women in 
setting salaries 
the union was shocked and disappointed by the ruling 
president margaret dean said in a statement 
csea regrets the decision but in no way regrets filing the 
case we know that we brought to light a deliberate policy to pay 
women less than men 
the union said it did not know if it would appeal us district 
judge marilyn hall patels decision which upheld the states 
argument that women in femaledominated jobs didnt suffer 
discrimination because their pay scales reflected levels in the 
private sector 
were obviously excited about the decision said christopher 
waddell chief counsel for the state department of personnel 
administration we perceive of this as being the core of the 
case 
patel a former lawyer for the national organization of women 
left open the possibility that the union could try to prove illegal 
discrimination through the effect of state salary and job 
classifications on womens pay levels a recent us supreme court 
ruling however has made that kind of suit much more difficult to 
prove without proof of deliberate discrimination 
the union failed to carry its burden of proof of showing 
that california intentionally discriminated against female 
employees patel ruled 
the state produced credible evidence that its job classification 
system which dates from the 1930s reflected market rates and a 
state survey of job duties and responsibilities patel said 
a state can rely on market rates in setting salaries even if it 
knowingly pays less to women as a result according to a 1985 
ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals the ruling was 
written by anthony kennedy who has since become a us supreme 
court justice 
his ruling which is binding on federal courts in california and 
eight other western states has crippled lawsuits based on 
comparable worth the doctrine that jobs with equal skill 
effort and responsibility should be paid equally 
but relying on the marketplace enables employers to 
institutionalize discrimination against women and minorities said 
nancy davis of equal rights advocates a san francisco feminist law 
firm involved in the lawsuit 
it has been our position that the market itself is 
discriminatory if you accept the marketplace defense youre caught 
in a vicious cycle youll never break out of she said 
the union filed the suit in 1984 claiming workers in 
predominantly female state jobs were deliberately underpaid for 
decades because they were women it sought hundreds of millions of 
dollars in back pay 
the union has resisted calling its suit a comparable worth 
case saying it was a conventional claim of sex discrimination but 
it has been generally described as a comparable worth suit because 
it is based on pay disparities between different types of jobs 
rather than unequal pay between men and women at the same job 
as an example the suit said stenographers 99 percent of them 
women were being paid 1107 to 1283 a month while 
groundskeepers 96 percent of them men were making 1342 to 
1523 licensed vocational nurses 88 percent female started at 
1376 a month while automotive equipment operators 99 percent 
male started at 1645 according to the suit 
patel said that while women in femaledominated jobs had lower 
salaries than workers in maledominated jobs pay for those women 
employees matched pay for similar private jobs male state 
employees on the other hand generally were paid less than their 
counterparts in the private sector patel said

the us dollar gained against the japanese yen 
today despite expectations of higher west german interest rates 
and share prices on the tokyo stock exchange rose too 
the dollar closed at 14105 yen up 045 yen from wednesdays 
close of 14060 yen 
many investors stayed on the sidelines to see whether west 
germanys central bank due to meet later in the day would raise 
interest rates said a dealer with a major commercial bank 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
while dealers expect the german bank to raise interest rates 
many believe the dollar will remain strong anyway 
higher interest rates in a country tend to make its currency 
more attractive to foreign investors at the expense of other 
currencies 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 1643 points wednesday added another 14019 
points or 040 percent closing at 3552299

the united mine workers of america is joining 
the aflcio four decades after john l lewis set the union on a 
course of independence because of a bitter feud with other labor 
leaders 
the umws executive board wednesday requested affiliation with 
the 14 million member aflcio whose governing body is expected to 
unanimously welcome its newest member in time for the federations 
convention next month 
this decision is a further indication of the strong spirit of 
solidarity that is manifest throughout the entire labor movement 
aflcio president lane kirkland said in a statement 
umw president richard trumka said the unions board decided 
that it is once again time for the umwa to apply for membership in 
the national labor federation formalizing our evercloser working 
relations with the aflcio and its member unions 
good relations between trumka and kirkland and cooperation 
between the umw and the aflcio in recent years have fueled 
constant speculation about the affiliation 
kirkland in 1983 became the first aflcio president to address 
a umw convention and in 1985 trumka became the first umw chief to 
speak at an aflcio convention 
the aflcio and its unions have been highly supportive of the 
umw in its bitter ongoing strike against the pittston coal group 
the umw in turn has been working to help other unions in recent 
strikes particularly those against eastern airlines and regional 
telephone companies 
affiliation also has been seen as a logical course for the umw 
because of a precipitous decline in membership which peaked at 
nearly 600000 in the 1940s but has fallen below 100000 
lewis pulled the union from the american federation of labor in 
1936 to help found the rival congress of industrial organizations 
he rose to cio president but resigned after franklin d 
roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940 lewis a republican 
a year later carried out his promise to pull the umw from the group 
if roosevelt was reelected 
the umw rejoined the afl in 1946 but left the next year lewis 
told the afl of the decision in a terse note to federation 
president william green 
we disaffiliate the note said 
lewis was heirapparent to green but was irate that the afl 
negotiated a compromise with federal officials who wanted union 
leaders to sign affidavits saying they werent members of communist 
organizations or didnt sympathize with communists 
among those who helped negotiate the compromise was george 
meany who succeeded green 
the afl and cio merged in 1955 lewis retired in 1960 
meany was aflcio president until he retired and was succeeded 
by kirkland a decade ago

president bushs choice to head natural 
resource policies at the agriculture department says hes learned 
a lot during a confirmation process that included harsh criticism 
from members of the senate agriculture committee 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee charged 
wednesday that james cason catered to special interest groups 
during his sevenyear tenure in a variety of highranking interior 
department posts 
time and again hes chosen the timber interests over the 
public the oil interests over the public and the mining interests 
over the public leahy said in the second day of the confirmation 
hearing 
when given a choice mr cason picked the special interests 
over the public trust 
cason 35 said he had learned a lot and been exposed to new 
opinions during the confirmation process 
he told leahy if he becomes assistant secretary of agriculture 
for natural resources and the environment he would appreciate 
your continued advice on what the right thing is sometimes it is 
difficult to know what is the right thing 
the committee will vote on the nomination after a closed debate 
on whether to recommend that the full senate approve him 
leahy made no secret of his problems with casons record saying 
at one point we dont need another james watt 
testifying against cason was max peterson who from 1979 to 1987 
ran the national forest service an agency under the assistant 
secretarys job that cason seeks 
peterson said the decisions cason made at the interior 
department were uniformly bad when measured against any 
reasonable standard of what is good for the public 
however patty mcdonald executive director of the public lands 
council said cason understands the multiple use mission of the 
assistant agriculture secretarys job 
mcdonalds group represents 27000 cattle and sheep producers 
whose livestock graze on public lands 
casons management abilities were questioned by sen thomas 
daschle dsd who said a general accounting office report showed 
that a system under casons jurisdiction for finding violators of 
mining laws has been defective for four years 
cason blamed the computer system and said the problems were 
being worked out 
it says something about management when after four years 
it didnt get better daschle said

consultant felice schwartz denied she 
advocates a deadend mommy track for working mothers she said 
her studies show the need for managers to be flexible in finding 
ways for career women to rise to the top 
ms schwartz told an audience of newspaper editors wednesday 
that managers especially in the media need to study changing 
patterns in the work force where she says women will account for 
60 percent of the increase in the labor force by the year 2000 
i believe women have had a harder time in the media than any 
other field she said in a luncheon address to the associated 
press managing editors convention she also told the editors that 
media women reacted with more hostility than women in any other 
field when they questioned her about a harvard business review 
article this year outlining her views on management women and the 
new facts of life 
feminist groups accused ms schwartz of encouraging management 
to put women down and push them out if they want to take time to 
raise a family while the article never used the term mommy track 
it did say the cost of employing women was greater than the cost of 
employing men because some women leave to have children 
the point of the article was that corporate leaders have to be 
more flexible in accommodating the needs of women because the end 
of the baby boom means employers will have to rely more on women to 
fill top ranks ms schwartz said 
she said it is a lesson that media management is slow in 
learning with women accounting for twothirds of the graduates of 
journalism schools 57 percent of the entry level media jobs but 
just one of three management positions and only 13 percent of 
newspaper publishers 
given the large number of women in the lower levels of media 
employment its discouraging when the pyramid narrows women 
continue to be squeezed out she said 
the best young women graduating from journalism schools will be 
looking to see if there are women at the top of their prospective 
employers she said if there arent she told the editors 
youll never be able to recruit the best and the brightest your 
newspaper no longer will be able to stand up to the competition 
ms schwartz said that while some media groups have made great 
strides the industry must follow the numerous corporations that 
provide flexible working conditions for women such as jobsharing 
and parttime scheduling in the legal and accounting professions 
how can a woman hope to get past the entry level if she faces 
a daily deadline not only of getting out a story but also picking 
up her children from school ms schwartz asked 
she said it is important for women and management to openly 
discuss their needs and for management to remove obstacles to 
promotion for dedicated women who also want a family life 
making such subjects taboo will shortchange women and business 
she said 
there no longer will be abundant male talent to meet your 
management needs but women are ready she told the editors

texas oilman t boone pickens says he wont take 
part in a special shareholders meeting of a japanese autoparts 
maker saying he thinks management is plotting to manipulate the 
outcome 
pickens said he will instead look for other ways to establish 
his rights as the companys largest shareholder 
we will not take part in a special sham shareholders 
meeting pickens said pickens has invested more than 1 billion 
to acquire a 26 percent stake in the company 
after upping his stock from 20 percent pickens indicated last 
month he might call for a special meeting but pickens said 
wednesday koito chairman takao matsuura and toyota are already 
conspiring to orchestrate the meeting to a predetermined 
conclusion 
toyota motor co is the major customer for the headlights koito 
manufactures and several koito board members are current or former 
toyota executives koito disputes pickens contention however 
that toyota controls three board seats 
the recent actions of koito toyota and other shareholders 
reinforce our assessment of japans rigged corporate system a 
system that is closed to outsiders pickens said 
sidney l tassin a partner in boone co pickens dallasbased 
investment arm said theyve already got everybody lined up over 
there to defend against a shareholder meeting its clear that that 
will not be an effective event were going to try some other 
angles 
since becoming koitos largest shareholder earlier this year 
pickens has been rebuffed in attempts to gain seats on the 
20member board he has said the actions indicate that japan is 
closed to foreign investors 
pickens also has asked the board to increase its dividends 
through distributing about 8 million the company received from 
japanese investor kitaro watanabe who was ordered to return 
profits from speculating in the companys stock pickens bought 
most of his koito holdings from watanabe or affiliates 
because he has held at least 10 percent of koito stock for at 
least six months pickens can call for a stockholders meeting at 
any time and tassin said that option still could be exercised 
as a major shareholder pickens also has rights of access to 
some information including accounting and financial records 
there are other types of business transactions that we can get in 
a position to influence or approve tassin said 
pickens said he has written other koito shareholders asking 
their opinion of and support for increasing the dividend but has 
received no replies he said he will send a second letter before 
determining further actions 
koito has said it will deal cautiously with pickens because of 
his ties to watanabe who twice has attempted to get the company to 
repurchase his shares at a premium before he sold them to pickens

kh corp formerly fruehauf corp has 
agreed to an amended purchase offer from tonontobased varity corp 
totaling about 560 million in cash and securities a spokesman 
said 
the offer is subject to approval by shareholders of both 
companies at meetings to be held on nov 29 said kh spokesman 
david hladik on wednesday 
the two companies have been in negotiations since august when 
kh said it had failed to meet terms of an agreement to sell the 
kelsey hayes co aluminum wheel and braking system business to 
varity for 650 million in cash notes and stock 
kh is the last remaining business of the dismantled fruehauf 
corp which changed its name to kh corp after selling its 
trucktrailer and maritime operations to californiabased terex 
corp in july the trucktrailer operation continues as fruehauf 
trailer corp a terex subsidiary 
varity formerly known as masseyferguson said in august it was 
reevaluating its offer for kh because the 233 million kh 
received from terex was 25 million to 30 million short of 
projections 
the kh board agreed to varitys new proposal tuesday night 
hladik said 
among other changes varity cut the cash it is offering to 413 
million from 66 million cut the number of varity shares offered 
to 378 million from 555 million and increased the amount of 
kelseyhayes notes it would guarantee to 4368 million from 430 
million hladik said

opec nations kept their oil production 
at a high level in september pumping well above the output ceiling 
just set by cartel officials according to estimates released on 
thursday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
lifted about 223 million barrels of crude a day in september the 
same as in august 
most of the higher output in august and september was from the 
persian gulf countries although production in iran and iraq fell 
slightly in september said the report by the parisbased agency 
ian graham an analyst at county natwest in london predicted 
the cartels production would pick up a bit more in october likely 
to about 225 million barrels a day 
some countries he said will widen their taps to meet the 
higher output quotas set last week by opec ministers meeting in 
geneva 
during their talks the officials decided to boost their overall 
production ceiling from 195 million barrels a day to 205 million 
barrels in the last three months of the year 
the increase of 1 million barrels in the ceiling was divided 
proportionately among all 13 member countries giving each a little 
more than under the current accord 
led by kuwait and the united arab emirates the cartel has been 
producing well above its supply cap in recent months 
despite the flood of oil prices have remained steady in recent 
months reflecting strong consumer demand for the commodity 
however prices remain under opecs target of 18 a barrel the 
average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec was 
1682 a barrel in the last week of september 
west texas intermediate the benchmark american brand has 
topped the 20abarrel mark in recent days middle eastern brands 
run about 3 a barrel less 
the energy agency estimated total consumption of oil excluding 
centrally planned economies at 521 million barrels a day in 1989 
rising to 538 million barrels in the first quarter of next year 
demand for opec oil was estimated at 222 million barrels in the 
januarymarch period of 1990 
graham said kuwait and the united arab emirates might trim their 
output some in coming months to reflect a little more 
discipline after the geneva meeting 
the two gulf countries have been overproducing to draw attention 
to their demands for higher shares of opecs total production 
the ministers were scheduled to meet in late november in vienna 
austria to map their strategy for the first half of 1990 they 
were also expected to take up the sensitive issue of reallocating 
output shares 
the energy agencys report estimated the united arab emirates 
supplied 22 million barrels a day in september double its quota 
of about a million barrels kuwaits production was put at 17 
million barrels a day compared with its cap of a million barrels 
nigeria produced about 18 million barrels a day last month up 
from its quota of 14 million barrels a day according to the 
report 
saudi arabia the worlds no 1 crude exporter pumped an 
estimated 5 million barrels a day above its target of 48 million 
barrels 
iran and iraq each lifted about 28 million barrels a day the 
same as their quotas 
other production estimates for september were qatar 400000 
barrels a day libya 11 million barrels algeria 700000 
barrels gabon 200000 barrels venezuela 17 million barrels 
ecuador 300000 barrels and indonesia 12 million barrels

cooperation and development made up of twodozen industrialized

two former researchers at a johnson amp 
johnson subsidiary say the company concealed vital information 
about a painkiller linked to at least nine deaths before it was 
pulled from the market 
in a lawsuit filed in superior court the former mcneil 
pharmaceutical employees allege johnson amp johnson conspired to get 
drugs on the market even if they were medically inadequate and 
maximize sales regardless of consequences 
the two dr edward lemanowicz mcneil former assistant director 
of regulatory affairs and dr james dale a former assistant 
director of medical research also contend they were forced out of 
mcneil for criticizing the drug zomax 
a prescription painkiller developed in the 1970s zomax was 
pulled from the market in 1983 after more than 2000 reports of 
violent reactions and at least nine deaths 
johnson amp johnson based in new brunswick issued a statement 
wednesday disputing the lawsuits allegations the company said the 
drug was taken off the market voluntarily because reports of 
allergic reactions had increased 
there is no basis for their charge that johnson amp johnson and 
mcneil pharmaceutical falsified or delayed reporting any data about 
zomax or any other drug the statement said 
the researchers allege that testing on the drug before it was 
put on the market was insufficient and that mcneil mishandled 
reports of adverse reactions among patients that began coming in 
after it was put on the market 
the researchers are seeking compensation for lost wages and 
possible punitive damages they werent actually fired after 
raising objections but were sent into a kind of corporate 
siberia said their attorney allan kanner

the government plans to halve canadas passenger 
train service next year and said it is willing to hear offers from 
the private sector to take over any route especially those 
attractive to tourists 
the long awaited announcement wednesday in ottawa was part of 
prime minister brian mulroneys program intended to trim the budget 
deficit opposition leaders pledged to fight it saying it would 
destroy the governmentrun service known as via rail 
they have turned the national dream into a national 
nightmare john turner leader of the opposition liberal party 
said the last spike has become the last straw 
transport minister benoit bouchard said the cuts to be made jan 
15 will allow the government to reduce its annual via rail 
subsidies now at 640 million to 350 million by 1993 
via rail president ron lawless said of a total of about 7300 
employees 2761 will lose their jobs mainly in 1990 
the cuts will leave via rail operating three weekly trains 
linking central canada with the east and west coasts a major chunk 
of its existing service along the populous corridor between quebec 
city quebec and windsor ontario a couple of regional routes 
and eight remote services 
mulroney attempted to ease the political impact by announcing a 
government commission would study all forms of passenger 
transportation in canada preparing for the next century but it was 
not clear whether rail service would be restored if the commission 
recommends it 
bouchard said the commission will investigate the best ways to 
move canadians between the countrys major cities and what such a 
system could cost 
he also said privatization that would improve service would be 
welcome every route is up for sale he said at a news 
conference 
the rail system played an important role in the eastwest 
development of canada the worlds secondlargest country so the 
proposal to reduce service can touch emotional chords 
among the services cut would be the canadian the domed western 
scenic train that is featured on many posters and postcards 
ed broadbent leader of the socialist new democratic party and 
another key opposition figure said the cuts were a disgrace and 
would affect the countrys poorest regions the most 
broadbent said public opinion could be mobilized to change the 
plan i think the government could be persuaded to come to its 
senses again he said

the bundesbank west germanys central bank today announced it 
has raised its key lending rates by 1 percent and other european 
central banks quickly followed with similar rate hikes 
the move appeared to be aimed at curbing inflation and 
supporting european currencies which have weakened against the 
dollar despite concerted central bank intervention in recent days 
the widely expected announcement by the bundesbank sent the 
dollar sliding in frankfurt the us currency dropped one pfennig 
to 18653 marks from 18760 in early morning trading in london the 
dollar which had risen against the pound on wednesday fell to 
16165 from 16055 
currency analysts said before the announcement that a 
halfpercentage point increase already was factored into the market 
and would not affect the dollar but that a bigger increase would 
dampen the us currency 
the bundesbank set the new discount rate at 6 percent with the 
lombard rate at 8 percent it was the fourth interestrate rise 
this year for the west german central bank 
meanwhile central banks in britain austria and the netherlands 
raised their rates by 1 percent to 15 percent 65 percent and 7 
percent respectively 
the bank of france increased its key rate by 34 percent to 95 
percent and the five to 10day repurchase rate by the same amount 
to 1025 percent and the swiss national bank boosted its discount 
rate by a half percentage point to 6 percent 
the discount rate is the cheapest or bottom rate at which a 
bank can borrow funds using treasury bills as collateral nearly 
half of bank financing comes from discount rate funds in west 
germany 
the lombard rate is the rate at which european central banks 
loan shortterm funds using securities as collateral its the 
ceiling of the money market rates banks normally borrow lombard 
funds only in emergency 
bundesbank officials in a statement released to the news media 
said the rate increases the fourth since the beginning of the 
year were intended to combat continued inflationary danger 
resulting from the countrys strong economy 
some commercial banks in europe followed the central banks 
announcement with rate increases of their own

when a leading japanese businessman and an 
outspoken politician collaborated on a book urging japan to stand 
up to its huge ally the united states their message was not 
intended for export 
but an unauthorized english translation of the japan that can 
say no has forced both the authors and publisher to deal with 
heated criticism from washington 
to a certain extent we expected a fuss abroad said hiroshi 
endo who supervised the kobunsha publishing companys handling of 
the work but we think some of the reaction in the us is too 
emotional and created by congressmen who want to use antijapan 
themes to get votes 
endo said vocal opposition on capitol hill has been led by 
representative mel levine dcal and that levine commissioned a 
74page translation that circulated in congress in august 
written by akio morita cofounder of the sony corp and 
shintaro ishihara a former novelist cabinet minister and 
candidate for prime minister the 160page original examines 
japans relations with the united states and the two nations 
frequent trade frictions 
while morita argues that the united states must regain the 
competitiveness its industries once enjoyed and scolds american 
managers shortsightedness ishihara laments a wimpish japan 
constantly capitulating to us pressure 
a chapter by ishihara the more aggressive of the two authors 
delves into what he sees as latent bigotry behind washingtons 
dealings with tokyo 
i believe at the base of the friction between the united 
states and japan is racial prejudice ishihara wrote the white 
race and particularly american whites he wrote have become 
overly proud of their civilization 
he went on to say that realizing their culture is declining 
the american whites fear of losing leadership to the yellow race 
japanese has clouded their perspective of japan 
ishihara was a darkhorse candidate to replace former prime 
minister sousuke uno who stepped down aug 9 to accept 
responsibility for the governing liberal democratic partys losses 
in a parliamentary election the month before backed by some of the 
partys right wing ishihara finished third in the threeman race 
though the book caused some howls in washington it made few 
waves among the intended audience the japanese 
most of what mr ishihara and mr morita are stressing in 
their book is not new and has been expressed privately by 
japanese journalists and businessmen who deal with america 
wrote taro kimura a former anchorman for the japan broadcasting 
corp television network 
kimura in a column published recently by the daily tokyo 
shimbun said the bluntness of the opinions might have shocked some 
americans who are used to dealing with more reticent japanese 
kimura argued that his countrymen should learn from the american 
ability to speak out and debate issues headon 
it is conceivable that the controversy surrounding this book 
may have been exaggerated by japan treating the comments of these 
two men as a seed of danger in usjapan relations is an overly 
japanese way of thinking he concluded 
the japan that can say no is under heavy criticism in the 
united states said a recent article in the conservative weekly 
shukan bunshun magazine but what is it about this book written 
with the intention of improving the deteriorating usjapan 
relationship that is so antiamerican and arrogant 
kobunshas endo believes the book may have touched a sore nerve 
by among other things suggesting japan could drastically alter 
the superpowers military balance by selling its technology to the 
soviets 
in 1986 toshiba machine co was accused of selling restricted 
hightech equipment to the soviet union prompting tough criticism 
from congress which claimed the equipment helped the soviets build 
hardertodetect submarines by enabling them to make quieter 
propeller blades 
washington later punished toshiba machines giant parent 
company the toshiba corp by prohibiting it from exporting goods 
to the united states for three years beginning in 1988 the us 
action was widely denounced in japan 
the chapter on racial prejudice may have also been sensitive 
because americans are more conscious of racial issues than japanese 
are endo said but we hope readers will be reasonable when 
they make their decisions about what they agree or disagree with 
instead of simply claiming its all wrong 
though endo and ishihara have complained that mistakes in the 
english translation added fuel to the fire an official version may 
not be in the works 
we hope to publish a translation but the authors have not 
decided whether that is what they want its still under 
negotiation endo said 
coauthor ishihara was quoted as telling the shukan bunshun i 
wrote the book with japanese readers in mind and though of course 
im not saying that the same things cant be said to americans i 
dont recognize the significance of hurrying a translation out in 
america 
for endo however this cloud has a silver lining 
sales are very good thanks to the controversy in washington 
he said adding that roughly 70000 copies have been sold 
endo said sales were brisk soon after the book was released in 
late january and a slump that followed has been more than made up 
for since august when reports of the congressional response 
appeared in japans press

its no fort knox but on an average 
night about 500 million passes through iowas capital 
the money is in checks those millions of pieces of paper that 
glue the american economy together 
mixed in with the social security benefit checks and payments on 
telephone and electric bills are transactions ranging from a 40 
cent prize to a first round sweepstakes winner to a 1 rebate 
for the purchase of a womens shaver 
there also is a check for 8724995 to an excavating company 
paid by a citys treasury 15749475 sent from one financial 
services company to another and a 26 million governmentrelated 
deposit with a bank 
an economy is not going to work unless there are transactions 
and cash is not practical says david lawrence a banking 
professor at drake university 
in some of those transactions the amount is not worth the paper 
it is written on 
linda conley who has been shifting bundles of checks at the 
federal reserve regional check processing center at des moines for 
16 years occasionally comes across one made out to no dollars and 
no cents 
its the type of transaction that keeps certain investment or 
bank accounts active even if no money changes hands 
there are 12 million checks processed before every sunrise at 
the des moines center each averaging about 450 and an additional 
12500 in checks returned for problems ranging from missing 
signatures to insufficient funds 
each must be credited to the recipients account and deducted 
from the payees 
were like a factory here our product is taking bundles of 
checks reading those checks bundling them and delivering them 
somewhere says edward ketchmark an assistant vice president of 
the federal reserve bank of chicago who manages the des moines 
operation 
what seems like a flood of paper passing through des moines is a 
trickle in a roaring river nationwide 
last year the federal reserve system processed more than 183 
billion checks totaling more than 124 trillion including 
personal and corporate checks postal money orders and government 
checks 
for the fed its an industry 
among other things it requires a fleet of fed airplanes to 
ferry the paper hardware capable of sorting 300000 checks an 
hour and business hours that get frenetic after most offices have 
closed 
the arcane paper shuffling that makes the checking system work 
could be replaced if the economy adopted an electronic system that 
made cash and checks obsolete but until then theres no real 
alternative lawrence says 
it takes squads of clerks at each financial institution and an 
army of federal employees to make the system work 
sarah fatino of des moines has a job that would intimidate 
anyone who cant balance a checkbook 
the 17year veteran tracks discrepancies between what banks say 
their checks total and what fed computers say they have processed 
in one case fed computers say a bank in northwest iowa was 
516 too low when it added bundles of checks totaling 
169046220 
by matching computer records with the piles of checks she found 
a 20 travelers check tallied by the bank as 1484 
nearby ms fatino is kurt chapman of des moines operating a 
burroughs 9195 sorter processing outofstate checks the machine 
counter looks like a digital watch gone wild 
each of those checks is bound for one of the other 47 fed 
processing centers around the country 
the sorter scans the numbers along the bottom left side of each 
check 
in iowa for example checks drawn on banks in 93 of the states 
99 counties begin with the numbers 0739 or 0730 the 07 stands for 
the 7th federal reserve district based in chicago the 3 is for 
the des moines center the 0 stands for des moines banks and the 9 
stands for banks outside des moines but within the district 
numbers on checks from credit unions and savings and loans in 
the processing centers district begin with a 27 to distinguish 
them the numbers that follow the first four digits identify the 
bank savings and loan or credit union where the check is drawn 
chapman whips rubber bands from around his fist wraps bundles 
of checks and puts them in bins the checks must be sorted by 130 
am to make the feds interdistrict transportation system flight 
out of des moines 
you have to make sure you put the bundle in the right spot 
says chapman 22 who has been doing the job for 2 years if it 
goes to the wrong bank you the check processing center have to 
pay interest on it it could be a million dollar check 
sometimes he consults a computer that tells him how many items 
have been processed the percentage rejected by the sorter and how 
many checks have been handled before the first paper jam 
maybe the check has been folded ripped or smeared by grease or 
peanut butter 
in the slow period 1045 pm to 1145 pm 33315 items have 
run through the machine with fewer than 1 percent rejected the 
first jam occurred after 16657 checks had passed through 
the process is accelerating under a federal law aimed at 
reducing the wait before an individual can use funds deposited by 
check 
as of sept 1 1990 financial institutions generally will have 
up to two business days after a local check has been deposited to 
make the money available to a customer and up to five days for 
checks from outoftown 
the expedited funds availability act of 1987 still is in the 
transition phase but already it has changed the way americans 
endorse checks and affected the operations of payroll departments 
printing companies and makers of banking equipment 
individuals now have just 1 inches on the rear of a check for 
their endorsement 
the bank accepting the check for deposit which is at risk if 
the check is not honored by the issuing bank has a space 
immediately below the endorsement reserved for its endorsement 
which must be in black or purple ink 
the remaining three inches is set aside for any other financial 
institution that handles the check including those that refuse to 
honor the check those endorsements must not be printed in purple 
ink 
with every institution handling a check leaving its stamp on the 
document such attention to detail is an attempt to give processors 
a helping hand especially when they have to backtrack a check that 
has bounced 
looking at the back of a check is like a very difficult 
puzzle its been handled by so many financial institutions the 
trail gets pretty cold says ketchmark sometime you need some 
really sharp people to determine the bank of first deposit

when subaruisuzu automotive inc 
celebrates the opening of its assembly plant in lafayette later 
this month workers will carry a portable japanese shrine weighing 
as much as a ton 
some industry analysts say the jointventure company may bear a 
greater burden the challenge of competing as the smallest japanese 
auto transplant in the united states 
i think its going to be a very tough road to profitability 
said charles j brady of oppenheimer amp co in new york there is 
a potential to be profitable but it certainly wont be easy 
subaruisuzu which will showcase the plant to the public during 
a week of grand opening celebrations beginning oct 15 started 
production of its first subaru legacy cars and isuzu pickup trucks 
in early september 
the company has said that when it reaches full production with 
two shifts sometime after next june it should be able to produce 
120000 vehicles annually a phasetwo expansion of the plant 
originally was projected to boost production to 240000 vehicles 
but has since been scaled back to 200000 
the start of production follows an occasionally tempestuous 
three years since the announcement that the joint venture by two of 
japans smallest automakers would build its 550 million plant at 
the intersection of interstate 65 and ind 38 southeast of 
lafayette 
the announcement was welcomed by a city still smarting from 
losing to normal ill in the competition for the 
chryslermitsubishi plant a year earlier it bestowed pride on a 
state commerce department that had succeeded after repeated 
failure in landing a japanese auto plant 
that pride soured however when the states top commerce 
official lt gov john mutz ran for governor last year his 
opponent democratic secretary of state evan bayh lambasted mutz 
in campaign ads saying the state had paid too dearly when it 
provided subaruisuzu with 86 million in incentives bayh won 
he is among the dignitaries scheduled to attend the grand 
opening a symbol perhaps of the harmony that subaruisuzu 
executives and production associates extol when asked why they 
work there 
subarus parent company fuji heavy industries ltd owns 51 
percent of the joint venture and isuzu motors ltd owns 49 percent 
general motors corp owns 42 percent of isuzu about 60 japanese 
managers and administrators will be employed at the joint venture 
rick mckinnon who came as vice president of manufacturing after 
23 years with gm said he was lured by the japanese team philosophy 
in which workers share tasks in groups and provide greater input 
into decisionmaking 
they look for team players and team involvement and in my 
personal involvement here with the management team i feel much more 
of a team player here than i did at general motors mckinnon said 
mark skidmore 35 of lafayette a team leader in paint 
maintenance went to japan for three months of training he said 
his team practices selfmanagement they tackle a maintenance call 
at first then some team members leave for other tasks as the 
problem at hand is reduced 
skidmore who previously worked at the aluminum company of 
america plant a couple of miles down the highway is sold on the 
japanese work ethic 
they care about what they sell american companies have lost 
that caring he said 
he and mckinnon are among about 600 employees at the joint 
venture christine miller chief spokeswoman for the plant said it 
expects to employ about 1200 by yearend and 1700 when it reaches 
full capacity in its first phase sometime after a second 
production shift is added in june 
the number of employees could reach 3200 under the second 
phase but miller and mckinnon did not disclose a timetable for the 
expansion 
the production will be split between subarus and isuzus with 
the legacy and isuzu pickup the first to be produced early next 
year the isuzu line will produce a sport utility vehicle similar to 
the current trooper model 
the second phase originally was forecast to raise production to 
240000 vehicles annually but miller said that total has been 
reduced to 200000 so the plant would not violate an airpollution 
permit 
i dont believe thats the real reason said kathleen 
heaney an auto analyst with nikko securities co international 
inc in new york i bet its a slow market 
subaru is already trying to sell the legacy as an import and 
is not doing that well theyre bringing in a brand new model and 
theyre not competing heaney said i think the isuzu part 
will do better than the subaru 
thomas gibson president of subaru of america recent told the 
trade publication automotive news that sales of the legacy have 
been disappointing not as well as id like 
oppenheimers analyst brady noted the joint venture was 
increasing the supply of vehicles when demand was weak subaru has 
heavily discounted prices to reduce inventories 
the legacy is offering me the same kind of vehicle as the 
toyota camry the mazda 626 or the honda accord brady said i 
dont know if the legacy being a new nameplate commands the same 
kind of respect those other vehicles do 
asked to speculate on whether this japanese transplant might be 
the first to fail brady said i think its the leader in term of 
betting right now 
the joint ventures president tamon yamamoto has said the 
company cannot survive unless it boosts production but some 
analysts disagree 
ron glantz of montgomery securities inc in san francisco for 
example said the venture can survive by producing a smaller volume 
of vehicles 
another uncertainty is unionization william e osos who 
directs activities of the united auto workers in kentucky and 
indiana said he hopes the strength unions enjoy in indiana will 
help when the uaw attempts to organize the plant 
workers rejected the uaw in a recent election at the nissan 
motor co assembly plant at smyrna tenn but the union 
successfully organized employees at the chryslermitsubishi venture 
in illinois diamondstar motors co 
figures supplied by the local chamber of commerce show the 
eightcounty area around lafayette with 47 percent unionization in 
manufacturing companies that compared with 81 percent in 
indianapolis 88 percent in fort wayne 84 percent in south bend 
and 94 percent in gary 
subaruisuzus policy miller said is because we embrace 
and endorse the team concept we do not feel a third party is 
needed

it is perhaps no small irony that a 
highly sought japanese auto plant was built on a road known as the 
bataan memorial highway memorializing a bitter us defeat to the 
japanese on a philippine peninsula and the resulting death 
march in which thousands died 
or is it 
the bataan highway signs are down because of road improvements 
but there are no plans to change the name of ind 38 the address 
of subaruisuzu automotive inc which is bringing as many as 3200 
jobs to the lafayette area mayor james riehle said 
its a reminder at least in my style of thinking of the 
horrors of war riehle said 
dont forget it was the united states that helped rebuild 
japanese industry after the destruction wrought by world war ii he 
said 
you can say their success has been our success too 
the success or failure of the joint venture wont be known for 
years but already lafayette has succeeded in recruiting what will 
be its largest employer after purdue university in spurring other 
development and in laying the groundwork for future expansion of 
the city 
projects that had been planned for some time in the future are 
being looked at and perhaps expedited said riehle who has been 
mayor 17 years 
those projects include a 33 percent upgrade in the capacity of 
the wastewater treatment plant and extension of a 24inch water 
main southeast of the city into an area that basically doubles the 
infrastructure for business 
it gave the county a whole new system of expansion said 
susan quick a local property broker retailers are starting to 
look at this area much more closely 
ms quick is codeveloper of park east a 247acre retail 
office and warehousing development planned along ind 26 east of 
lafayette and a couple of miles north of the japanese auto plant 
the project predates the plant but ms quick cannot ignore her new 
neighbor 
the car plant was just great for us 
ms quick said she and others in the community believed at first 
there was no need for a huge auto plant that might upset the 
balance of an already thriving community with an unemployment rate 
of 3 percent 
mark s davis president of the greater lafayette progress inc 
and the leader of local development efforts said the joint venture 
offered the local economy diversification and highpaying jobs with 
good benefits 
these are the best manufacturing jobs we could go after 
davis said it gets into fairness or equity not everybody wants 
to be a software engineer 
the lafayette area has lost many other jobs recently including 
about 600 at general foods and 250 each at pillsbury and north 
american phillips operations davis said 
economic development is not a game it is a deadly serious 
business with human family impacts the deaths are not the issue 
births are the issue if youre creating jobs your community will 
continue to prosper davis said 
nonetheless the plant also has stirred some fear and prejudice 
the rev carl malmgren pastor of the first baptist church said 
the arrival of the plant fueled unfounded rumors that japanese were 
buying a local country club to indulge their passion for golf 
they were uglier aspects too some people who got jobs at the 
new plant were isolated by former coworkers malmgren said 
i think the big thing is fear that gets played on fear of 
the unknown fear of things we have no control over malgren 
said i dont really believe the arrival of the japanese is the 
issue the issue is change that can no longer be handled 
the japanese became a lightning rod

the french government defying strong us 
objections intends to sell brazil rocket engine technology that 
could be converted to ballistic missile use and wind up in the 
hands of enemy states us officials said today 
the bush administration is studying whether it can do anything 
to reverse the french decision which was made personally by 
president francois mitterrand last month said the officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the deal calls for france to transfer to brazil the technology 
of a liquid fuel motor called viking which is also used in the 
french ariane rockets the officials said 
france has promised to place restrictions on the sale so that 
the motor is only used for peaceful space programs but the united 
states contends such safeguards cannot be implemented 
us officials noted that brazil and libya are cooperating in an 
attempt to develop ballistic missile boosters and said the french 
technology could be passed to libya for that project 
if someone like libya wants to use this motor to harmful 
purposes who will stop them said one official 
the united states first protested the planned french sale last 
july during the sevennation economic summit in paris the official 
said 
for a while it appeared the protest had stopped the french plan 
the officials said 
but the french government reconsidered its decision when it 
appeared france stood to lose a lucrative contract for the launch 
of two brazilian communication satellites on the ariane launch 
vehicle the officials said 
st louisbased mcdonnell douglas corp which is competing with 
the french company arianespace for the 60 million contract was 
informed by brazil of frances intention to transfer the viking 
technology to the brazilians the officials said 
china also bid for the launch contract but could not meet the 
deadlines and withdrew the officials said 
word of the dispute between france and the united states was 
first reported by signal magazine published by the armed forces 
communications and electronic association

sony is buying columbia pictures daiichi 
kangyo bank is acquiring cit group beacham group has merged with 
smithkline beckman other foreign companies have targeted american 
businesses ranging from airlines to tiremakers 
are overseas investors buying the us out from under us is it 
time to panic 
that depends on whom you ask 
we should be delighted said economist ward mccarthy it 
will reinvigorate our economy 
in the global market money flows from one country to another 
and that means new capital for firms and industries that need it in 
the united states said mccarthy of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc 
the government also appears unconcerned 
it shows confidence in the us economy and the longterm 
outlook for the nation said the commerce departments chief 
economist tony villamil 
furthermore foreigners havent taken that big a bite of the 
united states villamil said 
us firms owned 10 percent or more by a foreign firm or 
individual accounts for only 13 percent of the total value of us 
tangible assets and real estate assets he said 
but some congressmen say there should be more regulation of 
takeovers by foreigners their concern has been heightened by the 
current takeover battle in britain over bat industries plc because 
bats batus inc subsidiary owns major insurance retailing 
tobbaco and paper companies in this country 
a group of lawmakers sent a letter to secretary of state james 
a baker iii warning that bats suitors led by financier sir james 
goldsmith could break up batus without concern for the effect on 
the workers citizens or environment of the communities in which 
batus operates 
even without the bat situation many americans are concerned 
because of a spate of highly visible foreign acquisitions that at 
least give the appearance that the united states is in danger of 
losing control of its economic destiny 
last year for example 
grand metropolitan plc of britain bought pillsbury co for 
568 billion 
canadas campeau corp purchased federated department stores 
inc for 66 billion 
firestone tire amp rubber co was bought by bridgestone corp of 
japan fo 265 billion 1988 
sony purchased cbs records for 2 billion 
in recent weeks stockholders approved the 16 billion merger of 
smithkline with britains beacham sony agreed to pay 34 billion 
for columbia pictures and manufacturers hanover trust co decided 
to sell its cit group unit to daiichi kangyo for 128 billion 
these sound like big numbers but according to villamil direct 
foreign investment in the united states amounts to about 330 
billion roughly equal to american investment overseas 
he warned that americans cannot discriminate against foreign 
investors and still expect other countries to open their markets to 
us dollars 
during the first three quarters of this year foreigners 
acquired 177 us companies totaling 4125 billion compared with 
165 firms worth 5655 billion in the same period of 1988 
according to securities data co a newark njbased research 
firm the figures were based on transactions worth at least 10 
million 
foreign interest in us companies burgeoned in the mid1980s 
after the dollar began to decline and american targets became 
relative bargains for businessmen seeking to expand in this country 
in early 1985 for example it took as much as 262 japanese yen 
to buy a single us dollar today a japanese investor needs to 
put up only about 140 yen for each 1 in american assets or stock 
economist mccarthy says nationalism is behind many of the 
objections to foreign takeovers theres a feeling why do we 
need someone else to do it according to robert b reich a 
professor of political economics and management at harvard 
universitys john f kennedy school of government foreigners are 
only catching up to the american takeover strategists 
we were the ones who started the takeover craziness in the 
1970s said reich its hypocritical of us to be turning around 
and saying its unfair the bush administration like the reagan 
administration before it has no desire to stop foreign buyouts of 
us firms but congress has given the government some power to 
intervene in certain transactions 
last years trade act includes a provision giving the president 
authority to block takeovers by foreigners if there is credible 
evidence the acquirers might take steps that could harm national 
security 
citing national security concerns the transportation department 
has intervened in two airline deals recently the 365 billion 
takeover of nwa inc northwest airlines parent and the proposed 
675 billion buyout of united airlines owner ual corp because 
foreign airlines were acquiring substantial stakes in the us 
carriers 
in the northwest buyout klm royal dutch airlines had planned to 
acquire a 57 percent stake but us officials ordered that the 
buyout be restructured and that klms holdings be reduced to 25 
percent 
officials are still studying the united deal in which british 
airways would hold a 15 percent stake 
transportation secretary samuel skinner has said the 
governments actions were not meant to discourage foreign 
investment here 
the issue he said was more military than economic during 
testimony on capitol hill he noted that under the federal aviation 
act congress wished to safeguard national security by ensuring 
that us air carriers would provide aircraft to the armed forces 
in times of war or national emergency 
the fight over bat has officials and labor unions upset because 
they believe bats us companies and their thousands of workers 
are pawns in a foreign game and there is little anyone in the 
united states can do 
their fears are not unfounded goldsmith who wants to break up 
bat has already lined up a buyer for farmers insurance group inc 
which bat won just last year in a takeover fight of its own bat 
itself plans to sell its saks fifth avenue and marshall fields 
store chains as part of its defense strategy 
besides expressing their outrage to the state department 
several lawmakers sought the help of the securities and exchange 
commission but the agency said it did not have the authority to 
intervene in the battle 
dan goelzer sec general counsel explained in an interview that 
we wouldnt have regular jurisdiction because the offer wasnt 
being extended to shareholders in the us 
goldsmiths opponents here are hinging their hopes on the fact 
that he cannot acquire farmers without winning approval from each 
of the nine states where the insurance company operates 
but reich the harvard professor said americans should not be 
worried about foreigners taking over us firms theyd be in the 
exact same quandary if the company were owned by an american 
theres no clear difference in the behavior of foreign 
companies or american companies he said the mere fact they 
fly under a foreign flag doesnt mean the takeover game is played 
any meaner

new york developer donald trump today made an 
unsolicited 7 billion proposal to acquire amr corp the parent of 
american airlines amr announced 
a buyout at the price proposed by trump if actually completed 
would be the biggest airline purchase ever 
american spokesman al becker said the company had received a 
unilateral unsolicited letter proposing a 120 a share buyout 
by trump who bought eastern airlines northeast shuttle service in 
march for 365 million 
after an initial trading delay amr stock opened at 107 a share 
on the new york stock exchange up sharply from its wednesday close 
of 8275 the shares had settled back to 104 by early afternoon 
in new york 
news of trumps move pushed the dow jones average of 20 
transportation issues up 3787 points to 150498 
given the cast of characters the lack of information right 
now i feel like trumps got a tough row to hoe said kevin 
burke who follows the airline industry for first union corp a 
bank holding company in charlotte nc 
burke said the 120 offer was at the high end of analysts 
estimates of amrs worth it also came as a surprise especially 
since it was his opening salvo so to speak you would think he 
would have a few ducks in reserve he said 
trump was not immediately available to discuss his offer and 
amr officials refused to go beyond their early morning statement 
with 589 million outstanding common shares of amr stock a 120 
a share offer would be worth more than 7 billion 
the biggest airline buyout ever was an investor groups 365 
billion purchase of nwa inc parent of northwest airlines earlier 
this year a group led by united airlines pilots and senior 
management has offered to buy that carriers parent ual corp for 
675 billion but the proposal remains pending 
amr has been the focus of heated takeover speculation recently 
and last week asked the securities and exchange commission to 
investigate financial wire reports about takeover rumors 
trumps letter stated that his offer was subject to the 
execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive acquisition 
agreement and that trump believes that the financing necessary 
for the proposed transaction will be obtained within a reasonable 
period of time 
amrs board of directors will consider trumps offer in due 
course becker said from amr headquarters in fort worth 
becker stated there has been no change in amrs policy that 
amr and its shareholders will be best served by amr remaining an 
independent company and continuing the strong partnership among 
american airlines its employees the communities it serves and 
the public a partnership that has given amr the great success it 
enjoys today 
amr also stated that it continues to believe that excess levels 
of debt in the airline industry are not in the public interest 
in august amr stock jumped 12 percent as reports circulated 
that the company had retained two investment firms to help defend 
against any takeover 
news reports said amr had retained salomon brothers inc and 
goldman sachs and amp co to advise the fort worthbased company but 
amr would neither confirm nor deny the report 
amr estimated by some analysts to be worth 114 per share in a 
takeover had adopted a shareholders right plan designed to make a 
buyout more expensive 
within the past year american has replaced united as the 
nations biggest carrier and has embarked on a multibilliondollar 
expansion program that includes scores of new jets plus a new 
maintenance facility and plans for a 1 billion terminal at its 
base at dallasfort worth international airport 
amr posted a profit of 1779 million or 283 a share in the 
three months ended june 30 on revenue of 272 billion that 
compared with a profit of 1414 million or 236 a share on 
revenue of 216 billion in the year earlier period

a sovietamerican working group is seeking 
100 million from us investors for a venture capital fund to 
develop hightechnology companies in the soviet union 
the american money is being sought by the soviet unions 
technology innovations production co which was recently set up 
to bypass the cumbersome soviet bureaucracy and develop new 
technologies 
an agreement to seek money for the fund was signed wednesday at 
a meeting sponsored by the geonomics institute an independent 
conference center institute spokesman george bellerose said 
signers included nikolai volkov the head of the new soviet 
company and alexander belov an america watcher at the institute 
for the study of the usa and canada also signing were michel 
claudon head of the geonomics institute and graham taylor a san 
francisco lawyer who is chairman of the working group 
this is the most progressive and effective way to somehow 
promote our economic activities belov said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
about a half dozen prominent american venture capitalists 
attended the threeday vermont conference but were not willing to 
have their names released because they have not yet decided whether 
to commit money to the fund bellerose said 
a small group of americans including some venture capitalists 
plan to travel to moscow in november to review potential investment 
projects with the soviets a soviet delegation will visit 
middlebury next spring to continue the work 
individual investors would be required to put up a minimum of 
500000 
the soviet government has backed the proposal and is considering 
establishing freetrade zones and technology parks in the ussr to 
house the joint sovietwestern companies the international group 
hopes will sprout said alexander belov a soviet theoretician who 
helped develop the plan 
plans call for the first new technology park to be built outside 
moscow within two years he said 
the plan follows changes in soviet policy in the last two years 
opening the country to western investment 
the agreement rose out of three weeks of discussions earlier 
this year between a small group of western and soviet economists 
government officials and businessmen at the geonomics institute 
which is based on the campus of middlebury college 
taylor who has dealt with the soviets as a partner in a law 
firm involved with international companies said the soviets blew 
my socks off by agreeing to the joint venture capital plan so 
quickly 
accustomed to long delays even in getting letters answered he 
said he was surprised when the soviets agreed to allow joint 
sovietwestern venture companies set up outside the soviet union 
exporting is the major target of the joint venture plan 
said michael p claudon president of the geonomics institute 
few joint ventures with western businesses have succeeded 
because of a failing economy and bloated soviet bureaucracy the 
new approach includes not only joint manufacturing ventures but 
training of soviet executives by their western counterparts and 
other economic changes 
the goal is to have one company operating by the end of 
december according to a letter of intent signed by two americans 
and a soviet delegate to the conference

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday censured prudentialbache securities inc for what it said 
were violations of securities laws in several transactions 
the sec said prudentialbache failed to maintain possession or 
control of 218 million worth of securities that were pledged as 
collateral in socalled custody repurchase agreements between the 
firm and large institutional clients the total involved 90 
security positions and the alleged violations occurred during five 
days in late february and early march 1988 prudentialbache 
settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt 
prudentialbache said in a statement that the alleged violations 
did not affect client accounts or the firms more than 13 billion 
in capital 
prudentialbache officials said the violations were caused by a 
computer programming deficiency that failed to account for the 
purchase of the large blocks of securities on the same day 
unlike repurchase agreements where securities are physically 
delivered in exchange for money brokerages hold onto the 
securities in holdincustody pacts the arrangement typically is 
used for overnight or shortterm placements of blocks of securities 
in this case prudentialbache failed to account for the 
securities in its records even though it already had paid for them 
officials with the brokerage said 
prudentialbache noted that in the violations the difference 
in question amounted to approximately onehalf of 1 percent of 13 
billion in repurchase agreements during the five days in 
question 
among the charges the sec said prudentialbache sold and 
delivered to a trusteee of a mortgage obligation about 38 security 
positions that had been pledged as collateral without substituting 
other securities 
the firm also was charged with several recordkeeping violations 
prudentialbache agreed to set up guidelines to comply with sec 
rules and to hire an outside public accountant to evaluate the 
firms policies regarding the holdincustody transactions 
no fine or other penalty was assessed

point but not for long

opec and the european community ended 
an era of confrontational tactics thursday and took the first step 
toward closer cooperation between the oilproducing nations and 
their european consumers 
subroto secretarygeneral of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries met with officials of the trading 
bloc in the first such highlevel contacts between the two groups 
the two sides agreed to set up a working group to discuss 
possible areas of cooperation particularly on environmental issues 
antonio cardoso e cunha the communitys top energy official 
said that beginning from a very practical basis we can 
progressively go up into the deepest political cooperation 
the more we can see a clear picture of these things the 
better he told reporters we are in favor of sharing efforts 
in that direction 
subroto the former indonesian oil minister said there is a 
need for cooperation by the major players in the oil industry 
we feel that the best way is to start from the lower level 
among technical groups he said these contacts he said could 
then be elevated to higher level political discussions within a 
short period of time 
he said his visit reflected the end of the 1980s an era marked 
by confrontational attitudes between oil producers and consumers 
we are now entering a new period he said the 1990s opens 
the possibilities for cooperation a period that can prevent the 
price shocks of the past from happening 
cardosa e cunha said however no agreements were reached on 
ways to maintain price stability 
imports of opec crude oil and oil products account for about 53 
percent of the domestic oil consumption of the 12nation community 
also known as the common market 
later subroto told the royal institute of international 
relations that the chances were slight of another price shock like 
those in 1973 and 197980 even if opec were to play a more 
dominant role in the oil market in the future 
the fear that now exists mostly among people that are not 
very sympathetic to opec is that once a sellers market will 
return another price shock will happen he said 
but he said that is unlikely to happen 
another oil shock he said would have a devastating effect on 
the economies not only of the industrialized countries but also 
on those of the major producers whose economies to a large extent 
respond to stimuli from the industrialized economies

prices for 1990 model bmw cars will be 
frozen or reduced and the west german automakers us arm is 
ending rebates a company executive said thursday 
the announcement came a day after volkswagen of america the 
us marketing arm of west germanys volkswagen ag said it was 
cutting prices on volkswagens by an average of 75 percent and on 
audis by 82 percent and was getting rid of incentives 
bmw said instead of offering rebates it will give certificates 
to owners of bmw 5 and 7series automobiles except for the 
topoftheline 750il that are good toward a new bmw 
owners of 5series cars will receive 1000 certificates and 
owners of 7series automobiles will get certificates worth 2500 
bmw officials insisted that the certificates were not rebates or 
incentives they said use of incentives damaged the resale value of 
the car 
no certificates would be issued to owners of 3series or 750il 
cars the 1990 prices for them are staying the same as in 1989 
the certificates apparently were being used in part to soothe 
5and 7series customers who will see the 1990 prices for their 
model cars drop between 49 and 93 percent from 1989 levels 
bmws retail prices for 1990 will range from 24650 for the 
325i twodoor to 70000 for the 750il 
ron tonkin president of the national automobile dealers 
association has been campaigning for an end to rebates saying 
they give business owners less freedom in setting their own prices 
as they make deals with customers 
ford motor co announced a new incentive program for 1990 
vehicles with cash rebates ranging from 500 to 1250 on a wide 
range of cars and trucks or lowinterest financing ranging from 69 
percent to 109 percent depending on the term of the loan 
also on thursday 
mercedesbenz of north america announced that prices for its 
1990 cars would increase an average of 22 percent and range from 
31600 to 83500 
hyundai motor america said its 1990 cars would cost an average 
of 31 percent more than in 1989 ranging from 5899 to 13739 
toyota said prices for its celica line of cars would rise an 
average of 09 percent in the 1990 model year over 1989 prices and

the dollar took a surprising leap in hectic 
trading thursday defying efforts by european central banks to 
drive the currency lower by raising interest rates 
the west german central bank led the rate hike boosting its key 
lending rates by 1 percentage point bringing the discount rate to 
6 percent and the lombard rate to 8 percent it was quickly matched 
by britain austria and the netherlands france and switzerland 
announced smaller increases 
but the dollar after falling briefly staged a surprising 
reversal against all major currencies except the british pound 
surpassing levels before the interestrate announcement 
the feeling was that the dollar would take a brief hit then 
buying would come in said william sterling manager of 
international economics for merrill lynch amp co but so many 
people were waiting to buy on the dip that the dip never got below 
186 marks thats a testimony to the strong demand for dollars 
by international investors and corporations 
in europe the dollar closed at 18845 west german marks up 
from 18770 in new york the dollar traded at 18848 west german 
marks higher than 18815 on wednesday 
the dollar closed at 14105 japanese yen in tokyo up from 
14060 yen in london the currency traded at 14230 yen compared 
with 14105 on wednesday in new york the dollar rose to 14255 
up from 141475 
but in london one british pound cost 16100 more for buyers 
than wednesdays late 16055 after the bank of england raised 
interest rates by 1 percentage point to 15 percent in new york 
trading the pound changed hands at 16115 more expensive than 
16020 late wednesday 
analysts said the interestrate hikes were intended as the 
second phase of a twopart effort by industrialized countries to 
push the dollar lower and stem inflationary pressures making their 
currencies more attractive to investors 
the first step began last week with central banks selling 
dollars in a coordinated effort following a meeting of the group of 
seven industrialized nations but the currency repeatedly defied 
central bank intervention 
earlier in the week analysts concluded that currency markets had 
prepared for a halfpoint rise and that a steeper hike would zap 
the dollars strength 
all seven nations including the united states britain japan 
france west germany italy and canada have ample reason to want 
the dollar lower 
the worry is that the strong dollar will hurt us economic 
growth in 1990 and hurt the industrial and export sectors said 
allen sinai an economist with boston co and economic advisers 
inc in japan and west german even bigger doses of interest rates 
will be required because of the inflationary effects of weaker 
currencies 
the dollars strength despite the interestrate hike calls into 
question the group of sevens ability to mount a coordinated 
effort economists said 
the perception is that each major group is conducting interest 
rate policy with an eye on its own domestic conditions and that the 
credibility of g7 coordination is still lacking said sterling 
analysts said that while intervention is expected to continue 
to weaken the dollar will require adverse news about the trade 
deficit more interest rate hikes or fiscal restraint overseas or 
lower shortterm interest rates 
new data on employment is due out on friday but barring any 
strong suggestions that the us economy is slowing the federal 
reserve is not likely to lower interest rates 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
wednesdays rates included 16360 swiss francs up from 16290 
117625 canadian dollars up from 117475 63865 french francs up 
from 63825 and 138000 italian lire up from 137675

precious metals futures prices slumped thursday in a 
disappointed reaction to the dollars late surge in value against 
other major currencies following a rise in european interest rates 
on other commodity markets energy futures retreated coffee 
futures fell again grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock 
and meat were mixed 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures settled 360 
lower across the board with the contract for delivery in october at 
36340 a troy ounce silver was 82 cents to 93 cents lower with 
december at 5243 a troy ounce 
the slide marked the biggest daily move in gold prices since 
sept 25 but the market did not fall out of its recent trading 
range 
the metals closely followed foreign currencies which rallied in 
relation to the dollar early in the day only to end lower as the 
dollar advanced 
the early rally was kicked off by west germanys decision to 
raise its key interest rate a full percentage point forcing other 
european countries to follow suit 
the federal reserve did not move to raise us interest rates 
but the dollar strengthened anyway challenging the fed to take the 
opposite course and loosen up credit 
the only way to keep the dollar from rallying further would be 
to lower rates here in the states said peter cardillo commodity 
trading adviser with josephthal amp co a new yorkbased futures 
brokerage 
heatingoil futures fell sharply and most other energy futures 
also declined on the new york mercantile exchange partly in 
reaction to a pair of reports indicating ample supplies of crude 
oil and refined products 
the department of energys weekly inventory report showed 
largerthanexpected increases in us stocks of crude oil and 
gasoline and a monthly report from the international energy agency 
showed opec nations producing crude oil at levels well above the 
205 millionbarrel ceiling set by cartel officials just last month 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents lower to 1 
cent higher with november at 1996 a barrel heating oil was 45 
cent to 113 cent lower with november at 5791 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 44 cent to 57 cent lower with november at 
5497 cents a gallon 
coffee futures dropped to new 14year lows on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange but losses were limited by signs that 
international coffee organization negotiators were making some 
progress toward a new pricesupport agreement to succeed the export 
quotas suspended in july 
late in the day after the close the icos governing council 
passed a resolution to negotiate a new pact but details were not 
available 
coffee futures settled 14 cent to 125 cents lower with 
december at 7289 cents a pound 
corn futures prices rose moderately in active trading on the 
chicago board of trade amid rumors of new soviet purchases of us 
corn 
soybean futures retreated and wheat futures finished mixed with 
no fresh export sales seen for either of those commodities 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
december at 410 a bushel corn was unchanged to 4 cents higher 
with december at 243 a bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cents 
higher with december at 147 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 
5 cents lower with november at 574 a bushel 
hog futures rose sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
expectations for higher cash prices the rally lifted porkbelly 
futures and nearmonth live cattle futures but feeder cattle 
retreated slightly

automakers and analysts are wondering if the 1989 
model year was the last of the recent car and truck sales 
explosions of recent years 
about 78 million new vehicles one for every 31 people in the 
united states have been put on the road in the last five model 
years but if sales reach the 14 million15 million range predicted 
for the 1990 model year come true that sales boom could end 
id say there is a lot of uncertainty out there said 
analyst mike kobayashi of painewebber in new york city at this 
point were looking at 14 million for 1990 but we may be 
changing that soon 
he declined to say whether his firms revision would be up or 
down 
automakers on wednesday reported selling around 151 million 
cars and light trucks during the 1989 model year ended last 
saturday when heavy truck sales figures are added later this year 
it probably will push total sales to around 154 million the 
fifthbest model year on record 
that would be slightly better than many automakers and observers 
had predicted some of them are concerned that a surge in september 
sales may have been fueled largely by consumers wanting to beat 
1990 model year price increases 
analysts economists and auto company executives were waiting to 
see this years fourthquarter sales rate before making firmer 
predictions for the next year 
ford motor co is withholding any prediction for 1990 sales 
until fourthquarter results are clearer company chairman donald 
petersen said in an interview thursday 
the quarter could be a relatively slow quarter he said 
the basic economy is showing some growth you might call it 
modest growth 
petersen said one reasons for the marketplace uncertainty is 
buyer incentives ford announced a new set of cash rebates and 
lowinterest loan rates on a variety of 1989 and 1990 cars and 
trucks 
general motors corp and chrysler corp also have announced 
incentives on some of their 1990 cars and trucks 
you still have the fact of the excess capacity that injects 
an element of instability into the equation and a strong element of 
unknown petersen said the ingredients are there for some 
instability as far as the market is concerned 
auto assembly plants that operate at full capacity are the most 
profitable so automakers like to keep production as high as 
possible but some dealers and the national automobile dealers 
association have said they expected dealer orders to drop by as 
much as 30 percent in 1990 from 1989 
that could spell trouble for the automakers not only because 
orders from dealers may be down but also because factories may not 
be working at their optimum capacity 
its really hard to figure out what the big three are trying 
to do kobayashi said they havent geared up their production 
for the fourth quarter to match the sales theyve been having in 
the third quarter 
so thats sort of an admission that we should wait to see how 
the 1990 model year kicks off he said 
officially model years begin with the fourth quarter of a 
calendar year and end with the third quarter of the next year 
tom webb a senior economist with the nada on thursday 
predicted a 10 percent drop in fourthquarter car sales this year 
compared with last year 
that would put 1989 calendar year sales at 147 million 
vehicles he said far below the 158 million sold during the 1988 
calendar year the industrys secondbest 
were not predicting any recession were projecting a slower 
economic growth than this year webb said

sir james goldsmith reaffirmed his hostile 
bid for bat industries plc thursday saying he will make a new 
offer if regulators in nine states approve the sale of bats 
farmers group insurance subsidiary as part of the deal 
trading in bat shares was halted on the american stock exchange 
because of huge demand by speculators assuming that goldsmiths 22 
billion bid the second biggest takeover offer ever would be 
sweetened 
goldsmith suggested the deal will be changed so that farmers 
would be sold directly to the french insurer axamidi assurances 
rather than passing briefly through the ownership of goldsmiths 
hoylake investments ltd and a voting trust 
officials also suggested that changes will be made in how 
axamidi finances its 45 billion purchase of los angelesbased 
farmers the 15th biggest us insurer bat contends the current 
offer relies too heavily on borrowed money and repayments from 
farmers operating income 
the financing and ownership issues are big ones for regulators 
who must decide if the deal is in the best interests of farmers 
policyholders 
goldsmiths statement also dispelled suspicions that he would 
give up following bats announcement last week that it would 
restructure by selling its paper and retailing businesses to 
concentrate on tobacco and financial services 
it appears as if goldsmith is once again threatening to make a 
real offer bat said in a statement if and when one is made we 
will respond in the appropriate manner and in due course 
in another important change of strategy goldsmith said he would 
drop his lawsuits contending that state insurance regulators have 
no right to review the deal federal courts in seven of the nine 
states already had ruled against him down on those suits 
axamidi has only one small us business a delaware insurer 
critics say axa is too inexperienced in the american market they 
also contend that nearly all the 45 billion purchase price for 
farmers would be borrowed or repaid from farmers profits causing 
a heavy burden 
axamidi chairman claude bebear said in a statement that 
axamidi would file amended applications with the nine insurance 
commissioners to demonstrate its strength and experience a person 
with knowledge of the deal who asked not to be identified said 
the amended applications would include revised financing but would 
not describe it in detail 
bat called goldsmiths decision to drop his federal lawsuits a 
clear admission of defeat and one which will enable the focus to 
shift to the true issues whether hoylake or its highly leveraged 
partner axamidi are suitable owners for farmers

union employees of ltv steel cos bar steel 
division voted thursday to buy the division for 20 million a deal 
that will create the secondlargest employeeowned steel company in 
the united states 
the vote by united steelworkers of america members authorizes 
each union employee to pay an average of 4000 to purchase stock 
in the new company republic engineered steels corp the payments 
go toward a down payment to the divisions parent company ltv 
corp of dallas said company spokesman john willoughby 
under the buyout plan 3900 union members will pay 16 million 
while 1050 salaried management employees will contribute 4 
million union members will hold 76 percent of the stock in the new 
company while management will hold 24 percent 
the vote was 2252 to 1184 
this is a historic day and an extraordinary opportunity for 
our members said joe coyle usw director of district 27 in 
canton and chairman of the union negotiating team 
it will be the 16th employee stock ownership plan in which usw 
members have a majority or complete ownership of a company coyle 
said 
the company will be directed by a 13member board of directors 
with four representatives from the union four from management and 
five indepdendent directors selected by the union and management 
certainly the esop enhances our ability to implement a 
modernization plan willoughby said this is the ultimate 
employeeparticipation plan 
he said republic engineered steels corp will include two ltv 
plants in canton two in massillon ohio and plants in chicago 
gary ind beaver falls pa and willimantic conn 
the division had sales of 800 million in 1988 and will maintain 
its headquarters in massillon willoughby said 
the 20 million employee buyout is second largest in the us 
steel industry to the 1982 buyout of west virginias weirton steel 
corp in which 8300 employees paid 194 million to buy the 
company 
ltv corp filed for reorganization in us bankruptcy court in 
1986 selling the bar division will leave ltv with flatrolled and 
tubular products plants willoughby said 
presidents of the four largest usw locals had opposed the 
buyout partly because some employees will eventually lose their 
jobs in the sevenyear plan while five union local presidents 
favored it 
willoughby said management of the company would remain the same

as if boeing co didnt have enough trouble with 
a strike by machinists state and federal officials on thursday 
announced citations or fines for alleged safety and health 
violations by the aerospace company 
the state department of labor and industries said it penalized 
boeing 128780 for 36 alleged violations it is the largest 
penalty ever proposed against a washington employer under the 
washington industrial safety and health act 
also thursday the federal occupational safety and health 
administration announced citations for 40 violations that carry 
penalties totaling 41530 
the citations were primarily focused on boeing advanced systems 
operations at the developmental center in seattle where parts for 
the b2 bomber are made and follow nearly five months of joint 
investigation by state and federal agencies 
our inspection at the boeing co found substantial problems 
that need to be corrected and our penalty structure allows us to 
make employers aware of the importance we place on the safety and 
health of workers labor and industries director joe dear said 
boeing spokesman john kvasnosky said the company was in the 
process of reviewing the citations and cant say at this time if 
there will be an appeal or any further action 
since the inspections occurred we have made the corrections 
needed to meet some of those concerns and no further action is 
contemplated we have given the inspectors a timetable for taking 
corrective actions on the remaining concerns said kvasnosky 
of the states 36 alleged violations 19 were related to safety 
and 17 to hygiene many involved lack of hazardous chemical 
information and training programs and employee exposure to 
hazardous chemicals 
the federal citations included 22 for alleged safety violations 
such as unsafe machinery operation improper communication between 
equipment operators improper record keeping of injuries and 
illnesses unsafe physical working conditions and improper uses of 
equipment

a private rocket went 
up in flames during a launch attempt thursday ruining the first 
american booster designed and built solely with commercial funds 
officials said 
once the flames came out of the rocket we kept waiting for it 
to lift off and didnt see it leave the pad said bob angelotti 
a spokesman for american rocket co 
people were saying it didnt take off it didnt take 
off he said then flame and black smoke began to come out of 
the bottom of the rocket cylinder 
the 58foottall rocket was to have taken a 15minute suborbital 
flight to test star wars missile detectors on a satellite orbiting 
overhead and to test a heat shieldparachute that might be used on 
a reentry vehicle to help astronauts escape a space station 
emergency 
the company said the rocket fell off the launch stand a few 
minutes after it fizzled and burned 
the 58foottall rocket was to have taken a 15minute suborbital 
flight to test star wars missile detectors on a satellite orbiting 
overhead 
thursdays failed launch was another blow to the camarillobased 
company its founder george koopman died in an automobile 
accident july 19 while driving to a rocket test at edwards air 
force base koopman said earlier he wanted american rocket to be 
the federal express of the space business 
american rocket said its booster dubbed the koopman 
express was the first in the united states designed and built 
only with commercial funds without any government subsidy or 
surplus parts rockets used in other commercial launches this year 
were built under government programs although later sold for 
commercial use according to the company 
this is the rocket business and this is why you do test 
flights said jim bennett president of american rocket its 
not at all uncommon for your first prototype to have a problem like 
this well be investigating and learning from it and go on 
he said it probably will be next year before his company 
attempts another launch the company estimated this one cost 2 
million 
the launch had been scheduled during a twominute window 
beginning at 1028 am pdt but we lighted it up and for one 
reason or the other it didnt lift off bennett said 
so we ordered the release clamps reengaged and went into our 
scrub procedure but the vehicle caught on fire the air force 
says there was minimal pad damage but the vehicle is 
nonflyable 
the launch first had been planned sept 28 but was scrubbed by 
clouds and fear that lightning might hit the 33400pound rocket 
which is powered by a hybrid engine that runs on a combination of 
liquid oxygen and a solid fuel of polybutadiene rubber 
thursdays launch was scheduled so the rocket could release a 
cloud of inert gas as the pentagons delta star satellite passed 
overhead 
the satellite launched from in march contains sensors that 
some day may be part of a strategic defense initiative system 
nicknamed star wars in which satellites would detect incoming 
enemy nuclear warheads so they could be destroyed 
defense department spokesman maj william oconnell said earlier 
that the pentagon would not reveal whether the sensors detected the 
american rocket booster 
the rocket also was scheduled to deploy an engineering test 
model of an 8footwide parashield it is a combined heat shield 
and parachute that some day might be used in a new type of reentry 
vehicle such as an escape system to allow space station astronauts 
to return to earth the 390pound model was built by students at 
the massachusetts institute of technology
