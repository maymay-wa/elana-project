baseball commissioner a bartlett 
giamatti who left the presidency of yale university for the game he 
loved died friday after suffering a heart attack just five months 
into the sports top job he was 51 
giamatti died at his weekend retreat on marthas vineyard eight 
days after he banned cincinnati reds manager pete rose from 
baseball the decision followed a sixmonth battle over allegations 
that rose bet on his own team 
giamatti whose wife and son were with him when he died was 
pronounced dead at 432 pm after allout efforts to revive him 
failed said matthew stockpole of marthas vineyard hospital 
the commissioner was unconscious and in full cardiac arrest when 
an ambulance arrived at his home at 3 pm the hospital said in a 
statement cardiopulmonary resuscitation was administered in the 
ambulance and doctors at the hospital worked for more than an hour 
to revive him 
giamatti a chainsmoker who once said cigarettes were his 
primary vice left new york in the morning to spend the labor 
day weekend on the popular new england resort island 
giamattis death shocked baseball even as it was still recovering 
from roses suspension 
in an interview with the associated press two weeks ago giamatti 
dismissed the suggestion that he had been overly stressed by the 
rose matter 
while its a serious matter it doesnt take most of the 
time he said most of the time is spent on other things 
the way its been played and theres no reason it shouldnt have 
been played would make you think that i was been sitting here all 
day worrying about that but that hasnt been the case for months 
rose was deeply saddened by the news of giamattis death his 
attorney robert a pitcairn said in a statement issued in 
cincinnati 
in spite of their dispute pete had great personal respect for 
the commissioner the statement said he extends his deepest 
sympathy to commissioner giamattis family 
giamatti became baseballs seventh commissioner april 1 and was 
to have the shortest reign eclipsing the three years and three 
months of william eckert from 19651969 
giamatti was the first commissioner to die in office since 
kenesaw mountain landis one of his role models died in 1944 like 
giamatti landis made his mark with a lifetime ban against shoeless 
joe jackson and seven other members of the infamous chicago black 
sox who were accused of taking money from a gambler to throw the 
1919 world series 
at bostons fenway park home of giamattis beloved red sox 
flags were lowered to halfstaff 
new york yankees owner george steinbrenner said he spoke to 
giamatti by phone about 45 minutes before the commissioner was 
stricken 
i may have been the last person to talk to him he was happy 
we laughed steinbrenner said weve lost perhaps a true 
renaissance man any other commissioner there ever will be will pale 
by comparison he was brilliant he was compassionate he cared for 
the game and cared for its people 
it was a tremendous shock said deputy commissioner francis 
t vincent jr i dropped him off at noon on marthas vineyard and 
he seemed ok he had great friends and admirers baseball his 
family his friends the country suffered a big loss this was a 
uniquely talented man its a very sad event a tragedy for a lot of 
people 
president bush vacationing in kennebunkport maine said bart 
was a close friend of mine for many many years i just want to pay 
my respects he was a great person 
he loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a real 
contribution to the game standing for the highest possible ethical 
standards said bush who played baseball for yale 
giamatti president of the ivy league school from 1978 to 1985 
and a specialist in comparative literature succeeded peter 
ueberroth he had been national league president since december 1986 
baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finest 
commissioner in history ueberroth vacationing in paris said in 
a statement released through his newport calif office bart 
giamatti encompassed everything that is good and enduring about 
americas favorite pastime for this man of words courage and deeds 
no words can express the loss 
he gave of himself magnificently to yale as a teacher as a 
scholar and as a leader said benno c schmidt jr who succeeded 
giamatti at yale this university will be a better place because 
of his service he will never be forgotten at this university 
baseball rules call for the executive council comprised of the 
two league presidents and eight club owners to oversee the game 
until a new commissioner is chosen 
angelo bartlett giamatti born in boston on april 4 1938 got an 
early start as a baseball administrator as manager of the south 
hadley mass high school team in 1951 
but books also deeply attracted the man who would later say that 
he always found baseball the most satisfying and nourishing of 
games outside of literature 
giamatti an internationally recognized scholar on the 
renaissance was 40 when he became president of yale the schools 
youngest in 200 years he had joined the yale faculty in 1966 after 
teaching italian and comparative literature at princeton university 
when he took charge of yale giamatti was faced with a budget 
deficit of 2 million but he balanced the budget in four years 
his most difficult time came in 1984 when more than 2600 
clerical and technical workers went on a bitter 10week strike 
about another 1000 bluecollar workers including food service 
employees and janitors refused to cross the picket lines 
while yale president giamatti emerged as an articulate spokesman 
for a liberal college education in 1981 he attacked the moral 
majority as peddlers of coercion and said their aims were 
antithetical to a liberal education 
during the ap interview two weeks ago giamatti said being 
baseball commissioner was a lot like being a university president 
i tell you the truth this job reminds me much more of the one 
i had at yale the national league one was much more concerned with 
what went on out on the field 
i mean the whole purpose of working in baseball is to remember 
that youre also a fan of baseball im vitally interested in what 
goes on on the field i was lucky to have those 2 years in the 
national league it allowed me to have some peripheral engagement 
to learn a lot i like baseball i try to see as much baseball as 
possible he said 
giamatti is survived by his wife the former toni smith and 
three children marcus bartlett paul edward valentine and elena 
walton giamatti

warsaw sept 1535 pm1135 am estap german war 
planes swooped over warsaw this afternoon in an air attack in 
advance of three german armies invading this country 
i am telephoning this dispatch to budapest with the phone in one 
hand and a gas mask in the other 
from where i am i can hear the wail of powerdiving fighting 
ships and can see 14 german bombers slowly steadily following the 
course of the vistula river polands outlet to the sea 
apparently they are attempting to destroy all bridges 
the raid began at about 430 pm and is still continuing more 
than an hour later 
the german air raiders now 535 pm are coming back after 
making a wide circle 
they apparently are heading toward the government buildings in 
the center of downtown warsaw 
i can see puffs of antiaircraft fire 
although the raid is still on there is no panic 
across the street from me hundreds of inhabitants are watching 
fascinated on the rooftops 
tremendous explosions are shaking the city and rattling windows 
antiaircraft shells are bursting around the bombers which are 
coming over at an altitude of about 6000 feet 
warsaw had little warning 
elmer w peterson associated press chief of bureau here and i 
heard the antiaircraft guns before we heard the scream of airraid 
alarm sirens 
if the bombers have tied up traffic over the steel railroad 
bridge spanning the vistula it is a serious blow for polands 
traffic from here to the coast and the west 
the germans apparently tried for definitely military objectives 
reports have started reaching here of german air attacks 
elsewhere in poland 
a large number of women and children were killed a government 
communique said when german planes bombed a refugee train from 
poznan at the kutno station 70 miles west of warsaw 
the first air raid on polish territory it said occurred at puck 
near danzig at 540 am 
it said three german planes were shot down near krakow four 
others near gdynia the polish port on the same harbor as danzig 
and that polish troops had seized a german armored train at chojnice 
the communique charged that german troops invading pomorze the 
polish corridor were murdering the polish population 
contrary to hitlers announcement the communique said 
many of the towns bombed had no military or strategic value 
nine of the bombers that raided warsaw flew in the westerly 
direction across the city apparently toward the central railroad 
station 
they have been doing some exceptionally daring bombing however 
sometimes diving to about 3000 feet over the vistula bridges 
it is now 540 pm and the sound of antiaircraft guns and 
roaring motors has died away 
apparently the raid is over 
a large hospital for feebleminded jewish children was said to 
have been hit by the german air raiders late in the afternoon

forty years after the netherlands lost 
the pearl of its east asian empire thousands of its former colonial 
subjects still live in exile here awaiting repatriation to their 
own nation that never came to be 
camp lunetten in vught is the last of 74 resettlement camps 
established to house moluccan troops who fought for the dutch in 
their losing war with rebels in the 1940s in what then was the dutch 
east indies and now is indonesia 
lunetten a former nazi concentration camp is the netherlands 
most visible symbol of moluccan nationalist aspirations despite the 
fact that their homeland a sprinkling of islands west of new 
guinea was long ago swallowed up by indonesia 
the 220 moluccans still living in the ramshackle brick buildings 
maintain it is their symbol of defiance against the dutch whom they 
say reneged on a pledge to secure them an independent moluccan 
nation 
as long as we dont have our own nation were just living from 
one day to the next well always be moluccans said 30yearold 
ety huliselan who was born raised and still lives in camp lunetten 
weve always been homesick here its not our country but a 
strange country said her 61yearold father johannes a former 
private in the royal netherlands east indies army 
despite assimilation and the passage of four decades most 
moluccans still hold to the vision of an independent homeland 
according to current and former dutch government officials 
the dutch government says it promised only to do its best to 
secure a moluccan homeland and that political realities have since 
ruled out such an effort 
moluccan resentment exploded into terrorism in the 1970s when 
moluccan nationalists seized a school two trains and the indonesian 
consulate in amsterdam the attacks left 11 people dead 
when the indonesian separatists defeated the dutch in 1949 the 
moluccans proclaimed their own republic of the south moluccas 
to save them from possible indonesian reprisals however the 
dutch evacuated about 4000 moluccan troops and 8500 dependents to 
the netherlands in 1951 
in all about 45000 moluccans now live in the netherlands many 
still torn between their families authoritarian traditions and the 
more liberal dutch culture 
moluccan drug abuse and dutchlanguage illiteracy rates far 
exceed the national average and their unemployment rate of up to 60 
percent is four times higher 
successive dutch governments have tried to integrate the 
moluccans into dutch culture but have also given them more 
preferential treatment than any other ethnic minority in this nation 
of 146 million 
these people have been pampered by the state for years said 
maurice van hurck the welfare ministry official responsible for 
lunetten theyre looking for an enemy on which to vent all their 
aggression and the enemy is the welfare ministry 
until 1956 all moluccans lived in camps where they were issued 
free food and clothing since then the government has built them 
2800 rental units and about 50 churches in a program that has no 
parallel even in the generous dutch welfare state 
a 69million vught housing project designed along the 
organizational lines of moluccan village stands virtually empty 
because lunettens residents refuse to move 
the residents maintain their camp has great symbolic value in 
their fight and maintain that leaving it would imply giving in on 
their position that theyre victims of government neglect 
van hurck said rents in the camp start at the dutch guilders 
equivalent of only 8 a month and gas electricity and water are 
free rents in the new housing complex start at 90 a month which 
is still very low by dutch standards gas and electrical services 
for a dutch household run 90180 a month depending on the size of 
the home 
the moluccan nationalist movement which has a 
presidentinexile 79yearold johannes manusama provided the 
moluccans with a new foothold to hang on to their pride said 
annelies kouwenhoven a specialist on moluccan culture 
its the teaching of a lifetime to moluccans that the entire 
moluccan culture be transferred from father to son from mother to 
daughter said mrs kouwenhoven former secretary of the 
dutchindonesian joint committee on moluccan affairs 
some lunetten resident claim they were never officially 
demobilized from the dutch army and are owed 38 years back pay by 
the dutch government 
the government has paid for moluccan youths to travel to the 
moluccan islands so they could choose between life under indonesia 
and life in the netherlands 
only a few have opted for the moluccas according to mrs 
kouwenhoven 
lena dejong 32 a secondgeneration moluccan woman married to a 
dutchman said young moluccans continue to profess a belief in 
moluccan nationalism only out of respect for their elders 
were used to so many things here she said

the world watches while a death struggle is 
played out by the colombian government and the nations powerful 
drug lords but violence is by no means a newcomer to this 
bloodstained nation where a walk in the woods can spur a 
confrontation with bandits death squads or revolutionaries here is 
a look at colombias long history of violence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a chance encounter with a band of rebels 
or a hunt for gems in a jungle river can literally mean life or 
death in colombia a dangerous land long before the drug lords began 
their latest wave of terror 
the governments war with narcotics traffickers has captured the 
worlds attention while partially obscuring the fact that colombia 
for many years has been a violent place to live 
more than 75000 people have been killed in political violence 
during the last 25 years most of them in attempts by a half dozen 
leftist guerrilla groups to overthrow the colombian government 
between 1949 and 1953 another 250000 people died in a war 
between the nations two biggest political parties such was the 
hatred in that conflict that entire villages including elderly 
people and children were wiped out dump trucks would pour 
screaming prisoners over steep cliffs 
today guerrillas execute their own troops for treason drug 
traffickers wage war on other drug traffickers bandits battle for 
control of the nations emerald mines and rightwing death squads 
issue periodic reminders that they are still around 
additionally about 12000 people are killed yearly by common 
criminals the national police said in a recent communique 
the breadth and intensity of colombian violence at any given time 
is perhaps why colombians scoff when they hear foreign news reports 
that describe them as panicky and terrorstricken a population 
huddled indoors while the drug war is played out 
colombias emerald mines for example are regular scenes of 
violence dozens have been killed as bandits struggle for control of 
the mines in the hot steamy parts of the country 
an army colonel once told an associated press reporter who 
visited one of the mines that there is an average of one murder a 
day among the people who look for emeralds in a shallow river where 
a mine dumps rocks taken from a mine 
emerald buyers who go to the mines travel in convoys and carry 
machine guns and hand grenades several times a year the convoys 
coming from the mines are ambushed by bandits 
two months ago the army and a group involved in the emerald war 
battled with guns in an apartment building 200 yards from the us 
ambassadors residence in bogota the army found antitank weapons 
submachine guns and hand grenades in raided apartment 
rightwing death squads have taken a heavy toll in colombia 
killing more than 1000 people in the last four years 
the leftist patriotic union party has been the hardest hit with 
751 of its members gunned down or blown up 
colombias justice department said recently it suspects the death 
squads are operated by drug traffickers 
guerrillas long have extorted money from cattle ranchers in the 
form of a so called revolution tax in recent years drug traffickers 
have bought up hundreds of ranches 
when the traffickers refused to pay the revolution tax the 
guerrillas began kidnapping ranchers for ransom the death squads 
are believed to be the drug traffickers method of settling the 
score with the rebels 
many of the patriotic unions members are former guerrillas who 
accepted an amnesty offered by the government four years ago 
drug traffickers have been warring among themselves during the 
last year for supremacy in smuggling cocaine into the united states 
so far 180 members of two gangs one in cali and the other in 
medellin have been killed 
about 150 drug stores belonging to the cali traffickers have been 
blown up in the last year victims in the gang war are usually found 
riddled with bullets on the outskirts of town 
aside from hundreds of casualties each year in the war between 
leftist guerrillas and the governments security forces rural 
peasants also get caught up in the conflict 
both guerrillas and the army often suspect peasants of being 
guerrilla sympathizers or army spies 
frequently a guerrilla band will march through a jungle area and 
ask to buy food and other supplies from a farmer 
the peasant afraid to refuse sells much of what he has then 
the army arrives and says it has been told that the peasant has been 
helping the guerrillas 
the peasant is often tortured until he tells what he knows of the 
guerrillas who came through his farm 
after that the guerrillas return and shoot the farmer for 
betraying them to the army

the najjar brothers say they 
are victims but fellow villagers call them collaborators they sit 
on the third floor of their firedamaged home cradling uzi 
submachine guns provided by israel 
with the three brothers are several men from other villages who 
joined them in the ruined house after being accused of collaborating 
with the israeli occupation 
many of the 100 palestinians killed by other palestinians in the 
uprising that began nearly 21 months ago were accused of helping 
israel whose soldiers and settlers have killed more than 550 
palestinians 
others of this hilltop towns 10000 residents accuse israel of 
sponsoring a reign of terror they say the najjars and other alleged 
collaborators are guilty of beatings arson random shooting and 
seizing of proplo activists 
they have tear gas sound bombs live bullets everything 
said hamzeh hamarsheh whose son luay a lawyer was hospitalized 
with head wounds after a beating in july they must be removed 
they are a threat to safety 
ziad attatrih 28 who owns a shop that makes aluminumframe 
windows across from the najjar house pointed to eight bullet holes 
in his door 
two weeks ago he said the najjar brothers locked him and his 
workers in the shop and stood guard until israeli soldiers arrived 
and arrested his nephew who was wanted for uprising activities 
later the najjars set fire to his car attatrih said 
they are ruining things but what can we do he said i 
think i will have to move my shop 
hamarsheh said town leaders complained to israeli authorities but 
nothing was done the army says a police investigation began after 
israel television reported on alleged abuses 
the case of yaabad is one of a growing number israeli security 
forces are reported to have increased the arming of palestinian 
collaborators in recent weeks 
palestinians claim the israeli army encourages creation of 
antiplo militias but the military says weapons are given to 
protect threatened palestinians 
shock committees that support the palestine liberation 
organization have been blamed for the deaths of most of the 100 
palestinians killed by others 
col raanan gissin deputy army spokesman said in an interview 
that palestinians were armed on a highly selective casebycase 
basis for selfdefense 
he would not confirm they were collaborators but said the 
palestinians were under strict control with the clear 
understanding that if the weapons are used improperly they have to 
withstand the consequences 
dedi zucker a legislator from the leftwing citizens rights 
movement said in a letter to the defense ministry what is 
happening in yaabad is an illegitimate example of protection being 
given by israel 
arab reporters said at least 40 collaborators had been given 
weapons in this region 45 miles north of jerusalem and several had 
formed the equivalent of militias sometimes operating with israeli 
soldiers 
in habla village the reporters said three collaborators who 
shared a house opened fire to scatter proplo protesters and seized 
boys painting antiisraeli graffiti until soldiers arrived to arrest 
them 
gissin denied the army promoted formation of militias but 
defense minister yitzhak rabin recently said israel would encourage 
palestinians to fight proplo activists 
trouble in yaabad began a year ago when townspeople became 
suspicious that the najjars bassam 35 ali 27 and omar 23 
were colluding with israeli security services they were convinced 
when a najjar sister was seen carrying a pistol which arabs usually 
are forbidden to own 
palestinian activists ordered over loudspeakers that najjars be 
shunned the family business of making aluminum blinds was ruined 
four of their cars were burned and they finally moved away with 
their wives and children 
the house was looted and set afire 
omar najjar standing guard with his uzi on the sootstained top 
floor said his family was wronged and had returned to reclaim its 
rightful place in the community 
i used to be active in the uprising he said i carried the 
palestinian flag in the marches but they turned on us here they 
hounded us even after we moved spreading rumors in our new 
village 
bassam suggested on israeli tv that their relationship with 
israel was official we belong to the shabak shin bet security 
service he said we have orders they told us not to do 
damage we dont they allow us to protect ourselves 
their return coincided with the opening of a military government 
office guarded by several rooftop sentry posts in the village two 
of the posts are within sight of the najjar house which is linked 
to one by a military phone

more than 50 million us urine tests performed 
each year with simple chemical dipsticks cost more than 150 
million and many are unnecessary medical researchers say 
two studies published in fridays journal of the american medical 
association found that dipstick urinalysis the most commonly used 
urine test is unjustified for healthy young men and women though 
it may be useful for screening patients 60 years or older for 
unsuspected urinary problems 
dipstick urinalysis is one of the most frequently ordered tests 
by internists and family practitioners for urinary tract disorders 
ranging from infection to malignancy 
the test involves dipping a chemically treated stick into a urine 
sample changes in color on the chemically treated sticks can 
indicate the presence of sugar proteins blood and other substances 
that may point to possible bacterial infections or other bladder and 
kidney problems 
about 30 percent of all office visits to internists generate a 
dipstick urinalysis resulting in more than 50 million tests each 
year said the studies by the us preventive services task force 
at 3 per test dipsticks add more than 150 million annually to 
the nations healthcare bill the authors said 
in both studies the authors said pregnant women should be 
screened for urinary problems but they recommended using more 
sensitive tests such as urine cultures and microscopic examinations 
rather than dipstick urinalysis 
the first study conducted by dr steffie woolhander and 
colleagues at harvard medical school in boston looked at the 
effectiveness of dipstick urinalysis for detecting blood and protein 
in the urine 
the authors concluded that the benefits of screening symptomfree 
young adults are outweighed by the risks of following up false 
positives with further and more invasive testing 
but they said such tests may be appropriate for men and women 
over 60 because they have a higher disease prevalence the 
researchers recommended further study to determine the effectiveness 
of such screening 
the second study by dr richard j pels and colleagues at 
harvard found that dipstick testing of adults under 60 for evidence 
of bacterial urinary tract infection is also unwarranted for similar 
reasons 
but they said dipstick screening for bacteria may be appropriate 
for women who are over 60 years of age or diabetic 
both studies based their findings on a review and analysis of 
medical literature including data from five populationbased 
studies 
these studies showed that fewer than 15 percent to 2 percent of 
young adults with positive blood or protein dipstick results 
actually had a serious and treatable urinary tract disease

calling him a man of shameless excess a 
top state department official said thursday that panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega has amassed a personal fortune of between 
200 million and 300 million from drug trafficking and other 
criminal activities 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger made the 
allegation in response to a challenge from a panamanian diplomat 
last week for the bush administration to back up its claim that 
noriega has a long history of involvement in drug smuggling 
eagleburger spoke to a meeting of the organization of american 
states permanent council which was convened at a state department 
request 
much of his presentation was devoted to repeating charges 
contained in indictments returned by two florida grand juries in 
february 1988 
but no administration official had ever before offered an 
official estimate of noriegas wealth 
by conservative estimates we judge noriegas personal wealth 
much of it hidden in secret bank accounts abroad to be at least 
200 million to 300 million eagleburger said 
in response an american lawyer for noriega frank anthony 
rabino said eagleburger had failed to back up his allegations about 
wrongdoing with evidence 
the government has not offered what they promised which was 
proof he said they have again asked you and me and others to 
use our imagination to let our dreams run wild and maybe well find 
something evil in gen noriega if we speculate as they asked us to 
do long and hard said rabino who served as a member of the 
panamanian delegation for thursdays meeting 
rabino said much of the us case against noriega was based on 
the testimony of steven kalish a onetime noriega confidant and a 
convicted drug smuggler who was given a reduced sentence for his 
disclosures against noriega 
in kennebunkport maine where president bush is vacationing 
national security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters the 
administration would be making a statement on friday regarding the 
new situation in panama 
bush in a joint news conference with canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney said he was not giving up on the multinational 
diplomacy approach to oust noriega i am going to continue to work 
with the leaders in this hemisphere most of whom feel as i do about 
noriega to see if we cant help the panamanian people get what they 
deserve and that is a democratic society that stems from free fair 
elections he said 
a partial listing of noriegas assets include according to 
eagleburger a 600000 mansion in panama city a farm and an 
apartment in france several luxury apartments in the dominican 
republic various jet aircraft including a boeing 727 and three 
large pleasure yachts the macho i macho ii and macho iii 
so let us put aside once and for all this contention that gen 
noriega is a poor humble honest man who has been unjustly 
accused eagleburger said 
he said the story behind last years indictments is simple and 
chilling it is the story of that same shameless excess in the 
criminal field that eagleburger claimed also has been 
demonstrated in the political field 
this was a reference to the decision of panamanian authorities to 
void presidential elections last may after independent observers 
concluded that the antinoriega candidate guillermo endara had won 
by a landslide 
eagleburgers speech was prompted by an appeal last thursday by a 
panamanian diplomat romulo escobar betancourt in which he asked 
that the united states back up its allegations about noriega 
the occasion last week was an oas foreign ministers meeting 
convened to discuss the possibility of promoting a democratic 
transfer of power in panama the oas effort collapsed after three 
months and the council of state in panama on thursday appointed a 
new president comptroller francisco rodriguez to take over on 
friday noriega will continue as the countrys defacto leader 
in his speech eagleburger said noriega protected cocaine 
shipments from from medellin colombia through panama to the united 
states 
he said that noriega provided refuge and a base for continued 
operations to the members of the medellin cartel after the murder of 
a colombian justice minister in 1984 
he agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed on 
darien province eagleburger said and he assured the safe 
passage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into panamanian 
banks 
in kennebunkport bush said he and mulroney had discussed the 
panama situation thursday clearly were not going to recognize 
mr noriega weve got sanctions in place that will continue we are 
considering what additionally might be done the president said 
theres a high frustration level im ready to concede that 
but we are not going to give up on this bush said 
he said no comment when asked if there was a coup movement 
afoot in the panamanian military 
despite bushs pronouncement that the administration is 
considering what further steps it might take administration 
officials say privately there is little more bush can do short of 
military intervention or kidnaping of noriega both remote 
possibilities

when you climb into your sunbaked car in the 
shopping mall parking lot and crumple behind the wheel gasping in a 
saharan inferno its time for a few squirts from dr domingo tans 
handy air conditioner in a can 
tan a chineseborn physicist who lives in suburban alexandria 
va invented instant car kooler an aerosol spray containing 10 
percent ethyl alcohol and 90 percent water mixed with a mint 
fragrance 
those cardboard windshield sunglasses are no competition tan 
says 
to demonstrate he opened the door of his aging dodge sedan 
which had been parked in the sweltering sun for a couple of hours 
with a cardboard sunshade in place a large circular thermometer 
dangling over the front seat registered 122 degrees fahrenheit 
tan leaned into the car and pointed his can of instant car 
kooler psstpsstpsst 
within half a minute the thermometer had plunged 42 degrees to a 
more bearable 80 degrees he said the sunshade alone reduces heat by 
only 10 degrees to 15 degrees 
tan 57 began working on his invention about 10 years ago when 
his young son complained frequently about the suffocating heat in 
the family car 
from physics i know that water absorbs plenty of heat it is a 
good medium for moderating temperatures tan said i also 
thought that when it gets so hot we pray for rain and after it 
rains we know that the temperature drops 
tan got his idea 
its like making rain inside the car but the difference is 
that we dont make the whole car wet instead of rain there are 
drops of spray so fine that they vaporize right away he said 
he also observed a babys fever is reduced when its body is 
rubbed with water mixed with alcohol so tan added ethyl alcohol or 
ethanol to the car spray to make the water vaporize faster and 
reduce the air temperature even further 
born in fukien china and reared in the philippines tan 
obtained a doctorate in physics from the university of oregon in 
1968 taught college physics in rochester ny and did laser 
research at the national bureau of standards in washington until he 
entered private business in the 1970s he and his wife run a jewelry 
and gift shop in an alexandria shopping mall 
tan received a patent for instant car kooler in april and began 
marketing the 16ounce spray cans in midaugust the retail price is 
350 each 
in less than three weeks tan and his two business partners have 
received orders for more than 25000 cans from prospective 
distributors from new york to texas and as far away as austria and 
switzerland 
one exporter wants to ship instant car kooler to the middle east 
where tan says the heat inside automobiles can soar to 165 degrees 
or more 
tan says his son now a 22yearold college physics major is 
delighted with his fathers invention and gives away samples to his 
friends 
im a very religious person so i give nature credit for the 
idea the elder tan said in an interview wednesday 
a devout roman catholic tan is pleased that hes helping 
motorists stay cool 
i try to serve god he said he gave me a mission to do 
and i consider this as a gift from god to mankind

philomena jurey wrote her memoirs but cant get 
them published shes known around the world but a stranger in her 
own land its the story of her life she sighs 
mrs jurey who ends a 37year career in journalism today 
covered american presidents for the voice of america for 14 years 
in hamlets in albania and huts in borneo her radio voice is 
familiar to millions 
to people who never heard of dan rather she is a megastar 
and people who watch rather every night never had the chance to 
hear her the voice of america broadcasts to millions 130 million 
a week by its estimate but is prohibited by law from beaming its 
broadcasts to america 
mrs jureys boss sid davis relishes telling about an incident 
that illustrates the upsidedown life of a voa broadcaster 
when president gerald r ford went to china in 1975 a huge press 
corps accompanied him 
you had some of the titans of the broadcasting industry making 
the trip barbara walters all the top anchor people says davis 
we arrived in china and you had all these chinese people lining 
the street ignoring the television stars with their vast audiences 
and asking where is philomena where is philomena 
yes its true laughs mrs jurey in an interview the same 
thing happened when we went back to china with president reagan the 
rest of the press corps loved teasing sam donaldson about that 
it was fun because we labor in obscurity here 
even though she has been off the air for 19 months working as 
editorinchief of voa news and english broadcasts she still gets 
mail from around the world 
many correspondents want to know what happened to her why she 
disappeared from the radio some still write to propose marriage to 
which she replies that at age 61 im old enough to be a young 
grandmother 
she says she covered the white house for the voice the way any 
reporter covers the news the adrenalin gets going and you just 
report whats going on 
one difference she had to remember to speak slowly for an 
audience for whom english is a tricky language and she took had to 
take pains to put the news in a context for her listeners 
when a president submitted a request for foreign aid for some 
third world country for example she would stress that congress 
always has the final word on such matters 
and sometimes it was difficult to get over to a foreign audience 
exactly what a president is getting at 
mrs jurey recalls the struggle she had translating it for her 
audience when president reagan said hed had it up to his keister 
with something or other 
they were good sound bites but you had to use valuable air time 
to explain them she says remember when reagan said make my 
day 
mrs jureys career started for 3250 a week at the southwest 
times in pulaski va she joined the voa in 1961 her late husband 
was a local broadcaster 
she was born in new castle pa the daughter of an italian 
immigrant who owned a restaurant bar and small hotel 
the most troubling story she covered for the voice she says was 
the cuban missile crisis it was so sensitive the government wanted 
every shade in voa broadcasts to be exactly right 
that was a most difficult time she says her voice still 
reflecting irritation we had in effect a censor in the 
newsroom someone from our parent agency scrutinizing the copy i 
can understand that but i didnt think it was necessary 
mrs jurey says she intends to continue writing in retirement 
after she found no one in america wanted to published her memoirs 
i was told that it wasnt marketable because no one know who i 
was she says she tried her hand at a book about pizza 
she wrote about five chapters but couldnt land a publisher for 
that manuscript either 
they told me she sighs that people want to eat pizza not 
read about it

president bushs meeting at the white house 
today with embattled japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu touches 
off a posthoneymoon foreign policy phase that will test bushs 
management of americas role in the world 
his biggest decisions involve dealing with the soviet union but 
the issues closing in on bush also range from the strenuous effort 
to oust gen manuel antonio noriega from power in panama to the 
intractable arabisraeli dispute and the collapse of a 19nation 
conference on cambodia 
the first seven months in the white house have been relatively 
easy ones for bush his only nearcrisis in foreign policy involved 
the american hostages in lebanon and the slaying of marine lt col 
william higgins 
the hostage problem which also dogged presidents carter and 
reagan was not solved while bush was on vacation in maine but bush 
isnt faced with threatening execution deadlines 
however in the months ahead bush will be wrestling with all 
sorts of foreign policy questions for instance he has to decide 
how much money he can find to assist colombia in its war on drug 
lords 
the president has pledged 65 million and is preparing a 
comprehensive proposal to combat drugs to be announced next week 
but colombian justice minister monica de greif has appealed publicly 
for another 19 million to protect judges and other targets in her 
country 
the president is sympathetic but can he dig down for colombia 
and argue at the same time that theres nothing more in the coffers 
for poland beyond the 119 million he promised before solidarity 
captured a powersharing role in warsaw and food shortages grew 
worse 
it gets to be a matter of priorities and polands supporters in 
congress and among the american public are eager to have bush expand 
the modest aid he has offered and made conditional on the adoption 
of economic reforms 
even trickier is the situation in the baltic republics where 
proponents of change are getting a far different reception from 
moscow than solidarity has received 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has made bushs life easier by 
accepting the political and economic shifts in poland the country 
remains committed to the warsaw pact while changes in its industrial 
and agricultural policies could spare the soviets some of the costs 
of supporting poland 
but the communist partys ruling politburo is taking a skeptical 
view of what it calls the virus of nationalism in estonia 
latvia and lithuania and has warned of urgent measures to curb 
radical changes in the onceindependent republics 
asked about this development bush said he hoped peaceful change 
would continue not only outside the soviet union but in it 
the remark suggests bush may take the same approach to the 
baltics as he has to poland carefully encouraging change without 
saying how far he would like to see it go 
the visit of japanese prime minister kaifu involves some touchy 
presidential diplomacy as well 
bush has to juggle us frustration with japans 50 billion 
trade surplus against the possibility that pushing kaifu too hard 
might contribute to the downfall of his weak government that could 
pave the way for a leftwing coalition in tokyo that bush and his 
conservative followers would findasteful 
the collapse of the paris conference on cambodia means bracing 
for an intensification of the civil war between go that include 
prince sihanouk and the khmer rouge 
the bush administration had hoped the c would produce a 
ceasefire and a transition government now the options are suddenly 
bleak 
in the middle east at some n bush will have to decide whether 
the palestiniberation organization can be coaxed into coope an 
israeli plan for elections on the west bank the president and 
secretary of state james a baker iii consider the proposal the most 
practical way of gettingks started but a plo boycott could kill the 
plan and that would leave bush scratching his head for another 
approach 
in panama meanwhile gen noriega continues to outfox the bush 
administration clinging to power through standinand defying all 
pressures and stratagems the term of provisional president manuel 
solis palma is expiring what next

five capsules of the aids drug azt one days 
supply for infected people contain an estimated 15 cents worth of 
ingredients 
they probably cost between 150 and 250 to manufactthe 
drugstore for 9 
by any standard a lifetime of treatment with azt will add up to 
a lot of money is dicine really a bargain as its maker maintains 
the disagreement highlights the arbitrary often mysteriou 
fashion in which pharmaceutical companies decide how much to chrge 
for the medicines they hold exclusive right the only thing we know 
is there is no objective social way of determining what the price 
should be except what the market will bear said dr donald rucer 
of the university of illinois school of pharn this case the market 
is likely to grow dramatically 
azt known generically as azidothymidine and sold a the only 
approved aids drug until recently it was recommended only for the 
4with aids or severe aidsrelated illness but new research suggests 
that the medicine can also forestall aids in people at earlier 
stages of infection with hiv the acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome 
virus 
federal officials estimate that the drug could become routine 
therapy for an additional 600000 infected people those who have 
very early symptoms or no signs of the disease at all except for 
abnormal blood counts 
burroughs wellcome co the only company that makes azt sells 
the drug for 150 per capsule by the time wholesalers and 
drugstores take their markups the retail price is about 180 
peopleth aids typically take about eight capsules a day while 
five capsules daily are recommended for those with no outward 
symptoms for them the price is 9 a day or about 3300 a year 
somids patients have spent about 8000 a year taking 12 capsules 
ly a dosage no longer recommended 
on wednesday 15 homosexual rights and aids activist 
organizations asked burroughs wellcome to lower the cost 
absolutely its overpriced sor of the gay mens health 
crisis in new york its clear that at the current price there 
wll be people who wont be able to afford this drug 
leonard schifrin an economist at the college of wilows the 
pharmaceutical industry said that many drug prices are too high in 
part because companies often have no competition for several years 
after they introduce innovative medicines 
big profits are a way of life he said and maintenance drugs 
like azt taken daily for years are especially lucrative 
re used by large numbers of people with serious problems for lof 
time he said thats a gold mine and i hate to see azt being 
mined as gold its a basi problem of monopolistic producers and 
helpless consumers 
burroughs wellcome spokeswoman karen collins satried to price 
this drug compassionately dr david barry the vice president of 
research called azt a bar 
compared with drugs used for other chronic disorders azt is 
relatively expensive for instance maintena zantac the ulcer drug 
and vasotec the high blood pressure medicine both cost patients 
about 70 cents a day 
however barry noted that azt is far cheaper than some new 
antiinfection drugs that can cost 50 a day or more although these 
drugs are usually given for weeks at a time not years 
barry said that many factors go into setting drug prices the 
cost of production the number of patients who will take it the 
need for plant expansion cost of continuing to conduct research on 
the medicine 
buhe overriding factor is the expense of paying foompanys search 
for new treatments and cures wh million last year 
the successful drugs and the revenues obtained from them must 
pay for all of the enoarch we do in basic scientific fields or in 
applied fields that fail said ba the biggest element that 
determines how much we charge for drugs is the bottom line how 
much revenue do we need to get to keep our company out of the red 
and to sustain our research program 
barry said azt is difficult to mak23 steps but the manufacturing 
cost is just one relatively minor factor in the price and dbe 
like determining the cost of surgery based on the cost of stainless 
steel used in scalpels it makes no sense at all 
still stock analysts do estimate such costs johannah walton of 
shearson lehton in london calculates that the raw material for 
making azt mainly thymidine costs 300 peruring costs between 
3000 and 5000 per kilogram 
if she is right this means the ingredients in a single 100 
milligram capsule cost 3 cents and manufacturing the product costs 
30 to 50 cents 
a few months after azt was introduced in 1987 the company cut 
its price 20 percent to the current level 
though the company refuses to speculate about further price cuts 
walton said she expects another 20 percent price reduction within 
the next year because of improvements in manufacturing the growing 
number of users and the likelihood that newer drugs will be easier 
to make and probably cheaper 
if the price stays the same she said sales of azt could rise to 
800 million to 900 million in 1992 
this prediction is based on the assumption that the drug will be 
used by 40 percent of all people with serious symptoms of hiv 
disease 25 percent of those with early symptoms and 20 percent of 
infected people with no symptoms

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
bush administration is considering food aid to poland but is 
awaiting signals from that countrys new government 
its on the front burner itll stay on the front burner over 
the next few days until we come to some final decisions yeutter 
said thursday 
at the moment its premature to draw any conclusion partly 
because the new government is just getting into place in poland and 
we want to have some signals and some expressions of viewpoint from 
that government before we get heavily involved in this rkan 
said the possibility poland especially food aid was discussed by 
president bush and key advisers during a meeting wednesday at bushs 
vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
there may be additional aid offered dole said were 
talking of some kind of emergency effort by the united states and 
the western alliance dole told reporters its a question of 
timing a question of showing that were willing to do a little more 
than when polands government was communist 
dole met with leaders of polands solidarity uninment officials 
during a trip to eastern europe last month 
most of the leaders we talked to were pleading for food aid 
dole said recounting meetings with solidarity leader lech walesa 
polish president wojeiech jaruzelski and polands new prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki meat and butter is what they really 
need at least in the short term doid the primary thing is 
food they want to fill the shelves they want to show change 
people expect things to be better 
during his visit to warsaw last month bush said he would ask 
congresve 100 million in development aid for poland tontrys 
private sector he said he would ask an additional 15 million to 
help improve the environment 
dolhat there are only vague ideas of how additional aid to 
poland would be paid for and that the agriculture department is 
looking at options 
yeutter was asked about bushs promise during last years 
presidential campaign that he would never use food as a political 
weapon 
when the president said he would not use food as a political 
weapon he was really referring to the kinds of export embargoes 
weve had through the years yeutter said his desire and 
interest trating conclusively to american agriculture that we 
wouldnt be following that route during his administration 
the most controversial embargo was the one against the soviet 
union a partial lid on shipments ordered by president carter on 
jan 4 1980 in retaliation for soviet aggression in afghanistan 
ilifted 16 months later by president reagan 
ultimately experts decided the us embargo had little or no 
effect on the soviets who mostly turned to other suppliers for 
grain during that period 
every time wethrough agricultural embargoes weve ended up 
shooting ourselves in the foot yeutter said 
it seems tat what were doing now in the way of positive 
actions whether they be in poland or anywhere else in the world 
through food aalls into an entirely separate category he said 
if fooan be used as a mechanism to deliver positive change in 
polcal and economic circumstances that would seem to be a laudabl 
yeutter said 
dole said that while polands new leaders need substantial food 
aid soon the countrys longterm needs include finding the means to 
reduce its longterm foreign debt which now stands at about 42 bi

monsters are among the topics being kicked around at the 47th 
world science fiction convention 
more than 5000 writers scientists and fans assembled thursday 
for a long weekend of late night filking and confabs on the 
future of scifi and the word is that cyberpunk is out 
enthusiasts from science fictions fandom began flocking to the 
hynes convention center clad in star trek uniform tops 
propellorbeanies and tshirts festooned with buttons 
at its best fandom is far less discriminatory against people 
who are different andi schecter a prominent boston fan said 
during a panel discussion on fandom at its worst were a bunch 
of nerds 
heated longrunning debates are characteristic of these 
conventions whether theyre over the proper rotation of a space 
station around a manufactured sun in a novel from the 50s or over 
the general worth of filkers singers who rewrite folk songs with 
spaceage lyrics 
this year the filkers are staying at a different hotel 
at times fandom has all the dynamics of a fourthgrade 
playground schecter said 
the conference also features the presentation of the coveted hugo 
awards for outstanding science fiction writing as well as a brunch

connections and find out what next years hot topics will be 
chuq von rospach a hugo nominee who publishes other realms 
magazine said he sees writers tending toward bringing fantastic 
events into the real world rather than setting off for worlds of 
fantasy 
von rospach and others also said that cyberpunk the 
controversial subgenre that took hackers and the technologies of 
the information age into the future with protaganists physically 
entering computer systems through their personal computers was 
waning in support because it was overused 
organizers are looking beyond fantasy theyve invited marvin

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
farmers home administration faces a more businesslike future than 
its past as a grant agency churning out money for hardup 
farmers 
weve just got to reform that program take it out of the 
status of what its really become a grant agency and move it 
back to being a credit institution once again yeutter said 
thursday 
yeutters comments came as thousands of delinquent fmha borrowers 
begin getting notices that they had better start settling accounts 
or face the possibility of foreclosure 
the fmha has its roots in the great depression of the 1930s and 
is often called the governments farm lender of last resort to be 
eligible farmers must be unable to get regular loans from banks or 
other commercial institutions 
yeutter said the agriculture department agency has made 
billions of dollars of questionable loans over the last decade or 
so many of which are in default today 
but he noted that attempts have been made to change fmha and to 
toughen its lending practices only to be thwarted by legal action 
filed by farmers or their advocates or by congress 
if we have to change legislation in this area in order to do a 
more effective and skillful job of managing fmha well make 
legislative proposals to have that happen yeutter told a 
television news conference if we can do it administratively 
well do it that way 
for years the fmha has been embroiled in controversial attempts 
to collect longoverdue farm loans new procedures to help protect 
the interests of farmers and to enable the agency to proceed with 
its collections were included by congress in the agricultural credit 
act of 1987 
the latest move involves fmha sending out a new batch of 
collection notices to borrowers who failed to make their scheduled 
payments by the first of this year 
the total owed fmha by all delinquent borrowers is about 87 
billion although there is no breakdown showing how much the 1989 
notices involve said agency spokesman marlyn aycock 
the fmhas county offices were told to mail out the collection 
notices by aug 25 so delinquent borrowers could have them by sept 
1 aycock said 
the county offices were sent lists of delinquents totaling 13217 
borrowers as of aug 1 and were instructed to delete names of those 
who had settled their accounts 
aycock said those deletions could reduce the list to between 
11000 and 12000 names by the time they were mailed out last week 
but we wont get an actual count until farther down the road 
he said 
the list of delinquencies has shrunk dramatically since jan 1 
when it was more than 30000 borrowers he said by july 3 it was 
down to 15704 names and the aug 1 count dropped to 13217 the 
basic list sent to county offices 
borrowers will have 45 days from receipt of the notices to return 
forms to fmha describing how they want to settle their overdue 
accounts the 1987 law requires the agency to tell farmers they have 
certain options including reamortization or rescheduling payment 
deferral reduced interest rates and in some cases debt 
forgiveness 
if farmers dont respond or if a borrower is in such poor 
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out forced sale 
or foreclosure proceedings could begin 
aycock said the latest notices are in addition to more than 
66000 sent last fall to delinquent borrowers many of whom had not 
made payments for three years or more

a sharp drop in soybean prices helped trigger a 
14 percent decline in the prices farmers got for raw products last 
month says the agriculture department 
overall commodity prices at the farm level averaged the same as 
they did in august 1988 
the departments agricultural statistics board said thursday in 
its preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans corn lettuce 
and potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease from the july 
average 
higher prices for cattle apples eggs and grapefruit partly 
offset the decline for the other commodities 
oilseeds which include soybeans and feed grain prices showed 
the greatest monthtomonth decline while meat animals and milk had 
the largest increases 
a 90centsperbushel decline in the price of soybeans from 
july to august was the largest monthtomonth decline since 
junejuly 1984 the report said corn and sorghum prices were 
down but the average barley price was up 
wheat prices moved up after four months of small declines hogs 
and beef cattle were up from july but calf prices were down 
slightly 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said earlier thursday that 
he expects 1989 will be a good year for farmers although there 
is a mixed situation across the country because of drought and 
other weather problems 
i would guess net cash income nationally would be slightly 
below 1988 but not very much below he said crop production 
generally has rebounded from last years droughtreduced yields and 
exports are up 
overall id say farmers feel a lot better yeutter said 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products as a group increased 16 percent from july to 
august and averaged 53 percent more than the yearearlier level 
crop prices overall dropped 45 percent from july and averaged 
59 percent less than in august 1988 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in july averaged 144 
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison down from 146 percent in 
july that was the lowest reading since november when the index was 
also 144 percent

investigators studying the cause of a new 
years day house fire that killed 10 had an unusual piece of 
evidence a journal kept by one of the victims a 9yearold girl 
kimberly smischney of bemidji described by her teacher as a 
child who loved to write recorded in her journal how spooky it was 
that the lights at her cousins home in remer often flickered and 
popped 
her notes helped the fire marshals office determine that 
electrical problems may have caused the blaze 
she wrote many times about the house in remer because she loved 
it she loved going down there said arlane mullranin kimberlys 
thirdgrade teacher at horace may elementary school 
killed in the fire at the converted schoolhouse were kimberly 
her mother father and 10yearold brother her four cousins and two 
neighbor children remer a town of 400 is about 55 miles from 
bemidji 
the blaze occurred during a holiday gathering at the home of 
kimberlys aunt and uncle who were out celebrating the aunts 32nd 
birthday when the fire broke out 
mrs mullranin said thursday that kimberly kept the journal as 
part of a class project 
most 8 or 9yearolds dont like to write but kimberly was a 
writer she said she just felt she was born to be a writer or a 
singer 
children that age mrs mullranin said enjoy things that are a 
little bit strange or spooky and the house was spooky 
when i first read them i just commented back isnt this a 
funny house she said later it made more sense to me 
after the fire the teacher gave copies of pages from kimberlys 
journal to the fire marshals office 
i felt that possibly kim could help to solve the mystery and 
that i could do something too mrs mullranin said 
the cause of the blaze could not definitively be determined 
david bahma a deputy state fire marshal said in his final report 
dated jan 5 
but after ruling out the structures wood furnace and oil space 
heater he concluded that the blaze was accidental and could have 
been started by careless smoking or electrical problems in his 
report bahma noted references in kimberlys journal to unusual 
electrical occurrences at the house 
in one entry kimberly wrote that a light burned out when it was 
turned on in a bedroom mrs mullranin said 
i went to remer and the first day saturday night i was going to 
sleep near my cousins eddie and tigger and jay her brother well i 
sat down to quiet the boys down i laid back down and my pillow was 
gone kimberly wrote 
tigger turned on the light to look for it and the light burned 
out sam my other cousin turned on the bathroom light and it went 
out too i was so scared i found my pillow 
two weeks later kimberly wrote the lights went out in the house 
while others remained on in town 
i went to remer saturday and there was a blackout we had a 
couple little ones before the big one kimberly wrote we had to 
get out a lot of candles we had to close off the upstairs so it 
would stay warm i had almost dropped in fact i did drop a candle 
but it went out i was scared when i dropped the candle

a judges ruling that an energy department 
administrator committed an ethics violation will hurt the government 
as it tries to revitalize its nuclear waste management program the 
agencys deputy secretary says 
of course its a setback henson moore said in a telephone 
interview thursday after the ethics finding was disclosed 
us claims court judge reginald gibson found that samuel rousso 
acting director of the waste management office violated a 
conflictofinterest law by helping award a 1 billion contract to a 
group of companies that included one of his former employers 
moore said he was concerned that the ethics charge was another 
blow to the departments credibility which has been hurt in recent 
years by a series of project failures he suggested the blame should 
be put on the reagan administration 
were still seeing the fallout of things that happened before 
we got here he said 
the 10year contract in question calls for managing and 
integrating the work of other contractors at the yucca mountain 
nev site where the department is trying to determine the 
suitability of building an underground repository for nuclear waste 
gibsons finding was part of a broader ruling released in 
summary form last week in which the judge blocked the energy 
department from awarding the contract to bechtel management system 
inc as rousso and other department officials had recommended in 
december 
among bechtels partners in the bid was science applications 
international corp a san diegobased engineering and consulting 
company where rousso worked from october 1985 to may 1986 
the judge said the department could give the contract to no one 
but trw inc an unsuccessful bidder that sued the department on 
grounds that roussos key role in the bid evaluation process had 
biased the outcome in bechtels favor 
moore the no 2 energy department official said the department 
had not decided whether to appeal gibsons ruling he said senior 
department officials would take a lengthy look at the situation 
which could lead to major changes in the yucca mountain project 
rousso joined the energy department in june 1986 one month 
after leaving science applications and immediately became involved 
in preparing for the yucca mountain bidding process he was chairman 
of a department panel that studied the various yucca mountain 
contract bids and recommended dec 2 that the bechtel team be chosen 
gibson said rousso violated a federal ethics statute that 
prohibits an energy department supervisor from participating in 
department decisions involving any energy company that the 
supervisor has worked for within the past year 
rousso declined to comment on the decision in a brief telephone 
conversation thursday in an interview with the associated press 
earlier this week he said he had acted in good faith and believed 
no conflict of interest had been shown 
the conflictofinterest statute at issue allows for civil 
penalties of up to 10000 for each violation to be imposed by the 
department head or a federal court 
agency spokesman phil keif said he didnt know whether the 
department was considering seeking civil penalties against rousso

the number of mortgage loans issued in the citys 
black neighborhoods is disproportionately lower than in white 
neighborhoods the federal reserve bank of boston reported 
this unfortunate pattern persists even after taking into 
account economic and nonracial characteristics that could be 
responsible for differences between these neighborhoods said the 
report issued thursday 
the report stopped short of identifying the problem as redlining 
a practice by which lenders systematically discriminate against 
minority neighborhoods 
its suggesting that there may be other factors like 
insufficient outreach to minority neighborhoods that contribute to 
this said herb wass a spokesman for the federal reserve bank 
there just isnt sufficient data to find out if its all the 
lenders fault 
gov michael s dukakis ordered two state cabinet members to 
review the report and to use every means at our disposal to ensure 
that every citizen has the opportunity to own a home regardless of 
race or national origin 
the report said that because the number of mortgages are 
vulnerable to ups and downs in the housing market as well as the 
credit market it is difficult to disentangle the role played by 
lenders as opposed to buyers sellers developers and others in 
causing this disparity between black and white neighborhoods 
but the report stated flatly that boston financial institutions 
are functioning in a way that hurts black neighborhoods 
the report suggested that banks and thrifts should lead the 
way in correcting the problem by reevaluating their lending 
practices and changing the way they market their services and check 
credit needs 
i think it points up some crying needs in the city said 
robert sheridan president of the massachusetts banking association 
the message here is that the banking industry must move forward 
and i see it as a fair challenge 
the report was based on the analysis of about 48000 real estate 
transactions from 1982 to 1987 in bostons 60 neighborhoods 
as a result of reports about redlining in atlanta new york 
detroit dallas and other cities over the past two years civil 
rights and community activists have continually demanded the release 
to the public of numerical ratings the government keeps on community 
lending 
the savings and loan bailout bill approved by the house in june 
discourages redlining by requiring that lenders disclose both the 
number of loans they approve as well as the number of applications 
they get by race income and sex

the white house is putting a 78 billion price 
tag on its new drug strategy but intends to withhold from the 
american public details about 30 percent of the plan according to 
an administration source 
speaking on the condition of anonymity the source said thursday 
the government plans to keep secret classified sections outlining 
intelligence operations and detailing how it far it will go in 
pursuing drug traffickers 
white house chief of staff john sununu said thursday in 
kennebunkport maine that assembling the 78 billion could involve 
shifting money from other programs president bush is scheduled to 
announce the new policy in a nationally televised speech tuesday 
night 
you dont want the narcotraffickers to know what the limits 
are the source said we cant let them know how far we would go 
before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in 
the document draws from suggestions submitted by several federal 
agencies to drug czar william bennett 
it has been learned the strategy will call for more penalties 
against users steppedup law enforcement and expanded treatment 
programs up to 260 million in economic and military aid will be 
sent to colombia bolivia and peru to stop cocaine at its south 
american origin sources said 
the pentagon announced thursday that the first shipments in a 65 
million emergency aid package for colombia are scheduled to leave 
sunday a final list of supplies still is being drafted but 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said two c130 b medium range cargo 
planes will ferry the initial supplies 
president bush on vacation in maine said any international 
effort to aid colombia in its war on drugs would be useful 
the administration source said bush will reveal as much of the 
drug strategy as he can without compromising operations against 
traffickers 
the idea is to tell as much as possible to the people the 
source said but it is obvious we cant tell all 
sections of the plan that will remain classified deal with 
precise areas of drug operations and strength of us antidrug 
forces overseas the source said some portions dealing with 
strategies at home also will remain under wraps 
also to be kept secret are which thirdparty countries give 
information to the united states the source said the us 
intelligence community frequently relies on its allies to pass on 
secret data 
the plan attempts to lay to rest bureaucratic infighting among 
various agencies in the drug war sources say it calls for an 
increased role for the military more us troops will be committed 
to advising and training overseas forces but the plan stops short 
of calling for direct us military intervention 
the strategy according to sources delineates the overseas 
operations of the drug enforcement administration the state 
department which runs drug eradication programs and the cia which 
gathers intelligence data 
the cia set up a counter narcotics center in april to combine 
operational and analytical support to our countrys fight against 
international drug trafficking according to spokesman bill devine 
he said the plan is to unite the entire intelligence community 
the federal bureau of investigation defense intelligence agency 
the national security agency customs and the dea along with the 
cia in that effort 
attempts to stop the cocaine flow into the united states by 
working directly in south america were all but stopped earlier this 
year by security threats to american personnel from leftist 
guerrillas in colombia and peru and insufficient guidelines and 
cooperation among us agencies 
at home the plan envisions a crackdown on drug users calling 
for a program that would allow judges to strip student loans and 
other federal benefits from offenders 
a draft of the strategy leaked to the media in july called for 
a 49 percent increase in treatment funds 925 million in fiscal 
1990 compared with 621 million this year and 12 billion for new 
prisons a 28 percent increase over this year

a new wave of narcotics with names such as 
croak moon rock and parachute is hitting the nations 
streets along with a smokable form of heroin authorities say 
the drug cartels like any successful marketers of a product 
are constantly working on new and improved models of their wares 
sen joseph biden ddel said thursday 
their innovation means more death and devastation for our 
cities 
methamphetamines commonly called crank as well as a mixture 
of crack cocaine and heroin known as parachute are among forms 
of narcotics that could take root in the decade ahead authorities 
told a hearing of bidens senate judiciary committee 
also on the horizon are croak a mixture of crack and 
cocaine and basuco a cocaine derivative authorities said they 
said users already are able to buy a synthetic form of heroin known 
as pfunk 
mixing crack and heroin staves off the suicidal depression or 
crash crack users feel soon after the burst of euphoria caused 
by the drug said dr walter faggett substance abuse services 
director at dc general hospital 
heroin remains in wide use but is being sold in new forms said 
william hopkins director of street research for the new york state 
division of substance abuse services 
one is called his or heroin in a straw the powder is tapped 
into the straw and the ends heatsealed hopkins said 
pushers he said have taken to handing out business cards 
stating the street corner where they can be found the cards 
sometimes contain partial phone numbers at the last minute they 
add two digits he testified 
that makes it easy to shop by phone 
you can order drugs and a kid will deliver them to you on a 
bicycle he said 
irate citizens are at times able to clear street corners of 
pushers by holding antidrug rallies hopkins said but then 
steerers appear to herd addicts to corners a few blocks away 
were sales are in progress he said 
heroin is found in increasingly purer forms hopkins said 
young addicts are increasingly blending heroin and cocaine he 
said 
some of these young users shoot some of them snort and some of 
them smoke he said some smoke it on joints some smoke it on

tighter controls are expected to sharply reduce 
releases by industry of the cancercausing chemical benzene but 
federal officials acknowledge the curbs wont affect the biggest 
offender the automobile 
industrial releases account for about 20 percent of all benzene 
releases in the country said jack farmer director of the 
environmental protection agencys air emissions standard division 
most of the other emissions come from automobiles although small 
amounts also are found in cigarette smoke and various consumer 
products 
benzene a flammable colorless and odorless liquid escapes into 
the air after evaporating either through various industrial 
processes or from the automobile as the engine heats 
chronic exposure to benzene has been found to cause adult 
leukemia birth defects and other ailments 
the epa announced thursday that it would impose new emission 
control requirements on industry aimed at cutting by 90 percent the 
more than 40000 tons of industrial benzene released into the air 
each year 
most affected will be the steel and petroleum industries which 
will have to install nearly 1 billion in emissioncontrol equipment 
at coke production plants as well as at gasoline storage 
distribution and marketing facilities 
the epa listed benzene as a hazardous air pollutant in 1977 
the curbs on industrial benzene pollution were seen as a 
significant step coming after a dozen years of debate but epa 
officials acknowledged the rules address only a relatively small 
percentage of the benzene spewed into the air each year 
while the rules were expected to cut emissions in the steel 
industry by 97 percent and in the petroleum industry about 65 
percent they dont address releases when gasoline is pumped into a 
car or emissions during the vehicles operation officials said 
however william rosenberg assistant epa administrator for air 
and radiation said the agency will propose separate regulations 
next month aimed at dealing with toxic vapor releases from 
automobiles as engines become hot 
in addition to requiring changes in the composition of gasoline 
to reduce vapor releases rosenberg said the agency will consider 
requiring auto manufacturers to install additional equipment to 
capture vapor emissions including benzene releases 
clean air legislation before congress includes provisions aimed 
at reducing the release of toxic chemicals including benzene 
from motor vehicles both through tailpipe exhausts and vapor losses 
from the engine and fuel systems 
the epa estimated overall costs for the new regulations on 
industrial benzene pollution were at about 13 billion for initial 
installation of equipment with another 200 million annual cost for 
maintenance and operation of the new equipment 
these will be costly but feasible controls said f henry 
habicht deputy epa administrator adding that they will protect 
public health from the risks associated with industrial benzene 
exposure 
habicht said the emission reductions are designed to reduce the 
chance of a person eventually getting cancer as a result of benzene 
exposure to less than one in 1 million when considering the entire 
population 
the risk are higher perhaps as much as one in 10000 for 
people that live near industrial plants or facilities where there 
continue to be high amounts of benzene habicht said

mayor marion barry is calling new allegations 
that he has used drugs part of a campaign by federal officials to 
malign his character 
barry reacted angrily to news reports thursday that a convicted 
drug dealer who faces additional charges in the nations capital has 
told authorities that he and the mayor used drugs together 
through leaks to the press and other sources federal 
authorities have done what they set out to do to get headlines and 
to assassinate my character barry said in a statement read by his 
staff director maudine cooper this is lawlessness by the 
government 
the mayor was vacationing in rehobeth beach del and could not 
be reached to comment beyond his prepared statement 
us attorney jay b stephens would not say whether charles 
lewis the drug suspect has implicated barry in interrogations by 
federal agents but stephens said he wants the justice department to 
investigate whether stories about lewis cooperation originated with 
law enforcement officials 
lewis has been charged with perjury cocaine possession and 
trafficking in a federal probe that began last december when 
district police inexplicably called off an undercover attempt to 
make a drug buy from him after learning that barry was in lewis 
hotel room 
lewis was convicted on drug charges in the virgin islands earlier 
this year sentencing on that conviction has been postponed 
indefinitely 
for the past several years barry has been dogged by persistent 
rumors that he uses drugs in his statement thursday he repeated 
his declaration that he never saw or used drugs during at least six 
visits to lewis hotel room 
despite those denials top city officials said the newest rumors 
about barrys alleged drug use are harming his bid for reelection 
i was up until 3 am talking to some prior supporters about 
this said one top barry aide who asked not to be identified a 
number of these people say he just cant run for mayor and they 
wont support him 
said another aide all eight people i talked to this morning 
said they would not back him some of these people were tireless 
volunteers others had been major contributors 
barry is among four people who have announced their candidacies 
for the democratic mayoral nomination and the rev jesse jackson 
who has moved to washington has failed to completely discount 
rumors that he also will run 
the mayor was scheduled to unveil district drug czar sterling 
tuckers new antidrug strategy friday but three top city sources 
said barry had scuttled that plan cooper said barry would not 
return to work until next tuesday

a collection of federal agencies is beginning a 
decadelong multimillion dollar investigation into changes faced by 
planet earth 
evidence is increasing on the scientific table that change is 
occurring said bob corell of the national science foundation 
adding that both natural and humaninduced changes could have a 
broad impact on the future 
a host of agencies have joined in the 2yearold federal 
committee on earth science to set up the research to monitor 
understand and ultimately predict global change said robert 
post of the office of science and technology policy 
global change is a large complex scientific problem and it 
still is not largely understood committee chairman dallas peck 
head of the us geological survey said at a thursday news 
conference 
there is a shared common purpose to go understand global 
change said nasas dixon butler 
peck described the coming fiscal year as largely a planning 
period to be used setting up research programs likely to last a 
decade or more 
the atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority with 
michael hall of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
explaining that clouds are a major factor in the feared rise in 
global temperatures their effect is not well understood he said 
the widely discussed threat of global warming however is only 
part of the overall research effort that includes studies of threats 
to the earths protective ozone layer possible changes in the 
oceans and atmosphere air pollution and acid rain 
the most attention has been paid recently to the reports of 
warmer temperatures with some scientists concerned that the carbon 
dioxide and other gases added to the atmosphere by human activities 
will increase temperatures and cause disruptive climate change 
this socalled greenhouse effect is disputed by other scientists 
however and evidence is lacking on both sides that is an area the 
researchers hope to tackle early 
funds totaling 1915 million for fiscal 1990 are included in the 
budgets of various departments to get the program under way 
the seven major areas of research set forth in the committee plan 
are 
climate and hydrologic systems the role of clouds is the first 
item on the agenda followed by research in ocean circulation links 
between the air land and water and their interactions 
biogeochemical dynamics such things as the relationship between 
living organisms and the water and atmosphere for example trees 
take carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen and 
cutting down trees will reduce that activity 
ecological systems and dynamics which covers how people plants 
and animals would react to climate change and how their reactions 
might in turn affect other processes 
earth system history will look into what has happened to the 
land air and water when climate has changed in the past 
human interactions will examine population growth and 
development energy and land use and industrial production and how 
those activities affect the earth 
solid earth research will include research on coastal erosion 
volcanoes and their effect on climate permafrost the sea floor and 
other areas 
solar influences studies will include monitoring the incoming 
radiation from the sun the amount reflected into space and how that 
energy affects the earth and its climate 
in addition to the geological survey science foundation office 
of technology policy nasa and noaa other agencies participating in 
the program are the state department environmental protection 
agency departments of transportation agriculture and defense 
council on environmental quality

the internal revenue service has delayed for 
two months implementation of a tax rule that encourages companies to 
provide health and life insurance benefits to all their workers 
the new deadline for implementing the socalled section 89 rules 
is dec 1 the irs said thursday 
legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate 
that health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favor 
higherpaid workers the original deadline of jan 1 1989 had been 
delayed until oct 1 
business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether 
arguing that it is so complex costly and time consuming that it 
will drive some small companies out of business 
they claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended 
because companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them to 
all workers 
several measures affecting section 89 are pending in congress

a hearing will be held next week to determine 
whether irancontra figure john m poindexter may introduce evidence 
that covert aid to nicaraguan rebels was legal 
a federal judge thursday scheduled a sept 6 hearing to discuss 
whether there was valid evidence that the former national security 
adviser could use to defend the charge that he obstructed 
congressional inquiries into whether national security council aide 
oliver l north was secretly helping arm the nicaraguan contras 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress in august 1986 by 
assuring three house committees that the national security council 
was observing the spirit as well as the letter of a ban on us 
military assistance to the antisandinista rebels 
us district judge harold greene said he wanted to determine if 
poindexter should be given a chance to prove he had no motive to 
conceal norths activities by showing they were legal authorized 
or known throughout the government 
at issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by president 
reagan or other government officials could be presented as evidence 
that poindexter thought the national security council was following 
the law

alligator hunters are poised to fan out 
over lakes and canals for the start of the states second gator 
season in a quartercentury and hide and meat processors wont be 
far behind 
under new rules the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligators 
immediately by harpoon or bangstick a handheld device that shoots 
a 22caliber cartridge on impact 
last year most of the 2979 gators bagged were captured and 
brought to processors alive several airboats were capsized but no 
serious injuries were reported in the hunt the states first in 26 
years 
dead gators must be skinned within four hours to keep the meat 
from spoiling so hide and meat processors have made arrangements to 
get the fresh meat in cold storage quickly 
the industry has addressed the needs and is taking whatever 
actions are necessary to ensure that the quality of the meat is 
preserved said dennis david coordinator of state alligator 
programs many of them were making arrangements to have ice trucks 
and refrigerated trucks and large coolers to purchase carcasses at 
the lake shore 
wildlife officials say the states population of about 1 million 
alligators wont be hurt by the monthlong hunt beginning a 
halfhour before sunset today 
a study of lake okeechobee gators indicates the hunt actually may 
improve the health of the general population by reducing the number 
of reptiles competing for survival david said 
the state revived the hunt last year to help trim the gator 
population which has doubled since stringent antipoaching measures 
were adopted in 1970 
okeechobee one of 32 bodies of water open to the hunters is 
drawing particular attention following reported sightings of an 
18foot alligator east of clewiston on the lakes southwest shore 
yet some feel its mostly a tall tale 
its probably 90 percents rumor said charles lawhon of moore 
haven if its there its a wellsmart alligator and it keeps 
well hidden 
hunters can earn about 500 for the skin and meat of a 4foot 
gator and prices for large bulls can reach 1000 the biggest 
gator bagged last year stretched 13 feet 4 inches 
parts of the everglades in western dade and broward counties will 
be offlimits despite aboveaverage alligator populations because 
of excessive mercury levels 
the state selected 229 names at random from among 20163 
applicants for hunting licenses all but eight attended a sixhour 
training session and paid a 250 fee for the right to kill 15 gators 
each david said 
david expects this years catch to be about 2900 again

captors holding us hostages in lebanon are 
motivated by a personal vengeance that will be more difficult to 
overcome since israel kidnapped a moslem cleric says a us moslem 
leader who claims to have met with the hostageholders in beirut 
mohammed mehdi secretarygeneral of the national council on 
islamic affairs said thursday the kidnapping of sheik abdulkarim 
obeid worsened the prospects that the exceptionally bitter 
exceptionally paranoid kidnappers will free the hostages 
they feel the right to retaliation is sacred and any 
questioning of that is illegitimate said mehdi who claims to be 
possibly the only person in the united states who has met with the 
kidnappers in beirut 
obeid who is affiliated with hezbollah the proiranian 
extremist group believed to sponsor hostageholders was abducted 
from his home in south lebanon july 28 by israeli commandos israel 
saying obeid was involved in terrorism has refused to free him 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth claimed 
july 31 it retaliated by hanging us marine lt col william r 
higgins who was abducted while on un duty in lebanon us 
officials said they believe higgins was killed but some reports say 
the killing occurred months earlier 
joseph cicippio one of the seven other us hostages was 
threatened with death then given a reprieve 
mehdi claims to have met with people responsible for holding 
cicippio and terry a anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press during a february 1987 visit to beirut to 
appeal for the hostages release 
he said he was led blindfolded to the meeting in a dimly lighted 
room in beirut the captors he met with four men ranging in age 
from about 20 to 25 bore personal scars from the fighting in 
lebanon mehdi said 
the man who claimed to be in charge of holding anderson the 
longestheld hostage who was kidnapped in 1985 said his entire 
village was destroyed by us bombs dropped in retaliation for the 
bombing of the us marines headquarters in lebanon when 241 
servicemen were killed 
he is so damn bitter he is ready to drop such shells on new 
york on washington mehdi said of andersons captor who lost his 
wife children and grandparents when his village was bombed 
the captor responsible for holding cicippio who was kidnapped in 
september 1986 told mehdi his children had been burned by american 
napalm dropped from an americanmade airplane piloted by an israeli 
three of the captors five children died mehdi said 
what mehdi was told in lebanon however does not entirely match 
previous accounts of the kidnappers or events surrounding the 
abductions 
the man holding anderson has been described as a 38yearold 
lebanese shiite imad mugihniyah who is driven by a desire to free 
relatives held in kuwait for attacks on us and french facilities 
there 
there was one us bombing run following the destruction of the 
marine headquarters and it was not reported to have destroyed any 
villages 
in the case of cicippio israeli sources knowledgeable about 
israels war in lebanon say israeli planes used napalm in a few 
cases against strictly military targets belonging to syria 
mehdi said that although americans consider the kidnappers to be 
terrorists the kidnappers perceive themselves differently 
they said we are taking care of these people is this 
terrorism or is the burning of our children terrorism 
mehdi said his attempts to persuade the kidnappers that their 
actions violated islamic law that the taking of innocent hostages 
was contrary to the faiths teachings on personal forgiveness and 
individual responsibility were a dead road 
mehdi who is seeking a meeting with secretary of state james a 
baker iii said the us should pressure israel to release obeid to 
start a chain of events to secure the release of the hostages 
sheik obeid to his group in southern lebanon is like the 
pope and you do not kidnap the pope said mehdi colonel 
higgins was a victim of this 
the united states also should start trying to understand the 
suffering that caused the kidnappers to take hostages mehdi said 
people are not born terrorists circumstances make them take 
such violent actions if we dont bother to examine those 
circumstances we will be denying ourselves the opportunity to solve 
a problem mehdi said

feeling down doesnt increase a persons risk of 
cancer says a study that investigated the suggested link between 
mood and disease 
the study shows a lot of speculation about the emotional 
component in cancer is just speculation said morton bard vice 
president for services and rehabilitation for the american cancer 
society 
the possibility of a connection between outlook and disease has 
been periodically put forward since the beginning of history 
bard said 
he said the studys message is hold on there there is no 
answer yet the study by three researchers at the national 
institute on aging challenges the theory that depression can 
increase vulnerability to cancer but doesnt end the debate said 
alan b zonderman one of the researchers and a psychologist and 
senior staff fellow at the institute 
i think for the time being at least the weight of the evidence 
is certainly that theres no risk of cancer from depression said 
zonderman coauthor of a report on the study in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
the study is a 10year followup on 6403 people who took part in 
a 197175 survey by the national center for health statistics which 
gathered extensive data on psychology and medical risk 
the researchers updated the subjects medical history 
using the results of two psychological tests conducted during the 
earlier survey they identified 1002 as down most of the time 
zonderman said 
of those subjects 110 or 11 percent had been diagnosed with 
cancer or had died from it since the original study 
of the 5401 subjects who were considered not depressed 527 or 
10 percent had been diagnosed as having cancer or had died of it 
the 1 percentage point difference between the cancer rate for the 
two groups is statistically insignificant the researchers said 
we found that depressive systems didnt predict who was going 
to get cancer or who was going to die from cancer 10 years later 
zonderman said 
there was no difference in results when researchers adjusted the 
study to allow for other factors that could relate to cancer 
including sex age marital status smoking habits family history 
of cancer hypertension and cholesterol level 
the results also were unchanged after eliminating subjects who 
showed any sign of cancer based on a examination at the time of the 
initial survey 
earlier studies have supported a link between depression and 
cancer but the new research is a significant blow to that theory 
said bernard fox a professor in the department of psychiatry at 
boston universitys school of medicine who wrote an accompanying 
editorial in the journal 
although previous studies also have found no link between 
depression and cancer the work by the national institute on aging 
is the most extensive so far said fox who specializes in the 
relationships between personality and disease 
this is a highly controversial area in which there has 
unfortunately been too much exploitation for commercial reasons 
relating emotions to cancer said bard of the national cancer 
society 
the new study may help deter people from investing too much faith 
or money in the idea that how they feel will effect their 
susceptibility to cancer or their ability to fight it he said

an agreement between u s west communications and 
regulatory officials will give refunds of 46 million to colorado 
consumers this year and increase telephone rates by more than 85 
million beginning in 1992 
the agreement was reached thursday by u s west the state office 
of consumer council and the state public utilities commission the 
commission was to hold a hearing on the settlement today in denver 
the refund stems from a february 1989 commission order requiring 
u s west to return money collected under federallymandated 
depreciation rates that later were overturned by the us supreme 
court 
customers who paid bills between 1985 and 1989 will get a refund 
about equal to the local service portion of one months telephone 
bill the company said the refunds will appear as credits 
probably in november bills the company said 
the company sought the rate increase to upgrade equipment 
especially for rural customers the size of the rate increase for 
individual consumers hasnt been set yet u s west has proposed 
phasing in a hike of less than a dollar a month on every phone bill 
in the state 
were delighted with this settlement said ron binz director 
of the consumer counsel office it means telephone customers get 
the refund theyre entitled to and the states rural customers get 
modern telephone service 
jim smith a vice president for u s west communications said the 
agreement would allow the company to modernize equipment across the 
state 
switching operations in 84 communities need to be modernized 
officials said but the companys regular equipment replacement 
budget can handle only four to six offices a year 
the improvements will allow for a variety of new services such as 
automatic call forwarding and transmission of computer data over 
telephone lines u s west said

thousands of east germans who fled to 
hungary will be allowed to travel to west germany in the next few 
days government sources and an opposition party official say 
west german karsten voigt foreign affairs expert for the 
opposition social democrats said in budapest thursday that senior 
hungarian officials confirmed to him they plan to let out all east 
germans who want to leave for west germany 
about 10 percent of the 150000 to 200000 east germans 
vacationing in hungary are thought to be seeking passage to west 
germany and bonn and budapest have agreed to help them the 
government sources said on condition of anonymity 
hungary and east germany are ruled by communist governments and 
are in the soviet camp however hungary has embraced westernstyle 
reforms while east germany has shunned them 
in vienna austrian officials confirmed that bonn asked them to 
arrange for special rail transportation for up to 20000 east 
germans 
voigt discussed the situation in budapest on thursday with 
hungarys communist party president rezso nyers and foreign 
ministry officials 
hungary will let the east germans out under the auspices of the 
red cross or some other international humanitarian organization 
voigt told the west german zdf television network 
i was told this could only be a onetime thing and it is 
certainly important for the east german leadership to tolerate such 
a solution if not support it he said 
the apparent plan to allow east germans out of hungary without 
the usual documents authorizing their departure may have been 
intentionally leaked by west german officials earlier thursday to 
let potential emigres in east germany know about the rare escape 
opportunity 
most areas of east germany receive western radio or tv broadcasts 
asked if hungary had agreed to allow the escapes during the next 
few days one west german official told the associated press i 
cannot deny that 
officially bonn has denied it is working with hungary to aid the 
escapees foreign ministry spokesman peter rothen described reports 
of the plan as pure speculation 
however austrian railways officials in vienna told the 
associated press they were asked by bonn to ready railroad cars for 
a mass transport of refugees from the hungarian border on sept 6 
one official said he expected the exodus sooner perhaps this 
weekend 
austrian railways has promised to make up to 50 train cars 
available within six hours at an unspecified border point with 
hungary the official said on condition of anonymity 
the frankfurter rundschau newspaper said the refugees would be 
allowed passage to west germany on the basis of their east german 
visas for hungary 
a senior west german foreign ministry official michael jansen 
has spent this week shuttling among budapest vienna and prague 
hungarys foreign minister gyula horn visited east berlin on 
thursday 
the illegal exodus of at least 6000 east germans through hungary 
this summer has strained relations between the two warsaw pact 
allies as well as between east germany and west germany 
east german state media have accused bonn of enticing workers to 
the west and have embarked on a propaganda war to scare citizens 
into staying 
unprecedented legal immigration combined with the largest escape 
spree since 1961 when the berlin wall was built will bring at 
least 100000 east germans to west germany this year the 
intergerman affairs ministry has predicted 
hungary has become the escape route for many east germans 
frustrated with the lack of reform in their country it began 
dismantling its border fortifications with austria in may as part of 
its democratic reforms 
east germany a nation of 16 million suffers a widespread labor 
shortage the west german economy is expected to benefit from the 
new influx of manual laborers and skilled technicians from east 
germany including a construction boom to provide housing for the 
newcomers

the libertarian party announced plans to 
strengthen its selfproclaimed role as americas third party but 
leaders acknowledge their opposition to the drug war isnt likely to 
win votes quickly 
nevertheless the party opened its annual convention thursday by 
renewing its call for the legalization of drugs 
it does no good to back away from the unpopular issues 1984 
presidential candidate david bergland told delegates 
the party believes drugs should be legalized because the war 
is an excuse to trample individuals rights just as the prohobition 
of alcohol spawned organized crime the libertarians say current 
laws make drug dealing profitable 
at this moment in time the drug enforcement administration is 
the greatest threat to the liberties of the american people said 
dave nolan a founder of the 18yearold party 
the party boasts 200000 members but had less than 500 in 
attendance at the opening session of the threeday convention 
delegates had to pay their own way 
nolan conceded that the drug war is popular at the moment and 
our stand against it is going to be unpopular 
but party leaders said their position would reap dividends 
eventually because the war on drugs was doomed to failure 
we will be seen as the ones who stuck to their guns said 
larry dodge a onetime us senate and gubernatorial candidate in 
montana 
the drug position is consistent with the libertarian philosophy 
that government is too big and intrusive that philosophy also leads 
to them to support abortion rights and gun owners rights and 
advocate a noninterventionist foreign policy 
several party leaders said the libertarians should focus less on 
running for president and more on getting their message to the 
public they announced a renewed effort to use the media and high 
school seminars to spread their ideas 
when a representative of the libertarian party goes to a public 
high school every student is impressed with the legitimacy of the 
party in the political system bergland said 
the libertarians were thrilled that the convention was covered by 
cspan which covers congress and offers public affairs broadcasts 
on cable television 
we look for balance cspan spokeswoman kristin wennberg said 
thursday mimicking the republicans and democrats the libertarians 
brought placards to the meeting site a hotel ballroom bearing 
the names of all 50 states but some states had no representatives 
present

chancellor helmut kohl said today that 
only the truth will heal the wounds of the war germany began a half 
century ago and declared his nations readiness to reconcile with 
poland 
in a nationally televised speech to the federal bundestag or 
parliament on the 50th anniversary of the start of world war ii 
kohl said germans had to acknowledge their responsibility for the 
holocaust and hitlers dictatorship 
but he said that following germanys defeat in the war the 
nation had been fundamentally altered and dedicated to the 
principles of freedom and democracy for those reasons he said the 
younger generation of germans were absolved of responsibility for 
the war 
they bear no guilt for dictatorship or the world war neither 
collective as there is no such thing nor individual as their elders 
retain that he said 
but kohl also said the horrors inflicted on europe by the nazi 
regime could never be overcome or underestimated 
it must always be a reminder he said referring to the 
millions of victims of the holocaust it can never be rendered 
harmless by false comparisons 
joining parliament to hear the 50minute speech were guests that 
included polish students warsaws ambassador to west germany 
ryszard karski and us ambassador vernon walters 
kohl was interrupted by applause only once when he said west 
germany wished success for polands new leadership 
relations with poland and other communist nations of the east 
bloc were a major theme of kohls address and of memorial speeches 
by other west german dignitaries including president richard von 
weizsaecker and former chancellor willy brandt 
we want understanding between the german and polish peoples 
kohl declared this is our duty and it expresses the yearning of 
both peoples 
poland was the first nation to fall victim to nazi attack when 
hitlers army invaded sept 1 1939 beginning the world war that 
would eventually claim 50 million lives 
in the name of germany and by german hands were the terrors 
brought about for the polish people kohl said reconciliation 
is only possible if we tell the whole truth 
kohl recalled the systematic extermination of jews poles 
gypsies and political opponents and blamed the nazis and the all 
too many germans as well as many others abroad who allowed 
themselves to be blinded and misguided by tyranny 
his cautious attempt to address the responsibility of todays 
germany for the crimes of the past recalled memories of a more 
controversial effort last november by thenbundestag president 
philipp jenninger 
jenninger of kohls christian democratic union offended 
liberals and conservatives alike when his recollection of how 
germans at the time praised hitlers repressions was interpreted as 
being in sympathy with those sentiments 
in that speech on the nov 10 1988 the anniversary of the 
kristallnacht pogrom against jews 50 years earlier jenninger said 
the germans of that time saw the early years of the third reich as a 
triumphal march 
jewish leaders including simon wiesenthal later excused 
jenningers remarks as unfortunate but not illintended but the 
parliamentary leader stepped down a day after the speech in the face 
of widespread public criticism 
kohl said the foundation of the west german state established 
after the war discourages the growth of extremism but that radical 
elements persist today 
extremism from the political right or left can succeed and come 
to power only when the citizens turn away from the democratic 
parties or stand indifferent he said 
he made no direct reference to the ultraright republicans party 
but appeared to be warning west germans against defecting from 
moderation 
the republicans have garnered as much as 10 percent of the vote 
in recent local elections on a campaign platform that some view as 
threatening the rights of foreigners and have drawn important 
support away from kohls conservative party

israeli troops clashed today with several 
guerrillas in israels selfdeclared security zone in south lebanon 
an army spokesman said one guerrilla was killed and two escaped 
security sources in lebanon said a fourth gunman may have escaped 
after being wounded in the clash 
during the fighting two sovietmade katyusha rockets exploded in 
northern israel causing no damage security sources said the 
rockets were apparently fired from outside the security zone near 
the area of the clash 
the clash happened before dawn near the village of beit yahun 
six miles northwest of the israeli border said an israeli army 
spokesman who requested anonymity in line with military regulations 
the spokesman said the dead gunman carried a sovietmade ak47 
assault rifle and large amounts of ammunition and plastic explosives 
later soldiers showed reporters the body of the dead guerrilla 
who was wearing a camouflage uniform the soldiers also showed three 
kalashnikov assault guns two of which apparently belonged to the 
escaped fighters 
on thursday another round of katyusha rockets struck near a 
house in northern israel smashing windows but causing no injuries 
military spokesmen said they did not know which militia the 
guerrilla killed today may have belonged to 
the last attack in the security zone was on august 9 when a 
suicide car bomb carrying 550 pounds of explosives was detonated 
near an israeli military convoy wounding five israeli troops and an 
allied lebanese militiaman two men in the car were killed 
hezbollah the shiite moslem fundamentalist militia claimed 
responsibility for the attack and said it was in retalitation for 
israels kidnapping of a proiranian lebanese clergyman israeli 
troops abducted shiite cleric sheik abdel karim obeid from his home 
in south lebanon israeli troops along the northern border have been 
on alert in anticipation of hezbollah attacks 
israel created the security zone in 1985 as a buffer zone after 
withdrawing the bulk of its force following a threeyear occupation 
the 2to12milewide zone is patrolled by israeli soldiers and 
the 2500member israelisupported south lebanon army militia

thousands of ethnic moldavians marched today to 
protest a law that satisfies their demand to make their native 
tongue the republics official language but which still allows the 
use of russian 
the law passed by moldavian legislators on thursday was a 
compromise measure meant to appease ethnic russians and other 
minorities who opposed making moldavian the official language 
in the three baltic republics nationalist group leaders sharply 
criticized the kremlin for attacking their efforts to gain more 
autonomy latvias activist organization demanded that the central 
government recognize the regions special economic and political 
status 
the moldavian supreme soviet legislature met today to consider 
how to apply the controversial language law moldavian was made the 
official language in a show of independence from the soviet union 
and an attempt to preserve moldavian culture 
ethnic moldavians make up 64 percent of the republics 
population and russian and other ethnic groups comprise the rest 
the law makes moldavian the official language of government and 
economic affairs but allows use of both russian and moldavian in 
everyday life 
the provision that sanctions some use of russian was aimed at 
ending strikes at an estimated 200 businesses and industries by 
ethnic russians angered by the law 
tens of thousands of moldavians poured into the streets of the 
capital kishinev on thursday night to protest the compromises and 
several thousand massed again today official and unofficial sources 
said 
people are disatisfied with all the compromises the deputies 
agreed to konstantin bogdanash a journalist with the peoples 
front group that has led the campaign for preservation of the 
moldavian language said in a telephone interview 
bogdanash said protesters outside kishinevs opera theater where 
the 350member supreme soviet meets held signs reading people 
want freedom and respected russians mother russia calls you 
home 
the people are scandalized we need only one language said 
vasily nestase another peoples front member 
he said the group would call a general strike if the decision is 
not reversed and that the next step would be secession from the 
soviet union 
we are not a legal part of the soviet union nestase said 
pointing to the soviet annexation of moldavia from neighboring 
romania in 1940 under a nazisoviet agreement of the year before 
which also divided poland and the baltic states 
the lawmakers on thursday also restored the latin alphabet taken 
away a halfcentury ago by dictator josef stalin when he annexed 
moldavia stalin imposed cyrillic the alphabet used in russian to 
back his claim that romanians and moldavians are two distinct 
nationalities even though the languages are virtually identical 
a third proposal which was rejected would have made moldavian 
the language of communication among russians ukrainians jews 
bulgarians and other nationalities in the republic many 
nonmoldavians do not speak moldavian but generally know some 
russian 
legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise of 
bilingualism similar to that proposed wednesday by moldavias 
communist party chief semen grossu after a conversation with 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
according to a reporter for atem moldavias official news 
agency it reads the russian language as the language of 
interethnic communication in the ussr is used on the territory 
of the republic together with moldavian as a language of

bilingualism between russian and the national tongue 
in the baltics the leaders of the peoples fronts of latvia 
lithuania and estonia reacted to the communist party leaderships 
recent scathing criticism of their independence movements 
a statement released after a meeting of the three groups in the 
latvian capital riga said the partys criticism was adopted 
behind the backs of these republics without even the slightest 
attempt to discuss with them problems closely concerning them 
said artis erglis a secretary of the latvian peoples front 
whether the authors wanted it or not as a result in the eyes 
of many people they look like the brothers of those who divided 
zones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereign 
people the statement said 
the latvian peoples front issued a statement today saying its 
leaders planned to revise their groups platform to include a call 
for complete independence for the republic 
only in an independent democratic latvia can an economic and 
political crisis be overcome the statement said

shu wei one of the last students to leave 
tiananmen square before the military moved in on that bloody dawn in 
june said today she now thinks the student leaders should be thrown 
in jail 
zhang lin who took part in hunger strikes on the square is 
thankful to her university for political education classes giving 
students a chance to reach a clear understanding of the june 
tragedy 
the two were among a group of 13 officials and students from 
qinghua university who met foreign reporters today to give their 
views of the studentled democracy movement and its aftermath 
their conclusions that with thorough ideological guidance the 
students now realized their errors in joining the 7weeklong 
prodemocracy protests matched daily reports in the official press 
in which students admit being misled by counterrevolutionaries 
bent on overthrowing the government 
the newly adopted progovernment stances however differ with 
what many students say in private conversations they say students 
repeat whatever is expected of them at political discussion sessions 
but that few people really accept the government version of the 
crackdown on the student movement 
qinghua vice president liang yoneng said as many as 2000 of the 
universitys 13800 undergraduate and graduate students joined major 
street marches in late april and that 200 took part in a midmay 
hunger strike 
four students were killed all by gunshots and 11 were injured 
during the june 34 military attack on students and their supporters 
chinese officials say 500 people died in the crackdown while 
western security sources say the death toll may have been in the 
thousands 
liang said no students had been expelled for participating in the 
demonstrations three students wanted by police had been arrested 
and police were conducting further investigations against others 
involved in spreading rumors and instigating unrest he said 
liangs only expression of regret was that the university did not 
move more quickly to stop the demonstrations if we had stopped 
them the losses would have been smaller 
shu an automotive engineering student said it was quite 
reasonable for the government to round up student leaders because 
they violated the law in some respects and they must be dealt 
with 
student activists who led the protests have been charged with 
counterrevolutionary crimes and have been among the thousands 
arrested since the june crackdown 
the students at qinghua one of chinas most respected 
universities returned to campus on aug 14 to catch up on classes 
missed during the turmoil and for a heavy dose of political 
indoctrination 
similar to other beijing universities qinghua students are 
receiving four weeks of political education eight hours a week of 
reading documents by government leaders watching governmentedited 
videos that show rioters attacking soldiers and writing personal 
reflections expected to reveal sadder but wiser individuals 
the foreign reporters were also given a tour of a computer 
classroom and a student workshop and allowed to speak briefly with 
students 
one 20yearold engineering student shi xiaoli said students 
now agree they were pulled into a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
but unlike the selected speakers miss shi acknowledged there was 
some unhappiness with specific government measures she mentioned a 
harshly worded editorial in the communist partys peoples daily on 
april 26 which accused the students of causing social turmoil 
it was like setting fire to dry wood she said referring to 
a major protest march on april 27 the editorial should have made 
clearer that only a handful were counterrevolutionaries

a roman catholic priest who banned shorts 
miniskirts and other scanty apparel in his church has angered some 
parishioners but the archdiocese says it has no plans to overrule 
his policy 
since he began enforcing the dress code this summer the rev 
roger griese has turned away worshipers four times from sacred heart 
church where he has been pastor since 1968 in this southwest ohio 
city 
he also has posted notices reminding congregation members they 
must wear modest attire if they are to receive communion 
denial of communion is highly unusual in roman catholic doctrine 
said monsignor lawrence breslin of suburban kettering a former vice 
rector of the american college in rome 
my responsibility is to see to the proper and reverent use of 
the house of god griese 73 said thursday my responsibility 
is to god and the church 
grieses feelings about churchgoers attire did not represent 
those of the archdiocese said a dayton spokesman for archbishop 
daniel pilarczyk 
i hope that people dont think that his opinion is the general 
opinion of all priests said the rev robert monnin who also is 
pastor of st christopher church in nearby vandalia thats one 
mans opinion 
but he said the archbishop had no plans to speak to griese or 
take steps to curtail his policy 
ray george communications director for the cincinnati 
archdiocese said his office had received about 20 calls about 
griese ranging from support to outrage 
among those angered was elizabeth corrado 20 who ignored the 
warning signs and entered grieses church one sunday last month 
wearing shorts and a silk shirt she said she was accompanied by her 
boyfriend also wearing shorts 
in front of the entire church he says get out of my church 
youre not welcomed here ms corrado recalled i couldnt 
believe he was saying this of course everybody was staring at us

syrian troops bombarded the christian 
heartland today in fierce artillery battles that left at least seven 
people dead and 55 wounded 
police said the casualties came after midnight in clashes that 
escalated after the christian leader gen michel aoun claimed his 
troops repulsed two infiltration attempts by syrianbacked 
militiamen during the night 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll in nearly six 
months of fighting to at least 819 killed and 2409 wounded 
police said the syrians were shelling the entire 310squaremile 
christian enclave north of beirut the christian port of jounieh 
north of beirut was pounded by hundreds of shells and rockets 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said 80 shells a minute were hitting the enclave as 
christian gunners tried to knock out the syrian artillery 
apartment buildings burned out of control in both parts of 
divided beirut and other areas as the syrian army and christian 
forces battled through the night and morning 
one christian shell blasted the secondfloor apartment of mustafa 
najjar 33 a soundman with the londonbased visnews television 
agency in the aishe bakkar neighborhood of moslem west beirut 
najjar carried his 8yearold daughter and 7yearold son through 
the flames to safety but his wife amal 27 was burned to death 
neighbors said she was one of seven civilians killed thursday 
ambulances sped through the deserted smokefilled streets of 
west beirut taking casualties to hospitals 
about 90 percent of the citys 15 million people have fled the 
carnage in recent weeks leaving an estimated 200000 people 
huddling in basement bunkers and underground garages in the 
shellblasted capital 
shells exploded around the oncethriving hamra business section 
and the oncefashionable ras beirut residential neighborhood in the 
citys moslem sector at noon 
a spokesman for aouns command said the nighttime attacks by 
syrias allies in beirut and east lebanon were apparent infiltration 
attempt to probe christian defenses 
the spokesman who declined to be named said one group of 12 
militiamen tried to penetrate from syriancontrolled moslem west 
beirut near the harbor on the eastern end of the capitals dividing 
green line 
another group tried to infiltrate across our lines in the 
eintuffaha sector on the mountainous eastern flank of the christian 
enclave 
both attempts were repulsed the spokesman said we believe 
they were reconnaissance attempts by syrias allies to feel out our 
combat readiness 
he said aouns 155mm guns scored several direct hits on a syrian 
ammunition dump in the mountain town of bolonia 15 miles northeast 
of beirut 
the depot exploded in a ball of fire that was followed by a 
chain of blasts in the pine woods around bolonia the spokesman 
said 
the christians claimed their forces knocked out a syrian tank in 
the druse moslem hamlet of abadiyeh six miles east of beirut with 
106mm cannons 
syrian headquarters in lebanon declined comment on the christian 
claims 
police said syrian guns in west beirut were shelling the 28mile 
stretch of mediterranean coast north of beirut held by the 
christians 
the enclave is ringed by syrian troops and their allies on its 
three landward sides the coastal strip is the christians only 
lifeline to the outside world 
a witness in west beirut said syrian artillery fire forced a 
big ship off the christianheld coastline to flee when it tried to 
run the blockade the syrians imposed in midmarch to stop arms and 
other supplies reaching aouns beleaguered forces 
the ship turned around when the shelling started said the 
witness who spoke on condition of anonymity shells are falling 
around it aouns men are shelling the syrian artillery to take the 
pressure off it

grandparents of a 4yearold boy were 
charged with keeping the child in a squalid outdoor pen during the 
day with no toilet and just a bottle of water officials said 
gene and joyce white said they built the caged pen for the boy to 
keep him from roaming out onto a nearby highway 
if that excuse is satisfactory it will be up to a judge or 
jury but it is not satisfactory to me district attorney drew 
edmondson said thursday the boy was kept in a 10foot pen with a 
wire fence on two sides and board fence on the other two sides so it 
could not be seen from the highway 
there was a bean bagtype chair and toys inside the pen water 
was in a baby bottle which was in the dirt and there was no toilet 
facilities except in a corner of the pen there was no roof and the 
pen was covered only by a tree he said 
the whites faced a misdemeanor charge usually filed in cases of 
failure to pay child support the omitting to provide charge 
carries a year in jail or a 500 fine 
edmondson that was the only charge available to prosecutors we 
looked at the child abuse statutes very carefully and our feeling 
is it requires an injury or maiming of the child which is not 
present in this case 
the boy his 11yearold cousin and the whites 13yearold 
daughter who also lived in their recreational vehicle were taken 
into custody tuesday by the state department of human services 
child welfare investigators will hold a hearing to determine if 
the children should be returned to the home or placed in temporary 
custody elsewhere 
investigators said the boy appeared to be wellnourished and had 
no apparent injuries 
the boys mother left him with the grandparents when he was 2 
and the boys father apparently works in another city said 
sheriffs deputy patrick howland

europe today paid solemn tribute 
to the millions of victims of world war ii which started 50 years 
ago on sept 1 when a german warship opened fire on a tiny polish 
garrison 
adolf hitlers troops quickly overran poland and the war spread 
around the globe in the end 50 million people had died 
by then the nazis had shocked the world with the extermination of 
6 million jews and the united states had forever changed warfare by 
dropping nuclear bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 
many of belgiums 6 million dutch speakers woke up to a broadcast 
of hitler declaring war on poland brt state radio opened its 
foreign news report with a tape of the original declaration and 
germans cheering for their fuhrer 
in london a reunion was planned of some of the people who were 
evacuated during hitlers savage blitzkrieg bombings of the city 
italys leading daily the milanbased corriere della sera told 
its readers that europe paid the price of its lacerations with the 
loss of its political supremacy 
west germanys chancellor helmut kohl told a special parliament 
session in bonn we feel sorrow for the unspeakable suffering 
which was caused to human beings and nations in the name of the 
germans and by the hand of the germans 
we mourn for the many innocent victims from within our own 
people kohl added 
as he spoke a group of young poles sat in the visitors gallery 
the group had been invited as a sign of reconciliation between west 
germany and poland which suffered more than any other country from 
the nazi atrocities 
there still are nagging questions over west germanys 
relationship with poland kohl has been under pressure from the 
opposition social democratic party to visit poland as he has 
promised to do and provide more financial aid to warsaw 
by delaying his visit the chancellor is wasting good chances 
to give a clear expression to the reconciliation process between 
poles and germans party leader hansjochen vogel said thursday 
the communist party daily in czechoslovakia rude pravo called 
the fighting that spread to all corners of the globe mankinds 
most terrible war 
in communist east berlin foreign minister oskar fischer called 
today a day of recollection and sorrow during a speech to the 
500member peoples chamber 
fischer also repeated the commitment to do everything in our 
power to insure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives 
and the lives of our children 
corriere della sera called hitlers blitkrieg the technology of 
a new genghis khan the dreaded mongol conqueror of central asia 
it noted that hitler had the support of the german masses 
also pointing out that european political clout plunged after world 
war ii 
some of the most closely watched events were scheduled in poland 
president wojciech jaruzelski was to speak at westerplatte on the 
baltic coast where the first shots were fired 
we will pay homage to all victims of the war we will pay 
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in 
peace said wlodzimierz lozinski a spokesman for jaruzelski 
american conductor leonard bernstein was to lead an 
internationally televised memorial concert in warsaw and pope john 
paul ii was to address fellow poles in warsaw by a tv hookup 
but an event to bring together members of the worlds dominant 
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a 
boycott by polands only rabbi 
rabbi menachem joskowicz said he would stay away because the 
roman catholic church has not removed a convent from the auschwitz 
concentration camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the 
25 million jews killed there 
fifty years after the outbreak of world war ii there are still 
many unresolved issues traceable to adolf hitlers dictatorship 
they include the role of secret protocols in the 1939 
nonaggression pact between nazi germany and the soviet union 
the agreement allowed the soviets to take over the baltic 
republics of estonia latvia and lithuania and western accounts say 
the pact paved the way for the start of world war ii 
recent soviet reforms have emboldened residents of the baltics 
now the site of a growing independence movement 
the kremlin on thursday called world war ii the most horrible 
and destructive of all wars the commentary from the official 
soviet news agency tass then quickly lept to how the lessons of 
the past should lead the west to agreeing with moscow on arms 
control issues 
in bonn ultraconservative finance minister theo waigel said he 
did not deny one iota of german guilt for the war but he added 
that a onesided view of history with the conclusion that only the 
germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead 
to dangerous condemnations 
ultraconservatives have long asserted that soviet dictator josef 
stalin also shares some of the blame for the outbreak of the war

federal highway officials scrutinized the 
scaffolding used during the construction of a bridge that collapsed 
on a major baltimorewashington thoroughfare injuring 14 people 
the overpass collapsed thursday during the morning rush hour as 
workers poured concrete onto the bridge 
all of a sudden i saw these big blocks of concrete hitting my 
hood said earnest l izzard 52 i thought i was a goner but 
something inside im sure it was god kept me calm 
it was like a mountain coming down toward you said thomas 
rogers 53 of baltimore who was riding in the back seat of 
izzards car i dont know how we made it 
another driver kimberly sue andersen 30 of elkridge got 
deluged with debris and was pinned in her car until rescue workers 
pulled her out she was taken to the maryland schock trauma center 
with head injuries and a fractured jaw she was listed in critical 
but stable condition today 
four other passengers and nine construction workers were also 
injured some of workers went down with the bridge when it fell 
i was right on the bridge said david klein 25 a 
construction worker from hanover i heard the metal giving way i 
was wondering if i was going to be alive when i hit bottom 
highway officials say they want to determine whether the bridges 
steel and wood scaffolding was damaged when it was moved from a 
bridge that runs parallel to the one that collapsed 
such scaffolding is commonly used in bridge construction to 
provide a temporary support of the wet concrete deck of the bridge 
until the concrete sets 
the collapsed overpass was one of four bridges being built as 
part of a 62 million interchange project on the federally owned 
parkway at route 198 when the two bridges over the northbound 
parkway lanes were built the contractors dismantled the scaffolding 
after finishing the first bridge and set it up again to build the 
second bridge 
workers at the site said thursday that the general contractors 
associated marjon inc of ashland va and jp smith of edgewater 
md used that procedure to save time construction on the bridges 
began in march 1987 and was to be completed by this november 
company officials could not be reached thursday but federal 
officials and the contractor on the first two bridges said the 
practice is not unusual

its own with bush inviting the press corps to watch him take off 
for a lateafternoon fishing jaunt

a former official with the us department of 
housing and urban development was paid at least 200000 to help 
lobby for hud financing of a luxury manhattan apartment building a 
newspaper reported today 
new york newsday said hud eventually agreed to provide an 85 
million mortgage for the building 
alexander naclerio was hired to lobby on behalf of the ritz plaza 
developers in 1986 11 months after he left his job as director of 
housing in huds new york office and as top aide to former regional 
director joseph monticciolo newsday said 
the 479 apartments in the nearly completed 44story building in 
midtown manhattan will rent for 1702 to 3929 a month 
the project would have been eligible for a 35 million federal 
housing administration insured mortgage but naclerio argued that 
housing costs were higher in new york and that the developer had 
purchased neighboring air rights so the ritz plaza could be bigger 
hud officials agreed to the higher mortgage the paper reported 
naclerio is expected to testify about his role in the ritz 
project when he appears before the house government operations 
committee which is investigating the awarding of federal housing 
subsidies under the reagan administration

the energy department said today it has resumed 
commercial sales of tritium after investigators concluded that 
missing amounts of the radioactive gas were not diverted for use in 
building nuclear warheads 
in the meantime a team of department specialists is pressing an 
investigation of missing amounts of tritium shipped from the oak 
ridge national laboratory in tennessee to two british companies 
said phil keif a doe spokesman 
keif said discrepancies over how much tritium was shipped to 
commercial customers had been resolved except for the cases of the 
british companies surelite and saundersroe developments ltd he 
said department officials had discounted the possibility that the 
missing amounts had been diverted to bomb production 
i dont think anybody thinks that keif said 
tritium is used in biological and energy research and for 
production of luminous lights such as those used on airport runways 
as well as signs dials and watches it is used in nuclear warheads 
to boost the weapons explosive power 
the energy department had announced last july that it was halting 
commercial sales until it could account for about 5 grams of mssing 
tritium total annual commercial sales of the manmade gas are about 
180 grams it said 
the decision to resume sales on a limited scale was made aug 16 
at the same time a special team was formed to work out the shipment 
discrepancies that had not been resolved during a twomonth search 
by a joint team of doe and nuclear regulatory commission officials 
keif said 
keif said a series of eight tritium shipments to ei du pont de 
nemours amp co for use in biomedical work started aug 25 and was 
continuing he said a fullscale resumption of sales would begin 
sometime in september after the department had fully installed a set 
of tighter controls at the oak ridge laboratory 
tritium is produced at the savannah river nuclear reactors near 
aiken sc but all three active reactors there have been shut down 
for more than a year to correct mechanical and management problems 
doe said thursday that no decision will be made until spring on 
an exact date for resuming tritium production in a statement 
energy secretary james d watkins denied a washington post report 
that he had decided to recommend to president bush that the first of 
the three reactors be restarted next july 
i have made no final decision on a recommended restart schedule 
for any of the departments savannah river production reactors and 
do not intend to speculate prematurely on possible restart dates 
watkins said 
watkins also said that even after he makes a recommendation on a 
proposed restart date no exact date could be set until next spring 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said in a telephone 
interview that watkins meant uncertainties about technical reactor 
issues would probably persist for several more months 
moore said that while watkins had made no final decision on a 
recommendation we have a target date in mind for restarting the 
first savannah river reactor moore said he couldnt disclose the 
target date 
the post story said watkins would tell bush next week that 
waiting another 10 months to restart the aging savannah river 
reactors would not jeopardize national security 
tritium production is vital to nuclear weapons production because 
the gas decays at a rate of 55 percent a year and thus must be 
regularly replenished to keep the nuclear arsenal fully ready 
becky mcswain a spokeswoman for westinghouse savannah river co 
which manages the reactor complex under an energy department 
contract said thursday the company would have no comment on the 
post report 
earlier ms mcswain acknowledged that westinghouse two months 
ago had recommended to watkins that the first of the three reactors 
at savannah river be restarted in september 1990 and that watkins 
had indicated he wanted an earlier restart

wildlife 
the coast guard said representatives from the ship and refinery

francisco rodriguez a high school 
classmate of gen manuel antonio noriega was sworn in as president 
today president bush announced there would be no diplomatic 
contacts with the new government 
in a televised ceremony at the supreme court court president 
marisol reyes de vasquez administered the oath of office to 
rodriguez and vice president carlos ozores the proceedings were 
closed to the press and diplomats 
in a statement bush said the us ambassador to panama arthur 
davis would not return davis was called back to washington in may 
bush also said the administration will continue to take other 
steps to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the 
panamanian people he did not elaborate 
after the oath of office mrs vasquez and rodriguez exchanged 
the traditional embrace and he then donned the presidential sash 
the 10member court attended the ceremony 
the council of state named the president and vice president on 
thursday it declared that elections cannot be held until us 
economic sanctions and aggression end 
the council a body of cabinet ministers and heads of the 
military and agencies that noriega is presumed to control said it 
will evaluate the situation in six months to determine whether 
elections are possible 
noriega is head of the panamanian defense forces the nations 
military and the de facto leader of panama 
the council said rodriguez will head a provisional government 
that will rule with a legislative commission of 41 appointed 
members it said the national legislature will be abolished and the 
government will draft a new constitution 
rodriguez a 50yearold career bureaucrat was a high school 
classmate of noriega and served in the cabinet of the late gen omar 
torrijos in the mid1970s 
asked why diplomats were not invited to the swearingin a south 
american diplomat said i guess they do not want to run the chance 
of being turned down by some he noted that several ambassadors 
had been recalled by their governments or had gone on vacation 
apparently to show displeasure with the break in constitutional 
procedure 
panamanian authorities decided to form a provisional government 
after canceling the may 7 presidential election international 
observers said the opposition candidate won by a 31 margin but the 
government said the results were distorted by us interference and 
economic aid to the opposition 
opposition leaders have refused a government offer to share power 
the opposition said this week that it planned no organized 
protests of the new government to avoid bloodshed but that it will 
continue to fight to have its election victory recognized 
the council of state said in a statement that it will consider 
new elections only if the united states ends its aggression and 
releases all funds it has frozen 
panama has suffered in the past two years the most merciless 
brutal and cruel aggression by the government of the united 
states the council said the president of the united states in 
the use of his war powers has decreed against panama economic 
sanctions and measures that government has never imposed against its 
most bitter enemies 
panama says its gross national product declined 17 percent in 
1988 the worst drop since 1945 and that more than 30000 jobs were 
lost in the economic crisis aggravated by the twoyear confrontation 
with the united states 
the council of state said panamanians must fight all attempts 
by a foreign government to manipulate the judicial and political 
organization of the panamanian people the comment was a reference 
to us policy not to resume relations with panama unless noriega is 
removed from office 
noriega who has been indicted on federal drug charges in 
florida claims washington is trying to discredit him in a plot to 
renege on a treaty to return control of the panama canal to the 
country in the year 2000 when all us military installations in 
panama must be shut down

col moammar gadhafi celebrating his 20th 
year in power declared his support for panama today and said former 
president reagan has landed in the dustbin of history 
gadhafi also took credit for inventing perestroika the soviet 
unions program of economic and political restructuring and said 
the state of israel is an illegal entity 
gadhafi spoke at a special session of the general peoples 
congress libyas parliament to open the anniversary celebration 
that has attracted an array of leaders from the middle east and 
revolutionary governments 
the festivities mark the 20th anniversary of the coup that 
deposed prowestern king idris and established gadhafi and his 
radical socialist revolution 
the congress chanted one arab people as gadhafi arrived 
dressed in white slacks a gray sports jacket maroon shirt and a 
white cape trimmed in gold 
gadhafi told the visiting revolutionary leaders i stand with 
you in the trenches 
of reagan his former nemesis the libyan leader said reagan 
has joined hitler and mussolini in the dustbin of history 
gadhafi also said that the world must not be carved on 
religious grounds adding that israel should not be a jewish state 
the zionist entity is a strange entity left over from world war 
ii that must be removed the same way all the effects of world war ii 
have been removed gadhafi said in remarks coinciding with todays 
50th anniversary of the war 
the colonel also said libya supports panama and that we must 
support peoples struggles because if the people win it is a victory 
for us 
president hafez assad of syria and plo chairman yasser arafat 
who has been at odds with gadhafi joined in the anniversary 
activities 
assad and arafat sat beside each other on a platform chatting 
amicably before the session opened other leaders seated on the 
platform included nicaraguan president daniel ortega sudans 
military ruler omar hassan ahmed elbashir algerian president 
chadli bendjedid and tunisias zine el abidine ben ali 
ortega spoke briefly to the assembly recalling the conflicts 
both nicaragua and libya had with the united states under reagan 
reagan is finished and gadhafi continues on ortega said 
according to an unoffical translation of his comments in spanish 
in difficult moments he gadhafi was always close we both had 
difficult moments i owe him so much 
when ortega finished gadhafi embraced him and then the two 
clasped hands above their heads in triumph 
the session was the first in a list of events today that included 
an air show and a massive military parade through the central green 
square which was adorned with lights pennants brightly colored 
helium balloons hundreds of libyas green flags and portraits of 
gadhafi 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
libya also sent invitations to president bush and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher whose countries accuse gadhafi of 
supporting terrorism 
the highestranking western leader to attend was foreign minister 
gianni de michelis of italy whose participation reportedly 
irritated some western governments 
de michelis in comments apparently aimed at his countrys 
western allies said italy welcomed efforts to resolve differences 
with libya so the nations can talk in a climate entirely free of 
suspicions of any kind of action deemed unacceptable to the 
international community 
his attendance and that of highranking envoys from egypt and 
chad underlined the success of gadhafis efforts in recent years to 
move away from a radical goitalone policy to one of cooperation 
with his north african neighbors and western europe 
libya was at its most isolated in april 1986 when us warplanes 
bombed this mediterranean port and benghazi killing an estimated 41 
people including gadhafis baby daughter 
gadhafis adventurism over the years has created other enemies he 
now wants to turn into friends aides say 
on thursday libya and chad announced that they had signed an 
accord to end 16 years of warfare and hostilities that began when 
libyan tanks invaded northern chad and soldiers annexed the 
mineralrich aouzou desert strip 
the accord calls for the countries to reach a political agreement 
over the 40000squaremile border region within a year or turn the 
dispute over to the international court of justice at the hague

archbishop desmond tutu his wife 
and 34 other activists were arrested today as they began a march 
protesting the alleged beating of clergy and church workers during 
an antiapartheid protest 
the anglican archbishop winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize 
was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beaten 
about 20 protesters from the western province council of churches 
the clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whips 
to chase them from a security police office in cape town where they 
had gone to condemn recent detentions of activists 
later when tutu and the other activists left st georges 
cathedral to begin a protest march they encountered police who 
formed a human barricade police told the demonstrators to disperse 
then led them into vans when they refused 
the marchers carried placards with slogans such as to hell with 
restrictions and stop killing our people 
canon winston ndungane chief executive officer of anglican 
church in south africa said tutus arrest was a further 
indication that the authorities will use whateverwork stoppages at their 
factories to protest a labor law which they say cripples their power 
to strike 
one of the biggest union protests was at a unilever ltd factory 
in boksburg east of johannesburg where 1000 workers marched 
around the premises many carrying placards denouncing the yearold 
labor relations amendment act 
the two main black labor federations on thursday called on their 
15 million members to stage protests against the act which limits 
the ability of workers to strike during work hours today 
the federations also joined other major antiapartheid groups in 
calling for a national protest on tuesday and wednesday against the 
segregated parliamentary elections on wednesday in the past such 
protests have taken the form of a general strike 
the same organizations have been orchestrating a campaign since 
early august to challenge segregation laws and mobilize opposition 
to the elections 
on saturday activists plan to attempt an illegal march toward 
the parliament buildings in cape town and on sunday blacks plan to 
hold a mass picnic on a whitesonly beach in durban 
police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past 
week and have banned at least two protest rallies planned for this 
weekend including a peace service in soweto which was to be 
addressed by tutu 
the detainees aid center which assists families of detainees 
said two black activists were detained thursday in soweto when they 
made their daily appearance at a police station in accordance with 
restrictions imposed when they were released from a previous stint 
in detention 
on cape towns outskirts where police and militant youths have 
clashed daily for several weeks several mixedrace students 
reportedly were wounded today when officers fired tear gas and 
birdshot to disperse a rally 
the independent south african press association quoted a teacher 
as saying several students were arrested 
police said three mixedrace men were injured thursday night when 
a small mine exploded at a civic center in athlone near cape town

a top transportation department official says 
the agency is concerned about the latest flurry of takeover activity 
in the us airline industry and may move to block future 
debtfinanced buyouts and foreign purchases 
assistant transportation secretary jeffrey n shane said in 
interviews this week with the wall street journal and the washington 
post that the department will take active steps in response to the 
levels of debt and levels of foreign ownership 
news accounts of his remarks caused airline stocks to drop 
sharply thursday but dot officials declined to comment on the stock 
market development today 
shane was on vacation today and unavailable for comment however 
a dot official said shanes remarks reflect the feelings of 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner who has written letters 
to airline officials expressing concern about leveraged buyouts 
the purchase of a company using its own assets as collateral for 
borrowing money to complete the purchase 
leveraged buyouts usually result in massive debt often forcing 
cutbacks in unprofitable divisions or the selling off of others 
divisions or subsidiaries to help pay off the debt 
federal officials are said to be concerned that heavy corporate 
debts could weaken an airlines financial stability to operate 
safely 
in such a case or if deems management incompetent the 
transportation department can revoke a carriers permission to fly 
shane told the wall street journal that the agency which was 
silent on the recent leveraged buyout of nwa inc the parent of 
northwest airlines has decided it was time to send a message to 
the investment community 
we want to make sure people dont go off making blind 
assumptions about the ability of foreign carriers to buy big chunks 
of us carriers shane told the journal in an interview published 
thursday 
investor alfred checchi bought nwa for 365 billion in a deal 
that also involved klm royal dutch airlines 
that sale touched off a flurry of airline stock buying in 
anticipation of further takeovers or mergers involving ual corp 
pan am corp trans world airlines and others 
but shane said the transportation department was still reviewing 
the northwest purchase and could impose conditions that would 
prevent nwas new owners from restructuring without dot approval 
under the law foreign investors are barred from owning more than 
25 percent of a carrier but the department can object to smaller 
stakes if it believes the foreign carrier is trying to exert control 
dot officials also say the agencys stance is limited to airlines 
and is not the vanguard of a bush administration policy turnabout on 
foreign investment

ptl founder jim bakker will have full 
access to the grounds at the prison facility where he is undergoing 
psychological evaluation because he has not been convicted of 
anything a spokeswoman said today 
us district judge robert potter suspended bakkers fraud and 
conspiracy trial in its fourth day thursday after being told by 
bakkers attorney that his client was found cowering in a fetal 
position with his head under a couch 
potter ordered the fallen evangelist to undergo testing at the 
federal correction institute in butner to see if he is mentally 
competent to stand trial 
no specific information on bakkers condition will be released 
sharon orr a spokeswoman at the facility said in a telephone 
interview 
about all i can tell you is he will go under extensive 
psychological evaluation ms orr said a typical evaluation takes 
30 to 45 days but it has not been determined at this time how 
long this particular evaluation will take she said 
meanwhile bakkers wife tammy apparently was planning to see 
her husband a staff member at jim and tammy ministries who 
requested anonymity said mrs bakker has left orlando fla 
ms orr said bakker had not made up a visitor list and that they 
have not heard from mrs bakker 
she said bakker would be allowed to wear street clothes although 
he was issued an orange prison jumpsuit on his arrival 
bakker handcuffed and clad in the jumpsuit was given a standing 
ovation thursday night by a large crowd of inmates when he was taken 
to a mental health housing unit the durham morning herald reported 
today 
as bakker walked past a group of patients one of them spoke to 
him and bakker smiled back an unidentified source at the 
correctional institution told the newspaper 
several doctors contacted said that although someone could fake 
mental illness bakkers symptoms are consistent with stressinduced 
psychosis 
sure you could fake it said dr william bakewell jr 
acting chairman of the university of north carolina school of 
medicines psychiatry department but youd have to be an awfully 
good actor to sustain it 
on thursday with the jury out of the courtroom potter heard dr 
basil jackson a milwaukee psychiatrist who has been treating bakker 
for nine months say the ptl ministry founder was depressed and 
hallucinating seeing people as frightening animals out to attack 
him 
bakkers attorney george t davis told potter if mr bakker 
is handled gently and carefully he may be able to proceed with this 
trial 
the defense suggested bakker 49 be put in a private psychiatric 
institution but potter ordered bakker to the prison for up to 60 
days for evaluation marshals transported bakker in handcuffs and 
leg shackles 
assistant us attorney jerry miller argued before the judge that 
jackson was a hired gun 
its hard to interpret it any other way other than mr davis 
has once again this time he didnt summon his client up to pray 
this time he summons a psychiatrist up to say that his client cant 
go forward with the defense and its awfully suspect miller said 
the jury was not told thursday about his condition or about 
bakkers commitment potter told jurors the trial would not resume 
before wednesday 
there was no call for a mistrial in court thursday and 
prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to discuss 
the case outside court 
bakker and other ptl executives are accused of diverting for 
their own use more than 4 million raised from followers if 
convicted on all 24 counts bakker could be sentenced to 120 years 
in prison and fined 5 million 
jackson said bakkers condition worsened between wednesday and 
thursday even after he was given xanax an antidepressant sedative 
to put it in lay language the man is stressed out jackson 
said 
the charlotte observer quoted a former ptl employee as saying 
thursdays events were a reminder of what it was like to work for 
bakker 
the unpredictability the drama of it what the american 
judicial system is experiencing is what we experienced at ptl the 
roller coaster that we who have been around him and worked at ptl 
were on said al cress who worked in bakkers executive offices 
in 198485 
the newspaper also reported that 20 years ago bakker suffered a 
nervous breakdown while working for pat robertsons tv ministry in 
portsmouth va 
please dont do this to me a sobbing disheveled bakker told 
us marshals as they took him from his attorneys office to the 
courthouse for processing of the commitment order he curled up in a 
fetal position in the back seat 
tammy bakker last year described a similar scene saying in a 
fundraising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in a 
fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry 
jessica hahn the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with bakker 
led to bakkers downfall said in a 1987 playboy interview that just 
after the tryst a fellow evangelist who had just come from bakkers 
hotel room said he was lying in a fetal position in his room 
saying hes happy

president bush today made formal the expected 
us rejection of the new panamanian government appointed by gen 
manuel antonio noriega and said he plans to tighten existing 
sanctions against that country 
as of today the united states does not recognize any legal 
authority in panama despite its role as one of the most 
strategically located countries in the world the changed situation 
is the result of panamas disputed election process last spring 
bush said in a statement that the administration will continue 
to take other steps to deprive the illegal regime of funds that 
belong to the panamanian people he did not elaborate 
he said the us ambassador to panama arthur davis called back 
to washington last may will not return to panama and there will be 
no diplomatic contact with the new authorities in that country even 
though the us embassy will continue to function 
there have been no official dealings with the noriegadominated 
government in panama for 18 months 
the statement came on the last day of the term of president eric 
arturo delvalle who was ousted by noriega 18 months ago but has 
been recognized by the united states in exile 
the president said the united states will continue to support 
selfdetermination and democracy for panama and counter the threat 
posed by gen noreigas support for drug trafficking and other forms 
of subversion 
i am confident that other governments which support human 
rights democracy and selfdetermination and which opppose drug 
trafficking will take similar measures bush said 
he said it was a sad day for panama and for the democratic 
nations of this hemisphere in the wake of noriegas invalidation 
of last mays election to choose a new president who would have 
taken office today 
observers of the balloting said it was an overwhelming victory 
for noriegas opposition despite his efforts to rig it but the 
military strongman threw out the results 
the united states has chosen for the past year and a half not to 
extend diplomatic legitimacy to the noriegabacked government in 
panama opting instead to continue recognizing delvalle 
delvalle has wielded no authority in exile spent much of his 
time in hiding and had an almostinvisible base of support in 
panama but his term in office was to expire today with no 
acknowledged claimant as his successor 
the highly unusual diplomatic situation arises a day after the 
united states denounced noriega as a man of shameless excess 
with a fortune of up to 300 million from drug smuggling and other 
criminal activities 
noriegas greed personal ambition and selfishness are the 
origin core and sustenance of panamas crisis deputy secretary 
of state lawrence eagleburger told the organization of american 
states on thursday 
the political vacuum grows out of the decision of panamanian 
authorities to void mays presidential elections after independent 
observers concluded that the antinoriega candidate guillermo 
endara had won by a landslide 
speaking to the oas eagleburger said noriegas assets included a 
string of mansions and other dwellings in panama and elsewhere as 
well as various jets and three large pleasure yachts the macho 
i macho ii and macho iii 
an american lawyer for noriega frank anthony rabino said the 
case against his client based on two 1988 florida grand jury 
indictments was politically motivated 
rabino said the us government is asking you and me and others 
to use our imagination to let our dreams run wild and maybe well 
find something evil in gen noriega if we speculate long and 
hard 
noriegas oas ambassador jose maria cabrera said of 
eagleburgers allegations there is nothing new in this string of 
inventions 
the state department asked for the special oas meeting after a 
panamanian diplomat demanded last week that the united states prove 
its drug smuggling allegations against noriega 
in his speech eagleburger outlined a long list of criminal 
activities he attributed to noriega contending that he protected 
cocaine shipments from medellin colombia through panama to the 
united states 
he said that noriega provided refuge and a base for continued 
operations to the members of the medellin cartel after the murder of 
a colombian justice minister in 1984 
he agreed to protect a cocaine laboratory being constructed on 
darien province eagleburger said and he assured the safe 
passage of millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds into panamanian 
banks 
refusing to deal with panamanian authorities has made it 
difficult for the united states to protect its interests in panama 
but there has been no apparent impact on the operation of the panama 
canal 
the united states is responsible for operating the worlds most 
important interoceanic waterway the country also is home to 10000 
us servicemen 
another anomaly became history thursday when ambassador juan b 
sosa a delvalle loyalist who has declined for 18 months to 
surrender panamas embassy in washington to a noriega appointee 
shut down the mission 
with delvalles term expiring sosa said he could no longer 
claim to be the ousted presidents official agent in washington 
under the panamanian constitution an elected president was to 
take office today with the may elections annulled the 
noriegadominated council of state on thursday appointed as 
president francisco rodriguez who has served as government 
comptroller for seven years

police were trying to determine 
today whether drug lords ordered the slayings of five people to 
retaliate for a ussupported crackdown on colombian narcotics 
traffickers 
a sixth victim of the shooting was reported in stable condition 
in the san juan medical center where he was under police guard 
the killings occurred thursday in the thirdfloor offices of 
medical collection services which handles accounts for medical 
insurance programs in the san juan suburb of rio piedras 
an anonymous caller to the associated press on thursday claimed 
responsibility on behalf of the colombian medellin drug cartel 
the caller speaking spanish with a south american accent said 
the killings were retribution for the decision taken by president 
bush and his allies to help the colombian governments war against 
drug lords 
he linked the killings to the jailing of six people in puerto 
rico accused of running millions of dollars worth of cocaine for the 
medellin cartel the six are due to stand trial this month 
the caller said the attack constitutes a clear precise and 
final message that we know the puerto rican government will wisely 
understand 
police superintendent ismael betancourt said in a radio interview 
today that investigators were taking the call into consideration but 
had not been able to determine its authenticity he said no motive 
had been established 
there is no known connection between the collection agency and 
the bush administration and investigators have raised no connection 
between the shootings and the crackdown in colombia 
the fbi joined the investigation but had no immediate comment 
gov rafael hernandez colon in a statement said this is 
totally abnormal we havent had an attack like this here in many 
years we dont know what is behind it 
jose montanez supervisor of the police homicide division said 
police had ruled out robbery because of the method of the slayings 
also the company did not keep a large amount of cash on hand 
it was an execution obviously montanez was quoted by the 
san juan star everything points to that conclusion it was 
not a robbery 
he said three men and a woman were found dead in a computer room 
each with a bullet wound to the back of the head another man was 
shot in the back of the head and died after police arrived on the 
scene 
the only survivor carlos cerra 50 had a bullet lodged in the 
back of the neck but stumbled out of the office and got help 
police theorized that the gunmen used silencers because no one 
else in the building reported hearing any shots the office is 
located above a pharmacy in busy shopping district 
among the dead were edwin perez perez 36 and his wife carmen 
also 36 who owned the business police identified the others as 
jorge alberto fuertes betancourt 41 and gerardo clavell torres 
19 both employees and a visiting computerprogramming student

the consumption of dog meat is on the 
rise in south korea surpassed only by pork and beef reports said 
friday 
a government survey published by the kookmin ilbo newspaper 
showed the eating of dog meat has increased sharply since the 1988 
summer olympics when restaurants were told not to serve it for fear 
of alienating foreign tourists 
the newspaper said the survey was presented thursday during 
workinglevel talks involving several government agencies it said 
the talks centered on whether to recognize eating of dog as an 
indigenous habit 
government officials sensitive about such queries in the past 
refused to confirm or deny the meeting took place 
shin koobum director general for livestock at the ministry of 
agriculture forestry and fisheries was quoted as saying the 
increase in dog meat consumption contributed to a sharp drop in 
consumption of beef 
dog meat is less expensive than beef much of which is imported 
from the united states australia and new zealand 
shim said the amount of dog meat consumed in 1989 was expected to 
reach 33000 tons compared with 460000 tons of pork and 136000 
tons of beef 
the government cannot remain silent and is pressed to work out 
certain measures about dog meat shim was quoted as saying 
the newspaper said shim proposed lifting restrictions on 
restaurants serving dog meat since the olympics they have been 
told to limit operations and not serve foreigners 
we dont have to consider dog meat distasteful or disagreeable 
any more said a businessman who frequently visits dog meat 
restaurants in downtown seoul 
many south koreans believe dog meat is a good source of protein 
and has a delicate taste they also say protests by foreigners are 
based on a misunderstanding that south koreans eat their pets when 
instead dogs are bred for meat 
dog meat often is sold in tents or open air restaurants along 
hillsides and streams on the outskirts of seoul on weekends

attack in the predominately white brooklyn neighborhood of 
bensonhurst 
this was an absolute success proclaimed sonny carson a 
protest leader this will make the city wake up this will let the 
city know that there are young black people who will not take this 
any more 
the march was orderly until those at the front reached barricades 
police erected to keep demonstrators off the bridges roadways 
during the evening rush hour demonstrators threw bottles and bricks 
and police responded with nightsticks as marchers shouted take 
the bridge take the bridge 
twentythree police officers were injured none seriously police 
said an unknown number of others were injured

david dinkins 
spike lee the writer director and costar of do the right 
thing a movie about racial violence in brooklyn argued in a

coffins one symbolizing hawkins and the other huey p newton the 
former black panther leader who was shot to death last week in a

a mysterious ailment that sent a juror in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation trial to the hospital has the 
presiding judge worried the longest criminal trial in us history 
could end in a mistrial 
five of the original six alternate jurors have been excused 
because of illness and job problems during the trial now in its 
third year if the ill juror drops out the last remaining alternate 
would replace him and if one more juror leaves a mistrial would 
end the case without a verdict 
we have to have 12 of you to try this case superior court 
judge william pounders told the panelists who sat in the jury box 
with one chair empty thursday if were down to the final 12 
were in desperate straits 
pounders recessed the case until sept 11 to await a diagnosis of 
the jurors problem and determine whether he will be able to return 
to court 
the jurors have been hearing testimony on charges against raymond 
buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 who are named 
in 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy in a 
series of allegations linked to their now defunct mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach 
the defense rested last week and the prosecution began calling 
rebuttal witnesses 
the judge did not describe the ill jurors symptoms but said 
pathology reports have not yet diagnosed the cause 
pounders said he would try to take advantage of the latest delay 
by working with attorneys on jury instructions he said he wants to 
submit the case to jurors by december

the state attorney general said he will not 
prosecute anyone in the 1988 death of a cadet at a police training 
academy who died of heat stroke after a day of rigorous exercise 
the death of timothy shepard 25 of pittsfield was tragic and 
avoidable but there is no one who can be fairly and responsibly 
charged with criminal culpability general james shannon shannon 
said thursday 
he told shepards widow holly shepard and other family members 
of his decision before making it public 
springfield district judge irving j goldblatt who conducted a 
twomonth inquest into the death had recommended that charges be 
brought against two administrators and an instructor 
shepard and other cadets collapsed of heat stroke last sept 19 
at the police training academy at agawam shepard was the sickest of 
the 16 cadets who were hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration 
following a grueling regimen of pushups confusion drills and 
punishment laps he died nov 2 
it makes no sense that hes not going to pursue this its 
ludicrous absolutely ludicrous said mrs shepard she said a 
civil suit is now inevitable 
i do not condone the treatment of timothy shepard and the other 
cadets of class 12 i despise it shannon said but i must not 
be driven by vengeance i cannot shape the law to fit my feelings or 
the feelings and the irreplaceable loss of others 
evidence showed that the cadets on the first day of training to 
be municipal police officers participated in physically and 
mentally grueling exercises and had limited opportunities to drink 
water on a hot humid day 
goldblatt recommended that involuntary manslaughter charges be 
sought against earl harrington former director of the agawam police 
academy gary f egan former executive director of the state 
criminal justice training council and state police trooper c blake 
gilmore who served as commandant of the staterun academy 
dont take it from me take it from judge goldblatt said 
michael hashim jr the familys lawyer he came to a finding 
there was probable cause for a finding of involuntry manslaughter to 
be brought for jim shannon to toss it aside in my opinion it 
just leaves me speechless 
timothy burke general counsel for the massachusetts state police 
association said he was pleased by shannons decision 
as the factual circumstances reveal there was never any 
intention on the part of any of the state police officers involved 
in the training to in any way harm the cadets present on day one 
he said

larry james mcafee 33 wants a fulton superior court judge to

leaders of the oncebanned solidarity 
movement flanked president wojciech jaruzelski today as he paid 
homage to the small polish garrison in this baltic port that bore 
the first fierce nazi onslaught of world war ii 
in the remarkable and apparently unplanned display of national 
unity joining jaruzelski at the 50th anniversary ceremony were 
solidarity leader lech walesa and newly elected prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki a longtime solidarity activist 
on this day of great national memories we look not only into 
the past but also into the future into the near future and that 
which is still far ahead jaruzelski said 
we should never again be weak quarreling or isolated he 
said tomorrow poland must be stronger than today through its 
economic potential and most of all through mutual effort agreement 
and national reconciliation 
jaruzelski and mazowiecki were to return later to warsaw where a 
day of world prayer for peace was planned also scheduled was an 
internationally broadcast concert for peace led by american 
conductorcomposer leonard bernstein at the citys grand theater 
as jaruzelski spoke at westerplatte standing by were 53 veterans 
of the legendary polish garrison on the small peninsula who endured 
the guns of the german warship schleswigholstein and staved off a 
determined infantry assault for seven days 
world war ii began with the battleships opening salvo on 
westerplatte a polish outpost in then progerman free city of 
danzig at 445 am on sept 1 1939 
at dozens of points along the polish frontier the nazi 
blitzkrieg began without warning a lightningfast panzerled 
invasion by 15 million german troops obliterated the last organized 
polish army units by oct 5 
britain and france after demanding the germans withdraw honored 
treaty obligations and declared war on hitler on sept 3 
the stubborn resistance of the 182 polish soldiers on 
westerplatte isolated from the rest of poland served as an 
inspiration for poles who continued the battle against hitler until 
the march into berlin nearly six years later 
mazowiecki was scheduled to be at the ceremony today but 
walesas presence was apparently a spontaneous decision simple 
courtesy requires it he said 
walesa mazowiecki and senate speaker andrzej stelmachowski 
another solidarity activist earlier visited the workers monument 
erected by the free trade union in 1980 in front of the lenin 
shipyard where it was born 
mazowiecki was in warsaw on thursday to continue delicate 
negotiations on forming his new government while solidarity marked 
the ninth anniversary of the accords that founded the east blocs 
first legal independent union 
today several hundred supporters sang may he live 100 years 
to the prime minister as he walked to the monument with walesa 
their hands raised in the vforvictory sign 
mazowiecki laid redandwhite flowers at the towering columns 
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the baltic coast in 
1970 
then they bowed to the crowd and walesa led the singing of the 
polish national anthem 
as the leaders made their way back to their cars en route to 
westerplatte the crowd started chanting mazowiecki mazowiecki 
and reached out to touch the prime miniser 
stelmachowski taking in the sight of the former political 
prisoners now celebrating their victories against communist control 
said i still have an impression that i am playing a strange part 
in a very strange theater 
in warsaw meanwhile walter momper the governing mayor of 
berlin visited the monument to the final desperate uprising in the 
jewish ghetto in 1943 
for us as germans it is always necessary that we come here and 
remember what happened to the ghetto said momper 
the solidaritydominated polish senate adopted a statement on the 
war that said the anniversary should be a day of new horizons of 
reconciliation 
more than 6 million polish citizens lost their lives on the 
battlefield as victims of premeditated extermination or in slave 
labor in nazi concentration camps and stalins gulag the senate 
said 
nearly one out of every five poles living in 1939 died in the 
war the victims included 3 million polish jews 15000 polish 
officers believed massacred on stalins orders at katyn and 
elsewhere in the soviet union 200000 residents of warsaw who died 
in the capitals doomed 1944 uprising and boy and girl scouts who 
organized underground resistance units

hungarys top communists divided over 
the pace of reform and the move to a multiparty system met in a 
closeddoor central committee session friday 
no formal agenda was announced but political observers expected 
the 108member central committee to debate the increasingly open 
rifts between reformers and orthodox communists which some analysts 
predict could lead to a formal split in party ranks at a national 
party congress scheduled for oct 6 
the fourman leadership named in june to run the party until the 
congress formulates new policies in october is divided over 
multiparty elections scheduled to occurr before next june and 
negotiations with the opposition on how to run the ballots 
party general secretary karoly grosz a centrist who lost power 
in the june reshuffle has said he may quit altogether 
party president rezso nyers who says he is first among 
equals in the fourman leadership has differed publicly with 
leading reformer imre pozsgay over whether or not political parties 
can continue to be active at workplaces 
opposition groups negotiating constitutional reform and a new 
election law with the communists have demanded that political 
parties be banned from workplaces 
the communists who for four decades have maintained extensive 
organizations at factories and farms are stalling on the demand 
and nyers criticized a compromise put forward by pozsgay 
popular with the opposition pozsgay is under fire from some 
communists and opposition activists who suspect he is behind an 
official youth league move to create a revamped more powerful 
presidency a post he is said to want 
the communists and opposition also are at odds over what to do 
with properties owned by the communist party which the opposition 
says should be shared among all political parties the communists 
insist the buildings are solely their property 
another obstacle to elections emerged this week when the official 
trade union organization said it was pulling out of the forum which 
brings together the communists opposition groups and social 
organizations 
magda kovacskosa a member of the trade union delegation at the 
talks told the hungarian news agency mti wednesday the trade unions 
pulled out because economic issues are being largely ignored at the 
talks 
this could isolate millions of hungarian workers who are more 
concerned with rising prices and falling living standards than with 
political reform she indicated

one of nations largest producers of generic 
drugs repeatedly sent the brandname version of a widely prescribed 
antipsychotic drug to a lab for testing in place of its own generic 
version according to a report published today 
however the president of bolar pharmaceutical co of copiague 
ny called the 1982 incident unfortunate and said there was 
no malicious or fraudulent intent 
the washington post reported that bolar on three occasions sent 
brandname mellaril to pharmakinetics laboratory inc for testing 
instead of its generic version of thioridazine 
my technical staff has concluded that the tablets which you set 
for the bioequivalence study are not of your production alan g 
woodman who was president of pharmakinetics said in a letter to 
bolar vice president jack rivers 
excerpts of the letter were published in the post today four 
days after the food and drug administration proposed removing from 
the market bolars generic version of dyazide a drug for treating 
high blood pressure 
the fda said it has not been able to fully establish that 
bolars generic version is as effective as dyazide 
meantime bolar employees took out a fullpage advertisement in 
todays new york times to defend the companys management as 
reputable honest and caring the ad also expressed outrage over 
the climate of fear and distrust within the generic drug 
industry it said was created by a house investigations subcommittee 
because of the fraudulent deeds of a few 
to win fda approval of generic drugs manufacturers must submit 
them for tests by independent laboratories 
the post quoted pharmakinetics officials as saying they became 
suspicious that bolar was switching samples after the outer coating 
of tablets sent for testing began to chip and the logo of sandoz 
ltd the manufacturer of mellaril became visible 
a second sample was requested according to woodmans letter and 
it also proved to be recoated sandoz tablets it was only after the 
third sample according to the letter that woodman complained in 
writing to bolar 
pharmakinetics is not the keeper of morality in the 
pharmaceutical industry woodman said in the letter to rivers 
but jack you are an important part of an american success 
story and its our opinion that the exposure you place yourself and 
your company by pursuing this course of action far outweighs any 
possible benefit which may accrue to you or the company 
bolar president robert shulman told the newspaper that samples of 
the brandname drug were substituted for his companys generic 
version but he said it was the result of a silly error when 
copies of the sandoz drug were inadvertently mixed in 
this was an unfortunate isolated incident of a manufacturing 
error he said there was no malicious or fraudulent intent 
bolars product was approved by the fda after the company 
submitted for testing thioridazine tablets of different size shape 
and weight than the sandoz product

behind the slogans and political 
maneuvers highlighting ethnic tension in soviet republics is the 
hurt and confusion of transplanted russians who fear being uprooted 
from their homes 
as colonizers exiles scientific and economic specialists 
russians have been settling in moldavia the baltics and other 
nonrussian areas for more than 100 years both before and after 
the bolshevik revolution 
in a period of heightened ethnic feelings as the soviet unions 
minorities review what decades of soviet rule have brought much of 
the anger and frustration is directed at the russians next door 
many of them never learned the local language because it never 
has been much of an issue in a land dominated by moscow but in a 
society that is becoming rapidly polarized by demands for greater 
local sovereignty language has become the first and greatest 
indicator of who is who 
today its a law on language tomorrow on citizenship and the 
day after on residency russianlanguage teacher raisa kochetova 
complained to the moldavian supreme soviet or parliament as it 
began its debate tuesday on a law making moldavian the official 
language of the republic 
moldavia on thursday joined other republics that have passed 
language laws the baltics have followed with legislation restoring 
national flags economic and political sovereignty and immigration 
restrictions estonia went the furthest by setting strict residency 
requirements for voting and running for office 
no nationalist group has called for russians and others to be 
thrown out of their republics in latvia the independence movement 
is taking applications from ethnic latvians russians and everyone 
else for citizenship in an independent republic 
but the immigrants are worried that some slogans of ethnic 
protesters demanding they leave will become the policy of powerful 
new political movements 
we read stories about apartheid in south africa where people 
are barred from any work except manual labor if their skin is the 
wrong color said pyotr zalozhnikov 45 a russian worker and 
member of a strike committee in the moldavian city of tiraspol 
this is what this law would do to all people here who are not 
moldavian in one day well be made deafmutes our children will 
have no future he said by telephone 
nonmoldavian workers are feeling the same pressures as 
nonestonians did in that baltic republic they reacted the same 
way by walking off their jobs 
in both republics the proportion of russians and nonnative 
population is less than 40 percent 
zalozhnikov echoed the concern for his children expressed by 
nikolai chugunov a 42yearold russian who has lived in estonia for 
33 years although he was not affected by the residency requirements 
approved by the estonian government he said he was worried about 
what steps officials would take next 
mihai ghimpu one of the top officials in the moldavian peoples 
front said a language law would change mean nothing for the average 
worker for workers life wont change at all he said in an 
interview 
but partly to demonstrate the view that their lands were taken by 
force and partly to preserve the language and culture from the 
encroachment of russian ethnic leaders insist their language must 
be the official one 
the republics painful history of incorporation into the soviet 
union makes many people regard the slavic population with suspicion 
when hundreds of thousands of estonians lithuanians latvians 
and moldavians were shot or deported as stalin extended his control 
over their lands in the 1940s they were replaced by slavs who the 
dictator regarded as more reliable 
ethnic activists argue that the immigration has continued since 
then either as a predetermined policy to weaken the local 
population or to take advantage of better living conditions on the 
soviet unions western frontier 
but many go back much further 
in the early 19th century the great russian poet alexander 
pushkin was exiled to kishinev in what was then the russian 
territory of bessarabia 
in 1903 pyotr shornikovs grandfather a factory worker was 
exiled to moldavia for participating in a strike he stayed there 
when moldavia became part of romania after world war i 
shornikov has lived in moldavia all his life became an 
historian and says he speaks fluent moldavian a russian he is one 
of the leaders of the group yedinstvo which is fighting for the 
rights of nonmoldavians 
he rejects the argument that moldavia is being inundated with a 
new wave of immigrants kishinev the capital was about 47 percent 
ethnic moldavian in the years 185090 compared with the 43 percent 
moldavian population now he said

medicare will pay for routine mammography tests 
to detect breast cancer beginning jan 1 under a regulation the 
government proposed friday 
congress authorized medicare coverage of mammography examinations 
last year making an exception to the law that prohibits medicare 
payments for routine physical checkups 
one out of 10 women will develop breast cancer in their 
lifetimes according to medical experts and elderly women have the 
highest risk 
early detection of breast cancer is essential for effective 
treatment and medicare coverage will encourage more older women to 
obtain mammography screening on a regular basis said dr louis 
sullivan secretary of the department of health and human services 
the regulation drafted by hhs was published in fridays federal 
register after 60 days of public comment a final regulation will 
be drafted 
under the law medicare will pay for mammography tests every two 
years for women 65 and older for younger women on medicare because 
of disability the program will cover mammogrphy tests annually for 
those ages 50 to 64 and for women ages 40 to 49 who are at high risk 
of developing breast cancer it also will cover the exams every 
other year for those ages 40 to 49 who are not at high risk and will 
pay for one exam for those ages 35 to 39 
medicare will pay 80 percent of mammography costs after the 
beneficiary has paid the annual deductible of 75 for physicians 
and outpatient services 
the program will pay 50 for a mammography exam in 1990 
physicians who do not participate in medicare will be prohibited 
from charging more than 125 percent of that amount or 6250 in 
1990 
coverage of mammographies is expected to cost 150 million in 
fiscal year 1990 and 275 million in fiscal 1991

an organization representing fraternities at 
900 college campuses throughout the united states and canada 
announced friday it was launching a campaign to eliminate hazing 
which over the past decade has led to 40 student deaths and hundreds 
of serious injuries 
hazing has no place in the fraternity experience it is a 
dangerous form of intimidation that makes a mockery of fraternal 
love and were dedicated to eradicating it in the fraternity 
system said jonathan brant executive director of the national 
interfraternity conference 
brant said his group defines hazing as any action or situation 
intended to produce mental or physical harassment embarrassment or 
ridicule 
we are today launching an antihazing campaign that declares in 
unequivocal terms fraternities outright condemnation of all forms 
of hazing he told a news conference 
the national interfraternity conference based in indianapolis 
represents 59 major fraternities with 5155 chapters and more than 
400000 student members in the united states and canada 
brant said the conference had adopted an antihazing resolution 
more than 30 years ago and that most fraternities have had rules 
against hazing for the past two decades 
however he said we are painfully aware that in the past 10 
years more than 40 students have died and hundreds have been 
seriously injured by student organizations in what have been 
referred to as hazingrelated incidents 
brant said the antihazing campaign will involve distribution of 
printed materials on campuses organizing discussion groups at 
fraternity chapters and publishing articles in alumni magazines 
our challenge will be reaching those 5 percent of our members 
who i think for sincere but sincerely wrong reasons believe that 
hazing is a fundamental part of the fraternity experience he said 
also appearing at the news conference was eileen stevens of 
sayville ny whose son chuck stenzel died as a result of a 1978 
hazing incident at alfred university in upstate new york afterward 
she formed a group called chuck committee to halt useless college 
killings 
mrs stevens said she does not favor abolishing fraternities and 
that she had decided to work with them rather than against them 
in dealing with the hazing problem 
it would be very unfair to point a finger and say they were all 
guilty she said 
last month two major fraternities tau kappa epsilon and zeta 
beta tau announced that in an effort to eliminate hazing they have 
eliminated the traditional pledge period for students wishing to 
join 
fraternity pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was 
meant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before their 
initiation as full members

city police have a weapons problem 
should they keep their 45caliber thompson submachine gun made in 
1921 or sell it to a collector for a fat profit 
lt ronald gilchrist said officers still use the gun for training 
and take it along when responding to potentially dangerous calls in 
their community about 35 miles northwest of pittsburgh 
but the tommy gun is not practical compared to modern weapons 
gilchrist said it is heavy and replacement parts are hard to find 
it would be like comparing a new car to a model a ford he 
said 
some officers want to keep it for nostalgia reasons 
but gilchrist said the department needs modern weapons like m16 
rifles or 9mm handguns he estimated the thompsons value at more 
than 4000 to collectors 
the value of it is so great that its not worth us having to 
use it and breaking it he said

top drug lords being sought for 
extradition to the united states are being protected by corrupt 
military officers who help the traffickers avoid arrest a us 
narcotics expert said today 
infiltration of traffickers into the security forces is a very 
serious matter the traffickers dont feel any threat they might 
even feel protected the expert told foreign reporters 
wealthy leaders of the medellin drug cartel can easily afford to 
pay corrupt military officers up to 15000 a month for information 
about antidrug raids before they occur said the expert who 
demanded anonymity such soldiers generally only earn about 800 a 
month in salary he said 
the expert did not identify which of the 12 colombian drug 
dealers being sought by the united states who are receiving the 
inside information or the military officers who supposedly provide 
it 
also today police said they deactivated a bomb made of 40 pounds 
of dynamite in medellin a day after an explosion at a paint factory 
wounded at least 13 people 
government officials met thursday night to consider widening a 10 
pm6 am curfew imposed wednesday to halt drugrelated violence 
news reports said 
a police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
latest bomb was placed at the citys colombian industrial bank it 
was found and deactivated at 8 pm thursday two hours before the 
curfew went into effect he said 
it could have caused severe damage enough to affect even 
adjacent buildings the spokesman said 
earlier thursday 33 pounds of dynamite strapped to an ice cream 
vendors bicycle exploded at the medellin paint factory causing 
300000 worth of damage in addition to injuring at least 13 people 
police and fire department spokesmen said 
police in medellin said today that 527 violators of the curfew 
were arrested during the night most were released in the morning 
they said 
in washington officials said thursday that some of the 65 
million worth of equipment pledged by the bush administration to 
fight the narcotics trade should begin arriving sunday us 
military personnel were to arrive today for preparations 
the colombian government said that under emergency rules judges 
identities would be kept secret in drug cases since 1980 220 
judges and court officials have been slain in a reign of terror 
aimed at intimidating them into dropping drug cases 
the government began fighting back in its boldest attempt ever 
after a a leading presidential hopeful luis carlos galan was 
assassinated aug 18 drug lords responded with threats to kill more 
officials and with bombings 
they were particularly angry over a government decree that 
reestablished colombias extradition treaty with the united states 
where many drug dealers are wanted 
the bomb at the paint factory thursday was in a box on the back 
of the bicycle which was left leaning against a retaining wall 
around a paint storage tank colombian news reports said 
the blast also damaged about 20 cars a police spokeswoman said 
on condition of anonymity 
an anonymous caller told radio stations that the socalled group 
of extraditables colombias cocaine barons carried out the bombing 
and said there would be more attacks with more victims 
the group issued a statement aug 24 declaring total war on 
the government the group apparently speaks on behalf of the 12 
colombians the united states wants extradited to stand trial on drug 
charges 
medellin colombias secondlargest city in the northwestern part 
of the country is the home of the most powerful cocaine trafficking 
organizations in the world the cartels are believed to supply up to

millions of people jumped out of windows ran 
through smokefilled stores and pried each other from crushed 
vehicles friday in a citywide drill 66 years after the great 
earthquake that took at least 150000 lives 
safety officials used public address systems to issue mock 
earthquake warnings in designated parts of the city and helped 
volunteers and school children many wearing protective padded 
hoods move to open areas 
in a shopping center in kichijoji western tokyo police and 
firefighters rappelled down the sides of tall buildings to practice 
rescuing trapped people 
others used power saws and crow bars to rescue volunteers from 
cars piled on top of each other frontend loaders moved the cars to 
the side of the road clearing the way for firetrucks and other 
safety vehicles 
volunteers jumped from a fourth floor window onto a giant 
airfilled cushion following directions barked through a bullhorn 
firefighters filled a department store and shopping arcade with 
smoke to simulate an evacuation during fires likely to follow a 
major quake girls holding handkerchiefs over their mouths ran 
through the smoke in a line 
weve lost some business today but its for a good cause 
said the owner of a clothing store 
at two minutes before noon on sept 1 1923 the great kanto 
earthquake rocked the crowded kanto plain around tokyo and firest 
from coal cooking stoves quickly spread through the citys small 
wooden houses most of the victims died in the fires 
the intensity was estimated later at 79 on the richter scale 
great enough to cause catastropic damage in populated areas experts 
say another such quake could strike at any time 
a police chief speaking on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
friday that equipment like frontend loaders probably would be 
inadequate and not available where they were needed most wed 
just have to work our way from place to place he said 
toshiko maeda who watched some of the drills said she worried 
about what would happen in a real earthquake 
i doubt things would go this smoothly she said there 
probably would be pieces of buildings falling all around us

former president reagan didnt grasp the 
seriousness of the aids epidemic until he learned actor rock hudson 
was suffering from the disease reagans former physician said 
he accepted it like it was measles and it would go away said 
brig gen john hutton now commander of madigan army medical center 
here 
hutton also said reagan was tested for exposure to the acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome virus in january 1987 because he had 
received a transfusion of nine pints of blood after he was shot in 
the march 30 1981 assassination attempt he tested negative 
reagan did not realize how serious the epidemic was until july 
1985 when he saw a news report that hudson who later died of the 
disease was seeking treatment for aids in paris hutton said that 
was more than five years after the diease had been identified and 
when it had infected thousands of americans 
reagan himself a former hollywood actor saw the report while he 
was recovering from cancer surgery on his intestine and asked hutton 
to tell him about the disease 
after huttons lengthy explanation reagan said i always 
thought the world might end in a flash but this sounds like its 
worse the physician said 
hutton 57 a vascular surgeon and career army physician talked 
about his experiences as reagans doctor during a lecture last week 
to madigan medical officers and in an interview with the seattle 
times published thursday he was a white house physician from 1984 
to 1986 and physician to the president from 1986 until last 
january he assumed command of madigan in april 
the reagan administration frequently was criticized for being 
slow to respond to the aids epidemic in 1986 support for medical 
research and education increased substantially 
hutton said that when private citizens asked reagan what should 
be done about the epidemic he often said money might not be the 
answer 
he would say words to the effect is there a message in this 
like perhaps people are supposed to modify their behaviors 
hutton said 
reagan now 78 is vigorous alert and physically strong and has 
always recovered quickly from medical problems hutton said 
ive never seen anyone recover so fast hutton said hes a 
very stoic individual the only thing he got nervous about was 
the dental chair 
a week after reagans coloncancer surgery in 1985 the president 
wanted to ride his horse and was frustrated when hutton said no six 
weeks after the surgery reagan finally went riding with friends at 
his california ranch and took off galloping as soon as he saw an 
open trail hutton said 
hutton said he went into the stable shortly after the ride and 
found the president with a sheepish look and nancy reagan looking 
peeved she said to hutton he said you said he could gallop 
im thinking my job is in the balance hutton said 
hutton said he told reagan he was about 90 percent recovered 
after six weeks and that the president knew best whether he could 
ride 
aids which disables the bodys immune system is most often 
transmitted through sexual contact and through the sharing of 
contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes it also can be 
transmitted from mother to child at or before birth or through 
transfusions of blood or blood products tests developed since 1981 
have greatly lessened the risk of getting aids from transfusions

a national childrens advocacy group said 
friday it has joined an unwed california fathers petition to the 
supreme court for a rehearing in his case seeking visitation with 
his daughter 
the court in june upheld a california law that regards a womans 
husband as the father of her children thereby denying michael 
hirschensohn access to his child said david levy president of the 
national council for childrens rights 
but one of the justices john paul stevens was mixed up on 
the facts of the case said levy he thought hirschensohn had had a 
hearing in california on the visitation issue when he had not 
whether the hearing had taken place was never argued before the high 
court levy said 
about half a million children are born out of wedlock every 
year and in many cases the fathers are being cut out of their right 
to know and raise their children said levy 
what this is all about is an unwed father who wants to be 
involved and is spending tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees 
that could be spent on the child he said 
levy said his organization and hirschensohn are asking that the 
supreme court order a hearing on the visitation question 
the childs mother had a relationship with hirschensohn when she 
was separated from her husband and lived with hirschensohn on and 
off for several years said levy 
eventually the woman returned to her husband and took the child 
who is now 7 with her hirschensohn said the move ended a 
fatherdaughter relationship that had been established he said 
blood tests have verified that the girl is his daughter 
a child is being deprived of the right to have the financial 
and emotional support of her natural father said levy 
there is no reason why the child and father in this particular 
case should lose out because one of the justices thought a hearing 
had already occurred said levy 
the supreme court which is in recess resumes business in 
october

the government said friday that its chief 
economic forecasting gauge turned up in july for the first time in 
three months posting a modest 02 percent gain which many 
economists interpreted as further evidence that there is no 
recession on the horizon 
the commerce department said the gain in the index of leading 
economic indicators followed no increase at all in june and a steep 
13 percent drop in may the biggest decline since late 1987 the 
index had risen 06 percent in april 
the government initially reported a month ago that the index had 
fallen in june as well marking the fourth time in five months that 
the index had fallen 
at the time the june report came out many analysts were 
convinced that the economy was on the verge of a recession however 
since that time a variety of government statistics have been revised 
to show more strength than previously believed 
these revisions have sent economists scurrying to scrap their own 
recession forecasts in favor of predictions calling for the economy 
to experience a slowdown in the second half of the year but come 
nowhere close to toppling into a recession 
bolstering that view the government issued its first look at 
august economic activity on friday with release of the unemployment 
statistics that report showed the jobless rate held steady at 52 
percent in july while the number of jobs after adjusting for 
strikes shot up by more than 200000 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said that the 
leading indicators the good employment report in august and a 
string of other government statistics in the past month showed that 
not only is there no imminent recession there isnt even a 
slowdown at the present time 
he predicted that overall economic growth as measured by the 
gross national product could advance at a rapid clip of between 3 
percent and 35 percent in the current julyseptember quarter 
that would be substantially faster than the 27 percent gnp 
growth rate from april through june but sinai predicted growth 
would slow in the final three months of the year reflecting an 
expected dip in auto sales after the flurry of modelyearending 
discount incentives offered in july and august 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
expected growth in the final half of the year would average 22 
percent while that would be down a percentage point from the 
firsthalf growth rate it would be enough to reach the 
administrations goal of 29 percent growth for all of 1989 
we are going to have a fine year for the economy evans said 
inflation started out badly but it has calmed down and now you 
would have to look pretty hard to find something you didnt like 
about this year 
analysts believe that with inflationary pressures easing because 
of a moderate slowdown in growth the federal reserve board has been 
able to achieve the socalled softlanding it was seeking 
in july five of the 11 leading indicators showed strength with 
the biggest positive push coming from an increase in the growth of 
the nations money supply 
analysts said that reflected the fact that the central bank began 
easing credit conditions slightly in june and july a development 
which has helped to push interest rates lower 
other sources of strength in the july report were a jump in 
consumer confidence the rise in stock market prices during the 
month an increase in plant and equipment orders and an increase in 
the backlog of unfilled manufacturing orders 
five indicators held back the overall increase the biggest 
negative factor was a decline in raw materials prices while lower 
inflation is generally seen as good for the economy the leading 
index considers it a drawback because it can signal falling demand 
other negative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods 
an increase in weekly unemployment claims a fall in building 
permits and changes in business delivery times 
the 11th indicator the length of the average workweek showed no 
change from june to july 
the overall index stood at 1440 percent of its 1982 base of 100

all it would seem was bliss at buckingham palace 
prince charles and diana emerged unscathed from a spate of rumors 
about their marriage prince andrew and his wife sarah are happily 
raising a baby prince edward gave up military life and apparently 
found peace with a theater company 
queen elizabeth ii was the picture of grandmotherly contentment 
but now suddenly shocking headlines headstrong princess anne 
and her shy commoner husband are splitting up is the british royal 
family in trouble 
not really it has survived worse crises only to grow in 
prestige and popularity and compared with the scandals that beset 
some of their ancestors the separation announced thursday of the 
queens daughter from capt mark phillips is small potatoes 
many many royal marriages have been very unhappy indeed 
says michelle brown curator of the royal britain exhibition 
there have been lots of royal divorces in the past and many 
people far more miserable than capt phillips and princess anne seem 
to have been 
like the unfortunate sophia dorothea whose husband george i 
locked her in a castle for 32 years for being unfaithful to him in 
1694 
or more recently the drawnout saga of princess margaret the 
queens younger sister whose marriage to lord snowdon ended in 
divorce in 1978 
and then there was 19thcentury george iv whose attempts to 
divorce caroline of brunswick became a prolonged and disgraceful 
public spectacle 
anne and mark who have two children do not plan to divorce 
buckingham palace says 
while most newspapers ran the split on the front page friday the 
independent ran just one paragraph on page 2 the independent simply 
doesnt believe the royals matter others enjoy them as soap opera 
no scriptwriter could wish for a better cast the columnist 
godfrey smith has written queen elizabeth ii as everyones 
favorite mum prince margaret the willful younger sister 
prince philip the cantankerous father interesting children 
cheerful charlie randy andy educated edward and angular anne 
all sorts of inlaws divine diana problemgirl princess michael 
grandchildren galore 
there is however genuine sympathy for anne 
her marriage in 1973 to phillips televised from westminster 
abbey was dubbed a storybook romance but rested mainly on a shared 
passion for horses and marital strife has been rumored for eight 
years 
annes short temper and caustic tongue earned her an unpopular 
image that only changed in the 1980s through her quiet sustained 
and often courageous work on behalf of the worlds needy children 
she may never rival princess diana in looks and as seventh in 
line to the throne she is unlikely to become queen anne but she is 
blessed with wit poise and intellect and at 39 she is by far the 
most interesting of the british royals 
we are very possessive about our royal family and we were all 
in a sense guests at that fairytale wedding 15 years ago the 
times editorialized friday the queens daughter has never been a 
fairytale princess however and the monarchy is the stronger for 
it 
indeed the line was taken by some newspapers that the marriage 
was a sham and that its end came as a relief 
other european countries also treasure their royals and scandals 
are far fewer belgium hasnt had any problems since king leopold 
iii married a commoner in 1941 without his governments approval 
hollands princess irene scandalized protestants by converting to 
catholicism to marry a spaniard but her divorce 17 years later 
barely caused a ripple the swedish and danish royal families are 
squeaky clean 
so for the most part is the british family but when it does 
arise divorce is always an emotional issue from muchmarried henry 
viii four centuries ago to edward viii who had to abdicate in 1936 
to marry the twicedivorced american wallis simpson 
it was only since queen victoria and prince albert set up this 
wonderful sort of epitome of the perfect family that the pressure 
existed curator brown told london broadcasting corp radio 
before then royal marriages had all the rough and tumble and 
all the problems of any other marriage and nobody tried to pretend 
otherwise

unemployment held steady at 52 percent last 
month as the surprisingly robust economy added more than 200000 
jobs the government said friday in a report prompting forecasts 
that the recordlong expansion will last well past its seventh 
anniversary 
the labor departments official figure for nonfarm payroll 
expansion last month was 110000 jobs but strikes reduced the job 
totals by about 108000 meaning that without the walkouts the 
newjob total would have been some 218000 
the government also revised its july job growth figure upward to 
184000 from 169000 and the june totals up again from 250000 to 
297000 further signs that the economy continues to expand at a 
pace that will keep it out of recession in the short term 
the stock market greeted the unemployment report favorably while 
bond prices moved sharply higher after another closely watched 
economic report suggested a possible upcoming manufacturing slowdown 
bond prices jumped after the national association of purchasing 
management released its purchasing managers index which plunged to 
452 percent in august from 46 percent in july a reading below 50 
percent indicates the manufacturing sector of the economy is in 
decline 
but other data released this week including two more reports 
friday also suggested economic strength leaving little doubt the 
expansion will begin its eighth year come november 
we still have a very solid labor market said donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette senior vice president elliot platt the evidence 
is clear that the economy remains strong and we are clearly not 
plunging into recession 
said drimcgrawhill chief economist david wyss once again the 
economy looks stronger than we thought it was were really not 
seeing much sign of slowdown 
in the other reports released friday 
the commerce department said its chief economic forecasting 
gauge rose in july for the first time in three months the index of 
leading economic indicators rose a modest 02 percent after 
registering no gain in june and plunging by 13 percent in may the 
biggest drop since late 1987 following the stock market crash 
commerce said construction spending inched up 002 percent 
rising by 100 million to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4157 billion in july the modest increase followed a decline in 
june and analysts said it offered hope the lengthy construction 
slump is over 
these reports came on the heels of a sharp upward revision in the 
projected rate of economic growth in the second quarter the 
government earlier this week said the gross national product grew at 
an annual rate of 27 percent in the apriljune period up from a 
17 percent preliminary estimate the unemployment report the first 
comprehensive look at august economic performance indicated similar 
growth in the third quarter 
all but gone are the predictions of recession that were easy to 
find in the spring since then the federal reserve has eased its 
hold on credit after a yearlong tightening designed to slow growth 
and curb inflation 
now all but a smattering of forecasters believe the economy is 
growing at a sustainable pace with only dogged inflation 
threatening to trigger recession in late 1990 or 1991 
the primary fear now is that the economy is going to take off 
again and inflation with it and that the fed is going to have to hit 
the breaks again said wyss 
wage data in the report should prove encouraging to inflation 
watchers although perhaps discouraging to workers 
the government said average hourly earnings were essentially 
unchanged last month actually falling by a tiny fraction after 
rising 07 percent from june to july for the year ending in august 
average hourly wages were up 39 percent the government said well 
below the pace of consumer inflation 
the report also showed a slight reduction in factory activity 
with the average manufacturing work week dropping 01 hour to 409 
hours average factory overtime dropped by the same amount to 39 
hours a week 
the labor department said the civilian jobless rate held steady 
at 52 percent in a month that saw number of americans looking for 
work but unable to find jobs fall by a modest 76000 to 642 
million more than 1175 million americans had jobs an increase of 
138000 from july 
the official jobgrowth numbers were skewed by several 
strikerelated developments about 130000 telephone workers were 
out on strike while about 20000 coal miners returned to work after 
walkouts 
strikes affect the data because the job totals are taken from a 
government survey of businesses and strikers are not counted as 
being on payrolls but strikes do not affect the unemployment rate 
because that statistic is taken from a separate household survey in 
which strikers are considered to still have jobs 
the new job growth was predominantly in the serviceproducing 
sector which added nearly 70000 jobs that number would have been 
higher in a normal month because the telephone workers fall into the 
service portion of the economy 
manufacturing and construction posted modest gains in august of 
11000 and 8000 jobs respectively the manufacturing total showed 
slight job declines in some areas including furniture and lumber 
products but a gain of 25000 in auto manufacturing a sign that 
automakers called back some of the workers laid off because of 
sluggish sales 
in a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states the labor department said the 
unemployment rate was 51 percent down from julys 52 percent

president bush greeted japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu as a new friend today but immediately cautioned 
that the health of the partnership of their countries will require 
japan to increase its imports 
i share the prime ministers belief that while japan is noted 
as an exporting superpower the time has also come for japan to be 
an importing superpower bush said 
the president interrupting his maine vacation for the 
getaquainted session at the white house with the new japanese 
leader said economic imbalances between the two allies were 
discussed at length 
kaifu speaking after bush in a brief departure ceremony after

to reduce its budget deficit increase the rate of savings by 
americans and increase the competitiveness of us industry 
the united states is running a 50 billion annual trade deficit 
with japan and bush said we know that the health of our 
relationship partly depends on bringing our economic relatonship 
into better balance 
the two leaders said their discussions also included talks about 
china cambodia and international terrorism 
while we met as new friends our talks were conducted as old 
friends bush said he cited broad agreement on the major items 
of our bilateral and international agenda 
kaifu picked up on the theme saying that i just completed my

conduct talks with the president as if i were meeting an old 
friend 
kaifu also said he proposed to bush an international effort to 
be partly funded by japan to bring food and other relief to people

a refugee camp in ethiopia 
from the white house kaifu went to capitol hill to meet with 
senate leaders 
in a separate meeting today secretary of state james a baker

against us super computers satellites and forest products said a 
japanese official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity

that these trade issues would be discussed but not under the cloud 
of threatened us sanctions 
the bakernakayama breakfast meeting ranged from talks about 
cambodia and china to the current turmoil in latin america the 
official said 
as the two leaders began their twohour round of talks kaifu 
told bush he had been to the white house 18 years ago when gerald 
ford was president and earlier as a newly elected member of 
parliament when john kennedy was president 
kaifu wearing his trademark polka dot tie posed with bush for 
photos in the oval office before a session in the cabinet room with 
their advisers 
the kaifu visit entails some touchy matters for bush as the 
united states wants to push its concerns over japans 50 billion 
trade surplus but guard against pushing kaifu so hard that it 
weakens his fragile new government 
although the two countries have very good economic relations 
there are economic frictions over various issues kaifu said in 
an interview on cbs this morning and japan wishes to make as 
much effort as possible in order to resolve those economic 
frictions 
he said i would like to through my talks with the president 
make sure that this relationship of mutual trust will remain 
unshakeable and firm 
the meeting came a day after bush welcomed canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney and his family to the bush familys seaside 
home in kennebunkport maine 
the leaders said they discussed many issues including their 
shared support for embattled colombian president virgilio barco in 
his attempted crackdown on drug traffickers 
kaifu is making his first trip to the united states after 
recently taking office in the wake of sex and political scandal that 
felled his predecessor and other prominent japanese leaders 
it is customary for new japanese prime ministers to visit 
washington early on to establish a personal relationship with the 
president scowcroft told reporters 
this is one of our more important international relationships 
and it is important that the two establish this kind of close 
contact and thats really the purpose of the visit 
the 58yearold kaifu is one of japans youngest prime ministers 
but he has served in parliament for 29 years and was twice minister 
of education

adjust to a new life in the west security officials said

more jews left the soviet union in august than 
in any month for the past 21 years the chairman of the national 
conference on soviet jewry announced friday calling it a 
development of major significance 
the conference a nationwide group that has monitored jewish 
emigration from the soviet union since 1968 reported that 6756 
jews left last month surpassing the previous high of 4746 in 
october 1979 of those who left in august 793 or 117 percent 
went to israel 
this is a development of major significance and we hope that 
the upward trend in emigration which we have witnessed since the 
beginning of 1989 will continue said shoshana s cardin 
chairman of the conference 
soviet restrictions on jewish emigration have been a point of 
contention between us and soviet officials for years although the 
issue has been eclipsed recently by other human rights topics such 
as the drive for greater autonomy by the baltic republics and 
moldavia and demands by other ethnic groups 
bush administration officials and jewish activists in this 
country have said that higher levels of emigration and proposed 
relaxations in soviet visa law could prompt the us government to 
waive provisions of 1974 legislation linking emigration with trade 
benefits 
on june 13 the national conference on soviet jewry passed a 
resolution saying that if the favorable trends continued it would 
support waiver of portions of the jacksonvanik amendment 
the bill named after the late sen henry jackson dwash and 
former rep charles vanik dohio required higher trade tariffs on 
soviet imports as long as the president felt the kremlin was 
limiting emigration 
the newly constituted soviet parliament the supreme soviet is 
expected to consider a new emigration law when it convenes later 
this month although it was not clear how liberal the new 
legislation might be or when it might be passed 
the national conference said that some problems persist in jewish 
emigration from the soviet union ms chardin said in june that some 
400000 invitations had been mailed to soviet jews to emigrate 
although it was not clear how many actually wished to leave 
since january 33444 jews have been allowed to leave the soviet 
union and the total for 1989 could surpass the previous high of 
51320 set in the 1979 according to officials of the national 
conference on soviet jewry in july of this year 4537 jews 
emigrated 
last year 18965 jews emigrated from the soviet up sharply from 
the 1987 figure of 8155 and the 1986 figure of 914 the conference 
reported 
a state department source said the us government had no 
immediate reaction to the figures but noted that the bush 
administration has been keeping close tabs on soviet emigration 
policy with an eye to possibly easing enforcement of the 
jacksonvanik amendment

pan american world airways has agreed to pay 
235 million to 116 flight attendants who were penalized by the 
airline for weighing too much 
the airline also agreed to loosen up its weight rules and stop 
conducting appearance inspections of its flight attendants 
the agreement settles a classaction lawsuit by the flight 
attendants who said they were fired forced to resign or denied 
promotions because the airline decided they were overweight 
the lawsuit was filed five years ago in san francisco by the 
independent union of flight attendants which charged that pan am 
was discriminating against women by adopting different weight 
standards for women and men 
in 1987 a federal judge ruled in favor of the flight attendants 
and ordered pan am to change its weight policy pan am had appealed 
that decision 
under the settlement announced thursday pan am agreed to 
withdraw its appeal without admitting any wrongdoing and establish a 
more liberal weight policy it also agreed to pay the unions legal 
fees and the 235 million which includes back pay to the flight 
attendants 
the agreement must be approved by the courts 
in the old policy women flight attendants would have been 
considered overweight for instance if they were 5 feet 7 inches 
tall of medium build and weighing more than 136 pounds the new 
policy raises the maximum weight level to 151 pounds

lawmakers in the southern republic of moldavia 
opted friday for more compromises that severely weaken attempts to 
require all residents of the republic to speak the moldavian 
language activists said 
the legislature or supreme soviet named moldavian the state 
language thursday but said moldavian and russian could be used in 
everyday life that infuriated thousands of moldavians who 
demonstrated on the street late into the night while the lawmakers 
debated 
after hours of debate friday it decided that local governments 
could choose their own official language said vladimir solonar of 
yedinstvo a prorussian group 
moldavia previously had no official language but russian is 
typically used in government and commerce especially because many 
cities are dominated by nonmoldavians nationalists are trying to 
restore common use of their language but nonmoldavians fear 
discrimination and have gone on strike at 200 enterprises to protest 
thousands of moldavians demonstrated friday outside the opera 
house in kishinev the capital of the republic to protest the 
weakening of their proposal to require everyone to speak moldavian 
another compromise will permit business enterprises to choose 
their own language if they can win permission from both the local 
government and the republics council of ministers solonar said 
many businesses will try to use the loophole to continue using 
russian predicted yuri plugaru of the promoldavian peoples front 
said 
thousands of russians in the republic are in their 12th day of 
strikes over the language law whose original form would have 
required russians ukrainians bulgarians and other nationalities to 
use moldavian to speak to each other 
plugaru said moldavians are considering a general strike 
themselves to protest the compromises 
both the moldavian and russian representatives however said 
everyone would have to study the final law before deciding the 
strike question 
the language dispute reflects widespread tension among many of 
the soviet unions more than 100 ethnic groups stemming from decades 
of repression and neglect many of the ethnic minorities say they 
have been forced to learn and use russian even though it is vastly 
different from their native tongues and is alien to their cultural 
heritage 
people are unsatisfied with all the compromises the deputies 
agreed to said konstantin bogdanash a journalist with the 
peoples front group that has spearheaded the campaign for 
preservation of the moldavian language 
bogdanash said protesters held signs reading people want 
freedom no lies and respected russians mother russia 
calls you home 
the legislature also restored the latin alphabet taken away a 
halfcentury ago by dictator josef stalin when he annexed moldavia 
stalin imposed cyrillic the alphabet used in russian to back his 
claim that romanians and moldavians are two distinct nationalities 
even though the languages are virtually identical 
the legislators also ordered creation of a commission to look 
into the sharpening political divisions in the republic 
in the baltic republics meanwhile grassroots political groups 
lashed out at the soviet communist party leadership for its recent 
scathing criticism of their campaign for independence and the 
latvian organization demanded the kremlin recognize the regions 
special economic and political status 
whether the authors wanted it or not as a result in the eyes 
of many people they look like the brothers of those who divided 
zones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereign 
people at that time independent republics also behind their 
backs said a statement released after a meeting of leaders of the 
peoples fronts of latvia lithuania and estonia it referred to the 
nazisoviet nonaggression pact that put the baltics in the soviet 
sphere of influence 
the document said the partys remarks were the most sly or 
dangerous for democracy it has made since stalins rule 
the latvian peoples front said friday its leaders planned to 
revise their groups platform to include a call for complete 
independence for the republic 
only in an independent democratic latvia can an economic and 
political crisis be overcome the statement said 
it called for authorities to rehabilitate the onceindependent 
republic of latvia and recognize the special economic and 
political status in the territory of latvia to guarantee the return 
of independence and democracy 
the full platform is to be published in a week in the latvian 
press and will then be considered at an oct 7 meeting of all the 
peoples fronts members said sarmite elerte a spokeswoman for the 
group 
leaders of the lithuanian peoples front adopted a similar 
resolution last week

chancellor helmut kohl expressed grief 
friday over the horrors of nazi germany but called for a fair 
judgment of germans who were blinded and deceived by adolf 
hitler 
on the anniversary of the nazi attack on poland that plunged 
europe into world war ii kohl tried in a solemn parliamentary 
speech to ease german guilt while acknowledging the importance of 
keeping the horror in our minds keeping it present 
in communist east berlin ailing leader erich honecker missed the 
memorial ceremony in the 500member peoples chamber where foreign 
minister oskar fischer delivered the main address 
fischer called friday a day of recollection and sorrow and 
said the government was committed to do everything in our power to 
ensure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives and the 
lives of our children 
kohl declared west germanys commitment to reconciliation with 
poland and mending of the tear in europe inflicted by the war 
the wounds caused by world war ii have not healed yet they are 
burnt into the minds of nations kohl stated 
but he alluded to encouraging developments in eastwest 
relations and vowed the full support of west germany for 
reformoriented soviet bloc nations as payment for past wrongs 
we germans are under a special obligation to do so kohl 
said this stems not least from the hitlerstalin pact of 1939 
secret protocols to that pact deeded the baltic states to the 
soviet union and allowed the nazis to invade poland on sept 1 1939 
we feel sorrow at the untold suffering inflicted on people and 
nations by germans and in the name of germany and we mourn the many 
innocent victims from the midst of our own nation kohl said 
people still vividly recall the cattle wagons of the death 
trains packed with people destined for the extermination camps 
recalled kohl who said the scenes of suffering were sharp 
among his childhood memories 
it is true that too many people in germany and some abroad were 
blinded and deceived by that tyrant kohl said referring to 
hitler but he said we should beware of making hasty judgements 
from todays vantage point 
who among us can say with a good conscience that confronted 
with such evil they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs 
and who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not 
only ones own life but the lives of ones family as well he 
asked 
people today are no better and no worse than the people of that 
era but they are not under compulsion to make decisions in the 
conditions prevailing under totalitarianism 
kohls 50minute speech was interrupted by applause only once 
when he expressed west germanys wish for the success of polands 
new leadership 
kohl plans to visit poland this fall but the trip hinges on 
resolution of remaining political differences between the two 
states as well as a package of economic aid 
the stillfragile relations with poland also figured prominently 
in the anniversary addresses of president richard von weizsaecker 
and former chancellor willy brandt 
countless are the victims and indescribable is the suffering 
which the people of your country had to bear during and after the 
war weizsaecker wrote in a letter to polish president wojciech 
jaruzelski on the occasion 
my country has given a binding promise that it will neither now 
nor in the future make any territorial claims on poland 
weizsaecker vowed 
the bundestag members voted unanimously to endorse weizsaeckers 
call for reconciliation with poland 
nearly onethird of presentday poland was once part of germany

suggestions among west german conservatives that reunification of 
germany could some day take place within the prewar borders are 
among the wedges that continue to separate west germany and poland

construction spending recorded a slight 
increase in july as strength in nonresidential building offset 
weakness in housing and government projects the commerce department 
reported friday 
the department said that spending rose by a tiny 002 percent a 
gain of 100 million putting the seasonally adjusted annual rate at 
4157 billion in july 
the increase followed a 09 percent decline in june and an 
advance of 08 percent in may 
while the july rebound was modest analysts said it offered at 
least the hope that the lengthy construction slump may be coming to 
an end 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co noted that new 
home sales and construction starts for new homes were beginning to 
advance after a steep drop in the first part of 1989 he said that 
rebound would soon be reflected in the construction spending report 
and would help to lift the overall figure 
construction is on its way up because the lower mortgage rates 
have boosted sales he said 
sales of both new and existing homes fell sharply earlier in the 
year as mortgage rates climbed to a high of 1122 percent in late 
march rates then began falling and dropped as low as 981 percent 
in late july 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said that rates have been 
rising slightly in recent weeks and as of friday the national 
average for fixedrate mortgages stood at 1022 percent 
analysts said they did not believe the small increase in rates 
would be enough to dampen demand as long as mortgages dont rise 
much further 
in july all of the strength came in nonresidential 
construction which was up 09 percent to an annual rate of 997 
billion it was the third consecutive monthly gain in this sector 
following even stronger increases of 14 percent in june and 11 
percent in may 
the july increase was led by a 34 percent jump in spending for 
hotels and motels and a 31 percent gain in factory building 
projects 
residential construction edged down 02 percent to an annual rate 
of 1982 billion with singlefamily construction dipping 01 
percent while multifamily building was off a sharper 17 percent 
government construction spending fell by 12 percent in july to 
an annual rate of 809 billion as the biggest single government 
category highway construction dropped 4 percent 
the total construction figure was up a slight 12 percent from 
the level of building a year ago

police arrested anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu and hundreds of other activists nationwide 
friday as clerics students and workers staged protests in support 
of a growing antiapartheid campaign 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize was arrested along 
with his wife and 34 other protesters as they marched outside st 
georges cathedral to protest the alleged beating of church workers 
by police earlier in the day 
tutu and the others were released several hours later 
we are going to defy until freedom comes tutu told several 
hundred supporters after his release im increasingly proud of 
being part of a community that has decided we have had enough 
police spokesman brig leon mellet said all 36 could face 
prosecution under a law that prohibits demonstrations near 
parliament the march took place about 200 yards from parliament 
police also threatened friday to take decisive action against 
members of the media who defy stateofemergency regulations that 
prohibit reporting on unrest 
about 20 protesters from the western province council of churches 
said police used batons and whips friday to chase them from a 
security police office in cape town where they had gone to condemn 
recent detentions of activists 
tutu described the beatings as utterly utterly scandalous it 
was a peaceful demonstration 
later when tutu and the other activists left st georges which 
tutu heads they encountered police who formed a human barricade 
police told the demonstrators to disperse then led them into vans 
when they refused 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states had made its concern known to the south 
african government and has asked for a full report on the incident 
once again we urge the south african government to permit the 
peaceful expression of political dissent she said 
canon winston ndungane chief executive officer of anglican 
church in south africa called tutus arrest a further indication 
that the authorities will use whatever means possible to prevent a 
man of peace going about his work 
when tutus peaceful intervention is met by this kind of 
behavior it lessens whatever hope we have of ending the conflict in 
this country ndungane said 
tutus wife leah was among about 200 women arrested wednesday 
in cape town for staging an unauthorized protest the women were 
released without bail and told to appear in court next month 
tutu the first black to lead the anglican church in southern 
africa has played a prominent role in the nationwide defiance 
campaign launched aug 2 the campaign is aimed at challenging 
segregation laws and mobilizing opposition to the sept 6 
parliamentary elections which exclude the 28million black majority 
on saturday activists planned an illegal protest march on 
parliament and also planned to defy a police ban by holding a huge 
rally in soweto the township outside johannesburg on sunday 
blacks have scheduled a mass picnic on a whitesonly beach in the 
indian ocean city of durban 
police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past 
week and more were reported friday in cities nationwide 
several blocks from the site of tutus march police arrested 
more than 100 college and university teachers for staging an illegal 
antigovernment protest on a pedestrian mall 
in durban police arrested about 300 students both black and 
white who were demonstrating just outside the university of natal 
campus 
on cape towns outskirts where police and militant youths have 
clashed daily for several weeks several mixedrace students 
reportedly were wounded when officers fired tear gas and birdshot to 
disperse a protest rally 
police said they were deeply concerned about the screening 
abroad of film material featuring scenes of unrest 
police hereby issue an early warning to the media to strictly 
comply with all media emergency regulations a statement said 
under the 3yearold state of emergency reporting on police 
action and unrest is prohibited without permission from authorities 
the restrictions have not been enforced comprehensively but 
photographers and television cameramen have had their film 
confiscated by police with increasing frequency in recent weeks 
thousands of black union members meanwhile joined the defiance 
campaign friday staging work stoppages at their factories to 
protest a labor law they say cripples their power to strike 
one of the biggest union protests was at the unilever ltd 
factory in boksburg east of johannesburg where about 1000 workers 
marched around the premises many carrying placards denouncing the 
yearold labor relations amendment act 
the two main black labor federations have joined other major 
antiapartheid groups in calling for a national protest next tuesday 
and wednesday against the elections in the past such protests have 
taken the form of a general strike 
the labor relations act has been the subject of a bitter dispute 
among the government employers and unions since it was drafted by 
government officials last year 
employers agreed to some changes after unions complained it would 
virtually eliminate their ability to strike but several provisions 
remain which they unions say are unacceptable including a 
prohibition on sympathy strikes by workers not directly involved in 
a contract dispute 
fridays protest was endorsed by the 1 millionmember congress of 
south african trade unions and by the 500000member national 
council of trade unions

federal officials have rejected a request that 
former philippine president ferdinand marcos be buried at the 
national memorial cemetery of the pacific here his wife imelda 
marcos said friday 
but federal officials in washington said friday that no request 
had been received from mrs marcos 
mrs marcos said she made the request when marcos was very 
critically ill in june and was not expected to live more than a few 
days he has rallied somewhat but remains in critical condition at 
st francis hospital 
marcos turns 72 later this month 
his wife told the honolulu advertiser that she sought burial in 
the national cemetery because her husband fought alongside americans 
during world war ii and because current philippine president corazon 
aquino has said marcos will not be allowed to return to the 
philippines dead or alive 
alan sumitomo a supervisor at the cemetery said that to be 
eligible for burial there a person must be a veteran of us armed 
forces with honorable or general discharge or a dependent of a 
veteran exceptions to the rule can be made by the federal 
department of veterans affairs he said 
mrs marcos said the request was made to us veterans affairs 
secretary edward j derwinski through her washington attorney 
richard hibey she said derwinski told hibey there was no way 
that marcos would be allowed burial in the national cemetery 
but pam siciliano spokeswoman for the department of veterans 
affairs said friday we are not aware of any conversation or 
contact between mr derwinski and mrs marcos or her attorney 
derwinski was in poland representing president bush at world war 
ii commemoration ceremonies and was to return sunday 
we have not received a request from the marcos family for 
information on mr marcos eligibility for burial in a national 
cemetery and we cant discuss or make a final determination about 
his eligibility until we have a contact from the family or mrs 
marcos ms siciliano said 
there was no listing in washington telephone directories for a 
lawyer named hibey 
the national cemetery is located in puowaina crater more 
commonly known as punchbowl and overlooks honolulu it is the 
burial place of world war ii correspondent ernie pyle and astronaut 
ellison onizuka who died in the space shuttle challenger disaster 
the marcoses have lived in honolulu since they were ousted in a 
popular revolt that swept mrs aquino to power in february 1986 
they face a us indictment accusing them of stealing more than 100 
million from the philippines treasury and stashing the money in the 
united states 
mrs marcos previously said she would never bury her husband 
anywhere but in the philippines she said she thought burial in the 
honolulu veterans cemetery would be a way to resolve the controversy 
however she said she continues to hope that marcos will be 
allowed to return to the philippines to die in his country or to be 
buried there 
i will take his remains to the airport and wait there as long 
as necessary she said

ramming the family station wagon through a barrier and into the 
murky detroit river was ordered friday to stand trial on four counts 
of firstdegree murder 
lawrence delisle 28 also will be tried on a charge of attempted 
murder for allegedly trying to kill his wife suzanne delisle 32 
who was in the car and frantically tried to save their four children 
aug 3 
police say delisle confessed to crashing deliberately to be 
relieved of his burdens but he later renewed his original claim 
that it was accidental and that a leg cramp made him jam down the 
gas pedal and his wife said the confession was coerced 
delisles eyes watered when district court judge lawrence emmert 
bound him over for trial after a preliminary examination in this 
detroit suburb 
emmert who reviewed videotapes audio tapes and a manuscript of 
delisles liedetector test and police interrogation said the 
defendants confession was not coerced and may be used as evidence 
delisles attorney frank eaman said the tapes shouldnt be used 
because police pressured delisle he said he plans to appeal 
wayne county assistant prosecutor kevin simowski maintained 
delisle was questioned properly 
police never threatened him police if anything were 
sympathetic he said he didnt break down during any of the 
interviews 
emmert said critical testimony came from two witnesses who saw 
delisles car accelerate straight toward the river 
neither of them indicated that the car deviated at all he 
said 
mrs delisle who says she believes her husband is innocent 
testified thursday that as her husbands leg cramped she grabbed 
the steering wheel and pulled to the right while he pulled to the 
left and tried to grab his foot off the gas pedal police tests of 
the car found no mechanical defects 
she said she tried to save her children after the car hit the 
bottom of the river the couple were rescued by boaters who then 
tried to dive for the children 
bryan 8 melissa 4 kathryn 2 and emily 8 months died at a 
hospital within hours of the crash

farmers whose 1989 crops have been wiped out or 
reduced sharply by drought and floods can begin applying for federal 
payments on sept 15 agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
friday 
applications can be filed at county offices of the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service through april 
27 1990 he said 
congress authorized nearly 900 million in federal payments under 
the disaster assistance act of 1989 for farmers who suffered crop 
losses of more than 35 percent to 50 percent of normal production 
depending on whether they participated in this years commodity 
programs 
our ascs field staff will process disaster payment requests as 
quickly as possible to get financial aid to those farmers who have 
suffered crop losses due to drought excessive moisture and other 
perils yeutter said in a statement 
one of the usda provisions will deduct the value of a replacement 
crop to determine a farmers disaster payment for losses on his 
first crop 
for example if a farmers winter wheat crop was wiped out and he 
planted grain sorghum to replace it the grain sorghums value would 
be considered in computing the disaster aid that was due 
a formula will be used to account for the production costs of the 
planting and harvesting the replacement crop on socalled failed 
acres the idea is to come up with a net value figure for the 
replacement crop 
an agency official tom vongarlem explained the formula 
operation in an example 
suppose a farmer planted grain sorghum or milo on failed winter 
wheat land and harvests 30 bushels per acre this fall the formula 
calls for 75 percent of the output to be the farmers net production 
of sorghum 225 bushels per acre 
at around 2 per bushel the sorghum would have a value of 45 
per acre vongarlem said this is what would be deducted from the 
disaster payment that the farmer otherwise would get for losing his 
winter wheat

president bush said friday the united states 
will have no diplomatic contact with the new panamanian government 
approved by gen manuel antonio noriega and he promised additional 
economic measures will be taken against that country 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called the 
appointment of the new government by panamas council of state a 
thinly disguised coup detat she dismissed the new unelected 
president as the latest puppet of noriega 
the united states has recognized as the legitimate authority in 
panama president eric arturo delvalle who was ousted by noriegas 
allies in february 1988 but delvalles term in office would have 
ended friday and the administration ceased recognizing him as 
panamas constitutional leader 
the us embassy in panama continues to function but bush made 
clear in his statement that we will not have any diplomatic 
contact with the noriega regime 
us ambassador arthur davis who was withdrawn from panama in 
may will not return bush said 
this should have been a proud day for panamanians and for all 
who believe in selfdetermination and democracy bush said 
instead it is a sad day a sad day for panama and for the 
democratic nations of this hemisphere 
in effect little changed with fridays statements since the 
united states has had no official dealings with the noriegaled 
goverment for 18 months and no change is contemplated for the new 
team he has assembled 
as for delvalle he has spent much of that time in hiding and 
wielded no power 
still the administration used the occasion of the appointment of 
a new leadership in panama to intensify its campaign against noriega 
noriegas naming of a socalled provisional government is 
completely outside panamas constitution and is in effect a 
thinly disguised coup detat ms tutwiler said noriegas is an 
outlaw regime 
she spoke disdainfully of the figurehead president francisco 
rodriguez who was named to replace outgoing president manuel solis 
palma 
noriegas latest puppet president is an unknown within panama 
with no political following whose chief qualification for the 
position seems to have been his longtime friendship with noriega 
and his slavish loyalty to the dictator ms tutwiler said 
diplomatic hostility to panama she said is being reflected in 
the decision of a number of countries including venezuela peru 
uruguay colombia brazil chile and argentina to withdraw their 
ambassadors from panama city 
bush said that the administration will continue to take other 
steps to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to the 
panamanian people he did not elaborate 
early last year the united states began withholding from panama 
revenues payable to that country for panama canal operations among 
other actions trade sanctions were imposed and panamanian assets in 
the united states were frozen the amount of frozen assets is in the 
300 million range 
officials said privately a number of options are being considered 
for further tightening of the exisiting sanctions but they gave no 
additional details 
an elected president was to have been sworn in friday in panama 
but authorities there voided the may 7 elections after independent 
observers concluded that the antinoriega candidate had won in a 
landslide 
national security adviser brent scowcroft talking to reporters 
who accompanied bush on an air force one flight back to 
kennebunkport maine friday said the united states is rethinking 
all aspects of our relationship with panama including us 
posture on the panama canal treaties and further economic sanctions 
there could be other steps including economic he told 
reporters but he declined to discuss what they might be 
asked if he had run out of options and why the united states had 
not taken further steps before now he said because we didnt 
want to increase the suffering of the panamanian people 
regarding the canal scowcroft said the choices were to abide by 
the treaties suspend them or abrogate them but said there are no 
plans to take action at this time 
he said the exercises by us troops in panama will continue 
to keep our troops alert to the extent we may have to defend 
the panama canal against whatever

an appeals court on friday reversed a judges 
ruling that a small town school districts ban on dancing violated 
the constitutional separation of church and state paving the way 
for the purdy school board to resume its ban 
the ruling by a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court 
of appeals in st louis is a victory for losers and hypocrites 
a plaintiff in the case said friday and her attorney vowed to 
appeal 
us district judge russell clark ruled in august 1988 that the 
nearly centuryold ban on dancing at the purdy school 
unconstitutionally promoted the values of residents who opposed 
dancing for religious reasons clark said he did not believe the 
boards claim that the ban was simply a policy matter 
the school board had said it supported the ban not because of 
religion but because of possible drinking and discipline problems 
and because it was an unnecessary expense 
although the school board appealed clarks ruling it allowed 
students to hold a homecoming dance last december 
the case drew wide attention in part because of the similarities 
to the hit motion picture footloose 
the 8th circuit panel noted friday that many of the 900 residents 
of purdy a ozarks mountain town in southwestern missouri were 
religious conservatives but the judges panel said there was no 
unconstitutional mingling of church and state just because the ban 
adhered to the conservatives religious views 
we simply do not believe elected government officials are 
required to check at the door whatever religious background they 
carry with them before they act on rules that are otherwise 
unobjectionable under the controlling standards the panel 
said 
the appeals court said the plaintiffs should support school board 
candidates whose views mirror their own instead of going to the 
courts 
political divisiveness along religious lines is not a 
proper consideration except in cases involving financial aid to 
parochial schools the appeals panel said 
ransom ellis an attorney for the school district said he was 
pleased with the new ruling i know that the school board and the 
defendants in the case were also very pleased he said 
but william fleischaker an attorney representing students and 
parents who sued to have the near centuryold ban revoked said he 
would ask the full ninejudge appeals court to consider the case and 
that he would take it to the us supreme court if necessary 
the appeals panel ignored in its finding the vast amount of 
evidence that the school board in retaining the dance ban acted 
with specific intent to promote a religious view fleischaker said 
joan fox one of the parents in purdy who sued to have the ban 
revoked was outraged at fridays ruling 
i think its a victory for losers and hypocrites in a community 
where cowardice and bigotry sustains them she said

pope john paul ii speaking to poles friday 
via tv from the vatican recalled the horrors that gripped the 
capital of his native land 50 years ago with the nazi invasion of 
poland 
the popes speech was part of an international day of prayer 
for peace in warsaw attended by leaders of the roman catholic 
church and other religions to coincide with the 50th anniversary of 
the start of world war ii but polands only rabbi stayed away to 
protest the presence of a catholic convent outside the auschwitz 
concentration camp in southern poland 
on sept 1 1939 with the invasion of poland began a long and 
painful period of suffering of humanity of christians and jews of 
everyone the pontiff said his image appearing on a large tv 
screen overlooking warsaws victory square 
fifty years later what sounds on warsaw streets is not the 
echo of heavy soldiers boots but the light and friendly steps 
of pilgrims men and women professing different faiths who come 
from all parts of the world they have no power other than the power 
of memories which stimulates reflection and fervent prayer for 
peace the pontiff said in polish 
the memory of world war ii and the local conflicts that have 
been going on for the past 50 years and those which still 
tragically continue obliges all of us to persist in the aim to 
eliminate war from all parts of the world so it ceases to be a tool 
for resolving disputes he said 
in warsaw banners of black changing into polands white and red 
colors hung from the windows of the royal castle painstakingly 
rebuilt in the 1970s after being leveled during the war along with 
much of warsaw 
around the square hung a rainbow banner decorated with a dove and 
peace written in many languages a huge billboard proclaimed 
war never again 
photographs of the destruction of warsaw were shown on a tv 
screen set up for the popes address and smoke was released from

the council the largest christian group in south korea where 
onefourth of the 42 million people are christian was an active 
political force during past authoritarian regimes 
roh has carried out wide democratic reforms since he took office 
in february 1988 but critics argue he has not done enough

legacy of his disgraced predecessor chun doohwan who is under 
public fire for alleged corruption and power abuse involving his 
family and former aides

front of seouls joongang university campus to press demands that

a federal judge ruled friday in favor of united 
press international in a 12yearold libel case stemming from the 
death of a hawaiian man who linked a public official to organized 
crime 
us district judge charles richey said the complainant in the 
case failed to prove that the news report was false and the reporter 
was protected under the neutral reporting doctrine 
the case revolves around the death of a hawaiian environmental 
activist named george helm who a biweekly newspaper on june 15 
1977 strongly implied had been killed by local underworld 
figures 
dennis stone a upi reporter filed a story based on the 
newspaper report and an interview with the missing mans father the 
story said the missing activist had been threatened by a member of 
hawaiis board of land and natural resources named larry mehau 
according to george helms brother and father 
stones story also said the brother adolph identified mehau as 
the godfather of hawaiis underworld crime 
in a subsequent dispatch the same day stone wrote that the 
missing activist had told his brother adolph that he was planning 
to expose mehau and others 
the next day upi distributed a story detailing the hawaii 
governors strong defense of mehau and rejection of the biweekly 
newspaper story 
mehau quickly sued upi and lost two years later at the trial 
level on appeal the hawaii supreme court reversed the decision 
saying that stone acted with actual malice when he filed his two 
stories 
the case was remanded to the federal court in hawaii and removed 
to the disrict of columbia when upi went into bankruptcy here 
finally the case was switched from bankruptcy court to the 
district court and ended up with richey 
the disputed facts indicated the mehau has failed to prove 
by a fair preponderance of the evidence that stones reports are 
false said richey 
further the undisputed facts indicated that stones reports are 
absolutely protected under the neutral reportage doctrine which the 
court adopts herein for the first time in this circuit

a defense consultant admitted friday that he 
sold unisys corp confidential bid information about a pentagon 
contract for 24750 and shared the proceeds with a fellow 
consultant 
william j sanda 53 pleaded guilty in us district court in 
alexandria va to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government 
in connection with the sale of information to unisys in 1987 about a 
100 million marine corps contract 
sanda who was president strategic systems institute of 
rockville md agreed to cooperate with the justice departments 
continuing investigation of defense department procurement fraud 
dubbed operation ill wind 
us district judge claude hilton scheduled sentencing for dec 
1 sanda could receive a fiveyear prison term and be fined up to 
250000 
his guilty plea signals that the justice department is preparing 
to expand its investigation to include current and former unisys 
executives based in eagan minn who sought confidential bid 
information on contract to build shelters for sophisticated 
communications and electronic equipment used by the marine corps 
unisys spokesman peter hynes declined to comment on sandas 
guilty plea said the company is cooperating with the probe 
sanda admitted that he agreed in march 1987 to be a front man 
for fellow consultant william parkin 
under their arrangement sanda agreed to take a third of the fee 
that unisys paid while parkin would receive the rest for providing 
the inside information 
parkin 65 has been sentenced to 26 months in prison and fined 
25000 for his role in the procurement scandal his cooperation 
with the investigation appears to have helped prosecutors bring the 
charge against sanda 
according to court papers sanda first approached an rca employee 
and offered to provide bid information about competitors sanda 
later reported to parkin that he was unable to work out a deal with 
rca one of several companies bidding on the contract 
sanda soon reported that a unisys corp marketing representative 
expressed interest in purchasing information 
the unisys corp official is not named but was identified in 
court papers unsealed earlier this year as marketing executive ralph 
hughes who hynes said left the company in december 1988 
sanda showed hughes a sample of bid information later reporting 
to parkin that hughes believed that sanda had an inside source 
at the pentagon according to court papers 
unisys paid sanda 19500 under a consulting contract on aug 19 
1987 according to the court papers sanda cheated parkin out of 
1000 by telling his fellow consultant unisys had paid 18000 
sanda gave parkin 12000 instead of 13000 which would have 
been the twothirds share of 19500 according to court papers 
parkin gave 6000 to thomas muldoon another defense consultant who 
court papers say was the source of the bid documents the court 
papers said 
muldoon has been implicated but not charged in the ill wind 
probe 
after receiving the first payment sanda reported that the unisys 
executive again identified in earlier court filings as hughes told 
him of a complaint to the navy that unisys had hired sanda to gain 
an unfair edge in the contract competition 
hughes had told sanda that unisys would have to fill a file 
cabinet with data to support the contention that sanda was doing 
technical work for the company according to court papers 
sanda later reported to parkin that a unisys vice president not 
identified in the court papers suggested firing sanda because of 
the complaint but the company decided against to avoid appearing to 
be engaged in wrongdoing 
sanda was paid another 5250 by unisys in november 1987 shortly 
after he had advanced parkin 4000 for more information 
the court document disclosed that sanda tried to sell bid 
information on navy and air force radar test kits to gould inc 
sanda told prosecutors he met with the president of goulds navcom 
division but was not hired by the company 
sanda told prosecutors that he gave the gould official 
information about the companys own bid to show he had an inside 
source but that the numbers were slightly off

fighting between government forces and 
anticommunist rebels has intensified around the eastern city of 
khost government and diplomatic sources said friday 
they said the guerrillas want to show they are still a force 
despite deep divisions in the rebel alliance 
the rebels have been battling to capture a provincial capital as 
a seat for a provisional government since the soviet union withdrew 
its troops in february after nine years of military intervention 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
offensive against khost 18 miles from the border with pakistan 
appears to be the most organized attack since february 
naqib sameer deputy spokesman at the foreign ministry noted a 
nonaligned summit conference opens monday in yugoslavia and said 
the rebels want to show their power to the nonaligned conference 
the opposition groups are trying to cover their previous defeats 
the diplomats and sameer said the rebels also want to be draw the 
attention of the united nations general assembly opening this month 
diplomatic sources said the government appeared to be having 
trouble recapturing two military posts at tani south of khost 
despite heavy use of the warplanes 
sameer denied that khost was threatened saying the posts had 
changed hands a number of times since february 
he said the guerillas used artillery rockets and machine guns 
against government positions in the khost fighting over the previous 
24 hours he accused the pakistani armed forces of supplying support 
from across the border and claimed saudi arabian militiamen were 
fighting in afghanistan 
sameer said the afghan armed forces were responding with 
aircraft artillery and rockets 
rebel failure to capture jalalabad 80 miles east of the capital 
city of kabul and recent internal clashes within the rebel alliance 
prompted questions in the us congress about further funding for 
the rebels 
in place of jalalabad khost the capital of eastern paktia 
province is considered one of the softer targets because its 
proximity to rebel bases in pakistan makes it easier to organize 
supply lines 
in other combat sameer said government forces repulsed guerrilla 
fighters in southeastern kandahar province and around jalalabad 
the government said the road between kabul and jalalabad was open 
again in kabul the almost daily rocket attacks since june have 
ebbed 
sameer said a rocket hit kabul on thursday in the qalienaharha 
neighborhood killing one civilian and injuring two 
diplomats said the lull was apparently from the guerrillas 
concentrating their firepower on khost and use of a new missile by 
the government 
the government has been using sovietdesigned scud ballistic 
missiles with a range of 170 miles to fire on rebel positions near 
jalalabad and khost from the capital 
a new shortrange weapon perhaps a soviet rocket known as a frog 
7 also is being used by government troops the diplomats said the 
frog 7 has a range of about 40 miles 
they said the new rockets first noticed last week apparently 
have extended the security belt around kabul 
rocket attacks on kabul since june have killed more than 300 
people and injured more than 900 
the rebels have been fighting to overthrow the sovietsupported 
marxist government for more than a decade

former vice president walter f mondale 
and four current and former legislators will travel to warsaw this 
month to advise polands new leaders on how to run a parliamentary 
government mondale said 
mondale sen peter domenici rnm and former sens howard 
baker rtenn and thomas eagleton dmo are traveling as private 
citizens not as representatives of the government mondale said 
thursday the delegation is also to include former rep jim jones 
dokla 
the us group will advise polish leaders on such parliamentary 
matters as rules powers and conducting debates said mondale who 
was a senator from minnesota before becoming vice president in the 
carter administration 
the trip follows the appointment last month of solidarity editor 
tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister in a powersharing arrangement 
with the communist party which has dominated poland for more than 
four decades 
mondale said that if poland became independent of the soviet 
bloc it would be a boost to us security 
if we can create and help create an independent poland that 
would do more for the national security of this country than another 
hundred billion dollars of guns because if poland is free the 
russians could never fight a war in europe he said 
the group which also will include former us rep jim jones 
dokla will be attending a sept 2123 conference on the role of 
parliaments in developing economic policy said sue grabowski of the 
national democratic institute for international affairs which is 
sponsoring the meeting

as news of princess annes broken marriage swept 
the british press the separating couple and people close to them 
fended off questioning journalists friday 
anne only daughter of queen elizabeth ii stayed through the end 
of the international olympic committees annual meeting in puerto 
rico and left by private plane for a visit to belize 
her husband capt mark phillips and their two children stayed 
out of sight at their country estate in western england 
royal navy cmdr timothy laurence whose letters to anne made 
headlines this spring told reporters he would not leave his house 
until they went away 
by the time buckingham palace confirmed thursday that anne 39 
and her husband of nearly 16 years would separate speculation about 
laurences relationship with the princess was rife 
laurence 35 told a reporter from an evening paper he was tipped 
off wednesday that a statement about annes marriage would be made 
by buckingham palace and had decided to stay at home 
quite honestly im prepared to stay here all day or as long as 
it takes he said 
his neighbors in winchester 66 miles southwest of london were 
not so patient 
the daily mirror said an elderly woman came out to harangue 
reporters surrounding laurences house it said she called them 
rotters then sang three choruses of god save the queen 
britains national anthem 
laurence was linked to anne on april 8 when buckingham palace in 
an attempt to stop media speculation announced that he was the 
author of letters to the princess that were stolen from her home 
on friday the daily mirror reported that a canadian woman often 
linked in news reports with phillips also was besieged by reporters 
the newspaper said katherine birks called police after 
journalists surrounded her home in caledon ontario it said police 
sealed off the street and escorted her jeep out of the driveway at 
dawn 
lack of access to those involved has not stopped britains 
tabloids from reporting on the royal separation 
most speculated on financial arrangements although nothing is 
known about what personal income anne might have and little is known 
about the income phillips 40 derives from his farming and 
equestrian ventures 
that did not keep the sun from headlining 1 million pounds for 
mark which it called a payoff from the queen suggesting that 
would keep him from telling his story of the marriage 
another paper today decided it would be a 3 million pound 
payoff for phillips basing its estimate on a lawyers opinion 
that he was entitled to 250000 pounds 390000 for every 1 
million pounds of annes money it did not say how it determined how 
much she had 
the star came down in the middle 2 million pound kissoff to 
end royal marriage 
at the daily mail anne was blamed for the separation with 
headlines saying anne wanted her freedom and mark hoped they 
would stay together but the princess decided to end the sham 
marriage it quoted phillips father as saying the decision had 
not been mutual and his son would have been happy to continue the 
marriage 
when they married everybody expected that mark was going to be 
hanging on her coattails it quoted maj peter phillips as saying 
right from the word go he said he was going to do his thing and 
she hers he would not want to be a hangeron that is not his way 
of life im pleased to say

a naval commander who had observed the uss 
vincennes in the persian gulf said the ship had no good reason 
for shooting down an iranian civilian airliner killing all 290 
aboard 
the unusually candid article by cmdr david r carlson in the 
us naval institute proceedings magazine this month said others had 
remarked on the agressive behavior of the vincennes which had been 
dubbed robo cruiser 
carlson commander of the uss sides a frigate that was on the 
scene when the uss vincennes shot down the airbus on july 3 1988 
clearly put the blame on actions taken by the ship and disputed any 
notion of selfdefense 
no profit has come from the pathetic postincident attempts to 
place the blame on the victims he wrote view it as you will 
iran air flight 655 was shot down for no good reason 
having watched the performance of the vincennes for a month 
before the incident my impression was clearly that an atmosphere of 
restraint was not her long suit her actions appeared to be 
consistently aggressive and had become a topic of wardroom 
conversation 
capt will rogers skipper of the vincennes at the time said 
carlsons assessment was subjective and not in line with the navys 
conclusions 
the navy investigated the events of july 3 1988 in 
excruciating detail and published its findings in the fogarty 
report rogers said in a statement issued by the navy in san 
diego where he is stationed 
commander carlsons comments in the magazine article are his 
personal opinions of the airbus incident he said i fully stand 
behind the navy report and the performance of my crew 
navy spokesman david l dillon in san diego said that the 
magazine is not part of the navy 
its published by the naval institute a private selfsupported 
nonprofit professional society and its a forum for people to 
express personal opinions and assertions in various articles related 
to navy issues but the naval institute is not part of the us 
government so his comments are his own personal opinion he said 
carlson suggests the crew of the vincennes wanted to prove the 
capability of the ships aegis missiledefense system in the persian 
gulf 
on the day of the incident carlson said a crewman informed him 
that the vincennes had classified the plane as an iranian f14 
fighter 
i was also prepared to deal with an air threat but in all 
honesty did not perceive one carlson said 
according to carlson the event started with the vincennes 
helicopter drawing fire from iranian speedboats which he claims 
were only warning shots 
the vincennes saw an opportunity for action and pressed hard 
for commander middle east force to give permission to fire 
carlson said 
the tragedy was avoidable and we must learn from it he said 
a review of the facts is in order carlson wrote when the 
decision was made to shoot down the airbus the airliner was 
climbing not diving it was showing the proper identification 
friend or foe the vincennes was never under attack by iranian 
aircraft 
a naval investigator told congress last september that a series 
of errors caused by stress including misinterpreting electronic 
data caused the mistaken attack on the airliner 
rear adm william m fogarty who headed the navys investigating 
team said the captain of the vincennes will rogers iii ordered 
the ships missiles fired in the mistaken belief the airliner was an 
iranian f14 fighter plane 
carlson in his article puts some of the blame on himself 
i wondered aloud in disbelief but i did not do the one thing 
that might have helped he wrote i did not push for a 
reevaluation 
had i done so the information might have come forward quickly 
enough to allow me to attempt to dissuade the vincennes from 
shooting

the genetically altered virus released in a 
cabbage patch three weeks ago in the first test of its kind has been 
killing off the pest its supposed to fight and then dying off right 
on schedule scientists said 
the virus killed off all the cabbage looper insects that it was 
supposed to as part of the controlled experiment said h alan wood 
a virologist at the boyce thompson institute for plant research 
the institute is conducting the tests at cornell universitys 
agricultural experiment station in geneva and sprayed the field for 
a second time on thursday 
its very gratifying wood said our application technology 
was perfect everything was working just the way we predicted it 
would 
the aug 9 spraying made history as the first field release of a 
genetically altered virus in the united states the experiment was 
heralded as a milestone in the development of nonchemical methods 
of pest control 
the virus was genetically altered in the laboratory to be 
shortlived so that it would pose no threat of uncontrolled 
spreading 
samples that were taken one and two weeks after the first 
spraying show that the altered virus disappeared entirely from the 
900 cabbage plants where it was applied within according to wood 
but the virus that was ingested by the insects as well as 
whatever small amounts were absorbed into the soil will persist in 
decreasing amounts for another two years or so he said 
thursdays spraying was the second in a series of three scheduled 
for late this summer another 900 plants out of a total of 2700 in 
the test plot were sprayed 
the boyce thompson institute will monitor the field for two to 
three years to see how long the virus lives in the natural 
environment and to check for any movement of the virus according to 
an agreement with the us environmental protection agency

youth in a white neighborhood pleaded innocent to a murder charge 
friday and was ordered held without bail 
joseph fama 18 was placed in protective custody at his lawyers 
request after a hearing in brooklyn criminal court said correction 
department spokesman tom antenen 
in other developments friday a second suspect in the racially 
charged case indicated he was ready to cooperate with a grand jury 
probe and tensions erupted into violence outside a courtroom

chased four black teenagers with baseball bats golf clubs and at 
least one gun on the night of aug 23 one of the blacks 
16yearold yusuf hawkins was shot in the chest and died 
the murder of hawkins has touched off a series of protests and 
marches against racism some of them met by counterprotests by 
residents of the mostly italianamerican neighborhood of bensonhurst 
where the killing occurred 
fama fled after the shooting and remained a fugitive until early 
thursday when he surrendered to police in upstate oneonta he was 
returned to the city and witnesses identified him in a lineup said 
assistant district attorney paul burns 
hours after his return an estimated 7500 protesters clashed 
with police during a day of outrage march against racism through 
brooklyn twentythree officers were injured in the brawl 
im sure some of them came there because they had all good 
intentions but others clearly came with bricks and bottles bent on 
violence mayor edward i koch said 
in court fama attorney david a depetris entered an innocent 
plea for his client and challenged burns on what the lineups 
produced 
a number of individuals who viewed mr fama did not identify 
him in any way shape or form the lawyer said there is 
substantial dispute as to what actually occurred at the lineups 
fama said nothing during the arraignment 
he is charged with two counts of seconddegree murder assault

supreme court both pleaded innocent and justice john j delury 
refused prosecutors request that bail be revoked and allowed 
mondello to remain free on 100000 bail and raucci on 75000

1942 said in an earlier interview she was 18 at the time and 
married just three months 
after coming to terms with her husbands disappearance and 
apparent death she married kenneth rockhill of eureka in 1947 
this has been very trying for me and my husband it brings back 
a lot of memories she said but my husbands been wonderful

give us some consolation my only wish is that my parents were 
here 
he said he was just 12 years old when he learned that his brother 
was missing in action at first i didnt understand it but then 
i realized that life has death in it he said 
air force officials in washington said it is rare to find the 
remains of missing servicemen so long after world war ii 
they said identifying robert schwensens remains was difficult 
because the air force no longer had records of his relatives both 
his parents had died 
swede schwensen contacted the casualty memorial affairs office in 
alexandria va and made the arrangements for his brothers remains 
to be flown to kansas for burial at fort leavenworth

mayor marion barry asked friday to meet with 
attorney general dick thornburgh over press reports that federal 
investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack on several 
occasions 
in a letter to thornburgh barry said disclosures concerning the 
justice departments investigation into his links with convicted 
drug dealer charles lewis have damaged his ability to govern the 
city 
he said he hoped thornburgh would follow us attorney jay b 
stephens request for a full investigation into the disclosures 
this is an issue bigger than marion barry jr and the politics 
of the district of columbia barry said in the letter it is 
about the fundamental principles upon which our system of laws is 
based 
david runkel the justice departments chief spokesman refused 
friday to comment directly on the mayors request but indicated 
that an inquiry is standard in such cases 
you can assume whenever there is an unauthorized disclosure of 
information there will be an investigation runkel said 
earlier this year thornburgh ordered an investigation into leaks 
that rep bill gray dpa was being questioned by federal 
investigators 
gray then in a campaign for the democratic whips post in the 
house that he went on to win also had complained to thornburgh 
about leaks from the justice department 
the justice department responded by declaring that gray was not 
the target of an investigation and thornburgh went as far as saying 
he was willing to subpoena reporters telephone records in order to 
find the source of the leaks 
us attorney jay b stephens declined friday to comment on 
whether lewis has implicated barry in interrogations by federal 
agents but stephens said he wants the justice department to 
investigate whether stories about lewis cooperation originated with 
law enforcement officials 
in his letter to thornburgh barry said everyone involved in the 
investigation of his contacts with lewis is a justice department 
employee 
there seems to be one or more persons who with impunity are 
systematically leaking information that is part of an ongoing 
investigation barrys letter said the reality of all of this 
is that once published unsubstantiated allegations take on a life 
of their own and are repeated as fact 
quoting unnamed sources the washington post has reported that 
lewis identified to federal investigators four women in the virgin 
island who he claims can back up his allegations that barry used 
crack and other drugs there 
at least one woman has given investigators a statement backing 
lewis account that barry smoked crack on one occasion the post 
quoted the sources as saying 
wusatv earlier quoted sources as saying that lewis has told 
investigators he smoked crack with the mayor in lewis hotel room in 
december 
another station and newspaper wrctv and the washington times 
have carried stories in the past two days saying federal 
investigators believe they have enough evidence to seek an 
indictment of barry on perjury and obstruction of justice charges 
lewis has been charged with perjury and cocaine possession and 
trafficking in connection with a federal probe that began last 
december after city police inexplicably called off an attempt to 
make an undercover drug buy from lewis when they learned barry was 
in lewis hotel room 
for the past several years barry has been dogged by rumors that 
he uses drugs on thursday he repeated his claim that he never saw 
or used drugs during at least six visits to lewis room 
barry had been scheduled to appear friday with the citys new 
drug czar sterling tucker but the news conference was canceled 
thursday about two hours before the news conference city officials 
also canceled tuckers appearance

a judge on friday blamed the crew of a 
delta air lines jet for a 1985 crash that killed 137 people even 
though air traffic controllers had failed to warn the crew of severe 
weather 
in a 72page opinion us district judge david o belew jr said 
delta had failed to prove that the national weather service and 
controllers at the dallasfort worth international airport were 
negligent 
in the longest major aviation trial in us history attorneys 
for delta had argued that the weather was to blame for the crash 
because crew members didnt have sufficient warning about the 
severity of a thunderstorm at the airport 
the airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of 
the millions of dollars in claims arising from the crash 
the atlantabased airline said it would appeal the decision 
saying it was in direct conflict with the recent jury verdict 
in fort lauderdale holding delta blameless in all respects for the 
accident 
delta continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case 
clearly establish total government responsibility for the tragic 
accident 
in washington joe friday assistant administrator for weather 
services at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
said we are continuing to work with the faa federal aviation 
administration and the aviation industry to improve our science and 
technology so that this kind of tragedy will not be repeated 
the lockheed l1011 en route from fort lauderdale fla to 
dallas crashed trying to land at dfw on aug 2 1985 when it was 
caught in a downburst of wind during a thunderstorm the accident 
killed 137 27 people on board survived 
windle turley a dallas attorney representing a dozen victims of 
the crash said he was pleased with the ruling were very happy 
we felt from the beginning that delta was the only negligent party 
in this case he said 
belew said the crew of delta flight 191 knew or should have 
known that there was severe weather on the approach to the airport 
and that the thunderstorms were likely to cause dangerous wind 
shear an abrupt change in wind direction and force 
a national transportation safety board investigation had blamed 
wind shear for the crash 
in his ruling the judge said that attempting to land the 
aircraft in a thunderstorm constituted negligence on the part of the 
crew of dl191 and proximately caused the crash 
the government however did not escape criticism 
belew said dfw tower personnel should have taken steps to be sure 
that incoming pilots were aware of the weathers severity and that 
a meteorologist should have been sure that the weather was being 
monitored continuously while he took a long dinner break 
but belew cited other cases in which a controllers failure to 
warn pilots of bad weather was not considered negligent when the 
pilot already was aware of conditions 
he said the failure of air traffic controllers to route the plane 
to another runway was not negligent particularly because the pilots 
did not request a new runway 
yet the court considers the failure of governmental employees 
to pass on weather information to have been inconsequential to the 
fate of flight 191 in that there is no evidence that the crew 
would have acted differently with this confirmation of information 
already known 
the trial began in march 1988 and lasted almost 14 months 
although it recessed several times so belew could clear backlogged 
criminal cases 
the government argued that the flight crew didnt heed faa tower 
warnings didnt ask for weather information and decided to fly into 
the storm the government also says the jets radar should have 
warned the pilots of weather conditions 
the flight crew was killed in the crash 
delta has paid at least 66 million in death injury and damage 
claims from the flight 191 crash but in those cases survivors 
waived the issue of liability 
in the only previous case that considered liability a us 
district court jury in fort lauderdale determined that delta was 
blameless in the crash 
delta attorney john martin during final arguments in the fort 
worth case after testimony ended in april said the pilots did not 
know about the nightmarish wind shear 
the pilots of 191 were certainly not aware of impending doom 
he said 
wind shear is considered particularly dangerous at low altitudes 
and when pilots are taking off and landing such a downburst of air 
can cause a plane to lose altitude quickly 
the judge said deltas overall training program for pilots in 
windshear situations was lax but not negligent 
belew ruled out the possibility that tranquilizers capt edward 
m connors might have been taking at the time of the accident 
contributed to the crash saying the evidence was too speculative 
government attorneys had argued that connors use of valium and 
stelazine might have impaired his ability to properly respond to the 
situation

the us government will go after the 
personal assets of gen manuel antonio noriega and his friends and 
companies he controls in stepping up its drive against the 
panamanian leader us officials said friday 
they said washington is compiling a list of companies and 
individuals associated with noriega to block their assets and affect 
them financially by keeping them from doing any kind of business 
with us individuals agencies or companies 
we are going after noriegas cronies and firms he is identified 
with one us embassy official told the associated press 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
officials said the list will be made public within days and would 
include dozens of firms 
in its efforts to force the ouster of noriega whom it accuses of 
drug trafficking the us government imposed economic sanctions on 
panama last year the measures include withholding tax payments 
freezing panamanian government assets in the united states and 
refusing to pay panama canal tolls 
the total amount retained by the us government is estimated at 
close to 300 million 
but the sanctions have failed to budge the general who as 
commander of the panamanian defense forces is the most powerful 
individual in the country the defense forces include both the 
military and the police 
opposition leaders have said the us sanctions affect lowincome 
groups by aggravating the economic crisis 
the us embassy official said the new strategy was more 
selective and avoided measures that hurt the panamanian population 
on friday michael kozak deputy undersecretary of state for 
latin american affairs said in washington that the united states 
intended to put pressure on firms and friends of the regime 
without damaging the economy 
president bush said the united states will not recognize 
francisco rodriguez the provisional president named by the 
panamanian government because his appointment was the work of 
noriega 
the us embassy source said we can make it illegal for any 
us firm and individual to deal with any panamanian company owned 
by an associate of noriega or by noriega directly or indirectly 
this could mean a loss of millions of dollars by panamanian 
companies that do business with us government agencies like the 
military southern command and the panama canal commission 
the southern commands installations are home to nearly 14000 
us military personnel and it spends millions of dollars on food 
and other items the panama canal commission has nearly 8000 
employees which also means millions of dollars in maintenance and 
contracts and purchase of parts locally 
the us official said one company already targeted by the us 
government is an exportimport company in the colon free zone that 
at one time was run by carlos duque former presidential candidate 
of the government coalition

us military advisers may be sent to 
help colombia in its war against drug barons but this countrys 
defense chief said friday foreign troops are not needed to solve 
our domestic problems 
we can face this challenge alone defense minister gen oscar 
botero told a news conference 
late friday both the us embassy and the defense ministry 
denied there were any us military advisers in colombia 
the pentagon said thursday up to 200 american military personnel 
could wind up in colombia for tasks ranging from unloading to 
training 
a us narcotics official said drug traffickers wanted in the 
united states have managed to avoid a government crackdown and 
remain in colombia because of corruption among colombian authorities 
authorities in medellin home of the most powerful cocaine 
cartel said police defused a 40pound bomb that was left at a bank 
friday by terror squads working for drug lords 
it was the latest development in a series of assassinations 
bombings and arson by the drug cartels in the past two weeks drug 
lords are trying to force the government to reverse its decision to 
begin extraditing suspects wanted by the united states 
the us justice department seeks extraditions of 12 colombians 
believed to be key figures in cartels that supply most of the 
cocaine sold in the united states 
botero said the colombian army was capable of handling the 65 
million worth of equipment being sent by the united states without 
the aid of 200 advisers but did not rule out requesting technical 
help in specific fields 
he said the best aid the united states and other wealthy nations 
could give would be reducing drug use among their populations 
the general said 2004 properties had been searched 550 estates 
seized 1061 weapons found and 1356 cars 33 yachts 142 
motorcycles and 349 aircraft confiscated 
colombia began its toughest crackdown on drug dealing after the 
leading presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan was 
assassinated aug 18 during a speech at a campaign rally drug lords 
responded to the crackdown with threats to kill more officials 
us authorities said they believe corruption is slowing the 
crackdown and that drug chieftains remain in colombia protected by 
some officials despite speculation that narcotics overlords may 
have fled the country 
i feel confident most of these people are in colombia the 
us narcotics official said of traffickers sought by the united 
states 
traffickers eluding arrest dont feel a threat they might even 
feel protected he said 
infiltration is a very serious factor the official said of 
attempts by the traffickers to bribe colombian government officials 
and members of government security forces 
the official said drug cartels may have people stationed in small 
towns watching only for military or police movement army colonels 
can make up to 15000 monthly working for drug dealers 
the narcotics official spoke with reporters on the condition that 
his name or title not be disclosed 
the meeting with journalists was initiated by the us embassy 
perhaps indicating concern among us officials that colombias drug 
fight may be waning 
embassy officials said they had no information about us 
advisers coming to colombia to aid colombian security forces in 
using 65 million pledged by president bush 
barco said thursday the 65 million bush offered for colombias 
war on drugs was important but that the real solution is to put 
the brakes on the demand 
in drug raids the colombian army has found records in drug 
traffickers hideouts showing telephone calls to army bases and 
police stations arms caches have included police guns and equipment 
and scores of police uniforms apparently used as disguises 
the army and national police which are part of the defense 
ministry have ousted about a dozen officers for drug trafficking or 
being on traffickers payrolls 
the us narcotics official said he did not know how high up in 
the government the corruption goes 
if the colombian people do not win this battle i pity what 
will happen to this country the official said 
asked if he thought the battle would get more intense he said 
there is no doubt in my mind there will be a great deal of 
bloodshed 
he said the traffickers will kill their adversaries one by one if 
they defeat the current crackdown even president virgilio barco 
could be assassinated he said 
barco said thursday on colombia was doing its duty in the 
antidrug fight and called on developed countries to stop cocaine 
use 
the us official said the colombian supreme court will determine 
much of the success or failure of the crackdown 
the supreme court eventually will rule on the constitutionality 
of barcos decree to extradite colombians to the united states under 
a state of seige that exists 
in the last year the court has declared unconstitutional five of 
10 barco decrees aimed at controlling guerrilla violence and at 
thwarting drug traffickers

a 9yearold bangladeshi girl molested by 
the man who brought her to the united states was ordered returned 
friday to her foster home which state officials previously had said 
wasnt culturally relevant 
grays harbor county superior court judge michael spencer 
overturned a court commissioners ruling that let state child 
protective services take the child known as kushi from her hoquiam 
home on the central washington coast and place her with her sister 
in nearby lacey 
kushi a moslem was brought to the united states along with 
several other family members by stefan christopher a former united 
nations consultant who had the family live and work on his farm 
christopher 52 married one of kushis older sisters divorced 
her and then married kushis 12yearold sister 
on sept 11 he faces sentencing for guilty pleas to taking 
indecent liberties with the girl and two other children sheriffs 
department officials say christopher physically and 
psychologically tortured the family 
the superior court commissioner had decided after a closed 
hearing that the foster home didnt offer a culturally relevant 
upbringing as required by the state neither foster parent is moslem 
more than 200 people marched on the state capitol monday to 
demand the girl be returned to foster parents bob martin a chemical 
engineer and betsy seidel a middle school english and geography 
teacher 
im happy for now said seidel i realize its just 
temporary but im thrilled kushi is coming back into our home 
thats where she belongs 
details of spencers closeddoor hearing were confirmed by state 
officials and by tom copland the childs courtappointed guardian 
copland sought the court hearing after being barred from the 
earlier closed hearing that resulted in kushis removal from the 
martinseidel home the girl will be returned there this weekend 
judge spencer simply ruled that under the facts of this case 
the superior court had the authority to require a full court 
hearing prior to kushis removal from the foster home said 
copland an aberdeen attorney 
it was nothing more than a procedural ruling on an issue of law 
and had nothing to do with the merits of the case or the actions or 
motives of any party 
howard shuman spokesman for the state department of social and 
health services said officials would continue trying to contact 
kushis parents in bangladesh to learn where they would prefer she 
stay 
kushi currently is living with a sister who declined to comment 
when contacted by the associated press but seidel said kushi was 
excited about the prospects of returning to their home 
she called us collect last night and said she wanted to go to 
school she didnt understand why she couldnt seidel said

a provisional government loyal to gen 
manuel antonio noriega took office friday and the united states 
refused to recognize it vowing to impose more economic sanctions 
noriega did not attend the brief ceremony at which his 
schoolmate francisco rodriguez was sworn in as panamas sixth 
president in six years 
later in a televised speech friday night rodriguez appealed to 
the united states to end its confrontation with panama 
president bush said in washington earlier friday that he would 
tighten sanctions to deprive the illegal regime of funds that 
belong to the panamanian people 
i am confident that other governments which support human 
rights democracy and selfdetermination and which oppose drug 
trafficking will take similar measures he said 
us officials in panama said the tighter sanctions would try to 
keep noriega and his associates from doing business with us 
companies 
noriega is under indictment for drug trafficking in the united 
states which says he is a key connection for colombias cocaine 
cartels 
the fact that gen noriega handpicked another president doesnt 
change the political situation of the country opposition leader 
guillermo endara said through a spokesman 
the corruption will continue the dictatorship will continue 
nothing will change things will change when democracy is restored 
in this country 
rodriguez a career bureaucrat who has served noriega for 20 
years donned the presidential sash in a 20minute televised 
ceremony the ceremony was closed to the public and press and the 
diplomatic corps was not invited 
the council of state on thursday designated rodriguez 50 as 
president and carlos ozores typaldos a 49yearold jurist as vice 
president 
supreme court president marisol reyes de vasquez administered the 
oath of office to both 
rodriguez spoke for about four minutes quoting poet khalil 
gibran and promising to carry out my work with love with love of 
my country with energy and above all with dedication to serve the 
best interests of panama 
at a news conference afterward he defended the legality of the 
provisional government calling it a product of the best political 
options after the dialogue with the opposition was interrupted 
rodriguez later appealed in a nationally televised speech for an 
end to the faceoff between panama and the united states 
in this transition phase the united states has a magnificent 
opportunity to show the world its sincere concern for establishing a 
solid democracy in panama by letting panamanians decide for 
themselves he said 
rodriguez did not mention new elections in his 30minute speech 
in an interview ricardo arias calderon of the opposition 
christian democratic party called the swearingin equivalent to a 
coup detat carried out in order to place the country completely 
outside any constitutional government and thus assure the 
continuation in power of general noriega 
asked if the opposition planned any demonstrations he said 
under present circumstances that is not feasible we have had 
since may over 200 people imprisoned 
rodriguez was appointed to fill the constitutional void created 
when the noriegacontrolled government annulled the may 7 general 
election 
the opposition later refused noriegas invitation to join a 
junta saying it would continue to press for recognition of its may 
7 victory and noriegas departure from power 
international observers of the election said the opposition won 
by about a 31 margin the government said it was annulling the 
election because of alleged us interference 
rodriguez asked for international support in what he called 
panamas attempt to achieve a democracy in the face of us 
aggression 
he is the sixth person to don the presidential sash since noriega 
became commander of the defense forces in 1983 succeeding the late 
gen omar torrijos as panamas military strongman 
only one nicolas ardito barletta was elected he was forced to 
resign in 1986 
panamas council of state said the provisional government will 
consider calling new elections in six months if the united states 
releases panamanian funds frozen in us banks lifts economic 
sanctions and ends what it termed us aggression 
the freeze was imposed after noriegas indictment last year as 
part of us support of the opposition campaign to force the general 
to resign 
noriega says the campaign against him is a thinly veiled plot by 
us rightists to renege on the 1977 treaties under the treaties 
panama is to take full control of the panama canal at the end of the 
century 
bush said friday the united states will not have any diplomatic 
contact with the noriega regime 
he said that the candidates chosen by the panamanian people 
will not be allowed to take office today as required by the 
panamanian constitution panama is therefore as of this date 
without any legitimate government 
bushs decison will have little practical impact the us 
embassy remains open and officials said there were no plans to close 
it down

nevado del ruiz the volcano that wiped 
out a valley and 23000 people in 1985 spouted steam and ashes 
friday but then grew calm an official said people living nearby 
were evacuated 
volcanic activity has decreased significantly said camilo 
cardenas head of president virgilio barcos emergency committee 
a plume of smoke that reached five miles high earlier was down to 
half a mile by 1230 pm and so far there hasnt been any 
indication of avalanches he said 
nevado del ruiz erupted nov 13 1985 melting parts of its 
icecap boulders trees and mud dammed a river and when the barrier 
broke a wall of mud 150 feet high swept down the valley onto the 
sleeping town of armero 
the 16000foot volcano began spewing ash and smoke shortly after 
thursday midnight officials said the emergency office in 
manizales a city of 300000 about 15 miles away said 2500 people 
would have to be evacuated from river areas that might be flooded 
later friday the committee said the volcanos activity had 
regressed to a moderate state and a red alert was reduced to a less 
serious orange alert 
airplane flights diverted from the volcano were resumed late 
friday but highway traffic was restricted to emergency vehicles 
television pictures showed manizales with dark ashfilled skies 
at noon people in the streets covered their noses and mouths with 
handkerchiefs 
cardenas said barco cut short a trip to a north central 
provincial town and made an observation flight over the volcano

the parent company of united airlines said friday 
it was considering a 65 billion buyout proposal from a group that 
included the companys employees senior management and british 
airways plc 
ual corps board of directors said it had received and was 
reviewing the 300 a share proposal which tops an earlier offer of 
619 billion or 275 a share by investor marvin davis and was 
willing to consider other offers as well 
uals announcement capped a week of frenzied takeover speculation 
involving the nations biggest airlines and kicked off a fullscale 
bidding war for the chicagobased company parent of united airlines 
the ual board also indicated that davis had informed it that he 
might sweeten his current offer to more than 300 a share after he 
reviewed confidential corporate data 
no decisions were made but the ual board said a committee of 
independent directors would consider any proposals or financial 
alternatives available to the company 
the stock of ual parent of united airlines jumped 725 to 287 
a share friday on reports that uniteds pilots union management and 
british air was preparing a bid for the carrier 
under the proposal made by the group british airways would 
control 15 percent of the consortium that would acquire ual under 
federal law foreign carriers may not control more than 25 percent 
of a domestic carrier 
the employees including the pilots and staff of ual would 
participate through an employee stock ownership plan that would hold 
a majority of shares in return the employees would agree to 
unspecified wage concessions the ual board said in a statement 
the management element of the consortium would include stephen 
wolf uals chief executive officer and jack pope its executive 
vice president 
wolf would be asked to sit on the board of british airways and 
sir colin marshall british airways deputy chairman and chief 
executive would sit on the ual board 
in a prepared statement wolf said the buyout proposal did not 
contemplate the sale of any essential assets or the revision of its 
plans for fleet expansion and new routes 
british airways the worlds biggest international carrier 
issued a statement saying it had agreed in principle to invest 750 
million in the consortium in a combination of junior and senior 
securities 
british airways chairman lord king said the proposal would allow 
united and british airways to form the most formidable 
international partnership in every part of the globe united is 
the second largest us airline 
earlier reports about the groups proposal indicated the pilots 
union might put up as much as 1 billion with funds coming from two 
of the unions pension funds one of which is overfunded 
the rest of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed 
united pilots said in a statement they were pleased the employee 
ownership plan was being considered 
we look forward to a positive response from uniteds board of 
directors to our joint labormanagement proposal 
also friday the leadership of the flight attendants union at 
united approved a resolution directing its representatives to pursue 
participation in employee ownership of the airline 
the airline is in play and we intend to protect our members 
interests said pat friend president of the association of flight 
attendants united unit an employee stock ownership plan for 
flight attendants may be the best way to do that 
a relationship between united and british airways would further 
link two of the worlds biggest commercial airlines 
ual has a fleet of 421 aircraft serving more than 151 cities in 
north america and the pacific region 
ual also owns 50 percent of the apollo computerized reservation 
system one of the nations largest with british airways holding an 
11 percent stake in that business 
british airways in december 1987 entered into a joint marketing 
agreement with united that included the sharing of facilities at 
five major us airports plus joint marketing 
davis bid for ual and the recent buyout of nwa inc parent of 
northwest airlines have ignited a speculative fever in airline 
company stocks 
but the us department of transportation hinted wednesday it may 
move soon to curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in the 
airline industry 
jeffrey shane assistant transportation secretary for policy and 
international affairs said the agency was concerned that a high 
degree of debt from an airline buyout could compromise an airlines 
safety

overcome since israel kidnapped a moslem cleric says a us moslem 
leader who claims to have met with the hostageholders in beirut

kidnappers in beirut 
obeid who is affiliated with hezbollah the proiranian 
extremist group believed to sponsor hostageholders was abducted 
from his home in south lebanon july 28 by israeli commandos israel

in his first two months in office 
president carlos menem has imposed drastic measures on argentines to 
bring their chaotic economy back into line and he is winning their 
support 
he has more than tripled prices for public services 
electricity gas and water rates subway bus and train fares and 
has temporarily shored up an economy that had set off food riots and 
forced the radical civic unions raul alfonsin out of the presidency 
22 weeks before his term was up 
and while one of every two argentines did not vote for menem the 
peronist in mays presidential election he now is gaining favor 
for what he has done so far 
there is more stability said juan manuel casa a 29yearold 
car salesman who didnt vote for menem hes doing the right 
things 
i think menem is the only way to save the country said 
ricardo gutierrez a suit salesman who also did not vote for menem 
the publicservice price increases have narrowed an unsustainable 
budget deficit while a 54 percent devaluation has stabilized the 
austral currency and brought down interest rates 
wage and price guidelines have cooled hyperinflation while the 
cost of living rose by 197 percent in july the rate for august is 
projected at 35 percent and for september at 10 percent or less 
whats most important is that it is going down said victor 
vazquezpresedo a business school dean noting that inflation had 
not risen for the first time since last november everyone thought 
we were mired in hyperinflation and that was frightening 
stores in buenos aires are well stocked now merchants are no 
longer worried about inflation rising from day to day and accept 
credit cards again the price of a steak or a quart of milk no 
longer is frontpage news 
early rains have bolstered predictions of a 41 millionton farm 
harvest including wheat soybeans and corn which would mean a 60 
percent increase over last years harvest central bank reserves 
have increased to about 1 billion the international monetary fund 
has resumed negotiations on argentinas request for a 15 
billionloan 
although taking a taxi and dining out still are relative luxuries 
for most argentines real wages are about 30 percent higher than 
they were in june if still 30 percent below what they were in 
january 
i have friends who renewed their passports in anticipation that 
things would not get better said isidro soloaga an economist 
with the latin america research foundation now no one talks 
about that and hardly any left 
menems popularity has increased since the election may 14 to 
his peronist partys base of organized labor he has attracted 
middleclass support by appointing a conservative cabinet pledging 
to sell off state industries and lowering taxes on farm exports 
two polls have put his public approval rating at 80 percent or 
better in the election he won just under 50 percent of the vote in 
the multiparty race 
what our polls are showing is that when people are shown 
economic plans they have faith in even though there must be 
sacrifices there is public support said marbita carballo de 
cilley who directed the gallup poll that gave menem a positive 
rating of 87 percent 
menem has persuaded organized labor to accept wage increases 
below inflation rates big business to contribute to social welfare 
programs provinces to forgo federal subsidies farmers to plant 
more wheat and soybeans 
he also has taken the political risk of talking to the british 
about restoring the diplomatic relations broken off when the 
argentine military governnent then in power launched an invasion of 
the falkland islands in 1982 only to go down to defeat 
human rights groups arent happy however about a pending pardon 
or amnesty for military officers accused of torturing and executing 
people they suspected of being leftist subversives during the 
197683 dictatorship 
i dont think people will react violently to a pardon said 
hebe de bonafini president of the mothers of the plaza de mayo 
whose children disappeared or were killed in the military years 
people are hemmed in by the economy by hunger 
while menem apparently is off to a good start success remains a 
long way off 
an estimated 9 million of argentinas 32 million people live at 
or below the poverty line and about one of every seven workers is 
unemployed soup kitchens set up three months ago are still open 
unions representing doctors teachers commutertrain personnel 
and others have gone on strike for higher wages or have announced 
plans to do so police in northwest tucuman province 25 had to use 
tear gas aug 25 to break up a sitin by several hundred public 
employees 
the political coalition menem forged after taking office has 
approved legislation transferring authority from congress to the 
presidency to sell state companies but it is fraying over proposals 
to suspend subsidies to businesses and the provinces 
organized labor fears the selling of staterun companies may lead 
to cutbacks in jobs and wages despite menems assurances to the 
contrary political opponents worry that menem might be 
concentrating too much power in the presidency 
the coalition may or may not hold together for other pending 
legislation including tax reform and updating the constitution to 
allow a president to seek reelection 
but for now argentines are taking menem on faith

diana rigg started her acting career in 
shakespeare but she will be forever known as the exotically 
beautiful blackleatherclad counterspy on the british series the 
avengers 
although that was more than 20 years ago her stint as mrs emma 
peel was unforgetable since then other than a shortlived and 
unmemorable american sitcom in 197374 called diana she has 
rarely been seen in this country 
rigg makes up for it this season as she succeeds vincent price as 
host of mystery on pbs at the start of the new season on 
thursday oct 12 the show is an anthology of the best english 
mysteries 
i dont think there will be a major difference other than the 
question of our personalities she said on a visit to this country 
to promote the show and tape her appearances at wgbh in boston 
mystery is noted for edward goreys gothic steel engravings 
for the title sequences and gorey has designed a new black and 
white set for the host that has a onedimensional look 
im not playing a part i am myself i suppose it will evolve 
but its always dangerous to speak up front id rather wait and 
see my job is to introduce each show for those who know the 
characters its an affirmation and for those who dont its an 
explanation 
plus well also take a wider approach to the subject at hand 
for example well talk about the rules of law as they developed in 
england for the rumpole of the bailey series i like the idea of 
giving a tidge of information 
rigg recently completed a miniseries for the bbc called mother 
love that may show up on mystery its a decidedly different 
role from emma peel 
its the story of a woman who brings up her son by herself 
after her divorce she said she loves her son passionately and 
believes hes never seen his father in the years since the divorce 
but the father and son carry on a deception and when the mother 
finds out murder and mayhem ensue 
she plays the mother david mccallum man from uncle is 
the father and the son is james wilby who stars in a new version of 
a tale of two cities for masterpiece theatre this season 
the avengers british televisions version of james bond 
starred patrick macnee as a suave secret agent in a bowler it was 
witty absurd and diabolical his first female partner was honor 
blackman who left to play pussy galore in the bond movie 
goldfinger rigg was his partner emma peel when the show began 
its run on abc in 1966 she stayed with it two years then was 
replaced by linda thorson it left abc in 1969 but was later seen 
on latenight on cbs 
it was a very stylistic show and it set the tone for a lot that 
followed she said it certainly set the pattern for women as 
equal partners james bond hasnt reached that yet it was ahead of 
its time and quite original for television 
emma peel saw herself as the equal of any man she could 
compete without being strident patrick and i chose a very 
tongueincheek approach that made it more fun for us and more 
believable for the audience theres no question that people 
remember me most for the avengers but one has to move on you 
dont expect an artist to paint the same picture over and over 
rigg played a spanish contessa in the 1969 bond film on her 
majestys secret service it was the only movie in which 007 got 
married and in which george lazenby played bond she and price her 
predecessor on mystery were in theatre of blood in 1973 
rigg who is married to british producer archie sterling said 
she has tapered off her career since the birth of her daughter 12 
years ago still she was in a new version of witness for the 
prosecution for cbs and recently was on the stage in london in 
follies

the stock markets strength has presented a 
special challenge for a breed of wall streeters known as technical 
analysts how do you interpret charts and indicators when prices 
reach levels never seen before 
all but the newest of newcomers have experience dealing with this 
kind of situation from the day in early 1983 when the dow jones 
industrial average hit 1070 for the first time through the top at 
2722 in august 1987 
but all that practice wasnt enough for them to find any 
foolproof system for determining when a market at new peaks has 
further to go and when it is running out of steam 
most do agree that stocks now are nowhere near the extreme 
overvalued levels they reached two years ago so easy to spot 
now with the advantage of hindsight 
still a good many chartwatchers see cause for concern or at 
least caution heading into the last four months of 1989 
consider that most basic of measures for evaluating the market 
the ratio of stock prices to corporate earnings 
as measured by the leading market indexes the priceearnings 
ratio of a typical stock recently stood at about 13 to 1 down from 
about 20 to 1 in 1987 
pe ratios at 13 or so dont seem too high said martin 
zweig editor of the investment advisory letter the zweig forecast 
but what are peak earnings worth the business cycle has been 
up for seven years if were headed for recession stocks are 
anything but cheap 
zweig also notes that stocks are trading at more than 25 times 
their book value or theoretical worth if the companies they 
represent were liquidated only twice before has that ratio been 
higher just preceding the crashes of 1929 and 1987 
shortterm measures of sentiment or enthusiasm for stocks 
deteriorated expectably in august said philip roth technical 
analyst at the securities firm of shearson lehman hutton inc 
roth also observed however the trend is up we would become 
more negative on it only if volume stays high but prices fail to 
move ahead 
andrew gold at prudentialbache securities says several measures 
of momentum such as the cumulative number of stocks advancing 
minus those declining topped out a few weeks ago before the dow 
jones industrials and other market indicators pushed on to new highs 
this and other signals suggest the market is headed for an 
intermediateterm peak sometime this fall he contends 
but amid all the wariness some analysts cast ringing votes for 
further market gains 
at no time in the past 18 months have conditions been more 
bullish than they are today proclaims stephen leeb editor of the 
advisory letter indicator digest 
some might argue that stocks are no longer cheap since pes 
have risen while that is true it is also true that inflation has 
fallen 
what really counts is not the absolute level of pes but how 
high pes are relative to inflation by that measure stocks are 
about as cheap as they have been in the postwar period 
leeb says he believes the bull market has at least another year 
to run there are going to be reactions along the way maybe some 
as severe as 7 percent or 9 percent he concludes 
but the big rewards will continue to go to those who play the 
big trend rather than the shortterm swings

in an extraordinary year labor has suffered some major losses 
yet won some impressive victories although the spotlight on the 
negatives has tended to obscure the bright spots 
a number of unions have proven that labormanagement cooperation 
can work but as in the case of the united auto workers learned as 
well that too much of a good thing can prove troublesome 
others have found hope in their solidarity particularly in the 
eastern and miners strikes but will spend labors traditional 
holiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay for 
their pride and determination 
the movement has lost one nemesis ronald reagan but gained 
another frank lorenzo 
union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments in 
poland their dues helped support the solidarity trade union from 
its underground days to its historic rise as leader of the first 
noncommunist government in the east bloc through the aflcio us 
unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment and 
other supplies to solidarity while it was outlawed 
i think the role of the american trade union movement in this 
should not be overlooked aflcio president lane kirkland said 
last week 
kirkland head of the 14million member aflcio the major 
umbrella group for the nearly 18 million americans who belong to 
unions says those who are eulogizing the labor movement dont 
understand it 
the key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought to 
examine what we regard as the most important measure and that is 
internal cohesiveness and solidarity he said and i think its 
fair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity and 
cohesion today than weve had in many many years 
a number of developments bolster kirklands point among them 
the virtually unprecedented support of the pilots union when 
the machinists union struck eastern on march 4 
joint negotiations between former enemies the communications 
workers of america and the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers with atampt and the baby bell regional telephone 
companies that solidarity continued in a number of strikes against 
the regional companies 
nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1700 miners who struck 
pittston coal group after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed to 
bring a settlement pittston is seeking to halt its contributions to 
union pension funds a move that likely would cause other companies 
to follow suit 
still there have been setbacks for labor as well 
a trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steady 
flow that has allowed eastern and lorenzo to move ahead with 
plans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller nonunion airline 
labor still hopes to use congress and bankruptcy court to oust 
lorenzo but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches the 
sixmonth mark on labor day 
the most highly publicized failure of big labor was the auto 
workers defeat in an election at a nissan plant in smyrna tenn 
its first attempt to organize a us plant fully owned by the 
japanese the uaw lost by a 21 margin in a fight many within labor 
said the uaw was too hasty to bring to a conclusion by calling the 
election 
the vote came just weeks after uaw president owen bieber beat 
back a drive by a dissident group that sought to oust the unions 
leadership because of labormanagement cooperation the group said 
had gone too far 
at nissan and at other industries that traditionally have been 
the backbone of trade unions the labor movement is running into two 
main obstacles management programs to undermine union support by 
giving workers more say and perks and intricate antiunion 
campaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicants 
to determine their attitudes toward unions 
at smyrna nissan screened more than 100000 workers for about 
3000 jobs 
but kirkland said the japanese arent to blame for doing that 
they are led into this course in some cases not by anything 
inherent in their culture or their own countries because in many 
instances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in their 
own countries with good faith but are following the advice of 
hustlers american hustlers who have made a new profession out of 
trying to guide employers for a fee kirkland said 
to counter such tactics labor is changing the way it looks at 
organizing and now accepts as associate members workers at 
plants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers looking 
for residency status in the united states 
by getting its foot in the door and offering those workers 
benefits such as cutrate credit cards insurance and legal 
services unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success in 
later elections 
such a concept once reviled by traditionalists in the movement 
has brought in 300000 associate members in the past three years 
and according to kirkland and other federation officials is 
beginning to pick up steam 
the federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fighting 
among unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance at 
nonunion companies targeted for organizing and the affiliates are 
making fresh efforts at attracting women minorities and workers in 
the growing service sector 
the noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured some 
remarkable contract agreements 
the steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workers 
were forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry was 
nearly crippled 
the cwa and ibew came out of the atampt talks and the regional 
negotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovative 
packages of parental leave elder care and child care benefits 
and uaw workers at a joint chryslermitsubishi plant in illinois 
last week agreed on a new contract believed to have the best 
jobprotection provisions ever included in a major industrial 
contract 
in the final months of 1989 the eastern strike and legislative 
initiatives are likely to dominate labors agenda 
pending on capitol hill are efforts to raise the minimum wage and 
a number of other laborbacked measures including expanded child 
care benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers and 
acquisitions also pending but unlikely to pass is a measure 
designed to force president bush to intervene in the eastern strike 
kirkland refers to bush as reagan lite sharing his former 
boss promanagement bent but not his virulent antiunion 
philosophy bush is regarded as no friend of the labor movement but 
not as its no 1 enemy as was reagan 
that designation has been passed to lorenzo who was successful 
in making continental airlines a nonunion carrier and appears on 
the verge of winning again at eastern 
his recent talk of selling continental has sparked hope in the 
labor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory out 
of defeat 
kirkland said there will be no winners even if the carrier 
returns to the union fold but his contempt for lorenzo was clearly 
evident as he added a caveat 
scorched earth on both sides is not a victory he said of 
course its better than scorched earth on just one side

bigticket items ranging from refrigerators to 
cars have moved slowly out of stores this year but clothing has 
been selling at a healthy rate 
this pattern has drawn attention to stocks of retailers 
specializing in apparel particularly womens fashions and clothing 
manufacturers 
several wall street analysts expect the trend to continue and 
recommend investing in selected retailers and apparel makers that 
stand to profit from current spending preferences 
the latest results from the countrys major retailers showed 
apparel sales rose again in august from the past years blah pace 
the buildup in sales momentum was given an extra nudge by 
backtoschool business 
jeffrey feiner a retail analyst at merrill lynch amp co says 
part of the pickup in august reflected the weakness at apparel 
stores a year earlier when women rejected clothing styles women are 
busily replacing worn out wardrobes this year after finding few 
fashions that suited them for the last two years 
we believe that the somewhat betterthanexpected august sales 
increases continue to reflect some shift in consumer spending away 
from automobiles houses and bigger ticket durables and toward the 
enhancement of wardrobes feiner says noting that high credit 
costs and an uncertain economic outlook have made consumers 
reluctant to make large outlays for expensive goods 
we also believe this trend bodes well for retailers profit 
outlook feiner says 
cash registers at accessory and cosmetics counters also are 
ringing up better sales 
low inflation in clothing prices should help maintain the rebound 
in apparel spending says deborah bronston a textile and apparel 
analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
with the memory of poor business in recent years still fresh 
manufacturers and specialty retailers have made an effort to control 
price increases prices for materials and imports arent rising as 
fast as they had in other years in this decade which makes 
controlling markups somewhat easier 
clothing makers across the board are benefiting says bronston 
citing leslie fay cos liz claiborne inc oshkosh bgosh inc and 
russell corp as examples 
elizabeth armstrong an analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc 
says her company also considers several clothing makers to be fine 
investments right now mentioning that prospects appear good for 
phillipsvan heusen corp especially because of the improving 
profitability at the gh bass amp co shoe manufacturing division it 
acquired in 1987 
robert raiff of cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc said that as 
a group apparel makers havent really responded yet to the apparel 
spending recovery which means opportunities exist for significant 
appreciation in stock prices 
among the clothing companies he thinks have substantial room for 
improvement are brown group inc hartmarx corp vf corp and 
kellwood corp 
christopher vroom of alex brown amp sons inc points out that 
specialty apparel retailers have consistentedly outperformed mass 
merchandisers such as sears roebuck and co and k mart corp this 
year 
chains including limited inc one of the countrys leading 
specialty apparel merchants appear on investment firms lists of 
recommendations others talked about favorably on wall street 
include charming shoppes inc claire stores inc deb shops gap 
inc and merry go round enterprises inc as well as numerous 
department stores that emphasize apparel

with the arrival of autumn thoughts begin 
turning to keeping warm in winters chill that anticipation sends 
thousands of americans into the woods with chain saws exacting a 
heavy toll of fingers and toes among the unwary 
in a typical year the consumer product safety commission 
reports as many as 125000 people are treated in hospital emergency 
rooms for injuries related to chain saws 
the largest share of injuries nearly one in three occur when 
the saw operator is moving the saw or changing his position and 
touches the moving cutting chain the answer is simple carefulness 
kickback is the no 2 cause of injury causing some 20 percent of 
chain saw accidents according to the safety commission and 
kickback injuries are often the most severe with the chain striking 
the head or face 
improved saws are reducing that toll with the new models less 
likely to kick back at the operator this can still occur however 
and the solution is the same be careful 
an example is remembering to hold the saw off to the side when 
using it so that if it does suddenly catch and jump back it will 
miss the head and face 
cutting with the tip of the saw is particularly dangerous and 
should be avoided 
saws skating or bouncing along instead of cutting account for 13 
percent of saw accidents other major problems include loss of 
balance saws pinching and getting stuck and tree branches falling 
on the saw operator 
either gasoline and electric chain saws can be dangerous 
gasoline saws can cause burns and fires the electric ones can 
result in shock if misused 
the safety commissions advice is direct to begin with be sure 
you know how to operate the saw correctly and that it is oiled the 
chain tension is set correctly and generally the machine is in 
proper working order 
clear the work area so the chain will not contact anything other 
than the wood to be cut and place gasoline saws on the ground 
before starting them do not start them on your leg or knee 
when using the saw gloves can be a big help in maintaining a 
grip always hold the saw firmly with both hands and be sure of 
your footing so you dont slip or lose your balance 
when cutting larger pieces of wood use wedges to hold the sides 
apart so they dont pinch the saw 
when cutting logs stand on the uphill side so the log doesnt 
roll down on you when it comes free 
and be very wary of cutting branches that are under tension they 
can spring loose suddenly causing you to fall or lose control of 
the saw 
the safety commission urges dressing properly for chainsaw 
cutting this the agency says includes gloves and safety shoes 
eye goggles and relatively snug clothing so loose ends dont catch 
on branches or the saw a hard hat is also recommended as are 
hearing protectors in the case of gasolinedriven saws

americans came home from work last week locked their doors 
flipped on their tvs and stared in astonishment at the fabulously 
wealthy empire they had created 
with its fine homes and ranches its regal horses and sleek 
limousines it looked like a society worth fighting for the 
colombian drug barons who own it all certainly think so 
when the barons declared war on the colombian government for 
daring to enforce the law president virgilio barco spoke out to 
those he considered responsible american drug users 
those of you who depend on cocaine he said have created 
the largest most vicious criminal enterprise the world has ever 
known what might seem to be a matter of personal habit has 
thrown us all into a war we did not ask for 
when president bush goes on television tuesday to announce his 
strategy for fighting that war he will be speaking to a nation that

on any day in almost any community illicit drugs influence the 
way people live and the way many die what follows is a glimpse at

just east of the main bus station in new york city security 
guard robert reynolds patrols a grungy block of 41st street with the 
newest recruit in the war on drugs damien the doberman 
crack dealers and smokers had taken over the block smoking 
sleeping defecating and fornicating in public so business owners 
chipped in this july to hire 24hour private guards who patrol with 
a nightstick in one hand and a chain leash in the other 
within one week we had eliminated most of the problem said 
carl person who organized the effort police are limited but a 
dog doesnt know from constitutional rights if a dog goes woof 
woof the people cant argue with it 
the guard service costs 1750 a week with business people 
contributing from 25 to 250 depending on their rent 
its expensive its an added tax but unfortunately its the 
only way to do it in new york city said ron savitt a 
businessman there will never be enough police to cover it

a detroit woman who settled a crack debt by allowing her 
13yearold daughter to be raped is sentenced to life in prison by 
wayne county circuit court judge james j rashid 
although her crime normally would carry a 10 to 25year 
sentence rashid says susan barbier 29 has sunk to an 
intolerable level of humanity and shows no potential for reform 
this case demonstrates tragically the farreaching impact of 
drugs on innocent people the judge said 
although some people say drug abuse is a victimless crime no 
such argument is made about child abuse often as on this day they 
go hand in hand 
in charlottesville va social workers say theyre seeing more 
children placed in foster care because their parents abuse drugs 
and in richmond va a 12yearold girl is shot in the head and 
arm while standing on her front porch both her mother and police

in the shadowy world of drug dealing it helps to 
know the lingo 
it marks you as being a regular instead of a cop said a 
police officer who worked the streets of the bronx under cover and 
asked that his name not be used 
typically a steerer takes the buyeruser to the dealer 
first ascertaining if the buyer is genuinely looking to score buy 
drugs or is an undercover cop 
depending on the size of the operation the steerer may be 
supplemented by a holder who safeguards the stash the dealers 
drugs or money this ensures that the dealer has a minimum amount of 
drugs or money on his person if he is arrested by police or robbed 
by a buyer 
holders are usually kids younger than 16 the penalties are 
milder for juveniles 
another way buyers obtain drugs is through peephole operations a 
steerer takes a buyer to an apartment where the dealer accepts the 
buyers money and pushes the drugs through an opening in the

major us banks likely will have to increase 
their loanloss provisions this year to protect themselves from 
shaky foreign loans and an irreversible process of forgiveness 
initiated by the federal government according to a leading wall 
street credit rating firm 
but the study by moodys investors service warned that some banks 
may be forced to restructure their operations as a result and that 
could mean future staff cuts or asset sales 
banks added more than 20 billion to their provisions for loan 
losses in 1987 resulting in huge earnings declines or losses that 
year for many the credit ratings of many of the major money center 
banks also were lowered 
the moodys report released wednesday said more steps may be 
needed because the third world debt problem appears to be 
unraveling further 
they us banks are not all out of the woods yet it said 
the extent to which banks need to pad their loanloss reserves 
remains in dispute 
last spring the general accounting office the auditing arm of 
congress said third world countries were falling behind on 70 
billion in debt repayments to us banks and that american 
regulators should make banks put up more reserves to protect 
depositors against loan losses 
but more recently the us comptroller of the currency 
reportedly has proposed accounting changes that could discourage 
banks from making large additions to their loanloss reserves in 
order to avoid jeopardizing their quarterly dividend payments 
nonetheless moodys says us institutions still lag behind the 
reserves taken by big european banks 
britains central bank for instance recently required the four 
big british banks to raise their loanloss provisions so they would 
amount to nearly half of their credits to troubled debtor nations 
up from around a third the us average is 30 percent 
the moodys report said the us plan for reducing the 13 
trillion third world debt known as the brady plan has begun an 
irreversible process of forgiveness the debt initiative places 
more emphasis on having lender banks cut debt and interest payments 
than on providing new loans 
the us government has shifted from one focused on protecting 
the banks to one focused on protecting the political and 
economic stability of the borrowers by encouraging debt reduction 
the report said 
mexico in july became the first nation to reach a debt 
restructuring agreement under the brady plan although a number of 
its creditor banks reportedly have been slow to participate in the 
plan 
in that pact banks were given the choice of reducing interest or 
principle on the old debt or lending new money at least one bank 
citicorp the nations largest said in a recent published report 
that it would opt for making new loans 
moodys predicted the agreement with mexico will provide the 
country with very modest relief and that further bank concessions 
might be necessary unless officials sources step up their help

eastern airlines said it has abandoned an earlier 
plan to sell its latin american routes which means the strikebound 
carrier will have about 370 million less in cash by year end than 
first projected 
but rolf andresen easterns vice president of finance insisted 
thursday that the cash balance of nearly 400 million now expected 
to be available for operations and paying debts is an amount 
thats very adequate for our needs 
in an operating plan presented to creditors in april eastern 
projected a yearend cash balance of 774 million but andresen said 
that will be reduced because the latin american routes wont be sold 
andresen reiterated miamibased easterns pledge to pay all 
creditors 100 percent with interest 
we have a profitable and totally financially viable airline 
he said in a telephone interview 
earlier thursday eastern president phil bakes andresen and 
other senior officials told creditors that the airlines operating 
results are better than projected in its april plan and it has 
dropped intentions to sell any south american routes 
the officials made a twohour presentation to a meeting of the 
creditors committee in new york following speculation in recent 
days that eastern faces a revenue shortfall of up to 500 million 
and may have to revise its plan for emerging from chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection 
the wall street journal quoted sources earlier this week as 
saying that parent texas air corp may underwrite some of easterns 
operations because the negotiations with rival american airlines on 
the sale of the usually profitable latin american routes had stalled 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo announced last thursday that he 
is considering selling a minority or controlling interest in 
houstonbased continental airlines texas airs other airline 
subsidiary 
bakes and other senior officers told the creditors they 
anticipate profits before taxes of 62 million next year and 140 
million in 1991 
attorneys representing the creditors committee didnt return 
phone calls thursday seeking comment 
a spokesman for the pilots union one of three that has been on 
strike against eastern since march 4 called the airlines admission 
of a shortfall a clear indication that the bankruptcy 
reorganization plan is doomed to failure 
referring to the projected cash balance of 400 million or so 
pilots union spokesman ron cole said we believe that thats an 
extremely optimistic assessment on easterns part 
eastern under bankruptcy protection since march 9 has been 
trying to rebuild to about twothirds its prestrike size and has 
hired new pilots mechanics and flight attendants to replace the 
strikers 
andresen declined to say why the decision not to sell the latin 
american routes was made 
there are many factors he said its not a oneissue 
answer 
eastern previously claimed it was doing so well rebuilding from 
the crippling strike that it will be bigger than expected after the 
reorganization hinting that the latin american routes might not be 
sold 
dallasbased american the chief bidder for the routes recently 
expressed frustration at the lack of progress in the negotiations 
the frustration factor is very real its really not clear that 
they want to sell american spokesman ed stewart said in 
midaugust 
raymond neidl an analyst for dillon read amp co inc suggested 
thursday that texas air wanted top dollar for the routes and 
probably was holding out for a higher figure than anyone offered 
long term i think theyre in better shape not selling it he 
said if there is a cash shortfall then they could take some 
other actions 
andresen said eastern has received good prices for the assets 
it has sold in recent months mainly aircraft and airport gates

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home fell in july to the lowest level in 
nearly four years reflecting rising home prices 
the national association of realtors said thursday that a family 
with a median income of 32876 meaning half of the nations 
families earned more and half less had only 98 percent of the 
income necessary to buy a medianpriced existing home costing 
96400 
that was the indexs lowest level since september 1985 and marked 
a decline from 991 percent in june when the index dipped below 100 
percent for the first time since march 1986 
the decline in affordability in july was blamed on a 3000 
increase in median home prices nationally that more than offset the 
effects of a decline in the average mortgage rate from 1059 percent 
to 1039 percent the association uses a composite rate reflecting 
both fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages 
the changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment 
on a median home by 10 to 699 which represents 255 percent of 
the median familys income 
by region the median family in the midwest had 1292 percent of 
the income needed to buy a median home southern families 978 
percent families in the west 735 percent and residents of the 
northeast 705 percent 
consumers incomes have not kept pace with home prices in the 
northeast and west firsttime buyers simply dont make what it

the embattled founder of a stocktip 
telephone line says hes only helping the little guy by passing 
on the research of major wall street firms along with his own market 
recommendations 
but state regulators say the fasttalking barry k davis barred 
from the securities industry 18 years ago may be giving investment 
advice illegally 
in a telephone interview thursday davis fumed at the state 
bureau of securities a recent news story about his service and the 
attitude of wall street firms 
lets say my background hasnt been wonderful what has that 
got to do with what im doing for the little guy in america today 
he said 
what he does for the little guy is help prepare a recorded phone 
message changed thrice daily with a menu of rumors tips boasts 
about past successes and the state of the economy 
subscribers to traders amp investors alert of fort lee pay 695 a 
year for 1750 subscribers receive a beeper so they can be 
summoned to phone for special reports 
its not just the little guy on a subscriber list of 1600 davis 
says he helps he claims that a long list of brokers from major wall 
street research firms call him though he would not identify them 
he says they provide some of the lines information from the 
firms research departments davis said he also talks to exchange 
floor sources goes to other advisory services and computer bases 
and takes tips from people invited to call in 
brokers say they call to find out what other firms are saying 
what they may have missed from the newspapers or to crystalize the 
days information 
everything he says is not etched in stone but it gives you an 
idea of why things are moving and it gives you ideas of what to 
do said howard borenstein a broker at the chicago firm david 
noyes amp co 
davis says the large wall street firms are not too happy with him 
for cutting into their business 
morgan stanley amp co spokesman peter roche said the service had 
gotten hold of some daily announcements from the brokerages 
research department and sales staff were reminded that sharing the 
information was forbidden 
the brokers at goldman sachs dont need to call something like 
that said a spokesman for that firm he also doubted how much 
help davis gets theres no such thing as free research 
nor is the state bureau of securities too happy 
bureau chief james mcl smith said davis may be operating as an 
unlicensed investment adviser the investigation is continuing 
bureau enforcement director richard barry said regulators 
naturally gravitate to a oncebanned industry member who returns to 
it he also referred to a potential for such a service to be used 
for market manipulation 
theres a lot of possibilities of investment advisers to take 
unfair advantage of the market he said 
all i am is a research reporter said davis who speaks so 
quickly he is sometimes difficult to understand his conversation is 
laced with profanity and constantly interrupted by shouts at 
coworkers 
we claim under the freedom of the first amendment that we are 
doing electronic broadcasting he said 
when known as barry sutz in 1971 davis was barred by the 
securities and exchange commission from the industry for he says 
undercapitalizing his brokerage firm until setting up the line in 
september davis 46 of cresskill said he traded for himself 
worked in the insurance business and sold franchises 
he said he changed his name because he tired of sutz i also 
had a nose job because my nose was too big i change anything i want 
to change thats why im a great trader he said 
he called himself chief of research for tia and the original 
brains behind it but declined to identify its principals or top 
executives 
he said he now welcomes scrutiny by the sec and state regulators 
though when three of smiths investigators paid a call in may 
police were called to eject them 
tell us what the law is and well pay attention to it he 
said does a checkered past have the same rights as anybody else 
unless hes proven guilty 
he also criticized the wall street journal for running what he 
called an unflattering article two weeks ago he said the 
newspapers owner dow jones amp co which runs a financial news 
service aimed at stockbrokers wanted to wipe us out because were 
in competition 
dow jones spokesman roger may had no comment

a published report about convicted financier 
ivan f boesky and michael milken raises questions about whether 
boesky was trying to entrap the junk bond trader 
the washington post reported thursday that boesky now a key 
government informant allegedly met with milken former head of 
drexel burnham lambert incs highyield bond department in july 
1986 before wall streets insider trading scandal mushroomed 
milken now faces charges in the probe 
according to the post a confidential securities and exchange 
commission memorandum indicated the two met to discuss how to 
conceal the true nature of a 53 million payment from boesky to 
drexel 
the government contends the 53 million payment was part of a 
secret stock trading arrangement between the two highpowered wall 
street figures drexel claims the march 1986 payment was for 
consulting services it provided boesky 
boesky and milken met in july 1986 to discuss how they could 
substantiate the consulting services gloss which they had used to 
conceal the true nature of the 53 million payment the sec memo 
said according to the post 
prosecutors have never revealed when boesky began cooperating 
with authorities but the date could be significant for milkens 
defense against securities fraud and racketeering charges 
if boesky was cooperating in july 1986 the sec memo might 
indicate that he was trying to gather evidence on milken for the 
government an issue that milken defd raise at his trial set to 
start next year 
several wall figures implicated by boesky including invest and 
west coast stock broker boyd jefferies have pleaded guiltd in turn 
given information on others accused o the sec asked post editors on 
wednesday not to publish confidermation contained in the may 1988 
memo claiming the thought processes of commission attorneys now 
suing milkr securities law violations

the confidentmemo in may 1988 was said to be furious that ihe 
newsaper 
however sturc declined all comment on the maturday as did other 
sec officials 
any sby michael milken is totally untrue milken attorney 
martin fmenbaum said through a spokeswoman in new yorkg leaks by 
the government are deplorable and are designed to deike milken his 
right to a fair trial flumenbaums statement said 
the secs twopage letter to the post which said the memos 
disclosure was unauthorized added that publication could injure 
outside of the judicial processes the reputation of persons who are 
either entit day in court or who are not alleged by the commission 
to have violated the federal securities laws and possibly to impede 
thessions ability to litigate 
but post managing editor leor said we feel that what we 
published is neodys rights 
in its editions friday the post again quo confidential sec memo 
the newspaper did not st to milken had told government 
investigators he fabricated trading losses in transactions 
boesky 
the sec memo was quoted as saying that milken aide charles 
thurnher admitted he fabricated a loss figure for a boesky 
investment in unocal corp common stock because he believed that 
boeskys bookkeeper had inflated boeskys losses from another 
transaction 
both of the transactions were part of billion payment from boesky 
to milken that the sec alleges was part of a secret stocktrading 
arrangement between the two men 
boesky once a leading speculator in the sf potential takeover 
targets stunned the financial community in november 1986 when he 
agreed to pay a thenrecord 100 million to settle sec civil insider 
trading charges 
he also struck a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in ris 
cooperation and is serving a threeyear prison sentence for 
conspiracy to lie to the sec

clothing merchants and department stores benefited from 
backtoschool shopping during august but mass merchandisers 
suffered as consumers generally remained hesitant about big 
purchases 
we saw good sales in the apparel department but many of the 
other departments show a cautious consumer walter loeb an 
analyst with morgan stanley amp co inc said thursday after the 
nations biggest retailers announced their august sales results 
consumers generally are in a strong financial position and are 
confident right now but their spending is drifting sideways 
agreed jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
consumers have cut back on purchases of what are called 
discretionary items as opposed to necessities such as food because 
of rising mortgage payments and other credit costs 
august sales are important because the month marks the beginning 
of the retailers most critical season shopping generally 
accelerates in midaugust as families prepare for the new school 
year and then continues to build through the holiday season when 
stores earn about half their annual profits 
economists track retail sales because the figures are a component 
consumer spending which in turn accounts for about twothirds of 
us economic activity 
consumer caution has hurt big general storeowners such as the 
nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co sears said its 
august sales were up 23 percent overall but sales at stores open 
at least a year known as samestore or comparablestore sales 
fell 11 percent 
retailers and analysts consider samestore sales a more accurate 
reflection of a companys performance than totals that include sales 
at recently opened stores 
another mass merchandiser k mart corp also had a disappointing 
august with overall sales up 48 percent and samestore sales up 
15 percent 
walmart stores inc the discount chain that consistently has 
outperformed its competitors said its overall sales jumped 26 
percent in august while comparablestore results rose 11 percent 
positive results at stores that specialize in apparel such as 
jc penney co inc were due largely to backtoschool shopping 
penney where sales have steadily improved in recent months 
following a prolonged slump reported a 171 percent surge in 
overall august sales while samestore sales increased 157 percent 
limited inc the nations biggest specialty apparel retailer 
reported an 11 percent increase in overall august sales and a 7 
percent jump in samestore sales 
department stores also had a good monthmay department stores co 
said its overall sales rose 96 last month and samestore sales grew 
65 percent 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said the 
improvement at the apparel and department stores was better than he 
had expected and the trend bodes well for retailers thirdquarter 
profits 
edelman meanwhile cautioned that some of the rosier sales 
reports looked stronger than they actually were because the figures

the chicago mercantile exchange whose 
selfpolicing practices are under federal scrutiny has suspended 
four traders and fined them a total of 450000 for alleged 
violations during the 1987 stock market crash 
two of the traders were suspended for two years and ordered to 
return 44500 each to customers who were allegedly cheated 
the traders are accused of making prearranged transactions of 
stockindex futures in violation of exchange rules 
they allegedly cheated their customers by executing their orders 
privately for their own enrichment instead of in the open auction 
of the mercs standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures trading pit 
none of the traders has admitted or denied the allegations 
the stiff penalties suggest that the merc the worlds 
secondlargest futures market is taking a tougher stand against 
wrongdoing in the face of intense scrutiny of the industrys 
selfpolicing 
federal prosecutors on aug 2 announced indictments for alleged 
trading fraud against 45 traders and one clerk at the merc and the 
chicago board of trade the next day leo melamed chairman of the 
mercs executive committee promised to instill the fear of god 
in any traders who think of stealing 
most complaints against traders are settled before they get to a 
fullblown hearing and the case against the four traders was headed 
in that direction until the federal investigation became known 
afterward the merc broadened its probe to include more trades 
and brought added charges against the two main targets 
traders albert v furman iii and patrick j shannon jr were 
suspended from exchange membership for two years and ordered to make 
restitution of 44500 each 
furman was fined 125000 by the exchange in addition to 
prearranged trading the exchange found furman guilty of failing to 
fully answer all questions during an investigation of his case 
furman previously had been fined 125000 suspended two months 
and ordered to pay 127500 restitution in connection with other 
alleged improper stockindex futures trades made during the week of 
oct 19 1987 
shannon was fined 225000 in addition to his suspension 
peter shannon patricks brother was fined 50000 and suspended 
from exchange membership for two months 
sidney l rabin was also fined 50000 and suspended from 
exchange membership for two months 
stockindex futures are contracts for future delivery of groups 
of stocks futures traders can use stockindex futures to hedge 
against losses on actual stock market investments or simply to 
speculate on the prices of the underlying stocks

a former partner in a prominent chicago law firm 
has been sentenced to five years in prison believed to be the 
longest term ever issued for illegal insider stock trading 
us district judge marvin aspen on thursday also ordered alfred 
elliott 45 a former law partner in schiff hardin amp waite to pay 
the government 332000 in fines and 353000 in profits he made 
from trading stocks based on inside information he obtained over a 
twoyear period 
you are a brilliant talented man who could have accomplished 
anything you wanted in the practice of law aspin told elliott 
before the sentencing but to accumulate money and stockpile it 
the way you did that kind of greed boggles the mind 
elliott was one of two lawyers at the firm who represented 
companies on imminent corporate mergers and acquisitions he was 
indicted last july and convicted later on 70 counts of using 
confidential information to buy and sell stock he reportedly made 
more than 600000 between march 1984 and april 1986 
elliott said he knew he had made a mistake and that he had tried 
to right the wrongs made against the law firm which he left in 1986 
after his actions became known 
i realize what i did was wrong it was crazy nuts elliott 
said i am a person of integrity and i really am sorry this 
happened 
elliotts attorney james streicker also had argued for leniency 
in the sentencing and compared his clients case to that of 
financier ivan f boesky the wall street speculator is serving a 
threeyear prison sentence for conspiracy to lie to the securities 
and exchange commission a sentence he received after striking a 
plea bargain with federal prosecutors in return for his cooperation 
boesky had agreed in 1986 to pay 100 million to settle insider 
trading charges filed by the sec 
for his part elliott paid more than 500000 in damages and 
repaid profits after insidertrading allegations in a 1986 civil 
case filed in federal court by the sec 
but aspen rejected the comparison of elliott to boesky and 
sentenced elliott to five years which the us attorneys office 
believes to be the stiffest sentence ever imposed in such a case

the government said today its chief economic 
forecasting gauge rose in july for the first time in three months 
further chasing away fears of a possible economic downturn 
the commerce department said its index of leading economic 
indicators rose a modest 02 percent in july after registering no 
gain in june and plunging by 13 percent in may the biggest drop 
since late 1987 following the stock market crash 
the small july increase in the index was in line with 
expectations of many analysts who believe growth should continue at 
a moderate pace for the rest of the year 
that view is a sharp reversal of the prevalent opinion just a 
month ago when weakness in the leading index and a variety of other 
government statistics had raised fears that the economy was about to 
topple into a recession 
but since that time the government has basically rewritten 
economic history issuing various revisions showing that everything 
from employment growth to consumer spending were stronger than 
originally believed 
the image we had of an economy on the verge of a recession has 
been changed by these revisions said bruce steinberg senior 
economist at the new york brokerage firm of merrill lynch 
economists are not forecasting that the country is on the verge 
of boom times but they are now much more confident that the longest 
peacetime recovery in us history currently in its seventh year 
should be able to continue for some time to come 
the leading index is a compilation of 11 forwardpointing 
business statistics designed to forecast economic performance three 
to nine months down the road 
in july five of the economic statistics showed signs of 
increasing strength five flashed weak signals and one was unchanged 
the biggest source of strength was a pickup in growth in the 
nations money supply the federal reserve which had been 
restraining monetary growth in an effort to fight inflationary 
pressures has now switched course and over the past two months has 
been loosening credit conditions 
economists believe this change in fed policy has already provided 
momentum for the economy in such key sectors as housing construction 
other sources of strength in july were a jump in consumer 
confidence a rise in stock prices an increase in plant and 
equipment orders and an increase in the backlog of unfilled 
manufacturing orders 
five indicators held back the overall increase the biggest 
negative factor was a decline in raw materials prices while this 
indicated lessening inflationary pressures it is read as a negative 
for the index because it can also signal lower demand other 
negative factors were a drop in orders for consumer goods an 
increase in weekly unemployment claims a fall in building permits 
and changes in business delivery times 
one indicator the length of the work week showed no change from 
june to july 
the various changes left the index at 1440 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 
the bush administration is projecting that the overall economy 
will grow at an annual rate of 29 percent this year that growth 
target can be achieved even if the economy slows in the second half 
of the year from the 32 percent annual rate of first six months of 
1989 
many analysts are looking for a modest slowing of growth but 
nothing close to a recession 
david berson said he expected the rate of growth would slow 
slightly in the julyseptember quarter primarily because auto 
companies are working to reduce a high inventory of unsold cars but 
he said he expected the year would end on a strong note once 
inventories are trimmed

the nations unemployment rate remained at 52 
percent in august as the resurgent economy created more than 200000 
jobs the government reported today 
the labor departments official figure for nonfarm payroll 
expansion last month was 110000 jobs but strikes reduced the job 
totals by about 108000 meaning that without the walkouts the 
newjob total would have been some 218000 
the government also revised its july job growth figure upward to 
184000 from 169000 a sign the economy continues to expand at a 
pace that will keep it out of recession in the short term 
the unemployment report is the first comprehensive look at 
economic performance in august and the numbers bolster recent 
predictions that the recordlong expansion seems in no danger of 
ending 
in another goodnews report issued this morning the commerce 
department id the index of leading economic indicators the chief 
economic forecasting gauge rose in july for the first time in three 
months the july gain of 02 percent followed no change in june and 
a plunge of 13 percent in may 
the reports came on the heels of a revised report on the gross 
national product that said the economy grew at an annual rate of 27 
percent in the second quarter of 1989 up from the 17 percent rate 
in a preliminary report 
the government said the number of americans who were looking for 
work but could not find jobs fell by a modest 76000 last month to 
642 million more than 1175 million americans had jobs an 
increase of 138000 from july 
the official jobgrowth numbers were skewed by several 
strikerelated developments about 130000 telephone workers were 
out on strike while about 20000 coal miners returned to work after 
walkouts 
strikes affect the data because the job totals are taken from a 
government survey of businesses and strikers are not counted as 
being on payrolls but strikes do not affect the unemployment rate 
because that statistic is taken from a separate household survey in 
which strikers are considered to still have jobs 
the new job growth was predominantly in the serviceproducing 
sector which added nearly 70000 jobs that number would have been 
higher in a normal month because the telephone workers fall into the 
service portion of the economy 
manufacturing and construction posted modest gains in august of 
11000 and 8000 jobs respectively 
the manufacturing total showed slight job declines in some areas 
including furniture and lumber products but a gain of 25000 in 
auto manufacturing a sign that carmakers called back some of the 
workers laid off because of sluggish sales 
wage data in the report should prove encouraging to inflation 
watchers although perhaps discouraging to workers 
the government said average hourly earnings were essentially 
unchanged last month actually falling by a tiny fraction after 
rising 07 percent from june to july for the year ending in august 
average hourly wages were up 39 percent the government said well 
below the pace of consumer inflation 
the report also showed a slight reduction in factory activity 
with the average manufacturing work week dropping 01 hour to 409 
hours average factory overtime dropped by the same amount to 39 
hours a week 
the report adds to recent strong economic data showing that the 
economy continues to grow and at a somewhat stronger pace since the 
federal reserce eased its hold on credit after a march 19881989 
tightening designed to keep inflation in check 
we are looking at an economy that is stronger than people had 
thought merrill lynch analyst bruce steinberg said in advance of 
the report one report after another has shown more strength 
there were no dramatic shifts in the unemployment rate among 
demographic groups last month although the rates for blacks overall 
and black men in particular rose 
here are the august unemployment rates for the groups listed in 
the labor departments report compared with july 
adult white men 38 percent unchanged from july 
adult white women 41 percent down from 43 percent 
white teenagers 127 percent down from 134 percent 
blacks 111 percent up from 109 percent 
adult black men 98 percent up from 93 percent 
adult black women 94 percent down from 99 percent 
black teenagers 334 percent up from 331 percent 
hispanics 90 percent unchanged 
in a separate calculation that includes military personnel 
stationed in the united states the labor department said the 
unemployment rate was 51 percent down from julys 52 percent

four oil paintings a grand piano a 
jacuzzi and vintage wine and champagne are among the items at marvin 
warners horse farm that will be sold to pay off creditors of his 
failed home state bank 
ronald mowrey spent two days this week taking inventory of 
property at warners lush 600acre farm just east of cincinnati in 
clermont county mowrey is to oversee sale of the farm and contents 
under supervision of the us bankruptcy court in jacksonville fla 
the creditors sued warner after the march 1985 collapse of 
cincinnatibased home state warner 70 was convicted on ohio 
felony charges after the collapse but is appealing the convictions 
home states collapse triggered a statewide thrift crisis 
mowrey said he believes he will have warners farm and household 
furnishings assessed and ready for auction or private sale 
whichever will bring in the most money within 30 to 40 days 
the property also includes antique tables and chairs crystal 
wine glasses exercise equipment an antique hat stand leather 
chairs and a fur rug along with less exotic washers and dryers and 
vacuum cleaners 
there are also 30 to 40 head of cattle and a bull on the farm he 
said 
there is a real air of sadness there mowrey said wednesday 
there are pictures of the family and the children on the tables 
there are pictures of them growing up doing things as a family it 
has a real ring of sadness 
mowrey a lawyer and former fbi agent from jacksonville took 
control of warners assets after us bankruptcy judge george 
proctor changed warners proceedings last month from a chapter 11 to 
a chapter 7 action under which assets are sold to satisfy 
creditors claims 
warners creditors have claimed they are owed more than 3 
billion 
the farm called warnerton will be sold separately mowrey said 
one buyer has offered 4 million for about 400 of the 600 acres if 
appraisers think this is fair to the creditors the offer will be 
accepted mowrey said 
the dozens of thoroughbred horses that once grazed the pastures 
are gone creditors lawyers say most of the horses were apparently 
transferred to warners son marvin warner jr who owns a horse 
farm in lexington ky 
mowrey said he will make a similar inventory and assessment of 
warners newer 400acre horse farm in ocala fla next week under 
floridas homestead law a person in bankruptcy proceedings cannot 
be deprived of his home even to pay creditors a debtor is allowed 
up to 160 acres outside a city as a home exemption unless the 
court decrees otherwise 
warners creditors contend he improperly spent money which should 
have gone to his creditors to buy stock and furnish his ocala 
property they are asking that the court disallow the farm as an 
exemption 
warner has asked proctor to change his proceedings to a chapter 
12 action which would exempt warner from forced liquidation by 
labeling him a farmer a chapter 12 action is designed to protect 
farmers from foreclosure 
mowrey said the decision will be up to the judge but said his 
examination has convinced him warner probably would not qualify as a 
farmer 
mowrey said he estimates warner has assets of between 3 million 
to 40 million far short of what creditors are seeking warner in 
court papers filed in the early 1980s declared his worth at between 
85 million and 100 million

percent share in a flour mill in el salvador 
neither side would discuss the terms of the transaction or size

since acquiring minneapolisbased pillsbury early this year 
londonbased grand met has been selling off pillsbury subsidiaries 
that dont fit its longterm strategies the divestitures also help

it may have been so small they found it not worth keeping or 
developing said l craig carver a securities analyst with dain 
bosworth 
since venezuela has been plagued by such problems as the collapse 
in the price of oil a staggering national debt uncontrolled 
inflation a weak currency and social unrest its troubles made 
pillsburys operations there unpredictable from a financial 
standpoint said marlene johnson a public relations official with 
pillsbury 
but essentially we decided they didnt fit our longterm 
stragegy johnson said 
cargill the privately held grain giant based in wayzata west of

venezuela 
we feel that that country is taking some sound steps to correct

the internal revenue service has proposed settling 
nelson bunker and carolyn hunts back tax bill for about 200 
million less than onethird of the 700 million the government 
originally sought 
grover hartt iii attorney representing the irs in the hunts 
bankruptcy case said thursday he had proposed the 200 million 
settlement to his superiors in washington dc 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson thursday gave attorneys for 
bunker and his wife 30 days to hammer out details of the settlement 
with the irs 
the agreement in principle is a breakthrough in the nearly 
yearold bankruptcy negotiations of bunker hunt whose financial 
troubles stem in part from a scheme by hunt and his brother william 
herbert hunt to control the silver market in 1979 and 1980 
hunt and his wife filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last 
september to defend themselves from a string of lawsuits and claims 
for back taxes interest and penalties arising in part from the 
silver scheme 
we are proposing to settle because we feel it is in the 
governments best interest economically hartt said the 
rationale is it is economically beneficial to get 80 percent of 100 
today than it is to get 100 percent of 50 a year from now 
russell l munsch attorney for bunker hunt declined to discuss 
terms of the deal saying that is still in negotiations 
the decision to settle the case comes one week after testimony in 
the 300 million tax trial involving bunker and his brothers 
william herbert and lamar was completed in washington dc 
us tax court judge jules g korner iii isnt expected to rule 
in that case before february 1990 
if the irs settles bunker and herberts tax liability before a 
judgment is rendered in the 1982 tax trial it could mean that the 
tax trial was a futile effort said michael henke attorney who 
represented both brothers 
henke asked that the tax court ruling be expedited he said the 
case has cost the hunts about 35 million in attorneys fees and 
expenses 
under an order issued by the bankruptcy judge thursday creditors 
will be allowed to file competing reorganization plans in bunkers 
bankruptcy case beginning oct 1 until then creditors have to base 
their negotiations for debt repayment on the hunts reorganization 
plan 
the settlement being discussed between bunker and the irs would 
be similar to that already proposed in the bankruptcy of herbert and 
his wife nancy the irs says the couple owes 300 million in back 
taxes 
the irs contends the two brothers owe the agency a combined total 
of 1 billion in back taxes but has agreed to settle herberts case 
for about 150 million and bunkers for about 200 million 
in bunkers case the irs would receive 80 percent of a 
liquidating trust or about 110 million the agency would also get a 
90 million nondischargeable to be paid out of gifts inheritances 
and future income after bunker and his wife emerge from bankruptcy 
the couple would be allowed to keep their home and certain personal 
belongings hartt said

aztec tribesmen were such fanatics about 
their game of patolli they would gamble anything from corn fields to 
families in order to win this ancient version of you bet your 
life 
three albuquerque men who have fashioned an update of the game on 
an 18inch by 18inch board are wagering mere money about 60000 
so far in their gamble that it will be a big seller 
the odds are about one in 1000 that board games will be a 
financial success says mike kimball a graphics artist at the 
albuquerque journal who with friends phil white and jim franchell 
designed a modernday patolli which means game of the mat and 
sells for 2995 in specialty game stores 
kimball says his father richard kimball a writer in prescott 
ariz was doing research for an article when he came across a 
reference to patolli about three years ago 
he suggested to us that it might be interesting to play but he 
could find no records of rules or anything just accounts by 
spaniards mike kimball says 
we decided to come up with some rules we felt maintained the 
spirit of the thing he says we kept refining it until we had a 
real playable game and we decided it would be a good thing to put on 
the market 
modernday patolli players compete to be the first to maneuver 
four game pieces around the padded vinyl playing mat to a center 
pyramid they must avoid capture while wagering precious stones the 
winner gets a pot of golden tiger eyes the most valued stones of 
all 
the players must know which stones to move when to block and for 
how long when to bargain with a captive what kind of bets to make 
but the strategy can change with a roll of the five wooden dice 
bare on one side one to five dots on the flip side 
the playing stones are polished red jasper black obsidian 
turquoise howlite and white quartz a throwback to the pebbles that 
aztec players used 
betting cards outline payoffs on four different bets cortez 
boast montezumas fate omen of the days and so speak the gods 
aztecs would wager just about anything they were so into 
gambling theyd wager jewels capes theyd wager their farms 
their kids their wives and occasionally themselves kimball says 
theyd put up their lives for a certain amount of money if 
they paid the guy back there would be no problem he says if 
they couldnt pay the guy back within a certain amount of time 
theyd become a slave to that personor they would be sacrificed 
but a slave is a pretty valuable thing and you wouldnt just waste 
him 
the playing mat developed by kimball and partners is rimmed on 
each side with 20 aztec day signs such as the alligator deer dog 
vulture wind house jaguar or death 
the mat has a series of squares shaped like a cross on which 
playing pieces are moved 
the cross shape was used by the aztecs on their mats and 
represented to them the universe and the four seasons of life 
birth and spring in the east adulthood and summer in the south 
autumn and old age in the west and winter and death in the north 
kimball says although he and his partners did not know the exact 
rules of the aztec game they were intrigued by its gambling aspects 
we played other games like parchisi and go but this 
incorporates gambling and it became a lot more exciting kimball 
says once we refined the whole idea of the game we decided it 
would make a good game to massproduce 
the partners had their mats printed and contacted other suppliers 
for game components the first run of 2000 games was produced in 
1988 and most are sold 
worldwide games a mailorder company in colchester conn has 
ordered 240 patollis to be featured in its 1990 catalogue kimball 
says other specialty stores have ordered samples 
individual orders for patolli have come from spokane wash to 
west peabody mass from japan to england to canada some european 
game merchants also have expressed intense interest kimball says 
according to them this is exactly what european yuppies are 
looking for

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade with 
some of the selling reflecting an easing of frost fears in corn and 
soybean country 
soybean futures had run up sharply thursday after at least one 
private weather forecasting firm predicted patchy frost in some 
parts of the midwest late next week but many other private 
meteorological firms issued frostfree forecasts this morning 
overnight rainfall in much of the corn belt added to the selling 
pressure on ideas that the moisture may improve soybean yields 
and an increase in farmer selling of corn was an additional drag 
on the corn market 
wheat futures were mostly higher in moderate trading partly in 
reaction to news of an increase in export sales of wheat last week 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 388 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with september at 233 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cent lower with september at 134 a bushel 
soybeans were cent to 2 cents lower with september at 587 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 13 cent lower to 08 cent higher with october 
at 7362 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent to 15 cent 
lower with september at 8257 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent 
to 35 cent lower with october at 4035 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were unchanged to 45 cent higher with february at 4430 
cents a pound 
cattle futures settled mixed on thursday while pork futures

six months after eastern airlines filed for 
bankruptcy protection analysts are optimistic that bondholders and 
other creditors of the troubled carrier wont get burnt 
easterns creditors are coming out better than they probably 
would have expected at the start of the bankruptcy said philip 
baggaley who follows the airline for standard amp poors corp a 
credit rating agency 
eastern appears well on its way toward selling assets as proposed 
under its reorganization plan added analyst robert decker of duff amp 
phelps inc a chicago investment research firm 
i give eastern a pretty good chance of being able to meet their 
object that theyve been stating that theyll be able to pay off 
their debt holders in full decker said this past week 
eastern owes about 35 billion to creditors including 
bondholders banks ticketholders fuel suppliers and equipment 
trust certificate holders 
a crippling strike march 4 virtually grounded the texas air corp 
division and five days later it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization since then it gradually has been rebuilding its 
flight schedule 
it also has been selling assets to raise cash such as its 
northeast shuttle service which went to developer donald trump for 
365 million 
eastern said last week that its rebuilding plan is going better 
than expected and that the carrier may not sell the full 18 
billion in assets envisioned under its original rebuilding plan 
among the assets no longer up for sale are its valuable south 
american routes 
however since it has not sold as many assets eastern said it 
may not have the cash to make as many prepayments on debt as it 
expected 
among easterns debts are 39 million in industrial revenue 
bonds which financed construction of airport facilities used by 
eastern about 200 million in subordinated debentures and more 
than 700 million in equipment trust certificates which financed 
aircraft purchases all these securities are publicly traded 
recently holders of 63 million in eastern equipment trust 
certificates were paid in full when the certificates issuer ge 
capital corp decided to redeem them early now ge capital will 
receive payments from eastern for use of the jets sampp said 
sampps baggaley said the early redemption of the certificates 
which was allowed because of easterns bankruptcy filing 
indicates that ge capital feels that theyre going to continue to 
get their rental payments its at a high lease rate and ge decided 
they wanted it all for themselves 
raymond neidl an analyst at the new york brokerage dillon read 
amp co inc said eastern has been making interest payments on its 
remaining equipment trust certificates but the creditors have no 
recourse if it stops 
these certificates unlike the ge capital ones do not allow the 
certificate holders to repossess the planes should eastern stop 
making payments 
owners of easterns subordinated debt havent fared as well as 
the certificate holders eastern has halted interest payments on 
these convertible securities 
but all is not gloomy here the price of these debentures which 
dropped when the carrier filed for bankruptcy rebounded sharply as 
it became more likely that eastern would pay off its creditors in 
full neidl said 
nobodys been really hurt so far he said the prices of 
all issues have moved up very strongly 
he said investors holding eastern debt certificates may win no 
matter how the airlines saga ends 
if easterns reorganization goes as planned and it emerges as a 
profitable carrier the price of the debt issues will continue to 
rise should easterns plans go awry creditors need not worry 
because the carriers assets would fetch enough at auction to cover 
its debts 
neidl also was optimistic about easterns future but he said 
recent comments by texas air chairman frank lorenzo that he may sell 
all or part of continental airlines the holding companys other 
airline unit complicate the picture 
should he sell a partial stake the cash could be funneled to 
eastern to help it pay off debt but if continental is sold 
outright eastern may not survive as an independent carrier and it 
could be put up for sale or liquidated the analyst said 
i dont think eastern could make it on its own he said

a work force crisis will cripple the united 
states ability to compete internationally without immediate steps 
to improve the education training and efficiency of us workers 
says a report submitted today to labor secretary elizabeth dole 
at a news conference where mrs dole officially received the 
report the secretary said the problems in the work force require 
the attention of business labor government and private citizens 
the skills of our work force have not kept pace with the more 
complex jobs of today mrs dole said this skills gap must be 
bridged if our remarkable economic expansion is to continue and if 
we are to succeed in the evermorecompetitive global marketplace 
the report was produced by the commission on workforce quality 
and labor market efficiency created in 1988 by mrs doles 
predecessor ann mclaughlin 
commission chairman richard f schubert who was also at the news 
conference at the state of illinois center warned that the united 
states is already facing a lack of skilled workers and an excess of 
unskilled workers as predicted in a 1987 report prepared for the 
labor department 
when we started the commissions work last summer i think most 
of us had hoped to identify two or three major initiatives that 
would produce immediate broadgauge improvements in work force 
quality said schubert since that time however we have come 
to the realization that there are no simple easy solutions 
the commissions 44 recommendations cover three broad fronts 
improving education for young people providing lifetime education 
and training for workers and improving productivity and efficiency 
by providing more help to working parents and developing a system to 
better match workers with jobs 
schubert a former president of bethlehem steel and the american 
red cross said some of the recommendations would cost the federal 
government more money including increased spending for childcare 
and job training programs and tax breaks to individuals and 
businesses that invest in education and training 
we are aware of the other urgent issues calling for financial 
support schubert said but he added i believe we are going to 
have to make very substantial increases in the investments we make 
in our people and in our work force

iran is demanding 15 billion in 
compensation from japans mitsui conglomerate for its abandonment of 
a petrochemical plant in southern iran the official islamic 
republic news agency reported friday 
the news agency monitored in nicosia quoted ahmad rahgozar 
head of the national petrochemical co as telling the daily 
newspaper kayhan that japan had offered a friendly settlement 
and that he hoped the dispute would be solved shortly 
there was no immediate comment from a mitsui delegation that has 
been in iran since sunday in an effort to settle the problem 
iranian officials have warned that the issue might jeopardize 
japanese business interests in iran as the country launches a 
multibilliondollar reconstruction program after a ceasefire that 
halted the eightyear gulf war with iraq last year 
iran claimed earlier this month that the giant japanese 
conglomerate had offered to pay 125 billion after pulling out from 
the project but that the figure was rejected as too low 
mitsui and japans international trade ministry denied the 
report a mitsui official said a compensation package was being 
discussed but that the final figure would be well below the sum 
mentioned 
the plant was 85 percent completed before the gulf war broke out 
in september 1980 the japanese halted work on it october 1984 after 
the plant was badly damaged in iraqi air raids

china has set up a special commission to tackle 
the increasingly serious problem of factories failing to pay 
debts and taxes the official china daily said friday 
the report said the team to be headed by finance minister wang 
bingqian will seek to assist enterprises in repaying debts that 
have risen to 1085 billion yuan or about 293 billion at current 
exchange rates 
wang told the first meeting of the commission that defaults in 
the staterun business sector have risen rapidly this year 
disrupting the economy and interfering with the state budget 
li guixian governor of the peoples bank of china was quoted by 
the daily as saying defaults had intensified the acute shortage of 
funds and reduced factories working capital 
it said the governments austerity policies which have reduced 
construction projects and cut back on available credit and the 
refusal of some firms to pay taxes are reasons for the default 
problem 
li said that in the coming months banks will provide loans to 
companies with sound economic records to help clear their debts 
the daily said that as of the end of june chinas industrial and 
commercial banks had already provided loans to clear 8 billion yuan 
bank experts say many companies with large stockpiles of raw 
materials and products must also strive to move their stocks in 
order to pay their debts the daily said 
the report said the daqing oil and chemical factory one of 
chinas largest enterprises had been seriously affected by defaults 
from subsidiary companies it said that by the end of july 1100 
companies were in arrears by 300 million yuan to the factory 
wang in a gloomy report to the national peoples congress 
chinas parliament on thursday said government subsidies for 
inefficient stateowned industries have ballooned in recent years 
the government now pays an estimated 40 billion yuan a year to 
subsidize moneylosing enterprises

fujisawa pharmaceutical co announced friday it is 
acquiring lyphomed inc for about 670 million the first major 
acquisition of a us drug company by a japanese pharmaceutical 
maker 
we believe the merger of lyphomed and our us operations will 
further strengthen our position in the us and will allow fujisawa 
to compete more effectively in world markets dr tomokichiro 
fujisawa president of the osaka japanbased company said in a 
statement released by the two companies 
fujisawa has owned nearly 30 percent of lyphomed about 9 
million of the companys 299 million common shares since october 
1986 according to lyphomed spokeswoman melissa marsden 
the 3187ashare purchase price exceeds fujisawas 31ashare 
offer last week for lyphomed based in the chicago suburb of 
rosemont the final figure represents an alltime high for lyphomed 
shares which are traded over the counter 
ms marsden put the purchase price at approximately 670 million 
which includes conversion of the companys preferred stock 
the merger should be completed april 1 the companies said 
dr john n kapoor lyphomeds chairman said the new merged 
organization has the potential to be a worldwide leader 
we eagerly anticipate building on our past achievements and 
contributing lyphomeds many talents as part of fujisawas team 
kapoor said in the statement 
kapoor owns about 14 percent of lyphomeds stock a stake he had 
previously agreed to sell to fujisawa once lyphomeds board approved 
a buyout 
this is the first major acquisition ever of a us drug company 
by a japanese drug company said john boettiger first vice 
president of rotanmosle inc a houston securities firm i think 
its a good deal for both companies 
fujisawa sells pills primarily and lyphomed is the largest 
provider of intravenous drugs to hospitals boettiger said 
the buzz word in health care is combination therapy and this 
allows either company to provide both intravenous and oral 
medicine 
fujisawa is the largest researchbased drug company in japan 
boettiger said its sales for the fiscal year ended march 1 were 
146 billion 
the deal will give fujisawa access to lyphomeds us sales 
network which already markets about 400 products to more than 95 
percent of us hospitals he said 
lyphomed enjoyed explosive growth in the mid1980s particularly 
after it became the only company federally licensed to make 
pentamidine a drug used to treat aidsrelated pneumonia 
overall sales soared from 4 million in 1981 to 172 million in 
1987 
but the company ran into hard times last year after the us food 
and drug administration uncovered qualitycontrol problems at 
several lyphomed plants lyphomed lost 211 million in 1988 
lyphomed has since shuffled top management and posted a profit of 
105000 on revenues of 717 million in the first six months of 
1989 boettiger said that lyphomeds future prospects looked good 
particularly since the company received fda approval last month to 
open its new plant in puerto rico

when banking assistant barbara devahl 
takes her 4yearold daughter erin to public kindergarten starting 
this week shell go to work a few feet away 
ms devahls employer first bank system has donated space for 
downtown kindergarten part of st pauls municipal school system 
its a combination of school and day care aimed at recruiting 
parents with young children 
the school district needs space the corporation needs 
employees who hang around it really helps with turnover and the 
youngsters really need a quality education and parental involvement 
in that education said barbara roy a first bank assistant vice 
president 
only a few employers nationwide have embraced this degree of 
responsibility in the education and care of their workers young 
children but more businesses are looking at such arrangements 
largely because of the changing workforce and in particular the 
growing number of working mothers 
fiftyseven percent of all women with children under 6 years old 
are in the workforce double the percentage in 1970 us census 
bureau figures show a department of labor study last year showed 
the fastest rate of increase among working mothers are those with 
toddlers under age 2 
ms devahl said one of the biggest advantages to the first bank 
arrangement is that she wont have to worry about transporting her 
daughter from kindergarten to day care during the middle of the 
workday 
thats one problem first bank wanted to eliminate for employees 
when it donated the space to the school district there are other 
benefits too 
im really looking forward to having lunch with my daughter 
mrs devahl said 
since her husband works downtown the family can commute 
together i think it will give us a little bit more relaxed 
time she said 
bank officials are aggressively promoting the downtown 
kindergarten as it will be known until parents and students rename 
it as a recruitment tool 
we also knew that kindergarten is a particularly tricky year 
for making childcare arrangements because of the children being in 
school part day and then needing some other kind of a program roy 
said 
school superintendent david bennett who has been a supporter of 
workplace schools agreed 
for children its very disruptive at a young age to have to 
adjust to family life and school life and day care you begin to 
wonder who the stable and predictable adult in your life is 
bennett said 
once kindergarten is completed every day children will remain at 
the site for day care which will cost 75 a week for 4yearolds 
and 70 a week for 5yearolds public aid defrays the cost for 
lowincome families 
roy was instrumental in establishing the combined kindergarten 
and daycare program in 1986 and 1987 she headed a local task 
force that worked to expand childcare availability in st paul 
children of first banks employees will have priority in 
enrollment but at least two children of nonbank employees have 
enrolled spaces were offered to other downtown employees to help 
fill the class 
st paul public school officials who have modeled the program 
after a similar one in dade county fla have sent letters to 10 
large local corporations encouraging them to consider donating space 
for kindergartens and expanded daycare for their own employees 
children bennett said 
i think they really are going to put their very best energy 
into having this work out because the spotlight is on it roy said 
just west of minneapolis wayzata public school officials are 
trying to persuade trammel crow co a commercial real estate 
developer to set aside space in another office tower planned at the 
carlson center for a similar program in a recent survey of tenants 
100 employees said they would be interested in enrolling their 
children in a similar program said james brandl the community 
education director for wayzata schools 
will hoeg a trammel crow executive said hes interested in the 
idea as a tenant recruitment tool its just one of those things 
that makes you feel good about doing were potentially helping out 
our future generation hoeg said 
thomas schultz project director for early childhood education at 
the national association of state boards of education in alexandria 
va said hes unsure whether the idea will catch on that quickly 
but he endorsed first bank program it seems to me any 
arrangement that provides a service that offers continuity to the 
kids in terms of the day experience they haveis great as an 
example of creativity

soybean futures gave up most of the previous

dow jones amp co said friday it is preparing to 
put an overthecounter market stock into its transportation average 
because a wave of mergers and buyouts is making it impossible to 
find enough big transport companies on the new york stock exchange 
it would be the first time any of the three dow jones averages 
industrials utilities and transportations has included a stock 
that was not traded on the new york stock exchange 
ual corp could be the next nyse stock to disappear from the dow 
jones average of 20 transportation stocks ual parent of united 
airlines has received a 619 billion bid from investor marvin 
davis a joint bid of more than 65 billion from uniteds pilots 
union management and british airways also reportedly was being 
formulated 
the overthecounter market is a network of dealers that trades 
issues by computer over phone lines without any central exchange 
overthecounter companies generally are smaller than those listed 
on the new york stock exchange and many are regarded as more 
speculative because they have not had the opportunity to establish 
records as seasoned businesses 
preparations for adding an overthecounter stock have been going 
on at least since january but have gained urgency with the dealings 
over ual 
were not going to do this until we have to do it but we 
wanted to make sure people were prepared for it said dan hinson 
an assistant managing editor at dow jones wall street journal in 
a week united could be gone 
yellow freight system inc and roadway services inc are among 
the overthecounter candidates to replace the next nyse stock that 
drops out said charles stabler an editorial consultant to dow 
jones 
the industry body that oversees overthecounter trading welcomed 
dow jones decision 
this is just another example and testimonial to the stocks that 
trade in nasdaq said john t wall executive vice president for 
marketing and market services at the washingtonbased national 
association of securities dealers 
at the new york stock exchange spokeswoman sharon gamsin said 
that while mergers and acquisitions have taken away some stocks the 
nyses total listings were at a record level 
seven stocks have dropped out of the dow jones average of 20 
transportation stocks and been replaced since the end of 1986 
twa dropped out in october 1988 when its chairman and owner carl 
icahn took the company private most recently nwa parent of 
northwest airlines dropped out in july when it was bought by a 
group led by investor alfred checchi 
the transportation average traces its origins to 1884 when dow 
jones amp co began occasionally reporting on an index of 11 
representative stocks most of which were railroad companies in 
1897 the company began separate indexes for railroad and industrial 
stocks 
the railroad average was renamed the transportation average in 
1970 to reflect its changing composition it now consists mainly of 
airlines trucking companies and a handful of railroads

the industrial side of the us economy continued 
to weaken during august and a growth index fell to its lowest level 
since the economic expansion began in late 1982 the nations 
corporate purchasing managers said friday 
but many economists said they werent concerned about a possible 
recession noting that inflation remains under control and other 
economic indicators point to continued growth 
the government said friday that august unemployment held steady 
at 52 percent with the creation of more than 200000 new nonfarm 
jobs excluding the effects of phone strikes 
in other reports the government said construction spending 
inched up 002 percentage point in july and the index of leading 
economic indicators rose a modest 02 percentage point in july 
the purchasing managers index a widely watched barometer of the 
economys direction fell to 452 percent last month from 46 percent 
in july that was the lowest reading since december 1982 the month 
after the beginning of the current economic expansion 
a reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing 
sector of the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent 
indicates growth according to the national association of 
purchasing management 
robert j bretz chairman of the associations business survey 
committee said all major indicators of the manufacturing sector 
pointed down in august 
a measure of production growth fell for the second consecutive 
month to its lowest level in more than 6 years new orders also 
declined but at a lesser rate than in july inventories fell for an 
eighth consecutive month as purchasers adjusted to slowing 
production and new orders 
the bright spot on the economic horizon continues to be 
relatively strong exports and sharply decreasing inflation said 
bretz who also is director of materials management at pitney bowes 
inc 
of the 67 percent of the purchasing executives exporting 23 
percent reported better export orders up from 22 percent who said 
so in july according to the survey 
it also said prices fell in august the third consecutive monthly 
decline with purchasing executives finding 29 out of 38 selected 
commodities lower in price up from 21 in july 
all this says the economy is growing but its slowing said 
robert a brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities co 
international inc the weakness in the manufacturing sector is 
very pronounced 
brusca said the federal reserve may soon be forced to ease its 
credit policies by lowering interest rates a bit to keep the 
economy moving that sentiment helped push bond prices sharply 
higher friday which in turn gave the stock market a boost 
but while some economists expressed concern about the economys 
future others painted a less gloomy picture 
we may have a pocket of weakness in the manufacturing sector 
but weve seen recent indications that show the consumer is alive 
and well and spending money said elizabeth g reiners a money 
market economist for dean witter reynolds inc and thats keeping 
the economy going 
she noted the government recently reported that new home sales 
surged 144 percent in july the fastest pace in three years 
because interest rates had been dropping in recent weeks 
here are some details from the august purchasing managers report 
the index of manufacturing production fell to 465 percent down 
from 483 percent in july that was the lowest since a reading of 44 
percent in december 1982 
new orders declined for the third consecutive month however 
the new orders index stood at 451 percent up slightly from 448 
percent in july 
inventories fell for an eighth straight month to 433 percent 
from 455 percent in july 
the pace of vendor deliveries quickened with the index at 449 
percent vs 469 percent even though slightly more commodities were 
in short supply 
an employment index stood at 447 percent up slightly from 444 
percent in july 
the monthly report is based on replies to questions asked of 
purchasing executives in more than 250 industrial companies the 
index is a composite of five separate indicators including new 
orders production vendor deliveries inventories and employment

stock prices pushed higher today but trading 
slowed ahead of the long labor day weekend 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials posted another alltime 
high 
the stock market benefited from strength in the bond market and 
futuresrelated program buying with traders engaging in maneuvers 
aimed at profiting from the differences between prices of 
stockindex futures and actual stocks 
a collection of economic reports out today were open to varying 
interpretations but on balance the markets reacted favorably to 
the figures 
bonds sported big gains after an abbreviated preholiday session 
helped by a bullish response to the august survey from the nations 
purchasing managers the national association of purchasing 
management said its monthly poll showed lingering weakness in the 
industrial side of the economy 
the bond market initially sold off in reaction to a report on the 
job market that suggested the economy is growing at a moderate rate 
making the threat of recession seem more remote and the chances of 
interest rate declines less likely 
the labor department said the nations unemployment rate remained 
at 52 percent in august nonfarm payrolls expanded by 110000 a 
total that was reduced by about 108000 due to strikes 
a separate commerce department report pointed to a possible 
rebound in momentum after months of sluggish economic activity 
earlier this year the index of leading economic indicators rose a 
modest 02 percent in july after registering no gain in june and 
plunging by 13 percent in may the biggest drop since late 1987

the president of cie industrielle said friday he 
does not plan to fend of an unwelcome takeover bid for the insurance 
holding company with a formal counteroffer 
but jeanmarc vernes indicated he will continue the fight against 
cie financiere de suez a financial holding company whose 36 
billion bid is the largest ever on the french market 
in an interview on french radio vernes said he had two main 
reasons for deciding against a formal counterbid the cost and a 
concern that overt hostility could jeopardize approval for cie 
industrielles purchase of the insurance group colonia versicherung 
ag 
under french stock exchange rules a counteroffer would have to 
be at least 5 percent more than the suez offer 
vernes also alleged that suez had offered him 2424 a share for 
his cie industrielle interests before it launched its takeover bid 
in the market for 1970 a share 
suez said later it challenges vernes allegations in a brief 
statement it said the price offered to vernes in private 
discussions was coherent with the proposed 1970 tender given 
technical details of the payment it did not elaborate 
fridays announcement by vernes leaves the road clear for suez to 
pursue its takeover bid 
the cie industrielle president left his defensive strategy 
unclear he said however that he has asked for an investigation 
into heavy orders for the groups stock that blocked efforts to 
trade on the bourse last week 
vernes said he was ready to negotiate a solution with suez 
although he stipulated that he is prepared to do so only on the 
condition that he retains control of cie industrielle 
suez already has 1847 percent of cie industrielle and 32 
percent of groupe victoire cie industrielle in turn holds 40 
percent of groupe victoire the tender offer by suez is scheduled to 
expire on sept 18

bond prices surged higher friday boosted by a 
report that suggested a possible slowdown in manufacturing 
release of the report by the national association of purchasing 
management helped wipe out losses the market suffered earlier in the 
session in response to a strongerthanexpected employment report 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 1316 point or about 
813 per 1000 face amount while its yield slumped to 812 
percent from 819 percent late thursday 
trading was light and ended early ahead of the threeday labor 
day weekend 
bond prices fell in early trading after the labor department 
reported that the unemployment rate remained at 52 percent in 
august and that a resurgent economy had created more than 200000 
new jobs 
the prospect of a vigorous economy dashed traders hopes that the 
federal reserve would relax credit allowing interest rates to fall 
and bond prices to rise 
but prices roared back after release of the purchasing managers 
index which is compiled from a survey of purchasing executives in 
industrial companies the index fell to 452 percent in august from 
46 percent in july reaching its lowest level since december 1982 
a reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of 
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent indicates 
growth 
the report suggested that both manufacturing activity and 
prices at the producer level are going to be quite weak going 
ahead said ward mccarthy a managing director of stone amp mccarthy 
research associates inc 
but the markets reaction to the purchasing managers survey 
confounded some analysts william sullivan director of money market 
research for dean witter reynolds inc said traders should have 
paid more attention to the unemployment data 
the purchasing managers report is an extremely narrow snapshot 
of the manufacturing sector in contrast to employment which is a 
broadbased picture of the us economy including the service 
financial and other industries sullivan said 
the bottom line of the employment report is that the fed policy 
is on hold he said 
however robert brusca chief economist with nikko securities co 
international inc found weakness in the unemployment report 
noting among other things that it showed a decline in worker hours 
brusca also said there was evidence of a slowing economy in other 
recent statistics including thursdays government report that 
factory orders fell 17 percent in july 
i think the reaction to the unemployment report today in some 
sense was on target he said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues picked up point to point intermediate 
maturities were up between 1332 point and point and longerterm 
issues rose 2132 point according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with

the food and drug administration said friday it 
is investigating a 1982 incident in which the maker of a generic 
version of an antipsychotic drug substituted samples of another 
companys brandname version for testing 
the incident involved bolar pharmaceutical co inc of copiague 
ny one of 11 companies being investigated by the fda for problems 
ranging from manufacturing irregularities to fraud the company is 
one of the nations largest drug manufacturers 
the disclosure came less than a week after the fda began steps to 
remove from the market bolars version of the hypertension drug 
dyazide the agency said its investigation has been unable to 
determine whether the generic version is as effective as the 
brandname product 
bolar issued a statement saying that its version of the drug 
thioridazine was never developed never tested never sent to the 
fda and never marketed 
bolar president robert shulman was quoted in fridays wall street 
journal and washington post as saying the incident was a 
manufacturing error and an isolated case that occurred in 
attempting to copy the tablet color of the brandname drug 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said we have additional bolar drugs 
under investigation including thioridazine 
in the course of the fdas investigation the agency obtained a 
letter from pharmakinetics laboratories inc of baltimore to bolar 
questioning based on a visual inspection the thioridazine samples 
bolar submitted for testing the brandname version of the drug 
mellaril is made by sandoz ltd 
pharmakinetics officials became suspicious that bolar was 
switching samples after the outer coating of tablets sent for 
testing began to chip and the sandoz logo became visible 
bolar later submitted different generic versions of mellaril and 
won fda approval to market the product in 1983 the approved pills 
were a different size shape and weight from the brandname drug 
paul perito an attorney for pharmakinetics called the bolar 
matter an isolated incident pharmakinetics president steven 
woodman added we have not had any other incident like this from 
this manufacturer or any other 
earlier this summer vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of spring 
valley ny admitted to the fda that it substituted a brandname 
product for its generic version to win fda approval 
pharmakinetics did the testing for that drug as well but woodman 
said the lab did not suspect any problems at the time 
in the case of bolars generic version of mellaril 
pharmakinetics said it notified the company of the problem after it 
was noticed and refused to conduct tests on the samples 
pharmakinetics is not the keeper of morality in the 
pharmaceutical industry alan g woodman who was president of 
pharmakinetics at the time said to bolar vice president jack rivers 
in a letter obtained by the post 
but jack you are an important part of an american success 
story and its our opinion that the exposure you place yourself and 
your company by pursuing this course of action far outweighs any 
possible benefit which may accrue to you or the company 
pharmakinetics was not required to notify the fda of the problem 
pharmakinetics and fda officials said 
bolar in its statement said the letter appeared to have been 
leaked to the news media to increase pressure on the fda to remove 
lowcost generic dyazide from the marketplace 
in a fullpage advertisement in fridays new york times bolar 
employees stated their support for their companys management and 
said they were outraged at us rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the energy and commerce investigations subcommittee 
which has been investigating the generic drug industry and fdas 
generic drug division 
the ad attacked dingell for creating a climate of fear and 
distrust within the entire generic pharmaceutical industry because 
of the fraudulent deeds of a few

the wave of takeover speculation sweeping the 
airline industry has raised concerns among government regulators and 
others over possible safety and competitive problems stemming from 
debtfinanced buyouts 
government officials are worried that the heavy debts could 
weaken an airlines financial ability to operate safely the 
transportation department has signaled anew that it will severely 
scrutinize any deals relying heavily on debt 
and some analysts warn that the debt burdens piled up in highly 
leveraged buyouts of airlines could mean sharply higher air fares 
if the airlines pass their higher debt costs directly to passengers 
the moneys got to come from someplace said morten beyer 
chairman of avmark inc an aviation consulting firm in arlington 
va 
in a leveraged buyout a company is purchased using its own 
assets as collateral for financing the loans used in the takeover 
that means the loans are repaid either by selling the assets or by 
using the companys cash flow 
critics of such deals say the big debtservicing requirements 
could require lbo companies to cut spending in other areas and in a 
severe economic downturn could lead to bankruptcy 
in addition proposed airline takeovers may offer as collateral 
some assets that arent really in the companies hands such as new 
jets that have been ordered with little money put down 
i think the airline deals are extremely aggressive said 
chriss street an lbo specialist who is a managing director of 
seidler amdec securities inc in los angeles 
some experts believe an airline is the wrong kind of company to 
qualify as a good candidate for a buyout financed with debt 
airlines have heavy capitalspending requirements and must deal with 
unions in setting labor costs furthermore their business always 
has been very sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy 
in one of the biggest recent leveraged deals an investor group 
led by alfred checchi which included klm royal dutch airlines 
bought northwest airlines parent nwa inc for 365 billion on aug 
4 
that ignited a flurry of airline stock buying in anticipation of 
new takeovers or mergers involving ual corp amr corp pan am 
corp trans world airlines inc continental airlines and others 
united airlines parent ual already has received a 619 billion 
buyout proposal from investor marvin davis and said late friday it 
would consider a rival plan from a group led by ual management and 
employees and other offers 
assistant transportation secretary jeffrey n shane said this 
week that the department will take active steps in response to the 
levels of debt and levels of foreign ownership 
news accounts of his remarks caused highflying airline stocks to 
drop sharply thursday although they rebounded on friday 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner previously had written 
letters to airline officials expressing concern about leveraged 
buyouts but shane told the wall street journal that the agency 
which was silent on the nwa buyout has decided it was time to 
send a message to the investment community 
in cases of safety issues or if it deems management incompetent 
the transportation department can revoke a carriers permission to 
fly 
a transportation department official who asked not to be 
identified said friday that the agency is concerned about the 
impact of takeovers on airline competition and safety but not 
specifically on fares 
the costs of airline debt also could mean discount fares could 
become rarer said consumer attorney james flug a partner in the 
washington law firm lobel novins lamont amp flug 
transportation officials also have voiced concern about foreign 
ownership 
in addition to klm other foreign carriers have been racing to 
snap up chunks of major us airlines british airways has joined 
with the employeemanagement bidders for ual scandinavian airlines 
system which already holds 99 percent of continentals parent 
texas air corp has been in talks to buy a stake in continental 
under us law foreign investors may not own more than 25 
percent of a carrier but the dot can object to smaller stakes if it 
believes the foreign carrier is trying to exert control 
shane told the wall street journal that his department is 
reluctant to approve such foreign purchases because there still are 
many questions about us airlines access to european markets after 
the common markets planned unification in 1992 
he also said the transportation department still was reviewing 
the nwa purchase and could impose conditions that would prevent 
nwas new owners from restructuring without department approval 
weve been cooperating with them all along said nwa 
spokesman bob gibbons in minneapolis referring to the agencys 
review

the securities and exchange commission will 
appeal a court ruling that it erred in authorizing trading in a 
security that is based on the value of broad stock market indexes 
officials said friday 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last month that the 
securities known as stock baskets resemble futures contracts 
not stocks and as such they should be regulated by the commodity 
futures trading commission which originally sanctioned them 
after the sec authorized the american stock exchange and the 
philadelphia stock exchange to begin trading the stock baskets in 
april the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange which trade in similar financial instruments sued in 
federal court 
a threejudge 7th circuit panel ruled in favor of the two chicago 
exchanges saying any stock basket security must be registered with 
the cftc 
the sec decided to seek a rehearing by the same panel or a rare 
hearing by the entire 7th circuit known as an en banc hearing 
said brandon becker associate director of the secs selfregulatory 
oversight and market structure office 
cftc officials said they had not seen the sec court papers and

eastern airlines on friday said it has settled 
prestrike safety claims by the federal aviation administration and 
gotten favorable marks for the safety of its rebuilding effort 
the faa has concluded that the company is operating at the very 
high safety standards required by its operating certificate 
eastern said in a statement 
charles e bryan head of the machinists union at eastern said 
the statement was typical of the faas relationship with texas 
air corp chairman frank lorenzos airlines the unions marking 
the end of their sixth month on strike monday by joining the labor 
day parade in new york say eastern is unsafely rushing its 
rebuilding without the unions 
company spokeswoman karen ceremsak said eastern is paying some 
115 million in faa fines the faa safety charges were from 1985 to 
1988 she said and the claims were settled to meet an aug 31 us 
bankruptcy court deadline for old claims against the carrier 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on march 
9 five days after its three unions went on strike 
ms ceremsak said 85 million eastern is paying stems from a 
1986 civil penalty of 95 million the faa assessed because of 
numerous recordkeeping violations she said all the fines had to do 
with the prestrike workforce 
this is old news its housekeeping for the faa she said 
this was a completely different workforce 
the faa expressed satisfaction with easterns current maintenance 
personnel its supply of tools and spare parts and the ability of 
its newly hired pilots eastern said 
eastern released its statement late in the afternoon and no faa 
officials were immediately available in washington ms ceremsak 
said eastern had been delaying its announcement while working out 
details and trying to coordinate its statement with the faa 
the faa also acknowledges the numerous improvements made by 
eastern subsequent to march 4 1989 which have enhanced the 
companys regulatory compliance posture eastern said 
eastern said its past violations didnt affect passenger safety 
the miamibased carrier said it has carried more than 485 million 
passengers since 1975 with 29 fatalities one of the best records in 
the airline industry 
bryan said union officials know that eastern has been cutting 
corners on maintenance such as failing to certify altimeters 
theyre whitewashing it bryan said

a state agency is investigating the 
deaths of 19 wild vultures at walt disney worlds discovery island 
during a trappingandremoval operation for the unwanted predators 
disney spokesman charlie ridgway acknowledged friday that about 
15 vultures died of heat exhaustion in a storage shed while awaiting 
transfer to a nearby wildlife refuge 
we are cooperating fully in the investigation by the state 
game and fresh water fish commission ridgway said we had and 
still have a problem with the vultures we did relocate a number of 
them and purely accidentally about 15 of the vultures died of 
heat exhaustion in the hot summer heat 
curator charles l cook of discovery island received an emergency 
federal permit may 24 to relocate up to 100 of the aggressive 
scavenger birds that were bothering visitors and threatening rare 
birds and animals on the 11acre sanctuary and tourist site 
a subsequent report filed by cook said 149 vultures were 
captured according to a story for the new york times regional 
newspapers other disney documents show 19 vultures died in the 
trapping operation 18 were released and 112 were moved to 
chassahowitzka national wildlife refuge 
ridgway said he didnt have details of the operation but the 
number of vultures specified in the federal permit was exceeded 
through a misunderstanding and there was no intent to harm any of 
the vultures 
cook could not be reached for comment 
while common in florida and other southern states the large 
black vulture is protected under the migratory bird treaty act 
violations can bring up to six months in jail and a 5000 fine for 
individuals and a 10000 fine for corporations 
they perform an extremely valuable function in cleansing the 
land of dead animals said phil million a spokesman for the us 
fish and wildlife service 
the vultures have become an increasing problem at discovery 
island where they are attracted by the food supply around the 
island and a nearby campground disney officials have said 
in letters to wildlife officials disney said the vultures have 
attacked galapagos tortoises and brown pelicans consumed large 
stocks of animal feed and even torn apart furniture at the park 
discovery island is to these birds like social security in your

the japanese government said friday the nations 
surplus in the broadest measure of trade fell in july for the fifth 
month in a row 
the announcement came as president bush and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu discussed trade in washington 
japans current account surplus which includes merchandise 
trade shipping tourism and investment income fell 183 percent 
from its level of a year earlier to 531 billion the finance 
ministry said 
car and steel exports were down while computer and business 
machine imports were up 
japans surplus in trade alone a narrower measure declined 
nearly 20 percent to 697 billion in july from a year earlier the 
ministry said 
government officials hope the recent trend will help japan repeat 
last years performance when it cut its current account surplus 87 
percent to 795 billion 
meeting with kaifu in washington bush said i share the prime 
ministers belief that while japan is noted as an exporting 
superpower the time has also come for japan to be an importing 
superpower 
kaifu said japan recognized that trade imbalances were a source 
of irritation and said his country would continue to make efforts 
for expanding imports 
fridays figures show that in july a booming economy at home 
continued to drive japans growth while exports lagged 
japans imports jumped to 16 billion 135 percent higher than 
in july of last year imports of computers business machines and 
textile products were strong ministry officials said 
exports inched up 03 percent from a year earlier to 23 billion 
exports of cars declined 53 percent and steel exports declined 37 
percent compared to last year 
american and japanese officials will meet monday and tuesday in 
tokyo to discuss structural ways to reduce their bilateral 
imbalance japan will probably ask the united states to reduce its 
budget deficit which economists say fuels its trade deficit 
us officials may ask japan to stimulate its domestic economy to 
increase imports and encourage its people to spend rather than save 
after adjustment for seasonal fluctuations the current account 
surplus grew to 405 billion in july from 292 billion in the 
previous month 
the surplus in merchandise trade declined to 547 billion in 
july from 575 billion the previous month 
both exports and imports were measured when contracts were 
settled the finance ministry each month makes a separate 
announcement of trade statistics that are compiled when goods pass 
through customs
