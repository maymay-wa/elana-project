twin peaks the surreal abc series that 
became tvs most talkedabout lowrated show ended its current run 
wednesday without solving laura palmers nowmaybe murder and with 
its fbi agent shot three times 
the shooting of fbi agent dale cooper in his hotel room only 
the gunmans gloved hand was seen came at the end of the show and 
undoubtedly shocked many fans who have followed david lynchs 
quirky series from the beginning 
it was left uncertain whether cooper was killed the surprise 
shooting was only one of many closingepisode twists that will have 
twin peaks fans speculating until fall when the series picks 
up somes unresolved questions in a twohour premiere among the 
twists 
jock a fat barkeep shot during his arrest as a suspect in 
palmers death was smothered to death in his hospital bed by her 
increasingly deranged father 
leo johnson a drugdealing trucker also suspected of killing 
palmer was shot and possibly killed by another twin peaks lowlife 
while trying to murder bobby palmers twotiming boyfriend with 
an ax 
a mysterious assailants beating of the mad psychiatrist dr 
jacoby causing the latter to have a heart attack or did the heart 
attack hit moments earlier when the doctor hiding at night near a 
gazebo saw a woman he thought was laura 
the playing of a tape that palmer the towns high school 
homecoming queen supposedly made before her death in it she 
spoke of a mystery man who she said twice tried to kill her but 
boy i sure got off on it 
the everywhichwaybutloose finale left the series as it began 
shrouded in mystery despite earlier statements by abc that it 
would tie up some loose ends 
created by lynch whose eccentric films includes dune and 
blue velvet and mark frost the series is set in a pacific 
northwest logging town full of sex lies drugs doughnuts pie and 
strange events 
the last includes last weeks slaying of a mynah bird taken into 
police custody after suggestions it saw the murder of palmer 
in the shows april 8 premiere the discovery of palmers body 
wrapped in plastic touched off a crying jag by a deputy sheriff 
that it turned out he always cried at murder scenes proved an early 
indication that seemingly normal twin peaks was in fact weird city 
subsequent episodes featured fbi agent coopers dream of a 
midget speaking gibberish lauras leatherjacketed twotiming 
boyfriend bobby howling like a wolf and her mother who has 
psychic visions 
other characters the log lady toting a log that imparts clues 
about the murder a shoe salesman who lacks a left arm and carries 
a suitcase full of rightfoot shoes and singing and dancing 
icelanders considering a land deal 
a brooding beautifully filmed series it is to some is both a 
whodunnit and a gothic puton of soap operas one with so many 
byzantine twists that its ardent fans argue for hours about the 
meaning of a plot turn or apparent clue 
some viewers complain that if one episode is missed all is lost 
the shows premiere preceded by considerable publicity and word 
of mouth had top ratings of 217 
but its nielsens started sliding immediately and last week hit 
a low of 106 each ratings point represents 921000 homes 
abc renewed twin peaks for another season and will air it 
on saturdays with china beach next fall

after 5 years of work and 50 hours of footage 
filmmaker loretta smith has almost finished the movie she wanted to 
but now cant call born on the fourth of july 
that was the films title for four years but it had to be 
scrapped when oliver stone used it for his academy awardwinning 
feature on the life of paraplegic vietnam veteran ron kovic 
born on the fourth of july earned stone an oscar as best 
director and also won an oscar for editing tom cruise starred as 
kovic in the universal studios production that reportedly cost 15 
million 
what do you do when someone steals your title smith said in 
a recent interview she laughed however and acknowledged stones 
help with her own film 
the title is actually kovics taken from the lyrics of a george 
m cohan song he used the phrase as the title of his 1976 
autobiography but smith had lived with it as a shooting title for 
so long that she almost felt it belonged to her 
i see them as complementing one another said kovic in a 
telephone interview from his home in redondo beach calif 
theyre two very different films about the same person i think 
both the feature and the documentary are important statements 
kovic 44 was a muchdecorated marine in his second tour in 
vietnam near the cua viet river when a snipers bullet smashed his 
spine in january 1968 his resulting paralysis and his experiences 
in veterans administration hospitals turned him into an antiwar 
activist 
in smiths documentary kovic appears as himself sometimes 
naked with catheters hanging from his body the movie was filmed 
with a staff of about 11 people on a budget of 250000 raised 
from small grants and public donations the biggest individual 
donation came from bruce springsteen at a fundraiser in venice 
calif in 1987 smith said he gave us 10000 and the use of 
four of his songs for the soundtrack 
as a documentary maker i dont have a very high profile its 
almost like being a nonperson 
the 42yearold smith who once supported her film work by 
driving a taxi came to filmmaking by a roundabout route a chicago 
native who grew up in sterling ill ronald reagan grew up 10 
miles away how more allamerican can you get she was working 
as a textbook editor in 1974 when her thenboyfriend journalist 
richard boyle convinced her to trot the world with him 
the romance didnt last but it introduced smith to boyles 
friend kovic who was then completing his autobiography 
it proved to be an eventful friendship kovic traveled with 
smith and boyle to cambodia in 1975 when that nation was falling 
to the khmer rouge when kovic was arrested at a chicago 
demonstration in 1979 smith by then a film student was thrown 
in the same paddy wagon 
when kovic saw smiths first documentary an awardwinning 
effort titled where did you get that woman in 1983 he began 
pressuring her to film his story as a documentary he had become 
embittered with the hollywood approach after the collapse of a 1978 
attempt to film his book on a script by stone it would have 
starred al pacino 
when she began filming kovic in 1985 smith thought it would 
take her a year to complete she hadnt counted though on the 
complexity of her subject or on americas growing conservatism as 
the film cans piled up so did the bills 
i was turned down for every grant i applied for she 
recalled governmentsponsored agencies simply didnt want to 
deal with war and veterans 
smith kept on shooting though she gathered harrowing footage 
of kovics daily routine as a paraplegic shots of him addressing 
veterans rallies and documentation of a visit to his home town of 
massapequa ny 
in that sequence kovic rolls his wheelchair to a basketball 
court where he used to play he talks to some youths shooting 
baskets and finds out that they plan to enlist in the military 
kovic tells them about his own experiences but cannot dissuade 
them 
smith also wove in older material she obtained home movies from 
kovics family showing his long island childhood as well as 
combat footage of the war from television archives 
it grew from a cinematic portrait of a friend into an admitted 
obsession 
i really am trying to make a statement she said the 
vietnam war was the central fact for my generation of americans 
the war touched everyone whether they went to vietnam or not and 
it changed us well never be the same people again 
the project often languished though for lack of funding at 
times smith had to spend more time raising money than working on 
the film her utility bills went unpaid and her telephone was 
frequently disconnected 
in addition kovics treatment at another va hospital in 1986 
left him depressed and sometimes uncooperative 
when stone had a hit with the oscarwinning platoon and 
decided to film kovics book himself smith became worried kovics 
advisory work with stone often made him unavailable to her and the 
problem of the title had to solved 
smith though made a deal with universal whereby the studio got 
the title but she got universals aid in the distribution of her 
film stone a vietnam veteran himself helped raise money 
im editing the footage down to feature length right now and 
i want to show it at the new york film festival in september so 
ill have to raise more funding for postproduction smith said 
as for a title im open to suggestions maybe ill just call 
it a good american

a years worth of rain in four months washed out 
crops damaged homes and caused some 300 million in damage in four 
states but experts say dams and levees built since 1950 prevented 
a far worse catastrophe 
downtown dallas for example probably would have been swamped 
by trinity river had five dams not held back 390 billion gallons of 
water enough to cover rhode island under nearly 2 feet of water 
this would have been the new flood of record said ron 
ruffennach of the us army corps of engineers our economists 
think 2 billion in damage was prevented in the dallas area 
because of these water projects 
instead water was held back or channeled away from populated 
areas and flooding in texas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana was 
confined mostly to rural lowlying flood plains in those areas 
development is sparse and agriculture and recreation are the only 
industries 
in all damage from the water draining south toward the gulf of 
mexico is estimated at 300 million or more most of it related to 
agriculture exact counts are unavailable because many areas are 
still under water and may remain flooded most of the summer 
so far 76 counties in texas oklahoma and arkansas have been 
declared eligible for federal disaster assistance 
but as water recedes in most areas officials say it seems clear 
that given the record volume of water flooding could have been far 
worse 
a lot of the area that was flooded was agriculture area and 
much less populated than other places and particularly downstream 
its safe to say a lot of people received an early warning said 
laureen chernow a spokeswoman for the texas office of emergency 
management 
theres no doubt it could have been a lot worse the system 
worked as it was supposed to added carol weathers of the trinity 
river authority 
in louisiana the corps of engineers which operates 
floodcontrol dams warned that 700000 acres of land could be 
flooded with cleanup operations under way authorities count fewer 
than 110000 flooded acres because levees held 
about 110 homes sustained damage in five counties and counts 
from six others affected by flooding havent been made said janet 
merritt chief of disaster services in louisiana 
only two counties in louisiana apparently will qualify for a 
federal disaster declaration she said agricultural losses are 
estimated at 7 million 
elsewhere 
in oklahoma president bush declared 13 counties eligible for 
disaster aid one child was killed during storms about 500 homes 
were damaged and highways and bridges sustained about 8 million 
worth of damage officials said no crop or livestock losses were 
reported 
in arkansas 22 counties have been included in the disaster 
declaration no deaths were reported about 500 houses were damaged 
and agriculture losses were estimated at 48 million 
in kansas city 208 houses were destroyed 302 sustained major 
damage and 224 minor damage after flooding which has also covered 
800000 acres of corn damage is estimated at least 5 million 
in mississippi 345 houses have been damaged by flooding and 
cleanup efforts are well under way 
and in texas 12 people died last month because of the floods 
which began april 15 one died last week authorities said so far 
41 counties have been made eligible for federal disaster aid and 
the federal emergency management agency has received applications 
for aid from 3473 texas families 
last year 22 people died in flooding that made 89 texas 
counties eligible for federal disaster assistance fema paid out 
35 million in aid last year 
its impossible to compare with last year at this time said 
fema spokesman george burgess we wont know for some time 
what officials do know is that flood control techniques tested 
as never before because of the record volume of water helped to 
lessen the impact of the torrents 
the flood problem began in january and february when heavy rains 
drenched the ground national weather service hydrologist ernie 
cathey said 
there was no place for the water to go he said 
record rains continued through april and into early may dallas 
for example averages 2946 inches of rain a year so far this 
year the city has had 2915 inches 
the city experienced its worst flooding ever in 1908 when 
184000 cubic feet of water per second raced down the trinity at 
dallas the second highest recorded reading was during floods of 
1942 110000 cubic feet per second 
but this year the peak was 82000 and hydrologists estimate 
that if not for the dams holding back the 390 billion gallons the 
flow rate would have topped 260000 cubic feet per second 
still the work of the us army corps of engineers has come 
under attack in arkansas where gov bill clinton has questioned 
decisions to release large amounts of red river water upstream in 
oklahoma that water washed out fields in arkansas and threatened 
to crumble a levee at texarkana 
the corps is taking a second look at decisions made in 
oklahoma and arkansas after clintons complaints ruffennach said

bart simpson the goggleeyed cartoon kid with a 
corrugated hairdo is catching flak from educators who say his 
smartalecky attitude on the simpsons gives children the wrong 
message 
bart with his overbite and backtalk dont have a cow 
man is fast becoming an icon of american pop culture helped 
along by a multimilliondollar merchandising blitz from fox 
broadcasting co 
the scenestealer on the runaway hit tv show also stars in 
butterfinger candy bar commercials and there are plans for a 
starring role in a nintendo video game mattel inc promises bart 
dolls and action figures among more than 200 simpsons products 
entering stores 
this summer burger king launches a simpsonsbased ad campaign 
barts influence has reached stanford university and ucla where 
he won votes in student elections he was disqualified in both 
races on the technicality that he was not enrolled prompting 
student protests 
in a telegram from fox to stanford students bart told voters to 
be patient i must tell you i have set my sights on higher goals 
bart simpson for us president in 92 man 
bart is fast becoming the fictional youth american children 
identify with most not bad for a 10yearold kid with only eight 
fingers eh but his attitude bothers some critical school 
officials 
last month principal bill krumnow of lutz elementary school in 
ballville township ohio banned barts underachiever and proud 
of it man tshirt 
to be proud of being an incompetent is a contradiction of what 
we stand for krumnow said we strive for excellence and to 
instill good values in kids the show he said teaches the 
wrong thing to students 
the shirt also was banned at cambridge elementary school in 
orange calif and last week in kentucky principal lonnie watts 
of taylor mill elementary school declared the bart shirt a 
dresscode violation 
we feel like the bart simpson show does a lot of things that 
do not help student selfesteem such as saying its ok to be 
stupid watts said 
simpsons creator matt groening and fox officials prefer to 
let bart defend himself with statements like i have no comment 
my folks taught me to respect elementary school principals even 
the ones who have nothing better to do than tell kids what to 
wear 
the shows coexecutive producer sam simon said i dont think 
its the job of elementary school principals to pick the role 
models for their kids 
the uproar caused jc penney co inc which created simpsons 
boutiques in its stores to remove the offending underachiever 
shirt and another that reads im bart simpson who the hell are 
you 
even drug czar william j bennett took a swipe at bart on a may 
16 tour of a pittsburgh drugtreatment center bennett saw a poster 
of bart and told recovering addicts they shouldnt follow barts 
lead as an underachiever 
you guys arent watching the simpsons are you thats not 
going to help you any said bennett director of the national 
drug policy office 
that wasnt lost on fox we have great respect for mr 
bennetts task and responsibility said fox spokesman brad 
turell but i am not aware of any one tv program that will help 
teenagers kick the drug habit 
simon said the heat was the inevitable result of the shows 
success 
in a matter of a few months it went from being a cult favorite 
to a critical hit to popular acclaim simon said i knew that 
the next step because it always is the next step is somebody 
stepping in and saying its dangerous 
some authorities disagree with barts critics 
i think the simpson family is one of the few thoughtful 
cartoons on commercial broadcasting said peggy charren 
president of action for childrens television a lobby and watchdog 
group based in cambridge mass 
how can you teach the constitution if you ban tshirts she 
asked 
and fox executives stress theyre serious about barts image 
were sensitive to it but you cant do your show for three 
school principals said simpsons coproducer james l 
brooks a creator of taxi the mary tyler moore show and 
writerdirector of terms of endearment 
brooks said he frequently discusses the show with parents 
educators and child psychologists 
i know from my own childhood that i was messed up most by the 
portrayal of perfect families brooks said when you couldnt 
live up to them then you started to think something was wrong with 
yours

at 20 pvt francisco kisanga is 
already a veteran of angolas civil war decorated for bravery in 
what the government calls its two most decisive victories at cuito 
cuanavale and mavinga 
kisanga a 5foot5inch warrior whose nomdeguerre is jiboia 
portuguese for a large snake that seizes bites and kills he 
says joined the peoples armed forces for the liberation of 
angola when he was 15 
now despite renewed peace efforts between the marxist 
government and unita rebels the war for privates like kasinga 
continues as the two victories are debated 
he took part in a fourmonth campaign codenamed operation 
zebra that the government said wrestled the town of mavinga from 
rebel hands feb 2 before army forces pulled back to their southern 
base in cuito cuanavale 
guiding foreign reporters in an armored car along tracks in the 
heavily mined battlefield of cuito cuanavale kisanga grinned as he 
recalled the 1988 battle here and the recent fighting in mavinga 
cuito was a real hard battle heavy artillery tanks 
bombs kisanga said mavinga was just routine shelling and 
mines there was no handtohand combat the kwachas just run 
away 
kwacha or wake up in the native bantu dialect of 
umbundu is the battlecry of jonas savimbis unita national 
union for the total independence of angola it has fought angolas 
sovietbacked government first with south african and now with us 
aid since shortly after angolan independence from portugal in 1975 
kisangas dismissive summary of the mavinga battle contrasts 
with the heroic picture drawn by angolan officials and reflects the 
controversy surrounding the battles there and at cuito cuanavale 
according to lt col francisco furtado chief of staff of 
operation zebra the attack on mavinga involved heavy clashes 
between 7500 rebel troops and a similar number of government 
soldiers 
it was launched from cuito on dec 21 on jan 29 government 
forces finally crossed the river lomba 12 miles north of mavinga 
and the key to strategic control of the area furtado said 
he said 4748 rebels died eight were captured and 10 
surrendered before government troops withdrew from the town 
savimbi speaking may 15 on the rebels voice of the the black 
cockerel radio claimed the rebels routed government troops and 
reoccupied mavinga after heavy fighting 
furtado said two tactical groups were still pulling back to 
cuito where government and cuban troops halted south africas 
military push into angola in march 1988 
south africa also claimed victory at cuito cuanavale which 
became known as southern africas stalingrad because of heavy 
ground and air clashes between south african and cuban forces 
western diplomats in lisbon said intelligence reports indicated 
no major fighting around mavinga since february 
recent rebel actions have been smaller hitandrun attacks 
bombings and ambushes in angolas central highlands and northern 
provinces bordering zaire zaire serves as a conduit for much of 
the 50 million in us aid that unita receives yearly 
we have decided to shift units to other parts of the country 
to teach unita the lesson they didnt learn at mavinga furtado 
said 
pvt kisanga the 20yearold veteran knows what the new 
government orders could mean another tour of duty before he can 
go on leave

the countryside offers no escape from the social 
and economic pressures that lead kids to do poorly in school a 
study suggests 
a study that surveyed school officials in 312 rural urban and 
suburban districts last year cast doubt on the popular image of 
rural children leading wholesome troublefree lives compared with 
youngsters in crowded communities 
the study asked officials to estimate the percentage of their 
students who fit into one or more of a dozen risk categories 
including involvement in crime sexual activity drug or alcohol 
abuse depression child abuse poverty or parents who are 
substance abusers 
rural children fared worse than nonrural children in 34 out of 
39 statistical comparisons according to the survey by the national 
rural development institute based at western washington university 
the report thus suggests that the social and economic strains 
facing rural schoolchildren are every bit as bad and perhaps 
worse as those facing city youngsters 
isolation and rural customs are partly to blame said doris 
helge executive director of the institute based at western 
washington university in bellingham wash 
a lot of it is attitude helge said in a telephone 
interview sexual activity and dropping out of school is not that 
unusual in rural settings theres an acceptance of low 
selfesteem a kid has to be really deviant to get any attention 
a draft of the study which also compared the state of students 
with mental and physical handicaps to that of nonhandicapped 
children was made available to the associated press 
there are brighter spots on the rural landscape notably in 
minnesota north dakota and iowa where residents have long put 
high value on education and completing school 
but helge an authority on rural education problems said rural 
children with handicaps or psychological problems may fare worse 
than others because isolated communities often lack social services 
to address their needs 
among the surveys findings 
177 percent of nonhandicapped rural high school students were 
estimated to be substance abusers compared with 101 percent in 
nonrural districts 
123 percent of nonhandicapped rural elementary school 
children were found to be suffering depression compared with 10 
percent of urban and 85 perecent of suburban youngsters among 
mildly handicapped youngsters depression was a problem among an 
estimated 169 percent of rural gradeschoolers but only 95 
percent of urban and 124 percent of suburban pupils 
257 percent of nonhandicapped rural high school students were 
considered sexually active compared with 225 percent of urban and 
209 percent suburban students among mildly handicapped rural high 
schoolers 267 percent were sexually active compared with only 
153 percent of urban and 182 percent of suburban children 
67 percent of nonhandicapped rural middle school youngsters 
were said to be involved in crime compared with an estimated 56 
percent in urban and suburban schools 
127 percent of preschoolage rural youngsters without 
handicaps were considered victims of child abuse compared with 
119 percent in urban and 96 percent in suburban districts 
social and family strains have worsened in rural communities in 
recent years along with downturns in rurallybased industries like 
farming petroleum and timber experts say 
we shouldnt be surprised that rural children face the same 
if not more difficult circumstances as urban children said 
denise alston senior education associate of the childrens defense 
fund in washington 
services from prenatal care to recreation are limited and 
unfortunately poverty is the common denominator for both groups 
helge said the key to helping troubled rural youngsters lies in 
educating parents teachers and other adults to communicate more 
effectively with children and become more attuned to their problems 
before they become crises

in a move that echoes national disputes over 
controversial art the massachusetts house approved a measure 
tuesday that would prevent state funding of institutions that 
display works deemed offensive 
the measure would bar the massachusetts cultural council from 
giving any of its 14 million in grants to any institution 
exhibiting art that depicts sexual exploitation of children or 
displays religious objects in a disparaging manner 
the measure an amendment to the state budget passed on a voice 
vote without debate 
it is a long way from becoming law the house version of the 
budget must be reconciled with the senate version and gov michael 
dukakis who can veto individual sections of the budget said he 
believed the measure would be unconstitutional 
rep thomas finneran who sponsored the amendment didnt 
specifically define what he meant by offensive but mentioned 
recent disputes over the display of photographs by the late robert 
mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
it would prohibit the granting of financial support for any 
individual or group that displays anything that is offensive 
finneran said of the measure 
federal lawmakers have subjected funding for art to increasing 
scrutiny last year sen jesse helms rnc pressured the 
corcoran gallery in washington dc to cancel a scheduled 
exhibition of photographs by mapplethorpe whose photos include 
homosexual themes and nude children 
helms and conservative groups criticized the national endowment 
for the arts partial funding of the mapplethorpe show as well as 
a grant to serrano who aroused helms ire with his photograph of a 
crucifix submerged in urine 
to me in all honesty its ridiculous to talk about the 
expenditure of taxpayer dollars on something that is absolutely 
horribly offensive finneran said

after nearly a century in which most 
residents paid a few dollars a year the only us city on land 
leased from an indian reservation has agreed to a fourteenfold 
increase in rent to the seneca indians 
the agreement reached monday nine months before a 99year lease 
expires also calls for a 60 million payment from the federal and 
state governments to compensate for what both sides said were 
unfairly low rents under the old pact 
but city officials and residents tuesday worried about how the 
community would raise its annual payments to the indians from 
57000 to at least 800000 
if the economy of salamanca is really impacted by this lease 
it cant survive as a city said patrick callaghan chief city 
negotiator the package we worked out is about the best package 
we can get from the senecas whether we can get through this i 
dont know 
salamanca was settled in the mid1840s on land set aside 50 
years earlier for an indian reservation in 1892 congress imposed 
a lease on the senecas over the tribes objections that called 
for most city residents to pay 5 or less a year the city as a 
whole paid 57000 last year 
the lease expires in february and the uncertainty over what 
form the new lease might take had prompted residents to put off 
home improvements and businesses to delay expansions many banks 
refused to make loans on property within the seneca reservation 
some residents appeared stunned and shaken as they left city 
hall after learning the details 
the thing of it is there are so many people in this town 
working for minimum wage said carl auge whose lease fee went 
from 10 to 174 i dont know how theyre going to make it 
frank dragotta said the 891 a year he will have to pay on his 
bicycle store could put it out of business 
i work more or less full time to keep the business afloat 
its not strong enough to keep going on its own he said i 
dont know where im going to be 
about 90 percent of the property in salamanca a city of 6600 
lies on seneca land it is part of the 22640acre allegany 
reservation on the pennsylvania line 
under the new agreement a residential lease will be assessed at 
8 percent of the market value of the land and a nonresidential 
lease will be 10 percent of the land value the new lease will run 
for 40 years with an option to renew for another 40 years 
residents will pay the indians a total of 630000 annually the 
city government will pay the remaining 170000 
several residents said they didnt begrudge paying the tribe 
something extra 
five bucks wasnt enough said jack frost whose rent will 
be 161 a year 
but they said the federal and state governments should help make 
the payments officials in washington and new york have said there 
is no guarantee that government money will be available even for 
the onetime 60 million payment 
they were very instrumental in imposing this on the indians 
and now theyre walking away from it said joe giblin whose 
payments will rise from 51 to 243 
in the meantime salamanca could wither and die some residents 
said 
the citys not going to grow said jean barrett who will 
pay 255 instead of 6 how many people build a new house in 
salamanca how many businesses are in salamanca were just 
stifled

a former editor for the wall street journal sued 
the newspaper tuesday for 1264 million claiming he was fired and 
his reputation smeared by a false charge of plagiarism 
jonathan kandell the journals assistant foreign editor prior 
to his dismissal may 2 also demanded the return of notes and other 
documents that he contended the papers editors had kept knowing 
they would support his position 
the journal fired kandell 43 after accusing him of lifting 
uncredited material from another writers book for a page 1 article 
about three private entrepreneurs in eastern europe 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones amp co inc owners of the 
journal said dow jones believes the suit is utterly without 
merit and the company intends to defend itself vigorously 
kandell quoted paul steiger deputy managing editor of the 
journal as having said his alleged offense was the most serious 
transgression to take place at the journal since the foster winans 
case 
r foster winans was convicted in 1985 of using his position as 
a wall street journal columnist to profit from insider stock 
trading information he was sentenced to 18 months in prison a 
5000 fine and five years probation 
in his lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court in 
manhattan kandell contends he was libeled and his professional 
reputation destroyed by the journal he demanded 10 million in 
punitive damages and 264 million in compensation for willful 
wanton and reckless disregard of the truth and actual malice 
on the papers part 
he said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the 
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same 
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper village 
voice about kandells case the voice was not named as a defendant 
in the suit 
kandells article in the march 30 edition of the journal 
profiled a soviet machine tool maker a czechoslovak inventor and a 
hungarian banker as examples of individuals succeeding in the 
private sector 
kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three 
individuals in their countries after hearing them speak at a 
meeting in new york last november sponsored by the council on 
foreign relations 
he said that at the same meeting he also learned of a book 
communist entrepreneurs and met the author john w kiser iii 
he said he later read the book once and put it aside

president bush is asking israeli security 
forces to restrain themselves in confronting palestinians mounting 
angry protests over a weekend massacre 
bush emphasized his concern on tuesday by extending personal 
sympathy to the families of all palestinians killed in the 
spiraling violence 
his condolences were pointedly expressed to both the families of 
the 13 palestinians killed by israeli security forces since the 
violence began as well as to the families of the seven palestinian 
workers slain by an allegedly deranged israeli gunman on sunday 
bushs gesture comes amid rising discontent inside the bush 
administration over the course of events in israel 
the discontent centers not only on the loss of life suffered 
during the israeli crackdown on rioting palestinians this week but 
also on israels seeming reluctance to enter a dialogue with 
palestinian representatives 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that while 
bush was anguished at the murders of the seven palestinian workers 
he is also deeply troubled by the violent aftermath to these 
deaths 
besides expressing condolences to the families of all those 
who have lost their lives amidst the subsequent violence the 
president calls upon the israeli security forces as well as others 
to act with maximum restraint fitzwater said additional 
bloodshed and loss of life will only compound the tragedy 
but fitzwater said bush believes that simply deploring what 
happened and calling for restraint is not enough 
it is essential to address the political issues that lie at 
the core of the regions strife fitzwater said and added 
based on experience we believe that violence in the middle 
east will continue and possibly grow so long as there is an absence 
of a promising peace process that nourishes hope amongst israelis 
and palestinians alike 
the administration continues to believe fitzwater said that 
the initiative of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir which the 
administration has been trying to implement for months offers the 
best path to a negotiating process productive for both israelis and 
palestinians alike 
shamir repeatedly refused to endorse us suggestions for an 
israelipalestinian meeting in cairo to start implementing the 
initiative his government collapsed over the issue 
both shamir leader of the likud coalition and labor party 
leader shimon peres have been unable so far to form a new 
government 
we look forward to the quick emergence of an israeli 
government that is capable of making decisions on issues of peace 
and is committed just as we are to moving ahead on the peace 
process fitzwater said

twelveyearold david opont given only a 5050 
shot at survival 3 months ago after a neighborhood bully allegedly 
set him on fire could walk out of the hospital before the end of 
the month 
hes come a long way we expect him to be released shortly 
possibly within the next week said myrna manners a spokeswoman 
for the new york hospitalcornell medical center 
the brooklyn boy has been in the hospital undergoing four skin 
grafts and therapy since he was torched on march 7 doctors said 
then if his recovery went perfectly he would be out in four months 
but his release from the burn unit will send david into another 
world that relatives say is just as scary to the boy the legal 
system 
david may have to testify against the 13yearold who allegedly 
torched him in an abandoned building a pretrial hearing for that 
boy was set for today 
davids lawyers also will need his help in preparing a 
multimilliondollar lawsuit to be filed on his behalf 
and eventually hell be back on the streets where he was 
trapped bound and burned 
the future makes david nervous said guito lavoile 35 davids 
cousin and a family spokesman its not a problem of him its a 
problem of time its still too close to it all the scars will not 
go away easy said lavoile 
if you ever happened to be a victim of a crime youd think 
twice about going over it again he was 50 percent dead 
theres no doubt thats how he feels 
davids parents who brought their son here from haiti in 1988 
speak little english they have kept a daily vigil at the hospital 
as has their teenage daughter naomi 
the boy was on his way to school when a bully forced him into a 
building tied him to a railing and set him afire police said 
david who allegedly was robbed by the same boy a day earlier 
suffered burns over 55 percent of his body 
david initially told relatives he was torched because he refused 
to smoke crack but police filed no drug charges against the 
suspect and now believe his only motive was being a bully 
the alleged assailant was arrested hours after the attack and 
has been jailed at a juvenile center 
david was in critical condition for most of his hospitalization 
doctors put his chances of survival at 5050 fearing any 
complication could kill him he is now in stable condition manners 
said but faces years of treatment 
he is badly scarred by the burns does not have full use of one 
arm and will go from the burn unit to a rehabilitation center but 
he already is taking short walks around the hospital and may speak 
with reporters next week lavoile said 
i think its going to be amazing to see him back as a normal 
person to see him back on the streets his cousin said 
davids plight touched hearts throughout the city and nation 
more than 280000 poured into a fund established to cover his 
medical expenses he was visited by ronald and nancy reagan bill 
cosby vice president dan quayle and the rev jesse jackson 
david marked his 12th birthday one day after the attack and the 
hospital was flooded with hundreds of cards gifts and flowers 
mayor david dinkins another visitor used the boy as a metaphor 
for the city in his may 11 call for racial harmony in new york 
like the city in which he lives young david is suffering 
hes scarred and he struggles to overcome the damage that anger has 
inflicted on him the mayor said yet dinkins saw a bright future 
for the boy 
when i see him i see life in his eyes he said despite 
all hes seen davids eyes are wide open looking not behind him 
in fright but ahead in the fond hope that he will heal and move 
on

in a unique assault on leukemia doctors have 
found that a form of vitamin a will turn cancer cells into normal 
ones 
medicines usual way of combating cancer is to kill it doctors 
administer powerful toxic drugs in the hopes that they will destroy 
more cancerous cells than healthy ones 
the new approach instead tries to reform cancer cells it 
changes the cells genetic program bypassing the genetic mix up 
that makes them kill in this way the treatment induces the cancer 
cells to live to grow and eventually to die by the same rules that 
govern the rest of the body 
the drug a synthetic form of vitamin a called alltrans 
retinoic acid was developed in china and tested in france though 
it has drawbacks and works in just one rare form of leukemia 
doctors hope it will provide clues for shortcircuiting the basic 
errors that underlie all cancers 
the dogma has been to try to kill cancer cells said dr 
laurent degos is it possible to change a cell and not kill it 
so it becomes normal 
degos a researcher at hopital saintlouis in paris presented 
evidence that this indeed is possible in a report tuesday at the 
annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
he tested the drug on victims of acute promyelocytic leukemia a 
rare blood cancer that strikes a few hundred people in the united 
states each year all of them had failed earlier standard therapy 
he achieved complete though often temporary elimination of all 
signs of the disease in 16 of 17 patients who had relapsed for the 
first time there was complete remission in one of four patients 
who had relapsed a second time 
there was no killing of cells but they change said degos 
we see more mature cells 
this form of leukemia is caused by a specific genetic defect 
the mislocation of a piece of one string of genes or chromosome 
onto another chromosome as a result the cells get stuck in their 
juvenile stage they fail to mature normally and eventually die 
treatment with alltrans retinoic acid appears to bump the cells 
past this roadblock in their development so they grow old 
this is a smashing development commented dr charles 
schiffer of the university of maryland it has impressed even the 
most cynical this is a different approach to anything we have done 
in this disease in the past 
dr bruce chesen of the national cancer institute said the 
institute plans soon to sponsor four small safety studies of the 
drug once those are done it will begin a larger review of its 
effectiveness 
though the synthetic vitamin wiped out obvious signs of the 
leukemia the disease frequently came back apparently because some 
cancer cells were resistant to the drug degas said it may be 
necessary to combine the treatment with standard chemotherapy to 
try to obliterate the few remaining cancer cells 
the drug was developed in china by wang zeng yi dean of 
shanghai university ii a frenchspeaking medical school it is now 
being produced by hoffman laroche the pharmaceutical firm 
in an earlier report doctors said they found that the acne 
medicine accutane another synthetic form of vitamin a prevents 
new tumors from developing in people treated for smokingrelated 
throat cancer 
among other research presented at the meeting 
dr steven a rosenberg of the national cancer institute 
outlined the first results of his pioneering attempt to insert 
foreign genes into cancer patients the initial effort carried out 
on seven melanoma patients was intended to show that gene therapy 
is possible 
doctors removed cancerfighting blood cells from the patients 
tumors inserted a bacteria gene into them and then put them back 
into the patients bodies the manipulated cells zeroed in on their 
tumors the doctors hope soon to repeat the experiment this time 
inserting a gene that produces a cancerkilling chemical called 
tumer necrosis factor 
a survey of american and caribbean blacks in central brooklyn 
showed that a surprising 4 percent were infected with 
cancercausing human tcell leukemia virus type 1 or htlvi dr 
harvey dosik of interfaith medical center in brooklyn said the 
infection rate is 200 times higher than that seen nationwide in 
blood donors 
dr lode j swinnen of loyola university in chicago said he had 
found evidence that okt3 an antibody treatment widely given to 
recipients of organ transplants significantly increases their risk 
of nonhodgkins lymphoma a blood cancer he reviewed 154 heart 
transplant patients and found that 11 percent of those getting okt3 
since 1986 had developed the disease

the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee is threatening a delay in the confirmation of a 
top pentagon nominee until a dispute over civilian oversight of 
intelligence activities is resolved 
sen john warner of virginia expressed concern tuesday over a 
classified memorandum in which the head of special operations 
command proposed sole defense department oversight of military 
intelligence actions 
prior approval process of these activities now involve 
agencies other than the defense department as it should warner 
said but reportedly under the proposal only the secretary of 
defense on behalf of the national command authority would have to 
approve such activities 
the memo was written by gen james lindsay commander of the 
special operations command 
warner told lt gen carl stiner president bushs choice to 
replace lindsay that the issue of civilian oversight could hold up 
his confirmation to the defense department post 
it may well be that this senator feels that that issue is 
going to have to be resolved prior to such time as this committee 
completes the work on your nomination warner told stiner 
the nominee said he was not familiar with the memo but promised 
an immediate review and recommendation to powell after his 
confirmation 
the controversy centers on the defense departments special 
operations a combatant command of specially trained defense 
department forces who operate in peace or war the units can either 
support conventional forces or act in their place 
warner expressed concerns that the defining of activities as 
intelligence gathering would be done without oversight from 
agencies other than the defense department 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said he shared warners concerns and the ranking members of the 
senates intelligence committee harbor similar misgivings 
we want to make sure that our special operations forces have 
the right kind of intelligence nunn said we want to make sure 
that the cia does its job we want to make sure that intelligence 
areas of the defense department do their job but we also absolutely 
insist that the civilian oversight of those intelligence activities 
not be lost 
thats the bottom line nunn said

for only the second time in its history the 
federal fund that insures deposits at the nations banks lost money 
in 1989 
the federal deposit insurance corp reported that its insurance 
fund lost 851 million in 1989 following an even bigger loss of 
424 billion in 1988 
the backtoback losses were blamed on a postdepression record 
number of bank failures in 1988 221 banks failed or required 
government assistance to remain open that number declined only 
slightly to 207 in 1989 
fdic chairman l william seidman estimated tuesday that 150 to 
175 banks probably would fail this year but that the fund still 
should be able to return to profitability if none of the failures 
involves a large institution 
however he conceded that his estimate was highly dependent on 
the health of the overall economy 
much depends on future interest rates and future real estate 
markets he told reporters 
a big part of the 1989 loss was blamed on the failure of the 
20bank mcorp based in dallas which it is estimated will cost the 
government 2 billion making it the second biggest bank failure in 
history 
last years loss to the fdic fund came because the agency was 
forced to pay out more to take over the failed banks than it 
received in insurance premiums paid by healthy banks 
for 1989 the fdic had liquidation expenses of 413 billion 
that compared to 736 billion it spent on failed banks in 1988 
although the bank fund declined in 1989 the drop was 
considerably less severe than the previous year seidman said 
a financial institution becomes insolvent when the value of its 
assets primarily in the form of loans it makes drops below the 
level of its liabilities represented by its customers deposits 
the amount of money left in the bank insurance fund at the end 
of 1989 was 1321 billion that represented 07 percent of insured 
deposits far below the 125 percent level set as a goal by 
congress 
by comparison in 1987 the fdic fund stood at 183 billion 
representing 110 percent of insured deposits during a year when 
193 banks failed or required government assistance 
despite the losses in 1988 and 1989 analysts said they believed 
the fdic would be able to escape the sort of trouble that beset the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp the sister fund set up to 
insure deposits at savings and loan institutions 
a record number of sampl failures pushed the fslic into 
insolvency forcing congress to step in with the costliest bailout 
in us history 
robert litan of the brookings institution said he believed 
congress had learned some painful lessons from the sampl crisis and 
would act quickly to prevent a similar occurrence in the banking 
fund 
in order for this situation to be like the thrifts you would 
have to have both a recession and a congressional refusal to 
recognize reality he said 
he said congress and the administration were slow to respond to 
the sampl crisis forcing regulators to keep sick sampls open while 
their losses mounted making the ultimate bailout costs even more 
expensive 
the key lesson we learned is dont delay he said the 
thrift crisis got out of hand because congress and the regulators 
did not act

key senators working on campaign finance 
reform are finding common ground in a desire to curb how much money 
special interest groups can spend independently on behalf of a 
candidate 
leading republican and democratic lawmakers also agreed behind 
closed doors tuesday to cut the rates broadcasters charge for 
political ads and to jointly tackle millionaire candidates use of 
their fortunes to finance their races 
there are some areas we have a good chance of agreeing on 
sen mitch mcconnell rky head of the fivemember gop team said 
tuesday after the first of what are expected to be dozens of closed 
meetings over the next several weeks we tried not to harp on the 
areas of disagreement 
mcconnell and oklahoma sen david boren head of the democratic 
negotiating team said members of both parties have been victims of 
11thhour tv ads on behalf of a candidate by socalled independent 
political action committees 
in very general terms neither side is very happy with 
independent expenditures mcconnell said 
as an example he cited the hundreds of thousands of dollars an 
imported car dealers pac poured into key house and senate races in 
1988 on the basis of how candidates had voted on trade issues 
the negotiations taking place in an office just off the senate 
floor are aimed at preventing campaign finance reform efforts from 
degenerating into a democrat vs republican fight like it did two 
years ago 
boren said they will be patterned along the two months of 
private meetings earlier this year that produced a compromise clean 
air bill passed by the senate last month and being debated this 
week in the house 
weve not set a particular time frame boren said but 
were going to operate under a rule that no decision is final until 
everything is final obviously some decisions on individual items 
will depend on what the overall framework of an agreement is 
democrats have insisted that any reform proposal must contain 
fixed statebystate ceilings on how much candidates can spend a 
majority of republicans reject campaign ceilings and are demanding 
measures to curb democrats historic reliance on unions for their 
getoutthevote efforts 
both bills contain provisions that would prohibit tv and radio 
stations from charging candidates campaign ad rates often two to 
three times higher than what commercial advertisers pay 
to prevent millionaire candidates from using their fortunes to 
overwhelm opponents in a spending race senate democrats would 
impose a 20000 ceiling on the amount an office seeker can 
personally spend on his or her campaign 
republicans approach the issue from the other direction 
requiring a wealthy candidate to say well before an election how 
much of his own money he plans to spend on the race 
if it is more than 250000 the republican measure would allow 
an opponent to tap wealthy contributors up to 5000 each instead 
of the current 1000 ceiling on individual contributions if a 
candidate spends more than 1 million of his or her own money 
there would be no limit on how much a wealthy benefactor could 
contribute to an opponent

the united states can respond to the lessening 
soviet threat by significantly reducing its conventional forces but 
must strengthen its european alliances says a congressional study 
the report recommended that the bush administration consider 
parallel paths of continued reliance on nato and attempts to 
make arrangements such as the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe stronger 
along one path the united states could seek to revise natos 
policies doctrines and forces to take into account the new 
political and military situation in europe said the report by 
the congressional research service 
the report suggested that strengthening of the csce could be 
done by a legal treaty foundation and institutionalizing 
conventional arms control negotiations 
both goals could be adopted at a csce summit later in 1990 
said the report released on tuesday 
in light of the push toward democracy in eastern europe and the 
soviet union the united states will be able to reduce its military 
forces in europe from more than 300000 to less than 100000 by the 
middle of the decade the report said 
us influence in europe would depend more on its political and 
economic roles rather than military strength 
stanley r sloan senior specialist in international security 
policy at the congressional research service prepared the report 
at the request of sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate 
armed services committee 
nunn said the study offers a thoughtful and wellreasoned set 
of policy prescriptions for us and allied decisionmakers to 
ponder as they prepare for the july nato summit in london

an environmental protection agency study still 
under scientific review suggests that there is increasing evidence 
of a link between heavy electrical currents and some types of 
cancer 
the study an epa official said tuesday shows that research 
over the last decade has established at least a tentative 
connection between leukemia and some other cancers and the slowly 
varying magnetic fields created by powerful alternating electric 
currents 
richard guimond director of epas office of radiation said the 
report has no original research but rather is a review of a 
variety of scientific studies of the human body effects of 
longterm exposure to magnetic fields created by power lines 
at one time he said studies showed no link between electrical 
current and human cancer the new report however said guimond 
suggests that there is in fact stronger and stronger evidence 
being developed as more and more of these studies are done 
after the report is reviewed by a group of scientists it will 
be available for public review sometime this summer probably in 
july he said 
until then he said we cant say that it is final and what 
the final conclusions are going to be

romanias newly formed government tolerated 
violence and voter intimidation before last sundays national 
elections says the coleader of an international observer team 
sen joseph lieberman dconn just back from bucharest after 
monitoring romanias first free elections in 53 years said tuesday 
the united states should supply humanitarian aid immediately but 
he said further aid should be conditioned on the new governments 
ability to move toward democracy 
there was a lot of unfairness in the preelection process 
lieberman told reporters some of it was intentional by the 
government party and some of it was unintentional 
a problem facing the opposition parties he said was a lack of 
time to organize a campaign against the governing party which 
dominated media outlets 
what happened on sunday was a significant step forward toward 
democracy but there is a lot more to be done lieberman said 
theyve come a long way they deserve some help but they also 
need some pressure to continue to move toward more human rights 
more political freedom and greater recognition of the rights of 
minorities particularly hungarians

nearly 30 years after the peace corps was 
founded by president john f kennedy the general accounting office 
says the agency is still perceived as a white middleclass 
institution 
only about 7 percent of the agencys roughly 6300 volunteers 
are minorities a congressional investigative agency found and 
through 1988 no minorities held any of the top 20 management jobs 
at the agency 
efforts to improve the peace corps minority profile in the 
past have been shortlived and costly the gao said tuesday it 
called for a longterm strategy to correct the problem 
the underrepresentation of minorities in the peace corps has 
made it difficult for the agency to teach foreign peoples about the 
racially diverse american culture the study said 
congressional researchers acknowledged however that the peace 
corps has historically experienced great difficulty attracting 
sufficient number of minorities to serve as volunteers 
part of the problem stems from the lower economic status of 
blacks and other minorities the study said who believe that 
they cannot afford to volunteer two years of their lives to peace 
corps service 
but it said minorities also tend to see the peace corps as a 
white middleclass organization

a judge says he will visit an exhibit of 
robert mapplethorpe photographs before considering a request to 
dismiss obscenity charges against the art gallery showing the 
pictures 
municipal judge david albanese also set a hearing for thursday 
to consider a request for changes that would make the indictment 
against the contemporary arts center conform to us supreme court 
obscenity standards 
the judge said tuesday he will view the photos before the 
sixweek exhibit closes saturday 
h louis sirkin a lawyer for the arts center applauded the 
decision defense lawyers argue that the 175photo exhibit doesnt 
violate obscenity standards when viewed as a whole seven pictures 
were cited by prosecutors 
the lawyer said he will oppose attempts by prosecutors to alter 
the indictment against the museum and its director dennis barrie 
sirkin said any changes must come from a grand jury not a judge 
barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and 
using children in material involving nudity if convicted they face 
6000 in fines and barrie also faces six months in jail 
more than 67000 people have seen the exhibit 
a showing of mapplethorpes photos in washington stirred 
national debate last year over government support of the arts at 
the urging of sen jesse helms rnc congress barred funding for 
certain sexually explicit works 
the museum and its director argue that the judge should dismiss 
the charges because the photographs are art 
senior assistant city prosecutor frank h prouty jr said the 
city wants the indictment to specify that two pictures of nude 
children in the exhibit include a lewd graphic exhibition of the 
genitals 
the indictment issued april 7 says the exhibit includes a 
photograph of a minor male child with his genitals exposed and 
a photograph of a minor female child with her genitals 
exposed 
prouty also asked to add a phrase alleging that five pictures of 
sex acts in the exhibit are obscene under the threepart test 
established by the supreme court in a 1973 decision 
that decision said that to be ruled obscene material must 
violate local community standards depict clearly offensive sexual 
conduct and lack artistic value 
the judge also agreed to accept a brief filed by the cincinnati 
chapter of the american civil liberties union in favor of 
dismissing the charges

investigators ruled out a design flaw in 
the collapse of five 50foot steel beams that killed three workers 
at ohio state university 
but officials said it may take weeks to determine the cause of 
tuesday mornings accident which also injured a worker 
the workers were erecting a fourstory glass and granite 
building that will house a state computer centerthey were on the 
roof bolting on a 10foot cantilever a section of beam that 
extends outward without the support of a vertical column said 
richard t lombardi vice president of turner construction 
the cantilever fell causing five beams to drop lombardi said 
he estimated 75 to 100 workers were in the area at the time 
the worker who was injured was listed in fair condition 
an official of the ohio department of industrial relations said 
the deaths were caused by human error or structural failure 
its real hard to tell how it happened said elmer waltz 
chief of the factory and building division but design had 
nothing to do with the accident 
waltz said the accident could have been caused by a worker 
misdirecting the crane moving the steel or by a bolt shearing away 
from one of the beams

few here were surprised by the 
landslide victory of interim president ion iliescu although the 
opposition claimed vote fraud iliescus success appears more a 
result of the nations communist past and its desire for stability 
iliescu and his national salvation front who have dominated the 
government since the december revolution that ousted dictator 
nicolae ceausescu will be the first excommunists to triumph in 
eastern europes current series of multiparty elections 
with nearly all ballots counted tuesday night iliescu had 
captured 86 percent of the vote and the national salvation front 
had more than twothirds of the seats in the twochamber parliament 
iliescus challengers the national liberal partys radu 
campeanu and the national peasant partys ion ratiu claimed the 
campaign was undemocratic and that the voting process was 
manipulated by the front in a manner reminiscent of falsified 
elections under the former regime 
but while many of the 500odd foreign observers agreed that the 
election had some flaws most appear to believe the results should 
be accepted 
gov garrey e carruthers of new mexico the official us 
government observer called the poll a good election and a 
very giant step toward toward democracy 
harry mccubbin a british labor party parliamentarian noted 
that the size of the results were getting would indicate that 
any errors at the poll would not have made any difference in the 
result whatsoever 
more than 85 percent of the 16 million eligible voters cast 
ballots in sundays election the first in which people had a 
choice in decades 
the victorious front portrays itself as a modern 
socialdemocratic party but critics say it is merely a renamed 
version of the romanian communist party 
because of its close identification with decembers uprising 
the front won a legitimacy lacked by other reformed communists 
most romanians view iliescu primarily as the kindly but 
authoritative figure who announced the arrest of ceausescu while 
bullets flew outside the revolutionary headquarters at the tv 
studio dec 22 risking his life to bring the country its first 
breath of freedom in decades 
iliescu who was a communist minister under ceausescu in the 
early 1970s now argues vehemently that communism is dead in 
romania 
when intellectuals accuse the front of neocommunism they 
are referring less to discredited economic theories than to the 
suffocating bureaucratic mentality they associate with the old 
regime 
indeed while the communist party as an institution is gone and 
many of the more visible leaders have been dismissed or punished 
the old bureaucracy is still firmly in place 
iliescus inner circle is itself divided between older members 
with links to the ceausescu regime and younger types with a more 
western orientation who press for more radical change 
this generation gap appears to be widespread in many cases 
younger people voted for the liberals or peasant party while their 
parents wary of a real upheaval which might threaten their jobs 
opted for the front 
the long years of oppression worked to the fronts advantage as 
well 
bowing to authorities is firmly ingrained in many romanians 
some especially in rural and outlying areas found it difficult to 
conceive of voting for anyone but the party in power 
romanias media are still controlled by the state and the 
opposition parties have accused the front of manipulating tv 
coverage to its advantage and of causing the paper and ink 
shortages and distribution problems that have plagued their 
newspapers 
while the front denies this iliescu has prevented the 
establishment of independent tv stations and alternatives to the 
staterun publishing house 
the opposition was hurt by organizational problems as well one 
of the reasons why it originally sought to delay elections 
iliescu benefited from the oppositions inability to unite 
behind one candidate 
campeanu and ratiu are elderly former exiles vulnerable to 
charges that they did not understand the needs of todays romania 
ratiu who spent the past 50 years in england alienated some 
voters by emphasizing his ties to the west and his constant 
references to my friend maggie thatcher 
the fronts ideologue silviu brucan said his party benefited 
by giving the workers what ceausescu didnt a 40hour work 
week here was a government that for the first time cared for 
their basic needs 
the undecided voters he said saw the front as the only party 
they felt could ensure their desire for tranquility romanians 
had reached a point of saturation with violence and tension

people who try to quit smoking on their own 
succeed twice as often as those who enroll in programs researchers 
reported today 
the reason may be that the helpseekers are largely hardcore 
smokers they said 
a 1986 nationwide telephone survey of more than 13000 adult 
smokers showed that of those who tried to kick the habit within the 
previous 10 years 475 percent who tried solo succeeded up for a 
year or more the researchers said 
only 236 percent of those in kickthehabit programs made it 
for that long the scientists said in the journal of the american 
medical association 
thus smokers who try to quit on their own are more likely to 
succeed but programs serve a limited but important public health 
role researchers said 
such programs are treating the most addicted most 
hardcore said dr michael c fiore head of the study and 
these hardcore smokers are most at risk for the terrible health 
consequences of smoking fiore a professor of medicine at the 
university of wisconsin said in a telephone interview 
forty million americans have stopped smoking but more than 71 
million are still puffing up to a third of whom try to quit 
annually the researchers reported less than 10 percent succeed 
each year the researchers said 
overall people who succeeded tended to be older and more 
educated but were equally likely to be heavy smokers 25 or more 
cigarettes a day as those who failed more than 70 percent who 
tried to quit had been urged to do so by a doctor 
the american cancer society offers selfhelp material for 
smokers trying to quit including supporting the annual great 
american smokeout it also has its freshstart kickthehabit 
program 
that program recorded a 14 percent success rate in a recent 
study led by dr harry a lando of the university of minnesota 
who agreed with fiores assessment that such programs tend to draw 
the most addicted smokers 
but the best group programs get 40 percent success that is 
for intense kind of treatment lando said 
smoking is blamed for 390000 us deaths a year about 13 
million smokers quit every year but their ranks are being 
replenished by 1 million people annually mostly young people 
who start smoking fiore said 
another report in todays jama said tobacco companies and 
federal and state governments reap more than 500 million a year 
from sales of tobacco products to minors accounting for 33 
percent of the domestic market 
the estimate was based largely on federal surveys of smoking 
patterns among youngsters on tobacco company sales and profits and 
on tax rates said authors dr joseph r difranza of the university 
of massachusetts medical school at fitchburg and joe b tye of 
baystate medical center in springfield 
thomas lauria spokesman for the tobacco institute an industry 
trade group called the report a preposterous economic analysis 
he said the authors start off with the erroneous assumption 
that the industry targets kids and extrapolate from there he 
added so they not only build sand castles in the air they fly 
flags up the sand castles

staff to president richard nixon who had taken office six months 
earlier accompanied his boss to meet the returning heroes 
the two men fell hard in the years after that july 24 1969 
meeting one disgraced by scandal and the other suffering painful 
personal trials 
now theyve resurfaced together in the 1990s pitching a hotel 
and business complex in postcold war moscow 
haldeman and aldrin participated tuesday in a signing ceremony 
during a meeting of the usussr trade and economic council 
they represent americom international corp an office technology

aldrin who suffered from depression alcoholism and two 
divorces after becoming the second man to walk on the moon is now 
an aerospace consultant 
he described how he managed to be in the right place at the 
right time 27 years ago in being selected for the us space 
program 
and i look on this particular venture here to open up the 
opportunities for eastwest trade again as being an opportunity 
coming my way and bobs to be in the right place at the right 
time said aldrin 60

barbara calif called conductive rubber technology and a real 
estate syndication business in los angeles 
when asked if the soviets he meets ever bring up that other 
office and residential complex in his life watergate haldeman 
stares and tersely answers no 
the reaction i find here and really throughout all the world 
other than the united states is only one of wonderment as to what 
on earth the country could have been doing to throw that guy out on 
what any other country regards as a ridiculous farce rather than 
anything of any major substance he said 
haldeman also admits to being a fan of soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
i can only say having observed one politician very closely 
with a remarkable ability for survival and recovery and watching 
gorbachev i have utmost admiration for his political skills he

wildlife officials went fishing for 
answers when anglers started hauling in salmon from a trout pond 
it turned out that two workers taking the salmon from a state 
hatchery to protected waters in a reservoir had decided to 
liberate some of them said carl prescott deputy director of 
the division of fisheries and wildlife 
the 850 fish their fins clipped for identification were dumped 
may 9 in snows pond near the small town of ware wildlife 
officials heard about the salmon bonanza in ware two days later 
prescott said tuesday 
somebody stopped by and saw all these kids having a whale of a 
time of it and identified these fish as salmon and reported them to 
us prescott said 
the fish are landlocked salmon which are about 6 to 9 inches 
long smaller than their betterknown cousins the atlantic salmon 
i suppose that the fish were probably a little scrappier to 
catch but there were so many at that site that the ease of catching 
them and the numbers being caught would have made some good 
fishing prescott said 
the two workers involved in the dumping face a hearing on the 
matter 
the men said that the fish were under stress so they 
released them prescott

canadas parliament has begun debating an 
abortion bill that would allow abortion if a doctor believes the 
physical mental or psychological health of a pregnant woman is 
threatened 
the bill has split prime minister brian mulroneys governing 
party and is opposed by both pro and antiabortion lobbies 
parliamentarians from all parties have proposed two dozen 
amendments most designed to tighten the restrictions 
the prochoice lobby is fighting the law because it says there 
have been no restrictions for the past two years and none are 
needed now antiabortion forces say the bill doesnt go far enough 
the bill on which debate began tuesday is aimed at filling the 
void left when the supreme court struck down a previous law 
restricting abortions in january 1988 the court said the old 
measure was arbitrary and violated womens rights 
about 60000 abortions were performed in canada last year 
mulroney supports the bill but has given his conservative party 
lawmakers freedom to vote their consciences the future of the bill 
seems to rest on how many of his legislators switch sides and vote 
against the government 
the final vote is scheduled may 29 
under the old law abortions were allowed if they were approved 
by a hospitals therapeutic abortion committee which had to have 
at least three doctors the life and health of the woman were the 
only criteria it was a cumbersome often agonizingly slow 
procedure there was no single standard and acceptable reasons for 
abortion varied across the country 
under the governments proposal the judgment of a single doctor 
would be sufficient to determine that the physical mental or 
psychological health of a pregnant woman is threatened 
requiring medical opinion on the need for abortion appears to be 
a gesture toward the antiabortion forces at the same time the 
justice department says the wording of the proposed law is broad 
enough to permit abortion on social or economic grounds 
it pretends to be a prolife bill said margaret purcell 
national vicepresident for the antiabortion campaign life 
coalition organization 
but under the bill a woman would only have to walk through 
her doctors door and she has established that she is 
psychologically unwell she said 
the prochoice canadian abortion rights action league opposes 
the bill for different reasons 
this law will make some abortions criminal said jane 
holmes executive coordinator for the lobbying group this is 
insulting legislation this is a primary womens issue 
prochoice advocates complain the legislation does nothing to 
ensure access in provinces like prince edward island where no 
abortions have been performed for eight years because no doctors 
are willing to do them 
the groups president kit holmwood said she believes 
antiabortion forces will press for charges against any woman who 
has an abortion 
they have done it in the united states they are going to 
take this law and use it any way they can to stop abortion she 
said 
the measure calls for up to two years in prison for a doctor who 
defies the law or a woman who lies about her health it says all 
abortions are criminal unless induced by or under the direction 
of a medical practitioner who is of the opinion that if the 
abortion were not induced the health or life of the female person 
would be likely to be threatened 
the canadian medical association also opposes the measure 
saying the government should keep abortion out of the criminal 
code the association fears antiabortion forces will harass 
doctors by filing criminal charges

sandinista union demonstrators sang 
nostalgic revolutionary songs outside the supreme court to protest 
newly passed laws that would limit strikes and allow the government 
to fire civil servants 
we wont let them destroy the gains of the sandinista 
revolution jose angel bermudez head of the national employees 
union told the tuesday night gathering of about 1200 
also tuesday a united nations observer group said 194 
antisandinista guerrillas were demobilized and a shipment of us 
emergency medical aid arrived by air 
president violeta barrios de chamorro who took office april 25 
had originally enacted the laws by decree but retreated when a 
strike virtually shut down the government last week 
but the laws were then passed by the national assembly which 
mrs chamorros coalition party controls 
the leftist sandinistas replaced by mrs chamorro after 
controlling the government for nearly 11 years call the new laws 
unconstitutional and plan to appeal to the supreme court which 
their judges still dominate 
the people voted for dona violeta because she promised to 
improve the economy not to have their rights violated said 
gonzalo araico a telephone company worker 
mrs chamorros coalition says the government is virtually 
bankrupt and the national payroll must be slashed 
the demonstrators led by former president daniel ortegas 
commonlaw wife rosario murillo joined in revolutionary songs like 
the wall its not enough to pray and the people united 
can never be defeated 
murillo former director of nicaraguas institute of culture 
said musicians and singers were reliving their days of opposition 
before the sandinistas took power in 1979 
artists didnt play in the street under the sandinista 
government because the rules made it too hard murillo 
acknowledged you had to talk to 50 bureaucrats to get permission 
to do one performance 
the 300000 in us medical aid including supplies of 
antibiotics and antimalaria pills arrived in a chartered jet 
tuesday morning 
the government embarrassed by the us congresss delay in 
appropriating aid for nicaragua trumpeted the arrival as an 
expression of us support and said it expected another shipment 
next month 
fernando castanon spokesman for the un observers said 98 
yatama indian fighters were demobilized tuesday yatama is an 
independent indian organization that fought alongside the contra 
rebels on the atlantic coast 
the contra leadership now based in el almendro 110 miles 
southeast of managua has said it will not order contra fighters to 
disarm because it cannot guarantee their personal security 
individual contras have continued disarming but at a very slow 
pace 
the contras claimed 15000 men under arms as of sunday while 
the united nations estimate was about 11000 
the 96 regular contras demobilized tuesday brought the total 
since may 8 to 1404 at 96 a day there would still be 9000 to 
13000 contra guerrillas under arms when the june 10 deadline for 
full demobilization arrives

stormie jones the worlds longest surviving 
heartliver transplant patient is out of the hospital and doctors 
hope higher doses of an experimental antirejection drug will allow 
the 12yearold to stay out 
stormie was discharged from childrens hospital of pittsburgh on 
tuesday after doctors controlled a mild episode of rejection of her 
second donor liver 
she could return to her home in white settlement texas within 
a few days perhaps in time for her 13th birthday on may 31 said 
her mother lois suzie purcell they were staying with friends 
tuesday she said 
stormie returned to childrens hospital on sunday after tests 
showed high liver enzyme levels a possible sign of organ 
rejection 
doctors raised her dosage of fk506 to control the rejection 
episode the japanese drug has been approved by the food and drug 
administration for use only at childrens and 
presbyterianuniversity hospitals 
stormie received a historic heartliver transplant at childrens 
in 1984 to control a congenital condition that left her cholesterol 
level 10 times higher than normal she received another liver in 
february after hepatitis damaged her first donor liver 
until november stormie had been taking cyclosporine an 
antirejection drug that lowers the bodys ability to fight 
infection researchers say fk506 is more powerful and causes fewer 
side effects 
modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400 
transplant patients currently taking fk506 said dr robert

united nations the un security council has decided to meet 
in geneva friday to hear plo chairman yasser arafat in what was 
seen as a compromise to avert a dispute over a us visa for the 
palestinian leader 
the announcement tuesday night came after the united states 
failed to grant arafat a visa to address a session in new york 
the 15member security council the highest un body held 
several hours of closed consultations on an arab request for an 
immediate meeting addressed by arafat the meeting is to discuss 
the escalating violence in israels occupied territories and the 
need to protect palestinians 
two years ago the united states rejected arafats request for a 
visa to address the general assembly and the session was moved to 
geneva 
this time however the united states did not reject or accept 
the request rather us officials said arafat did not personally 
make the request 
arabs seek to win us support in condemning violence against 
palestinians and thus wanted to avert a confrontation over the 
visa israel and influential us lawmakers oppose giving arafat a 
visa 
the united states a member of the security council did not 
oppose a move to geneva 
in december 1988 arafat renounced terrorism and implicitly 
recognized israels right to exist prompting the united states to 
open a dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
us ambassador thomas r pickering declined comment when 
reporters asked him what the united states had decided on granting 
a visa to arafat 
on monday the 22nation arab league requested the urgent 
meeting prompted by the killing of seven arabs by an apparently 
deranged israeli gunman on sunday and the subsequent shooting 
deaths of 10 arabs by israeli soldiers in the occupied lands 
arafat last visited the united states in 1974 when he addressed 
the general assembly on palestine 
the security council has met outside new york only twice in 
january 1972 in addis ababa ethiopia to discuss african matters 
and march 1973 in panama city to discuss the panama canal

a year ago miamis militantly anticommunist cuban leaders are 
playing host for a weekend of meetings seminars and parties with 
visiting soviet officials 
soviet political advisers including five members of the supreme 
soviet will stop here saturday and sunday to talk with community 
leaders before attending next weeks bushgorbachev summit meeting 
in washington 
the cold war is really over its a new era said soviet 
delegate andrei kortunov 
in the past miami has been the site of a militant sometimes 
violent brand of anticommunism a polish vessel was hit with a 
homemade bazooka in 1968 the city tried to ban miss yugoslavia 
from an international beauty pageant here and as recently as last 
year miamis calle ocho street festival barred anyone who had ever 
performed in cuba businesses and museums that do business with 
cuba have been bombed 
but cuban community leaders including mayor xavier suarez and 
jorge mas canosa the head of the anticastro cuban american 
national foundation agree that the world has changed 
the time has come to take risks mas said we have a great 
opportunity to convey to the soviet people that we cubanamericans 
are not the enemy 
the event called the moscow in miami presummit gets under way 
officially on saturday it includes seminars on regional conflicts 
and superpower relations sessions on glasnost and tips on how to 
do business in the soviet union 
there is also a lighter side including a party in cowboy hats 
at regines nightclub and sightseeing for the soviets 
cubanamerican leaders here heartened by the strained relations 
between mikhail gorbachev and fidel castro hope to take advantage 
of the soviets presence to persuade them to stop subsidizing cuban 
communism 
the soviets in turn are seeking landing rights for the national 
airline aeroflot in this gateway to latin america 
kortunov said moves toward greater freedom in the soviet union 
have changed the way people in his country see miami 
the basic vision of miami was as a city of racial tension a 
city of cuban criminals and a place where american millionaires can 
come to enjoy life at the beach he said 
now the image of miami is changing we understand that miami 
is the unofficial capital of the caribbean we also should change 
our attitudes about cuban immigrants here

an ee cummings poem that uses 
sexual imagery in telling of a mans reaction to a new car was too 
explicit for some school board members 
they voted to ban the textbook in which it is found 
the poem was open to numerous interpretations one of which 
was explicitly sexual susan zimmerman of the grand rapids board 
of education said at mondays meeting 
the board split 44 on whether to ban the book literature 
an introduction to reading and writing the tie means the 
textbook used in a pilot program last year at city high school 
will not be used permanently 
diane wakoski writer in residence at michigan state university 
in east lansing said the board should appreciate the poem for 
expressing passion without being blatantly vulgar 
there are sexual puns in almost every ee cummings poem 
wakoski said hes a great love poet and everyones loves usually 
include sex 
written in cummings unconventional style the poem begins 
she being brand new and you know consequently a little stiff 
i was careful of her and having thoroughly oiled the universal 
joint tested my gas felt of her radiator made sure her springs were 
ok i went right to it floodedthecarburetor cranked her up 
slipped the clutch 
wakoski was dismayed with the boards action 
i thought we had reached the stage in our culture where we 
could talk rationally realistically and sensibly about sex in our 
classrooms she said ee cummings use of language is 
discreet and practically genteel

and two other men to firebomb the house in a feud with a member of 
the family three of fraziers friends also testified he hired 
skinner to burn the house 
assistant prosecutor joseph p bednar jr said jurors told him 
after the trial there were too many inconsistencies in the 
witnesses stories to believe them 
frazier and the others differed over whether the bomb was thrown 
from skinners car and whether the arsonists had walked to the

harvard university has sold the stock it 
owned in companies that manufacture tobacco products because of the 
dangers of smoking 
the university decided to sell the stocks last september and 
completed the sales in march according to harvard president derek 
bok 
he revealed the sale may 18 in a letter to three harvard school 
of public health students who had been demanding the university 
sell its investments in companies manufacturing cigarettes 
in reaching its decision the corporation was motivated by a 
desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged 
in significant sales of products that create a substantial and 
unjustified risk of harm to other human beings bok wrote 
dr allan blum a houston physician and chairman of doctors 
ought to care a national antismoking group that pushes for 
divestment of tobacco stocks called harvards decision a 
breakthrough morally and financially 
this is a historic event that cant help but send a message 
that theres something rotten about holding tobacco stocks blum 
said 
sara ridgway vice president of public affairs for the lorillard 
tobacco co said the decision may deprive harvard of profitable 
stock investments 
i think it would behoove them to look at the best investments 
and our stock has done very well she said 
bok said the decision was based on an advisory committee on 
shareholder responsibility review 
he also said tobacco companies did not adequately answer 
questions about ethical issues in selling tobacco and their 
adherence to world health organization guidelines for marketing 
tobacco products in the third world

uncooperative creditors and trouble with 
federal wildlife authorities dashed plans by a bankrupt soviet 
circus to stage a series of toursaving shows 
the great circus bim bom ran out of money and had to halt its 
us tour on may 9 now us fish and wildlife service officials in 
new york are threatening to seize 54 circus animals allegedly in 
the country illegally 
costumes and equipment needed for the atlanta shows which had 
been tentatively scheduled for next month will not be released by 
a transportation company that is owed money circus spokesman john 
stallion said tuesday 
the combination of dilemmas effectively killed plans to stage 
the atlanta shows he said 
problems brewing over the animals stranded in newburgh ny 
were caused by a lack of paperwork circus managing director andrew 
trueman said 
i cant believe fish and wildlife is going to ship our animals 
back just because we dont have a 25 report he said 
the animals are here illegally said sam librandi a 
wildlife official in new york city we think they should be sent 
back until the problems are solved 
the 54 animals which include bears lions horses and 
chimpanzees have been under federal scrutiny since last week when 
a humane society official reported they were being kept in cramped 
cages meant only for transportation 
circus officials in marietta with the troupes 125 performers 
are trying to find money to resume the tour and said they working 
to correct problems surrounding the animals 
but librandi said his agency has gotten no cooperation from the 
circus 
animals brought into the united states from foreign countries 
are required to have wildlife declaration documents bim boms 
animals did not have the documents when they arrived in the 
country and circus officials have not provided them since he said

president bush recently counseled mikhail s 
gorbachev to shrug off the heckling he got at a may day parade 
suggesting the soviet leader ought to come join some of the 
parades i go to 
but actually bush has had it easy signs waved in his face are 
just as likely to make whimsical comments about broccoli these days 
as denounce us policy in central america 
and some hecklers have gone so far as to buy tickets to gain 
legal admission to republican fundraisers a form of protest that 
activists of the 1960s and 70s would never have dreamed of doing 
as he crisscrosses the country giving speeches and raising funds 
for republican candidates bush is seldom confronted with the angry 
crowds that dogged and sometimes drowned out other presidents 
it may be a sign of the times but protesters dont seem very 
angry these days 
last sunday bush was on his way to a speech in portland ore 
when a passenger train drew abreast of his motorcade on tracks that 
paralleled the highway two passengers a man and a woman 
recognized the president and both began making obscene gestures at 
him from the train window 
this went on for several minutes as the train and motorcade kept 
precise pace bush looked at the couple and nodded politely 
finally the two stopped gesturing and both began waving at the 
president hello mr president the words formed by the woman 
said 
a crowd of 150 to 200 demonstrators burned flags and newspapers 
the next day outside the hotel in downtown portland where bush was 
speaking 
there were a few arrests of those starting the fires but for 
the most part the crowd broke up peacefully when police moved in 
the signs carried by the protesters covered a range of subjects 
some protested bushs environmental record others dealt with aids 
the homeless us support for el salvador one targeted 
administration tax policy if his lips are moving hes lying 
and that was one of the biggest demonstrations bush had seen in 
months 
with the mixture of messages protesters dont seem to be very 
organized 
at an event earlier this week in los angeles where bush gave a 
neighborhood speech praising community antidrug efforts one 
heckler within easy earshot of bush screamed contras cocaine 
el salvador its all your fault 
bush looked at him quizzically oliver north the cia the 
homeless the man shouted repeating the same words over and over 
again 
bush shrugged others in the crowd told the man to keep quiet 
at two fundraisers this year hecklers who interrupted bushs 
speeches turned out to have purchased tickets to get in at 
several hundred dollars apiece 
more often than not demonstrators at bushs speeches complain 
for a few minutes then sit down and keep quiet 
protesters who show up at bush events most frequently complain 
about us support for el salvador bushs antiabortion stance and 
his position on feminist issues there also usually are several 
signs calling attention to environmental issues or lamenting levels 
of spending on aids research and for the homeless 
but there also are more and more broccoli signs 
ever since bush declared war on broccoli there have been a 
myriad of broccoli signs at bush events some of them nasty most 
of them goodnatured one proclaimed bush beats broccoli and 
bore a cartoon of bush in boxing trunks standing victoriously over 
a fallen broccoli stalk 
restaurants sometimes bear signs with variations on this theme 
we dont serve broccoli come on in mr president 
bushs tendency to meet with various interest groups may help 
mute some of the criticism even though it may also spawn it in 
some unexpected areas 
the presidents decision to include several gay rights activists 
at a white house ceremony to sign legislation to crack down on 
socalled hate crimes won him plaudits from gay organizations 
but partly as a result of those invitations southern baptists 
withdrew an invitation to bush to speak at their convention this 
june in new orleans

colonial rule

its 19101945 colonial rule of korea during which hundreds of 
thousands of koreans were forced to work as slave laborers the 
protesters contend that the japanese killed thousands of koreans 
during the war

economic dependence on japan 
japan and south korea also have been locked in a diplomatic war 
over better treatment of about 600000 ethnic koreans in japan 
seoul has asked tokyo to eliminate discrimination against koreans 
in japan who were forced to live there after being drafted for 
forced labor

a former wall street journal editor is suing the 
financial daily for 126 million claiming he was wrongly fired 
and libeled by a false charge of plagiarism 
jonathan kandell 43 who was fired as assistant foreign editor 
of the journal on may 2 filed the lawsuit tuesday 
the journal accused kandell of lifting uncredited material from 
another writers book for a page 1 article about three 
entrepreneurs in eastern europe 
roger may a spokesman for journal owner dow jones amp co said 
dow jones believes the suit is utterly without merit and the 
company intends to defend itself vigorously 
kandells article on march 30 profiled a soviet machine tool 
maker a czechoslovak inventor and a hungarian banker as 
individuals succeeding in the private sector 
kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three in 
their countries after hearing them speak at a november meeting in 
new york sponsored by the council on foreign relations 
he said that at the same meeting he learned of the book 
communist entrepreneurs and met its author john w kiser iii 
he said he later read the book once and put it aside 
kandells suit said he told his editors that he hadnt credited 
kisers book in his article because he had done all his own 
legwork and the book was not where he had first learned of the 
subject 
on may 1 kandell said the editors told him they had decided he 
should have mentioned kisers book in the article but emphasized 
that it was a judgment call 
later that same day kandell said he learned he was to be 
fired he quoted paul steiger a deputy managing editor as saying 
he had a gut feeling that kandell had not been truthful and that he 
had shown a lack of candor 
kandell said he was dismissed the next day after consulting with 
his lawyer and refusing to sign a letter of resignation that he 
said would have kept him on the journals payroll through june 30 
in his lawsuit filed in us district court in manhattan 
kandell contends he was libeled and his professional reputation 
destroyed by the journal he demanded 10 million in punitive 
damages and 264 million in compensation for willful wanton and 
reckless disregard of the truth and actual malice on the 
papers part 
he said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the 
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same 
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper the 
village voice about kandells case the village voice was not named 
as a defendant in the suit 
kandells suit also demanded the return of original notes and 
other documents that he contended the papers editors had kept 
knowing they would support his position

photographers and reporters and at one point stopped to pose 
let me do a nixon he said stopping to raise his arms and 
flash a vforvictory signal with both hands 
the columnist and writer of such books as fear and loathing in 
las vegas has said he never assaulted the woman who he says was 
drunk and pressured him to have sex 
defense attorney hal haddon argued pitkin county prosecutors 
cannot prove that thompson owned the drugs and explosives found at 
his home in rural woody creek thompson has said that the search 
was so extensive it may have turned up drugs left by party guests 
years earlier 
found at the house were a small amount of cocaine more than one 
ounce of marijuana tablets of lsd and the tranquilizer diazepam 
four sticks of dynamite and three blasting caps authorities said 
haddon said the explosives were owned by a friend of thompsons 
who used them to dislodge beaver dams 
supporters of the writer who inspired the character duke in the 
doonesbury comic strip demonstrated outside the courthouse 
waving signs like when the going gets weird the weird go to 
jail and today the doctor tomorrow you 
thompsons books are written in a style dubbed gonzo 
journalism because their seemingly nonfictional narratives of news 
events often include exaggerated accounts of his antics brought on 
by drug and alcohol abuse

the four warring factions in cambodia 
have agreed to sign a ceasefire pact soon thailands prime 
minister was quoted as saying today 
official radio thailand said the thai leader chatichai 
choonhavan a key mediator in the conflict mentioned a possible 
truce while speaking about talks on the cambodian conflict to be 
held in tokyo june 45 
if a pact is signed it would be the first significant agreement 
reached in 11 years of conflict in the past however all sides to 
the conflict have gone back on promises of agreements 
it is certain that the four cambodian factions have agreed to 
sign a ceasefire agreement soon the broadcast paraphrased 
chatichai as saying 
it said chatichai briefed reporters after conferring in bangkok 
on tuesday with foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam which 
backs the phnom penh government in its battle against the three 
guerrilla groups 
officials have said the talks are likely to focus on questions 
of how to monitor a ceasefire and conduct free elections as well 
as the role of the united nations in the process 
negotiations thus far have been stymied by quarrels over who 
should govern cambodia before the election various officials have 
said a truce should be reached without waiting for resolution of 
the political disagreements 
communist prime minister hun sen of cambodia has said he will 
attend the tokyo talks a thai foreign ministry spokesman quoted 
thach as saying he hoped hun sen would be flexible at the talks 
prince norodom sihanouk the main noncommunist guerrilla 
leader said in a statement issued in bangkok today that thailands 
army chief gen chavalit yongchaiyudh the main broker of the 
proposed truce persuaded him to attend 
sihanouk referred vaguely to the cambodian peace agreement 
which possibly i would sign in tokyo but he said the agreement 
would commit only himself since he recently resigned as head of the 
guerrilla coalition 
son sann leader of one of the guerrilla groups the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front also will 
be in tokyo at the time of the talks his office said 
it was not certain if the third guerrilla group the communist 
khmer rouge would participate vietnam invaded cambodia in late 
1978 ending nearly four years of bloody khmer rouge rule then 
installed hun sen 
hun sen sihanouk and son sann have spoken in favor of a truce 
but the khmer rouge which has the largest guerrilla army 
previously said it wanted a ceasefire only in the context of an 
overall political settlement 
the thai foreign ministry spokesman somphong faichampa said 
hopes for a settlement have risen because vietnam and china which 
arms the guerrillas soon will hold another round of talks on 
cambodia 
the united nations security council also will meet soon to 
discuss its role in the peace process he said

strife to come together to fight the common foes of crime poverty 
and prejudice 
the citys first black mayor made his plea tuesday before 6000 
new yorkers at a citysponsored rally on the edge of harlem 
when a few shout out words of hate we can drown them out with 
acts of hope dinkins said 
and when the instigators seek to turn us against each other 
we can respond by turning to each other and coming together to 
fight our common foes crack and crime poverty prejudice and 
pollution 
the most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of 
verdicts in the bensonhurst case the slaying of a black teenager 
by a mob of whites in the mostly white section of brooklyn in 
august one white teenager was convicted of murder a codefendant 
was acquitted of murder but convicted of lesser charges 
a black boycott of a koreanamerican grocery store and a speech 
by a city university professor who espouses white supremacy also 
have heightened tensions 
dinkins in announcing the citysponsored unity rally on monday 
said a silent majority needed to be heard above the voices of 
some activists who have been fueling instead of soothing tensions 
dinkins was joined tuesday night at the cathedral of st john 
the divine by gov mario cuomo and cardinal john oconnor of the 
roman catholic archdiocese 
for gods sakes why are we fighting among ourselves cuomo 
asked the crowd we must save our strength for the real battles 
for fighting the closedminded the skinheads the antisemites 
the racists and gay haters 
the speeches interrupted by standing ovations and cheers were 
broadcast live on local television 
about a dozen blacks picketed the cathedral holding signs that 
read lets take our peace justice and unity rally to 
bensonhurst 
the rally was followed by a candlelighting ceremony and 
singing led by the mayor 
we are witnessing the children of the immigrants and the 
oppressed fighting each other as never before he told the crowd 
the powerless are trying to prove their power by hurting those 
who are just as powerless it must stop and it must stop now

israeli troops today enforced curfews in the 
occupied lands confining 15 million people to their homes and 
palestinians observed a general strike to protest the killing of 
seven arabs by an israeli civilian 
hundreds of police reinforcements poured into jerusalem to 
prevent unrest as israel marked the 23rd anniversary of the capture 
of the old city and surrounding arab east jerusalem from jordan in 
the 1967 middle east war 
two jewish extremists came under a hail of stones while 
attempting to pray at the disputed temple mount as thousands 
marched through arab east jerusalem demonstrating israels claim to 
the area they were not injured 
two palestinians were wounded in stonethrowing incidents arab 
reports said today 
also today the israeli government sharply rejected us and 
european criticism that the violence resulted because middle east 
peace talks have been stalled the foreign ministry even implied 
that world leaders were encouraging arab violence by connecting the 
unrest to political developments 
linking the violence to the peace process is liable to be seen 
by certain groups as a reason to continue the violence in hope of 
attaining their ends ministry spokesman yossi amihud said in a 
prepared statement 
on tuesday palestinians in the occupied territories and in 
neighboring jordan took to the streets in escalating protests over 
sundays massacre of the seven arab laborers 
five people two in israel and three in jordan were reported 
killed and at least 47 injured on tuesday the third straight day 
of violence following sundays shootings the third death in jordan 
a palestinian accidentally shot by another was reported by 
hospital officials but government officials have not confirmed it 
in moslem areas of lebanon today a general strike to protest 
the slayings brought commercial life to a standstill palestinians 
also observed the third day of a general strike in the occupied 
territories 
in jordan relatives quietly buried a 14yearold palestinian 
boy shot by police tuesday during a protest in the irbid refugee 
camp near amman 
all shops businesses and schools ended a general strike in 
jordan and israel but a week of mourning continued over this 
weeks deaths black flags were flown on every corner in the 
streets of the camp said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
a similar scene was reported at the seven other major refugee 
camps in jordan 
in the occupied west bank and gaza soldiers enforced widespread 
curfews for a fourth day in an effort to curb the violence set off 
by sundays massacre 
in clashes tuesday israeli troops killed two palestinians and 
wounded 22 raising the toll since sundays shootings to 13 
palestinians slain and more than 800 injured 
the deaths brought to 708 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis in the palestinian uprising at least 216 other 
palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israel fortythree israelis have been slain in 
the revolt 
in jordan at least two people were killed and 25 wounded 
tuesday as police fired to disperse demonstrations in two cities 
and the baqaa refugee camp near amman the capital the official 
petra news agency said 
prime minister mudar badran pledged to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee safety and order 
nearly half of jordans 31 million people are palestinians who 
fled israel in the 1948 or 1967 middle east wars 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir defended his government 
against criticism by arabs and the us state department both 
over sundays slayings and the heavy use of gunfire by israeli 
troops during protests 
anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of 
israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and 
viciously distorting the picture shamir told legislators from 
his rightwing likud bloc 
palestinians charge that israels harsh tactics in handling the 
29monthold palestinian uprising and the governments failure to 
begin peace talks have increased antiarab sentiment 
there is no doubt that the israeli government led by shamir 
leads to such catastrophe said proplo leader faisal 
husseini the atmosphere created by such a government is 
responsible 
israeli authorities say the man charged in sundays seven 
killings in a tel aviv suburb 21yearold ami popper was deranged 
and also upset by an unhappy love affair a judge ordered 
psychiatric evaluation for him on monday 
foreign minister moshe arens said today popper had nothing to 
do with who is the prime minister the composition of the 
government or the policies of israels government of israel 
the man simply went berserk said arens a member of 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
president bush extended personal condolences to the families of 
the seven slain palestinians and those killed later by security 
forces he urged israel to act with maximum restraint 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher 
complained about the number of casualties caused by the israeli 
army and spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united states 
believes that absence of a peace process contributes to violence 
in the middle east 
shamir has headed a caretaker government since its coalition 
with the centerleft labor party collapsed march 15 over labors 
insistence on negotiating with the palestinans 
at the united nations on tuesday the un security council said 
it will meet friday in geneva to hear plo chairman yasser arafat 
discuss violence in israel because the us government has not 
granted him a visa to speak in new york the us government has 
neither accepted nor rejected arafats visa request saying it was 
not made by arafat personally

japan will block the goddess of democracy radio 
ship from entering its ports if the vessel will be used to make 
unauthorized broadcasts to china from international waters the 
chief cabinet secretary said today 
it was the latest setback for project organizers who hope to 
beam prodemocracy messages to china before the june 4 anniversary 
of the chinese crackdown on protesters in beijing they want to 
load a transmitter in japan 
if we give tacit approval to such behavior we would be 
inviting international criticism misoji sakamoto told japanese 
reporters according to an official of prime minister toshiki 
kaifus office who spoke on condition of anonymity 
officials said the japanese government has not yet received an 
entry request from the crew of the 1200ton ship sponsored by the 
french magazine actuel and other publishing organizations 
sakamoto said the unauthorized broadcasts would be illegal if 
the crew asks to enter japanese ports the government will handle 
the matter strictly according to japanese regulations he said 
japan is a signatory of the international telecommunications 
union an agreement that prohibits the establishment or use of 
broadcast stations on objects on the sea or in the air even 
outside a nations territorial waters 
the ship left france on march 17 and last week reached keelung 
in northern taiwan to take on supplies including a radio 
transmitter sent from france but customs officials refused to 
release the equipment on grounds that the unauthorized radio 
broadcasts violate international agreements 
earlier hong kong which reverts to chinese sovereignty in 
1997 denied entry to the ship 
china reportedly has pressured taiwan not to extend any 
assistance to the vessel and asked japan not to allow the ship to 
land 
the ship was reported preparing to leave keelung tonight for 
japan 
kyodo news service reported that nichiei marine service co a 
japanese shipping agent received a telex today from paris saying 
the ship would enter tokyo kobe nagasaki or naha in japan to 
obtain equipment and replace crew members 
officials of nichiei marine could not be reached immediately for 
comment 
the ships organizers have said they hoped to begin broadcasting 
to china before the june 4 anniversary of chinas crackdown last 
year on the prodemocracy movement in which hundreds and perhaps 
thousand died 
the ship is named after a statue built by students in beijings 
tiananmen square that was destroyed by chinese tanks during the 
repression

a scientist who resigned from a 
highranking position in nuclear weapons design to protest the 
governments star wars research has taken a new job at the los 
alamos weapons lab in new mexico 
roy d woodruff had been in charge of the lawrence livermore 
national laboratorys nuclear weapons design work and had stepped 
down to take a lowerranking job at the research center 
the 49yearold scientist announced tuesday that he will join 
livermores counterpart in los alamos the birthplace of the atom 
bomb after a threemonth vacation 
john nuckolls director of the livermore lab issued a statement 
saying he was pleased that roy has been able to work out a 
suitable arrangement with los alamos 
in 1985 woodruff was involved in a dispute with dr edward 
teller the designer of the hydrogen bomb and a teller protege 
lowell wood over research into the star wars system known 
officially as the strategic defense initiative 
he accused the two of making wildly optimistic assessments 
of a controversial antimissile xray laser weapon 
woodruff found support for his position among many scientists 
including dr sidney drell of stanford university and a nobel 
prizewinning physicist dr hans bethe of cornell university 
but woodruff complained that former livermore director roger 
batzel wouldnt allow him to give his own assessment of the xray 
laser to high reagan administration officials including the late 
cia director william casey as teller and wood had done he 
resigned his weapons post in protest 
after being given a much lower position woodruff filed a 
grievance with the university of california which manages the lab 
for the us department of energy uc agreed to his demand for a 
more responsible position and appointed him assistant associate 
director for treaty verification 
meanwhile congress began an investigation into his allegations 
about the xray laser and what role if any uc and the lab played 
in muzzling woodruff 
woodruff received the 1988 hugh m hefner first amendment award 
for his willingness to jeopardize his career in order to go 
public with a realistic assessment of the state of the strategic 
defense initiative program 
colleagues said woodruff has been unhappy over his treatment by 
the lab and uc which he felt should have taken a stronger stand in 
his defense

airport to the helicopters 
agriculture officials pledged to find someplace else to base the 
choppers before tonights scheduled malathion spraying of garden 
grove and panorama city 
the states medfly project lost its base at the el monte airport 
last week after neighbors complained about noise from the nighttime 
missions which began last summer 
cimbaluk ruled the state failed to prove an emergency existed to 
warrant an injunction the commissioner scheduled a full hearing on 
the issue for june 8 
meanwhile two lawsuits filed by the city of los angeles and the 
natural resources defense council and aimed at halting aerial 
malathion spraying of urban areas are headed for court july 26 
state assemblyman richard katz said 
these lawsuits are designed to end the aerial spraying and 
force the state to put health factors above economic 
considerations katz said tuesday 
agriculture officials contend the spraying and massive releases 
of sterile flies are the best ways to protect californias 
multibilliondollar agriculture industry from the mediterranean 
fruit flies 
they also maintain that the amount of malathion being sprayed is 
not harmful to humans or animals opponents claim more study of 
malathions health effects is needed

overuse of standardized test scores is cutting 
off education and job opportunities for countless children and 
adults who are not being evaluated fairly a commission said today 
the national commission on testing and public policy released a 
highly critical study of standardized multiplechoice tests and 
said educational and employment testing should be changed so that 
the talents of all americans are promoted 
we recognize that in the past some tests have been a positive 
force for numerous individuals and institutions the report said 
however the growing overreliance on testing over the past 
several decades deprives the nation of much of the talent it needs 
and sometimes conflicts with the nations ideals of fairness and 
equal opportunity it said 
commission director george madaus said the main message is to 
move away from a single test score to select people the way 
weve been using them to open doors to identify talent and to 
help nurture talent 
the commission report from gatekeeper to gateway 
transforming testing in america is based on a threeyear study 
of more than 75 reports by scholars as well as hearings across the 
country 
from 197285 the number of state standardized testing programs 
grew from one to 34 this year every state in the nation has a 
mandated testing program 
the study said standardized test scores often are the single 
barrier keeping promising students out of schools and competent 
employees from obtaining jobs or promotions 
madaus said today that more is at stake than simple justice for 
minority groups who tend to perform relatively poorly on 
standardized tests 
as a practical matter the demographics are such that these 
groups are going to be more and more represented in our society 
he said we cant afford any longer to exclude them from 
education and employment opportunities at which they would succeed 
on the basis of a single test score 
madaus said no other industrialized western nation has a 
comparable system of standardized testing some use rigorous 
examinations at the high school or college levels he said but 
theres nothing equivalent to the elementary and secondary school 
testing that we have here 
according to the study tests may mislead as indicators of 
performance and scores can be affected by numerous outside factors 
such as anxiety noise level of the testing environment and 
testtaking habits all tests are to some extent culturally 
dependent and almost always reflect the dominant or national 
culture in both form and content it said 
differences between average scores of black and white americans 
are fairly substantial the report said and in employment tests 
only 16 percent of black americans score above the median scores of 
white americans black americans have scored on average 100 points 
below white americans on scholastic aptitude tests 
in 1988 women averaged 56 points lower than men on the sat the 
study said 
hispanics native americans native pacific islanders some 
asian americans and other minorities tend to score significantly 
lower on many tests the study showed 
there is too much educational testing the study said noting 
that mandatory testing consumes some 20 million school days and the 
equivalent of 700 million to 900 million in direct and indirect 
expenditures annually 
each year elementary and secondary students take 127 million 
separate tests mandated by states and districts achievement 
testing is required for first graders in nine states for second 
graders in nine states and for third graders in 27 states 
the commission recommended banning standardized testing for all 
elementary students especially those in preschool and first grade 
four and fiveyearolds are simply too young to be subjected 
to standardized testing as a measure of achievement said the 
report the commission hopes as a result of the study many 
governors will rely on the findings of this report to back away 
from prior calls for more testing at younger levels 
in other recommendations the commission called for 
reevaluating the judging of the quality of tests the names 
given to them the way results are reported and the ways they are 
used no testing program should be tolerated that classifies people 
as unable to learn it said 
instead of merely multiplechoice tests candidates should 
supply answers perform acts demonstrate skills create products 
and supply portfolios 
evaluating critically the fairness and accuracy of all 
testbased classifications in terms of the opportunities being 
allocated 
test scores should not be used by themselves to determine 
kindergarten entry grade promotion graduation or employment 
opportunities 
assessment of the effectiveness of institutions and programs 
should differ from assessment of individuals 
the commission formed by the ford foundation in 1987 and 
administered through boston college is a group of education 
government labor and business leaders

a leading presidential candidate accused 
the united states and other nations of failing to do enough to help 
fight drug barons and a second candidate promised to seek united 
nations mediation in the drug war 
the nations of the world have an obligation to help us 
alvaro gomez said in statements published in bogotas el espectador 
newspaper today 
gomez a centerright candidate for the national salvation 
movement said he would ask a special un drug council to analyze 
earlier peace proposals by colombias powerful drug lords as a way 
to stop terrorism 
his opinions were echoed by frontrunner cesar gaviria of the 
governing liberal party 
gaviria said the rest of the world has left colombia alone in 
its violent drug war he said industrialized countries such as the 
united states continue to consume huge quantities of cocaine but 
are not doing enough to help colombia fight the drug barons 
authorities blame cocaine traffickers for killing 259 colombians 
since august when president virgilio barco began his most sweeping 
antidrug crackdown 
in the past 10 days five car bombs have exploded in three 
colombian cities killing 28 people and injuring about 300 
government officials said the new wave of terror is an attempt 
by drug lords to scare people away from the polls in sundays 
presidential elections 
the army and police said they are mobilizing 230000 troops to 
ensure peaceful elections in which 138 million colombians are 
eligible to vote 
military checkpoints have been placed on major streets and 
highways and armored personnel carriers and jeeps mounted with 
machine guns are seen patrolling the principal cities 
three of the four major candidates have hinted at some sort of 
accomodation with the drug lords to end the violence 
but gaviria favored to win the elections has said he will 
continue the current governments hard line against the traffickers

memorial day for many means picnics beach 
outings and the indianapolis 500 and that bothers people in this 
village that claims to be the holidays birthplace people in 
waterloo take memorial day seriously 
the meaning of the days been lost said joseph c donahue 
a retired postmaster and world war ii veteran he is cochairman of 
the waterloo memorial day committee planning next years 125th 
anniversary observance 
nowadays memorial day is thought of as a reason for a 
threeday weekend a day for boat races fishing derbies marathon 
races or fireworks theres lot of activities but nothing that 
really has to do with memorial day 
its difficult to say exactly where memorial day was first 
observed southern communities like columbus ga and columbus 
miss began paying tribute to their war dead by decorating graves 
as the civil war wound down said ruth semtner curator of 
waterloos memorial day museum 
carbondale ill held a community observance for its civil war 
victims on april 29 1866 
six days later all businesses in waterloo closed for the day 
while local citizens honored the war dead 
women prepared wreaths crosses and bouquets for each veterans 
grave said semtner the community was decorated with flags at half 
staff and veterans and townspeople marched to martial music to the 
three village cemeteries 
waterloo adopted may 30 as the observance date in 1868 when the 
commander of the grand army of the republic gen john a logan 
established that day for the national observance of decoration day 
the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars say 
congress decision in 1971 to shift memorial day from may 30 to the 
last monday in may so workers can enjoy a long weekend 
diminished the holiday 
while the two groups have lobbied to change the holiday back 
the people of waterloo never changed the observance date from may 
30 
its not intended to be a day of celebration the fourth of 
july is a day of celebration donahue said 
this memorial day in keeping with tradition the town will hold 
a parade to the three cemeteries with prayers at each site 
the central new york community made its bid as the birthplace of 
memorial day in 1965 and congress and president lyndon b johnson 
issued proclamations in 1966 upholding the claim 
many communities held memorial daytype observances said 
john genung a waterloo mortician but they all fell short in one 
way or the other they werent formal they werent communitywide 
or they were oneshot affairs 
while there is disagreement over the origin of memorial day 
there is a widespread accord among veterans groups that the nation 
should take the holiday more seriously 
were disturbed that its become a nice spring holiday to go 
fishing as we get further away from the most recent war people 
tend to forget why the day is set aside as a national holiday 
said vern pall from the kansas city headquarters of the vfw 
the holiday honors the more than 1 million american soldiers 
killed since the american revolution he said 
its a special day the lives we lost were special and the 
causes they died for were more meaningful than a day off from 
work pall said

the house voiced strong disagreement with 
current us military aid for el salvador in a largely symbolic 
vote that speaker thomas foley today called a watershed in 
policy toward the central american country 
foley dwash said tuesdays 250163 vote to cut military aid 
was a sign of new thinking on us policy and an indication that 
in some form military aid will be curtailed in the future 
propelled by bush administration lobbyists and moderate 
democrats led by rep dave mccurdy dokla the house reversed 
course moments after that vote and killed the bill to which the aid 
curbs had been attached 
but despite the murkiness of the situation it was apparent that 
a solid majority in the chamber believes continued human rights 
violations by the salvadoran military dictate an end to what some 
have called a blank check policy 
the american people and the american congress have been played 
for fools by the military and by extremists on both the left and 
right in el salvador said rep joe moakley dmass a sponsor of 
the aid restrictions this must end and it must end now 
church and labor groups which had supported the aid restrictions 
hailed tuesdays vote as a significant victory the widest margin 
in favor of curbs on salvador aid in six years 
the bush administration sought to dilute the victory by lobbying 
hard against final passage of the underlying bill which would have 
provided authorization to send new aid to new democratic 
governments in panama and nicaragua 
fanning the normal skepticism of lawmakers toward foreign aid 
spending the administration succeeded and the bill was killed 244 
to 171 
foley said today that having achieved a victory on the salvador 
issue majority democrats would move to a vote thursday on a 
separate 4 billion supplemental spending bill that includes 720 
million in aid to panama and nicaragua the bill which president 
bush has urgently sought had been held up by democrats to gain 
leverage on the salvador issue 
that meant the aid money along with more than 3 billion in 
addons for domestic programs wanted by the administration and 
individual lawmakers probably would win final approval before 
congress leaves friday for a 12day memorial day recess 
house and senate negotiators completed work on the 4 billion 
measure on tuesday after agreeing to about 2 billion in cuts from 
this years pentagon budget to pay for some of the new spending 
the bill includes 300 million for nicaraguas struggling new 
democratic government and 420 million for panama 
it also includes 110 million to help the census bureau complete 
its lagging 1990 head count 435 million for veterans medical and 
pension benefits and 166 million for the head start program 
various powerful lawmakers also won approval of favored projects 
for their home states among the largest was a 185 million 
automated fbi fingerprint facility for west virginia home of 
senate appropriations chairman robert byrd dwva his house 
counterpart rep jamie whitten dmiss and other southerners won 
inclusion of millions in disaster relief money for their region 
during debate on the aid restrictions rep lee hamilton dind 
noted that el salvadors decadelong civil war has cost 70000 
lives uprooted onefourth of the countrys population and left its 
economy in ruins while the tiny country has swallowed 4 billion 
in us aid i dont see how anyone could be satisfied with that 
record he said it is time for a new approach 
the amendment adopted by the house sponsored by moakley and 
rep john murtha dpa would have withheld of 50 percent of el 
salvadors 85 million in annual military aid this year and in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 
under the legislations terms if the government failed to 
pursue peace talks with leftist rebels the rest of the aid could 
be cut if the rebels balked in peace efforts the aid could be 
restored 
but bushs congressional supporters argued that curbing military 
aid would amount to a reward to the rebels of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front who they branded terrorists 
this makes the democratically elected government morally 
equivalent to the guerrillas who have never participated in any 
electoral process complained rep gerald solomon rny 
opinion on capitol hill has turned increasingly against the 
salvadoran military since the murders last nov 16 of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and her daughter nine soldiers have 
been charged in the murders but there is widespread skepticism 
about whether the killers will ever be brought to justice

some private security guards hired to protect 
british military bases have criminal records are afraid of the 
dark or fall asleep on the job because of overwork according to a 
parliamentary committee report 
some guards have even smashed windows at the bases they were 
hired to protect the house of commons committee said 
the report issued late tuesday was based on an inquiry into 
security at the bases following a series of terrorist attacks 
including the bombing of the royal marine music school in 
september the bombing claimed by the irish republican army 
killed 11 people 
there was a public outcry at the time when it was disclosed that 
private guards had partial responsibility for security at the 
school nearby residents said security had been lax 
the report by the parliamentary select committee on defense 
found the standards applied to private security guards hired by the 
ministry of defense were far lower than those applied to the 
military 
one committee member bruce george of the opposition labor 
party called their training abysmally inadequate 
as a result the firms offer a consistently unsatisfactory and 
potentially dangerous level of service the report said 
allan rogers labors spokesman on defense said the report is 
a fairly savage indictment of the government and of the whole 
process of security 
he called for government regulation of the private security 
industry 
of the 2000 or so military facilities in britain 56 use 
private security companies a spokesman for the defense ministry 
said security guards are used for lowlevel tasks to free trained 
military personnel for more important work 
rogers said the firms are hired because it is cheaper to use 
private guards than soldiers or military police 
some guards had proved to be hopeless physically incapable 
of lifting a barrier or afraid of the dark the report said a 
significant proportion of those presented by security companies 
failed defense ministry vetting 
the report also said it is evident that there is a very 
serious problem with the caliber of people employed by private 
security firms arising in part from the employment of guards with 
criminal records or propensities 
the report cited 
low wages high staff turnover and poor screening of applicants 
guards falling asleep as a result of working two straight 
shifts 
a significant proportion of guards who failed military 
screening 
cases of vandalism including smashing of windows 
the committee recommended the defense ministry not enter into 
any more contracts with private security firms until the industry 
is regulated by the government it said it should consider 
replacing private firms with soldiers and police 
the parliamentary inquiry also was prompted by bombings at 
inglis barracks at mill hill in north london in august 1988 and at 
clive barracks at tern hill in shropshire in february one soldier 
died and nine were injured in the mill hill bombing and one 
soldier was injured at tern hill 
after the inquiry began there were attacks at military centers 
in leicester and halifax in february and two bombings last week in 
london 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic ira is fighting to get british 
forces out of northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated 
province with the irish republic

orders for big ticket durable goods 
reversed direction in april after two months of increases and fell 
41 percent the government said wednesday 
it kind of a coincides with the industrial production report 
we saw earlier which showed a 04 percent decline in april said 
economist thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
it shows the manufacturing side is still sluggish and planners 
are still insecure about the future 
the commerce department said durable goods orders to us 
factories totaled a seasonally adjusted 1233 billion for the 
month the decline erased nearly half of the 89 percent gain 
during the previous two months after a record 105 percent drop in 
january 
but excluding the transportation sector orders for durable 
goods items expected to last at least three years were off just 
01 percent in april 
the volatility in orders the last four months is attributable 
to the transportation equipment industry the department said 
excluding transportation orders have been relatively flat 
declines in both aircraft and automobile orders in april caused 
a 143 percent drop in the transportation sector to 316 billion 
the drop followed gains of 234 percent in march and 101 percent 
in february transportation orders had plunged 294 percent in 
january 
both runiewicz and kris bledowski an economist with cahners 
economics in newton mass said they expect the manufacturing 
economy to pick up later this year 
investment spending will rebound after a year and a half of 
depressed spending that was caused by lower profits bledowski 
said and i would see a tremendous pull from europe that is going 
to grow this year much much more robustly than the united states 
that would stimulate demand for us exports 
runiewicz also said he expects consumer spending in the united 
states to pick up in the second half 
nondefense capital goods orders often a barometer of business 
investment plans were down 97 percent to 369 billion after 
rising 133 percent in march 
shipments of durable goods fell 23 percent to 1221 billion 
but unfilled orders inched up 02 percent to 4978 billion 
the one positive note is that unfilled orders are still on the 
plus side runiewicz said it means theres still a backlog 
there 
a backlog of orders means there less chance of production 
cutbacks and loss of jobs 
the electrical machinery sector posted the only gain up 45 
percent to 204 billion most of the increase represented defense 
communications equipment the sector had slipped 21 percent the 
previous month after a 28 percent advance in february 
nonelectrical machinery orders fell 25 percent to 218 
billion after being unchanged in march they had edged down 06 
percent the previous month 
orders for primary metals also dropped down 15 percent to 
116 billion after rising 79 percent in march and falling 42 
percent in february 
excluding defense durable goods orders decreased 45 percent 
defense orders were up 23 percent to 79 billion on top of 
gains of 06 percent and 183 percent in march and february

charges opened fire outside a courthouse during an escape attempt 
and the two men and a policeman were killed in the shootout that 
followed a newspaper said wednesday 
ten others were injured in the violent getaway attempt tuesday 
in the southern town of songkhla the bangkok post reported about 
100 police took part in the hourlong shootout in which the

defense secretary dick cheney said 
today there were problems with us nuclear artillery shells in 
europe but he said they have been fixed and there was never any 
danger of an accidental nuclear explosion 
a published report said some experts feared a possible 
accidental nuclear explosion if the problems were not solved 
it is important here not to overdramatize the nature of the 
problem cheney said i will simply say that there was no 
danger but that the shells in question did not meet the very high 
standards that we have i dont believe there was any cause for 
concern 
he declined to go into details of what was done to correct the 
problems saying such matters were classified 
cheney speaking at a news conference after wrapping up a 
twoday session with nato defense ministers was responding to a 
story in todays editions of the washington post it said the 
united states was repairing artillery shells and examining the 
design of two kinds of missiles because of the possibility of an 
accidental nuclear explosion 
cheney said he was not certain at what point the german 
government had been informed of potential problems with the 
artillery shells 
maj gen dieter wellershoff west german chief of staff who 
briefed west german reporters in brussels said the us had told 
bonn of technical changes on the nuclear warheads spokesman 
klaus naumann said the west german military was informed before and 
after these technical changes were completed 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said he saw no reason to 
demand immediate withdrawal of the nuclear artillery but he said 
the government hoped that a situation would come soon whereby the 
nuclear artillery could be scrapped 
in the netherlands where some us nuclear weapons are based 
defense ministry spokesman martijn verbrugge said we are always 
informed when the americans are planning maintenance on warheads 
stored there he refused to say whether or when dutch officials 
were told about the problems reported by the post today 
us troops in europe were warned not to move the shells until 
they are fixed the paper said 
the problem with the w79 shell designed for eightinch 
howitzers was one of three found recently by energy department 
experts the newspaper said 
a special committee will be appointed to review the w88 warhead 
atop the new d5 missile being deployed on trident submarines this 
year the post said 
and it said special flight restrictions have been instituted 
pending review of the w69 warhead on the shortrange srama 
missile carried by some bomber aircraft 
the w88 and w69 warheads use the same volatile fuel that 
experts feared could explode in certain accidents and set off the 
conventional explosives that trigger the nuclear explosives 
those conventional explosives surround a mass of plutonium and 
compress it from all sides to the point where the nuclear chain 
reaction begins and proceeds to cause a nuclear explosion in a 
split second 
the artillery shell problem was discovered by special computer 
studies using new more powerful computers in 1988 the post said 
those studies raised the possibility that a bullet striking the 
conventional explosive could set off part of it dispersing the 
highly toxic plutonium though not necessarily causing a chain 
reaction at least a dozen such accidents are known to have 
occurred in the nuclear age 
but if the bullet hit while the shell were in the artillery 
piece the barrel of the weapon might reflect even neutrons back 
into the plutonium to cause a nuclear explosion according to the 
experts thinking as described by the post 
the w88 was feared to be vulnerable to an accidental nuclear 
explosion but the w69 threat was dispersal of plutonium the 
newspaper said 
an unidentified senior military official was quoted as saying 
for a while we were worried that these things might go off if 
they fell of the back of a truck and landed in a certain way 
special teams early in 1989 installed safing mechanisms and 
the shells are being modified the post said 
energy secretary james d watkins though declining to discuss 
specifics or confirm all details was quoted as saying in an 
interview without any question safety has been preserved for 
the artillery shell 
i can confirm that the admiral was concerned about nuclear 
weapons safety said mj jameson the energy secretarys 
spokeswoman as to details im not at liberty to talk about 
that 
rep john m spratt jr dsc chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on defense nuclear facilities confirmed that 
the subcommittee had called for an inquiry by a panel of 
nongovernmental physicists into the safety and security of us 
nuclear forces 
spratts office released a letter sent to watkins on may 3 
advising him of the planned inquiry along with watkins reply 
agreeing to cooperate spratt said in the letter that the 
subcommittee knew the department was already taking action but 
believed that an independent assessment will be as valuable to 
the department as it will be to congress 
when watkins arrived at doe last year he learned of several 
highly visible safety problems he started investigating and at 
some point he recommended the creation of a subcommittee of the 
nuclear weapons council a joint doedod body which was done she 
said 
he felt that the secretary of energy should place a greater 
emphasis on nuclear weapons safety she said

argus leader sioux falls sd on president gorbachevs tour 
mikhail gorbachevs decision to visit minnesota has the 
potential to focus the eyes of the word on this nations heartland 
the soviet president will visit minneapolis on june 3 where he 
is expected to meet with business and agriculture leaders 
if there is one place where this man who offers himself as a 
visionary for a better world can learn about the american way it 
is in the midwest 
just as soviet premier nikita kruschev did during his 1959 trip 
to an iowa farm gorbachev will come in touch with the values and 
work ethic of people who make a major contribution to the strength 
of the free world 
despite political differences there is an intrigue with the 
style of this soviet leader that makes him more likeable than those 
who have preceded him 
there is still need for progress the summit with president bush 
offers one opportunity to further advance those relations the trip 
to the heartland offers gorbachev the opportunity to shake hands 
with the kind of people who have made a difference it will be 
worth his time

the times london on disarmament 
stressing the toughness of talks so as to claim noble 
achievements is an old tactic and president gorbachev and the 
american secretary of state james baker made full use of it last 
week in moscow 
with one exception the ussoviet agreement on chemical 
weapons washingtons references to dramatic breakthroughs should 
be read as expectations deliberately lowered on almost every point 
on the agenda for the washington summit on may 31 including 
agreement on a strategic arms limitation treaty start serious 
obstacles remain 
there is little doubt that negotiations came close to breakdown 
first the shadow of lithuania loomed larger over the moscow 
talks than either side admitted at the time second was the 
failure to make any real progress through the current stalemate on 
reducing conventional forces in europe 
this failure was a sure indication of the tension that has now 
entered sovietamerican relations

the marion ohio star on bushlithuania 
president bush defending his cautious approach to the 
lithuanian crisis could have called on emerson the 19thcentury 
yankee sage who once observed that there is action in inaction 
instead the president quoted a more recent yankee thinker 
i dont want to make the wrong mistake baseball hall of 
famer yogi berra is supposed to have said neither does the 
president 
his remarks recently were not as flippant as the yogi allusion 
suggests in fact they were refreshingly candid and absolutely 
correct 
the president said he wanted to avoid any action that would 
set back the cause of freedom around the world lithuanian 
officials reacted bitterly 
those same officials need to realize that their right to be free 
and independent is not the question the question has to do with 
such practical considerations as timing and process and political 
reality those considerations dictate moderation and compromise 
president bush like yogi berra understands that

the westerly ri sun on the population growth 
right now there are 53 billion human types walking this planet 
earth that number says the united nations population fund could 
approximate 15 billion in 100 years a scant five generations into 
the future 
during this present decade it is projected that another 
billion people will be added to humankinds total thats at a rate 
of 100 million a year roughly 275000 a day 
big numbers and they translate into big problems 
at the present population level we are unable to feed 
ourselves whether the problem be one of production distribution 
or economics the horror stories of hunger and starvation 
throughout the world are brought to our attention daily 
if the demand for food cannot be met now what lies ahead if 
the unacceptable pressures brought to bear on our environment by 
five billion people are trebled what lies ahead 
the united nations report says decisive action is needed to slow 
population growth the united nations is right and because the 
united nations is an organization that transcends national 
boarders it must play the leading role in determining what lies 
ahead as the un says the alternative to action is to leave our 
children a poisoned inheritance

grants pass ore daily courier on drugs 
two psychologists at the university of california berkeley say 
experimenting with drugs can be a sign of normal adolescent 
development and they question the just say no approach to 
completely abstain from drugs 
jonathan shedler and jack block concluded that adolescents who 
experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted than abstainers or 
abusers they say selfcontrol may be more critical than 
abstinence 
the study found drug abuse is a symptom of psychological 
problems originating in childhood and made worse by parents 
while some may misinterpret the study as approving of some drug 
use it did not do so it found for example that at age 18 those 
who used marijuana once a week or more were alienated lacking in 
ability to control their impulses and distressed compared with 
experimenters but it also found those who abstained were anxious 
emotionally constricted and lacking in social skills compared with 
experimenters the study defined experimenters as those who used 
marijuana or another illegal drug no more than once a month 
shedler said the studys conclusions absolutely do not mean 
drug experimentation is something that is beneficial but it does 
mean that some limited drug experimentation may not be 
catastrophic it could be a sign of trouble to come or simply a 
sign of normal adolescent exploration 
shedler says more effective antidrug efforts would identify 
at risk children who would tend to have drug problems later in 
life and counsel them

nintendo the japanese computer gamester has announced it will 
donate 3 million over five years to the pioneering media 
laboratory at massachusetts institute of technology the idea is to 
help children learn while theyre having fun certainly these two 
parties are equipped to do that but the sight of them shaking 
hands produces a vague sense of uneasiness 
commercially nintendos instincts have been impeccable their 
game machines now are in one of five american homes but charges of 
monopolistic practices swirl around nintendo american rival atari 
has filed an antitrust suit and the justice department has been 
asked to investigate it 
much of this stems from nintendos practice of tying its 
software designers up with exclusive contracts that prevent them 
from adapting successful games to anyone elses hardware systems 
to these charges nintendos president hiroshi yamauchi replies 
if our terms are so strict they make people unhappy theyre 
always free not to accept them yes they are free to walk away 
from an association with the outfit which controls 80 percent of 
the market 
but then these decisions always cost something as do the 
decisions on what proprietary interest nintendo may claim in any 
research breakthroughs this union with mit may produce 
perhaps its that aspect of things that pitting of ethics

green bay wis pressgazette on college athletics 
there are too many incidents of recruiting violations players 
who spend little time in classes and just plain bad behavior in 
college athletics a better system than the one now in place is 
obviously needed to control such abuses 
two attempts at imposing controls surfaced in recent days one 
is a good idea the other isnt if the good idea is not acted on 
the bad idea may be imposed 
the good idea was embodied in a washington meeting that brought 
together men and women coaches and college presidents basketball 
topics ranged from shoe contracts to graduation rates to tenure to 
recruiting violations 
notre dames digger phelps suggested that a sport czar replace 
the national collegiate athletic association as rulemaker and 
disciplinarian 
indianas bobby knight touched on tenure when a coach loses 
his job and we know hes a good coach we know hes an honest guy 
we wonder what do i have to do to keep my job knight said 
knight also said that a schools athletic scholarships ought to 
be based on its graduation rate 
louisiana states dale brown and north carolinas dean smith 
pointed to potential problems with the contracts coaches sign with 
manufacturers of athletic shoes 
the good idea is that coaches and university presidents see the 
need for new action to rid college athletics of abuses 
the bad idea was on display in springfield ill where a bill 
was introduced in the state legislature to make the ncaas list of 
recruiting violations part of the criminal code thats a poor idea 
for two reasons 
first such a proposal would add another complex duty to law 
enforcements list of chores abuses in college athletics are 
serious but not nearly as serious as other problems police and 
prosecutors are asked to solve 
second while the illinois proposal may die in the 
legislature it is a sign that people are unhappy with athletics in 
statesupported schools in effect introduction of the proposal 
says that if schools dont police themselves others will take on 
the job 
those in college athletics presidents and coaches in 
particular must do more of what they were doing in washington if 
they dont they will eventually see what was proposed in 
springfield enacted into law

a study helps explain one of natures injustices 
why some people can eat with abandon and stay slim while others put 
on weight with the slightest dining nono 
the answer is individual differences in what the body does with 
unneeded calories some folks tend to store them as fat others lay 
them down as muscle 
since building lean tissue uses up much more energy than storing 
fat fat makers grow fat while muscle makers stay trim many 
people seem to fall somewhere between these two extremes 
the findings come from a unique experiment doctors put 12 pairs 
of identical twins on diets in which they ate 1000 more calories 
each day than their bodies needed and they got almost no exercise 
when it started all were slim men in their early 20s with no 
family history of obesity after 84 days they had all eaten 84000 
excess calories but some had grown fat while others stayed 
relatively trim 
the man who gained the most weight put on 29 pounds and stored 
up every extra calorie somewhere on his body the man who gained 
the least added 9 pounds and stored only 40 percent of the extra 
calories 
it demonstrates for the first time that for a given amount of 
calories you have differences in the bodys response to the 
surplus of energy said dr claude bouchard who directed the 
study the individual differences are amazing they are huge 
the study suggests that individual differences determine to what 
degree people resist or succumb to the excess calories they take 
in when they eat an ice cream cone or an extra hamburger 
almost 40 percent of the weight gain is explained by the 
propensity to store in the form of lean or fat tissue said 
bouchard this is the single most important variable that has 
been presented in the literature to account for differences in 
weight gain 
bouchards study performed at laval university in ste foy 
quebec in 1988 and 1989 was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine in the same issue was another twin study 
conducted at the university of pennsylvania and an editorial by dr 
ethan ah sims of the university of vermont 
sims wrote that bouchards work will become a classic study 
because bouchards experiment was conducted on genetically 
identical twins he was able to provide more evidence to support 
the widely held idea that obesity is at least partly an inherited 
disorder 
when one man put on a lot of weight in the study his twin 
tended to do the same the study found that there was three times 
more variation in weight gain between pairs than within pairs 
the study also found close links between twins regarding whether 
they tended to grow pot bellies or big bottoms 
in the study the doctors first determined how much each 
volunteer needed to eat to stay the same weight and then added 
1000 extra calories to eachs diet they lived under 
aroundtheclock supervision in college dormitories and were 
allowed to take a halfhour walk each day but otherwise they did 
nothing more strenuous than play cards or watch television 
experts believe that other factors also contribute to how people 
handle calories these include their metabolic rates the amount 
of calories their bodies need to keep going while resting and how 
much they fidget 
all the extra blubber did not stick long to the quebec men they 
lost the weight within six months 
in the pennsylvania study researchers examined 673 pairs of 
identical and fraternal twins in sweden about half of the pairs 
were raised together while the rest had been separated at birth 
they found genes could explain most of the difference in 
peoples weights although there was a slight sex difference 
genetic influences accounted for 70 percent of the differences in 
fatness among men and 66 percent in women 
their childhood home environments had no effect at all on 
whether they grew up to be heavy or slim four years ago the same 
group found that twins who had been put up for adoption grew to 
have the body builds of their biological parents not the people 
who raised them 
in his editorial sims said the two latest reports show that 
destiny in the form of our genetic makeup has a great deal to 
do with the shape of our middles

ivan boesky brought his command of wall street 
to federal court calmly admitting to insider trading and giving a 
jury a lesson in risk arbitrage leveraged buyouts and deliveries 
of briefcases full of cash 
appearing relaxed on the stand in the trial of former associate 
john a mulheren jr boesky delivered his first public testimony 
tuesday since his 1986 plea bargain centerpiece of the nations 
biggest insider trading scandal 
boesky spoke in a deep strong voice occasionally adjusting the 
microphone when it failed to pick up his words 
when a juror complained she couldnt hear his answers he 
suggested he and the prosecutor go over the testimony again that 
command is usually reserved for the judge who put a finger over 
her lips in a hushing gesture to boesky 
later us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum had to 
admonish him for answering questions before they were asked 
resumption of boeskys testimony was delayed this morning 
because of a sick juror mulheren a diagnosed manic depressive 
told reporters outside the court that hes trying not to let the 
trial bother him 
when you face the kinds of things i face every morning you 
dont get upset about things like this mulheren said try 
being a manic depressive for a while 
boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count in 1986 and paid 100 
million in penalties he served two years in prison and gave the 
government incriminating information about a number of associates 
including mulheren 
boesky is the governments main witness in mulherens securities 
fraud trial the biggest drama could come later mulherens lawyer 
thomas puccio is expected to grill boesky about his own 
credibility and criminal past 
dressed in a charcoal suit and dark blue tie testified that he 
received inside information about proposed takeovers from former 
investment bankers dennis levine and martin siegel and that he had 
agreed to pay them up to 5 percent of his firms profits for their 
help 
he said he never gave levine any money siegel however 
received 800000 in three cash deliveries boesky said 
it was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts 
put into a briefcase and handed by an intermediary to mr siegel 
boesky said 
a fourth cash delivery was canceled when he received word of a 
securities and exchange commission investigation into levines 
dealings he said 
did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded 
on inside information from dennis levine asked assistant us 
attorney scott gilbert 
yes boesky said 
boesky who credited mulheren with saving his business from 
collapse in 1982 said mulheren was one of the few friends with 
whom he shared the information he received from levine and siegel 
although he never revealed its source 
mulheren 40 is accused of manipulating a stock price and 
concealing ownership of other stocks to help boesky cheat on his 
taxes and evade securities laws he faces up to five years in 
prison and 250000 fine on each of 41 counts 
boesky avoided looking at mulheren who once was trustee of 
boeskys childrens trust funds but later allegedly plotted to 
assassinate boesky when he learned the speculator had fingered him 
weapons charges were later dropped 
he wouldnt look at me said the eccentric mulheren as he 
left the courtroom in a red leather bomber jacket with 1940s air 
speed records stitched on the back 
under questioning boesky recounted his days as the son of a 
detroit restaurant owner and his rise to head of his own wall 
street firm 
he stopped now and then to explain a term to the jury he left 
the stand to explain risk arbitrage using a chart prepared by the 
prosecution 
siegel and levine the former drexel burnham lambert inc banker 
who first implicated boesky in wrongdoing have pleaded guilty 
levine agreed to cooperate with prosecutors siegel is awaiting 
sentencing

simple justice and workplace realities demand 
that american schools and employers stop relying on flawed 
standardized tests to decide who gets ahead a private commission 
said wednesday 
low test scores should never stigmatize an individual as a 
failure or permanently restrict the individuals life choices 
the ford foundations national commission on testing and public 
policy said in a report 
but the panel of education government business and labor 
leaders said standardized test scores are often the single barrier 
keeping promising students out of schools or competent employees 
from advancing 
the group recommended a series of steps designed to improve the 
accuracy as well as reduce the influence of the tests that many 
americans must take to qualify for everything from kindergarten to 
office promotions 
among the panels conclusions tests should promote human 
talents rather than inhibit them multiplechoice tests should be 
replaced with better methods of evaluation and test results alone 
should not be used to make any major judgments about a person 
the report noted that minority groups and women vital to the 
workforce of the future score lower than white males on many 
aptitude and achievement tests 
we cant afford any longer to exclude them from education and 
employment opportunities in which they would succeed on the basis 
of a single test score said commission director george madaus 
this report doesnt constitute a special plea for 
minorities said commission chairman bernard gifford what the 
report constitutes is a call to common sense it argues that tests 
should be used where appropriate to the task at hand 
the commission opposes standardized testing of preschool and 
elementary children but did not recommend a ban in its report 
instead noting that such tests are mandated or widely used in 
most states the panel said test results should not by themselves 
determine kindergarten entry grade promotion or later in life 
graduation or job opportunities 
the report said standardized testing has become pervasive across 
the country one state had a mandated testing program in 1972 while 
all 50 had them in 1989 it said elementary and secondary students 
take 127 million mandated tests a year using 20 million school 
days and costing up to 915 million in direct and indirect 
expenditures the report said 
for all the money and time and effort the report said the 
tests can be highly misleading they almost always reflect the 
dominant national culture accounting for the score gap suffered by 
minorities and scores can be affected by any number of factors 
ranging from anxiety to noise level 
students and jobseekers would be evaluated more fairly if they 
had to supply answers and portfolios perform acts demonstrate 
skills and create products rather than simply fill out 
multiplechoice exams the commission said 
madaus said no other industrialized western nation has a 
comparable system of standardized testing some use rigorous 
examinations at the high school or college levels he said but 
theres nothing equivalent to the elementary and secondary school 
testing that we have here 
the commission was formed in 1987 by the ford foundation and is 
administered through boston college its report from gatekeeper 
to gateway transforming testing in america is based on a study 
of more than 100 research papers by scholars and hearings conducted 
in san antonio honolulu washington and albuquerque

president bush spoke by telephone to egyptian 
president hosni mubarak but did not offer to increase further the 
number of soviet jews permitted to enter the united states 
secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
the arabs are concerned about the heavy influx of jews into 
israel many from the soviet union especially those settling on 
the west bank in gaza and in easter jerusalem 
bakers comments were in response to an israeli radio report it 
quoted an egyptian presidential spokesman as saying bush had told 
mubarak steps were being taken to enlarge the number of soviet jews 
allowed to come to the united states 
baker at a white house news conference said bush had spoken by 
phone today with mubarak 
however baker added it is my understanding that the 
president did not offer to take in more soviet jews 
baker said however that as many as 70000 soviet emigres 
already are expected to come into the united states this year up 
from 50000 in 1989 and 14000 in 1988 
so we are increasing the number of soviet emigres that we 
receive in the united states baker said 
the secretary of state added that it was his understanding that 
bush did not give mubarak a commitment to further increase those 
levels

a lawyer was cleared today of charges stemming 
from a scheme with former ashland oil co chairman orin atkins to 
sell confidential ashland documents to the iranian national oil co 
atkins who pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and wire 
fraud had been a key witness against the attorney charles barnett 
of palm beach fla 
a jury in us district court in manhattan acquitted barnett 
39 of conspiracy and six counts of wire fraud after a fourweek 
trial 
the government had alleged that barnett participated in a plan 
to sell the documents to the iranians for use in a lawsuit against 
ashland which had not paid 283 million for seven tanker loads of 
oil 
one of the jurors jack perlstein said the jurors followed 
instructions from us district judge john e sprizzo that they 
acquit barnett if they found ashland had defrauded the iranians 
we felt the defendant may have been guilty but we went by the 
judges charge perlstein said 
atkins had testified that after he resigned in 1981 as ashland 
chairman but remained at the kentucky oil concern as a consultant 
he improperly obtained 259 corporate documents and tried to sell 
them to the iranians for millions of dollars 
prosecutors alleged that barnett became involved through his 
late father barney barnett who was a close friend of atkins 
assistant us attorney herve gouraige said during the trial 
that the younger barnett was instrumental in getting the iranians 
to agree to the alleged scheme although no money ever changed 
hands 
the iranian company eventually sued and the case was resolved 
last summer when ashland agreed to pay 325 million to settle the 
claim 
barnett testified his efforts were legitimate legal work to help 
the iranians collect money from ashland 
during this time i was simply accommodating a client of the 
firm and an old friend of the family barnett said my feeling 
was that iranian oil company had been defrauded and that they 
deserved to get the money which they were due 
at the trial prosecutors presented a videotape of a secretly 
recorded meeting between atkins and another conspirator roy 
furmark who had agreed to cooperate with investigators 
the videotape showed atkins urging furmark to close the deal 
with the iranians because he needed money

a young dolphin that became stranded on the shore 
of the thames river died five hours after an elaborate rescue 
operation a veterinarian said wednesday 
it was critically ill when it got here and was suffering from 
pneumonia and a lot of skin damage through having been too long in 
fresh water john taylor said at windsor safari park 
a second dolphin has been spotted swimming with the one that was 
retrieved tuesday taylor went to the river wednesday to determine 
whether it could be saved 
it will surely die like the other if it is left there he 
said these animals are tired and sick after swimming about 40 
miles from the sea to the center of london 
after the first dolphin was rescued a veterinarian swam with it 
an isolation pool filled with mildly salty water in an effort to 
keep it alive 
the police fire service and royal society for the prevention of 
cruelty to animals participated in an elaborate rescue operation 
after the dolphin which they named phoenix was spotted beached on 
a gravel bank of the thames near vauxhall bridge 
taylor said the dolphins may have come up the river from the 
north sea in pursuit of salmon which have returned to the 
cleanedup thames after a 145year absence 
porpoises were also seen in the thames last week

president bush will press soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at their summit meeting to revive negotiations 
to remove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from europe 
secretary of state james a baker said today 
baker outlining bushs agenda for the may 31june 3 summit 
also said the president will try to keep the talks from being 
impeded by unrest in the breakaway republic of lithuania 
baker said it is important that a treaty be signed this year to 
cut us and soviet nonnuclear forces in europe 
baker failed to make headway on the issue last week in his own 
talks in moscow us officials said the soviets were reluctant to 
conclude the accord until they were assured there would be 
reductions in german forces as well 
but baker said the administration hoped presidenttopresident 
level of discussions can give some new impetus to the 
negotiations 
on tuesday a senior us official said it would be difficult to 
complete the treaty this year because of the german issue and also 
because of soviet concerns about the steadfastness of the east 
european allies 
at a white house news conference today baker said the treaty 
being negotiated by nato and the warsaw pact in vienna would 
change the map of europe 
baker said it was up to germans to decide the internal 
aspects of the unification of east germany with west germany on 
troop levels baker said outsiders could get involved in the 
discussions but here too the germans were in charge of their 
future 
apart from soviet concerns about germany and the warsaw pact 
the treaty also is lagging over differences about some of the 
weapons to be reduced and about anticheating provisions 
baker said the main sticking point is a dispute over which 
aircraft to limit he also stressed the importance of verification 
at stake is the destruction of tens of thousands of pieces of 
soviet military equipment he said 
on lithuania where the soviets have imposed a partial economic 
boycott to deter an independence drive baker said a longterm 
improvement in superpower relations depends on widening 
democratic values throughout soviet society 
baker said soviet policies in lithuania may disturb us deeply 
offending our fundamental values but he said there is too 
much at stake to dismiss cavalierly the potential for 
progress 
also baker said the slowdown in conventional arms negotiations 
would not deter the bush administration from completing another 
treaty to cut longrange nuclear missiles on both sides 
it is a very good thing for the united states of america he 
said so why link it

president bush should urge mikhail gorbachev 
to stop arming the angolan government so peace talks can begin in 
an effort to end the 15year civil war a spokesman for the 
usarmed rebels said wednesday 
the rebels want the issue discussed at the bushgorbachev summit 
that starts here next week said jardo muekalia the us 
representative of the union for the total independence of angola 
or unita 
muekalia said attempts to start peace talks were at a crucial 
juncture and the soviet position could determine their success he 
called the soviet attitude ambivalent with diplomats supporting 
peace talks but the army providing the angolan government with 
weapons 
the soviet unions leading african affairs official yuri 
yukalov was in lisbon on tuesday for talks with portuguese 
government officials on the angolan peace process 
yukalov said the soviets would not halt their supply of arms to 
luanda while fighting continued and might even increase it if the 
united states boosts aid to unita portugals lusa news agency 
reported 
the united states provides unita with an estimated 40 million 
to 50 million of weapons every year although the program is 
secret and exact figures are not available us supporters of the 
aid argue that the soviets give angolas government as much as 600 
million or 800 million annually 
muekalia said unita would require more american weapons because 
it had almost exhausted the supply provided in an emergency us 
airlift in january 
officials of unita and of the luanda government held talks in 
evora portugal last month and will meet again soon he said 
muekalia described the talks as exploratory but said there was good 
will on both sides 
he said unita agreed at the talks to recognize the legitimacy of 
the state and its president but refused to recognize the government 
as legitimate saying only free elections could pick a legal 
government 
however unita appears to have dropped a key demand of 
establishing a transitional government composed of representatives 
from both sides to arrange elections unita now appears willing to 
let the government of jose eduardo dos santos rule until elections 
occur 
the government appears to have dropped its demand that unita 
leader jonas savimbi step down muekalia said that demand was one 
of the main reasons for the failure of a ceasefire in june

jeanmarie le pen leader of the farright national 
front was ordered today to pay symbolic damages to 11 groups that 
protested his description of nazi death camps as a detail of 
history 
a court in nanterre ordered le pen to pay the equivalent of 18 
cents to each organization as well as 720 to each group to cover 
legal fees 
a hearing on the case took place march 28 le pen did not attend 
the hearing but he said afterward the decision was another move in 
the general offensive against the fn or his national front 
le pen 61 caused a scandal during a 1987 radio interview by 
calling the nazi gas chambers a detail of world war ii history 
he has denied this and other controversial remarks were evidence of 
antisemitism 
the national front currently holds only one seat in the national 
assembly but has received about 15 percent support in recent 
opinion polls its central theme is france for the french and 
it advocates deportation of immigrants 
bernard jouanneau a lawyer for the groups that lodged the 
complaint hailed the judgment as an important message to all of 
france and in particular to those who listen to jeanmarie le pens 
messages of hate 
numerous french political and civic leaders have accused le pen 
of creating an atmosphere of racial intolerance that indirectly led 
to the desecration of a jewish cemetery at carpentras two weeks 
ago a corpse was mutilated at the cemetery and 34 tombs were 
vandalized 
today about 15 people in the southern region of albi were taken 
into police custody for questioning but released later in the day 
reliable sources said speaking on condition they not be named 
several newspapers in southern france published a letter today 
claiming responsibility for the desecration in the name of an 
unknown moslem organization the letter purported to corroborate 
similar claims made earlier by telephone police have said the 
claims are under investigation but there is no indication that are 
legitimate

lithuanias parliament today offered to suspend 
some of the laws it has passed since declaring independence two 
months ago but not the declaration itself soviet television 
reported 
the supreme council of the baltic republic passed a resolution 
that offers to suspend the laws the brief report on the tv evening 
newscast vremya did not detail which legislation was involved 
the laws passed after the march 11 declaration include those 
governing lithuanian participation in the soviet army draft 
earlier today lithuanias president today encouraged countrymen 
suffering under the kremlins 5weekold economic embargo to 
survive as though we were in a surrounded fortress 
we are poor but well not starve to death president 
vytautas landsbergis said in a speech reported by the lithuanian 
news agency elta our main weapon is unity and stamina 
before todays announcement the baltic situation was settling 
into a stalemate as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev insisted 
that lithuania and its sister republics of latvia and estonia 
retreat from independence 
 
landsbergis and other baltic leaders have said they are willing 
to compromise but will not surrender their goal of seceding from 
the soviet union which forcibly annexed all three republics in 
1940 
gorbachev responded to lithuanias declaration of independence 
by cutting off oil natural gas and key raw materials since energy 
supplies were cut off april 18 factories have ground to a halt 
traffic has thinned out and 19000 people have been thrown out of 
work 
soviet authorities have blocked hard currency transfers to all 
three baltic republics but otherwise have not used economic 
punishments against latvia and estonia for their more cautious 
approach to secession 
nonestonian workers were striking at 21 enterprises in tallinn 
the capital to protest the republics secession drive the 
estonian government responded by trying to block food shipments to 
the strikers the soviet newspaper izvestia reported 
the strikes appeared to have little popular support 
in lithuania landsbergis said the soviet blockade was 
strangling the republic and radio vilnius reported that over 
onequarter of all industry was idle at some point during the 
working day because of the shortage of energy or other supplies 
the report monitored in london cited official figures that 
11000 industrial and 8000 agricultural workers were unemployed 
because of the blockade the sanctions have cost the republic 75 
million the report said 
beginning today lithuania said private motorists will no longer 
be able to buy gasoline gas will be reserved for ambulances 
police cars fire trucks food trucks armored cars hearses and 
agricultural equipment said algirdas brazauskas head of 
lithuanias antiblockade committee 
landsbergis told a news conference in vilnius that it is 
unlikely that the ussr will lift the blockade elta reported 
the kremlins aim is to cause riots in lithuania and make the 
republic surrender he said but lithuania will not capitulate 
our strategic task is to prepare the public so that we could 
survive as though we were in a surrounded fortress 
gorbachev met tuesday with the presidents of latvia and estonia 
but did not budge from his hard line against their independence 
gorbachev who sat down last week with lithuanias prime 
minister met at the kremlin for 20 minutes with presidents anatoly 
gorbunov of latvia and arnold ruutel of estonia the estonian news 
service reported 
gorbachev reportedly told them the same thing he told lithuanian 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene the baltic republics must 
either suspend or revoke their declarations of independence which 
violate the soviet constitution

a congressman on wednesday criticized the 
pentagons refusal to release videotapes shot by the military last 
december during the us invasion of panama 
what is the military secret that has to be protected said 
rep charles rangel dny who has filed a freedom of information 
request for release of the tapes 
in february rangel requested the release of all tapes shot by 
us forces during the december 20 invasion but according to the 
congressman the defense department has released a portion of the 
tapes while withholding tapes shot from apache helicopters during 
the invasion 
an army spokesman said the pentagon has released hundreds of 
hours of footage but chose not to release the tapes from the 
apache gun camera because it portrays classified military 
operations and weapons 
its not just videotape said col bill mulvey there are 
gun camera dials distances to targets 
in an interview rangel said he did not know what the tapes 
contained but noted published reports of panamanians complaining 
that missiles fired from the apache helicopters caused most of the 
damage to apartment buildings 
arent the american people entitled to know what they 
supported said rangel the chairman of the house committee on 
narcotics abuse and control 
the united states launched the invasion to remove panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega who faces a range of us drug 
charges and help install a democratic government 
in a statement rangel said release of the tapes to answer the 
nagging questions about the conduct of the invasion by actually 
showing what happened would be more in the interest of the national 
security than blocking the publics ability to judge for itself

four pieces of early 18thcentury silver that lay 
unclaimed in a bank vault for 101 years were sold for nearly 2 
million wednesday christies said 
the silver belonged to thomas wentworth 3rd earl of strafford 
a distinguished soldier and diplomat who died in 1739 the maker 
was david willaume a french huguenot and one of the three top 
silversmiths in london in his day 
the wentworth silver a pair of wine bucket an ewer and a 
basin was deposited at glyn mills and cos bank on londons 
lombard street in 1859 by a descendant who died soon afterward as 
did his executor 
the bank tried to trace other descendants but found none and 
the silver remained in the vault until 1960 when a family 
descendant claimed it and sold some pieces in 1963 said 
auctioneer stephen clarke the four pieces now sold were sent by 
a descendant of that claimant he said 
he said an unidentified telephone bidder paid 13 million for 
the wine buckets the london dealers armitage paid 632000 for the 
other pieces 
the silver had gone black when it came out of the vault in 
1960 but we have kept an eye on it since then and it is in 
splendid condition clarke said 
the record price for any piece of silver is 198 million paid 
at christies in new york last month for a 17thcentury sicilian

the senate voted 5248 today to restrict the 
import and manufacture of semiautomatic assault weapons handing a 
surprising defeat to the national rifle association 
these are combat weapons sen dennis deconcini dariz 
said shortly before the vote to bar imports of five foreignmade 
assault weapons and ban domestic manufacture of four others 
the vote came as lawmakers worked on a larger anticrime bill 
that also includes provisions to restore capital punishment for 30 
federal crimes including presidential assassination 
opponents of the restrictions immediately called for 
reconsideration of the decision but the senate voted 5049 not to 
reconsider 
the first vote on semiautomatic weapons came on a move by sen 
orrin hatch rutah to strip from the legislation the restrictions 
on nine different types of weapons the outcome represented a 
stunning setback for the national rifle association which had 
lobbied hard to kill the curbs supporters of the ban had said over 
the weekend they held little hope of winning 
they said they expected to face opposition on the campaign trail 
this fall because of the legislation 
senate critics called for tougher criminal penalties in place of 
curbs on guns 
lets try em and fry em sen alan simpson rwyo told 
the senate tuesday night that will start a lot of action in the 
united states and we wont have to worry about this stuff 
deconcini the chief sponsor of the restrictions scoffed at 
claims that they would place a burden on the hunters he pointed to 
a picture of a street sweeper a sinisterlooking rounddrummed 
semiautomatic shotgun of african origin that he called an 
apartheid control weapon 
its not going to be used on deer because it would absolutely 
blow the deer to pieces deconcini said but hatch told the 
senate that there is nothing in the constitution that limits the 
2nd amendment to ownership of guns for hunting 
there is no legislation in the house at present corresponding to 
the senate crime bill 
the bill would ban the import of five types of semiautomatic 
assault weapons and outlaw the manufacture of four others in this 
country 
other provisions would restore capital punishment for 30 federal 
crimes including presidential assassination the measure would 
overhaul the way courts review the constitutionality of criminal 
trials 
it would allow use of evidence gathered with flawed warrants and 
fine tune the moneylaundering laws it also would allow death row 
inmates to use statistics to prove claims that their sentences were 
the result of racial bias 
a campaign for curbs on assault weapons began in january 1989 
after a deranged gunman with an ak47 semiautomatic assault rifle 
opened fire on a stockton calif school yard at recess time 
leaving five children dead and 30 others wounded 
the senate held its first vote on the issue tuesday killing 
8217 an attempt by sen howard metzenbaum dohio to enlarge the 
list of banned weapons from nine to 21 two republicans joined 15 
democrats in the futile attempt to keep the measure alive 
metzenbaum sought to assure lawmakers that they could weather 
criticism from the national rifle association 
let us show some courage here today he said let us stand 
up to the national rifle association and stand up with the police 
officers of this country 
i know the political liability it is no secret that some of 
the people on my staff are urging me not to vote for this 
sen paul simon dill said at another point but he added 
were not going to be around here forever and we ought to be 
thinking about what we can contribute 
we face the choice of siding with the gun lobby or the law 
enforcement people and my friends in that choice im going to 
stick with the law enforcement people simon added 
police group representatives earlier urged the senate to approve 
the ban 
the nra has almost completely alienated law enforcement 
were not divorced but were estranged said baltimore police 
col lj suspenski he said he had resigned from the nra because 
of its position on the legislation 
the bill initially was part of the bush administrations 
anticrime package but has long since been reshaped by majority 
democrats led by senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr 
ddel the administration now opposes the measure

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today that chinas human rights record should not be the only 
factor in a decision to extend trade benefits for that country 
some members of congress say bush faces a heated battle if as 
expected the administration announces thursday a decision to 
extend the benefits 
while stopping short of actually announcing bushs decision 
baker listed reasons at a white house news conference why the 
preferential trade status should be extended 
the real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you 
terminate it baker said 
he said withdrawing the benefits would have a negative impact 
among reformers in the chinese government would damage the 
economy of hong kong and would hurt very significant and 
substantial us economic interests in china 
baker said chinas human rights record in the aftermath of the 
bloody crackdown june 4 1989 on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
tiananmen square was one of the factors but it should not be 
the only factor in the decision 
despite the threat of a confrontation with congress senior 
administration officials said bush would propose a oneyear 
extension of the mostfavorednation preferential tariff treatment 
for china 
bush solicited comments from republican leaders tuesday he was 
contacting democrats by telephone today said white house deputy 
press secretary alixe glen 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has opposed 
giving more trade benefits to china and has urged bush to overhaul 
us policy toward china 
by its actions the bush administration is sowing the seeds of 
disaster with respect to the next generation of leaders in china 
mitchell said 
like other despots before them the chinese government of 
today will pass from the scene in time the question and the 
challenge for the senate is whether we will continue to support a 
regime which caused the deaths of many of their own people he 
said 
mitchell narrowly lost a congressional fight with bush earlier 
this year over legislation dealing with chinese visas 
one key house democrat rep stephen solarz dny criticized 
bush for failing to build a consensus on china policy 
solarz is chairman of a house subcommittee on asia which 
canceled a planned hearing today to explore chinas trade status 
with richard solomon an assistant secretary of state solarz 
office said the administration asked for a postponement of the 
hearing because it was not ready to testify on the issue 
meanwhile congressional aides said bush was expected to make 
his decision on the matter public thursday 
if the trade issue is not handled in an appropriate way it 
will set the stage for what will be i think a very divisive 
debate here in the congress not on a partisan basis by the way 
he said 
solarz said he is not opposed to extending mostfavorednation 
status but he wants bush to put attach strings to the extension 
administration officials say some conditions will be included 
in bushs trade extension as a way of expressing displeasure over 
chinas human rights 
mostfavorednation status gives china the same trade benefits 
including lowestpossible tariffs that the united states extends 
to most of its major trading partners 
cancellation of the benefits would cause tariffs to rise sharply 
on some 12 billion in annual chinese exports 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif a supporter of chinas students in 
the united states said she wouldnt vote for mostfavorednation 
status for china 
her main concern however is the 450 million in loans the 
world bank is scheduled to consider later this month mrs pelosi 
would like the united states to block the loans 
several republicans including house minority leader robert 
michel rill said they would go along with bushs apparent 
attempt to extend trade benefits 
but the sentiment was not unanimous 
i know the president thinks he has good reason american 
business interests said rep mickey edwards rokla chairman 
of the republican policy committee but im bothered by the idea 
of granting special treatment to china he said 
edwards said china has cracked down more not less on human 
rights since tiananmen square 
edwards predicted bush could probably win a congressional fight 
on china 
congress could block bushs decision but only by passing a 
resolution of disapproval that in turn could be vetoed and 
it takes twothirds votes in both houses to override a veto 
by a single vote in january the senate sustained bushs veto of 
a bill to extend the visas of chinese students in the united 
states bush argued that he was offering the chinese students the 
same safe haven through administrative actions 
on tuesday the independent federation of chinese students and 
scholars asked bush to suspend chinas mostfavorednation status 
to demonstrate us commitment to democracy and human rights in 
china 
the federation says it represents some 40000 students at more 
than 200 universities in the united states

nato defense ministers today called for 
a quick eastwest accord to slash troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear arms in europe to wipe out the chances of a surprise 
attack by the soviet union 
we appeal to the soviet union to show a constructive 
attitude said nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner at the end 
of two days of talks by defense ministers of north atlantic treaty 
organization members 
us defense secretary dick cheney joined his counterparts in 
the western alliance by urging the kremlin to speed up progress on 
negotiating a conventional arms agreement this year 
the ball is in their court we are eager to negotiate such 
an agreement cheney said 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
that president bush will press soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev at their summit meeting may 31june 3 to revive 
negotiations to remove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from 
europe baker said it is important that a treaty be signed this 
year to cut us and soviet nonnuclear forces in europe 
western officials have complained in recent weeks of soviet 
footdragging at the vienna talks between negotiators of the 16 
nato nations and the seven of the sovietled warsaw pact 
the nato defense chiefs said in a final statement that an 
accord along with other security measures will virtually 
eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack on nato as a whole 
by vastly superior conventional forces 
as a result the minimum warning time for any largescale 
offensive operation will substantially increase the statement 
said 
the officials said they also decided to lower the readiness 
and availability of some of their forces 
cheney said that with the collapse of the warsaw pact its 
not unreasonable for us to think that we would not have to 
maintain the same high state of readiness that we have in the 
past 
the ministers noted they have already reduced the number of 
military exercises for their soldiers and planned to make further 
substantial reductions in the training programs 
many of these exercises are conducted in west germany and 
residents have grown increasingly tired of having their lands 
overrun by tanks and being subjected to noise from lowlevel 
flights 
the ministers as expected called for a review of their own 
military strategy in light of the dramatically reduced eastwest 
tensions they also asked military authorities to look into forming 
multinational forces drawing soldiers from the different nato 
nations to create joint divisions 
no deadline was set for nato analysts to come up with a report 
president bush has urged that the summit participants launch a 
wideranging nato strategy review for the transformed europe of 
the 1990s 
the ministers confirmed they have scrapped a guideline in 
effect since the late 1970s calling for a 3 percent annual 
increase in defense spending by each alliance nation the target 
they said was no longer appropriate 
many nations have failed in recent years to reach that goal and 
even fewer are likely to meet it now 
british defense secretary tom king on tuesday raised the 
possibility that an eastwest deal to cut forces in europe would 
not be reached this year which would be a serious setback to 
western hopes for rapid arms control deals 
the two sides are still trying to agree on a ceiling for combat 
aircraft and on measures to verify compliance once a treaty is 
reached 
the united states currently has 305000 troops in europe while 
the soviets have an estimated 565000 soldiers 
moscow and washington have settled on a plan to trim their 
forces to 195000 for each side in central europe with the united 
states retaining an additional 30000 in britain and southern 
europe 
the nato alliance is under pressure to respond to the momentous 
changes in eastern europe by emphasizing its role as a political 
organization rather than a military pact 
it is battling some calls in europe that it and the sovietled 
warsaw pact be scrapped and replaced by an umbrella security 
organization that organization would be formed from the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe a 35nation forum for 
discussions on human rights and other issues

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev attacked 
maverick communist boris yeltsins campaign platform for the 
russian presidency on wednesday accusing him of working toward 
the breakup of the soviet union 
gorbachev launched the quick sharp attack on yeltsin at the 
russian congress which he has attended as a silent observer over 
the past week his speech exposed the deep concern that led him to 
sit through hours of tedious procedural debates 
yeltsins plan for wresting control of the russian republic from 
the kremlin and allowing it to set its own policies amounts to an 
attempt to cut russia off from socialism gorbachev said 
that will contradict the line of perestroika which we 
proposed to give a second wind to socialism on the road to 
democratization he said can we do without russia if she 
decides to go another route 
russia is the largest of the 15 soviet republics with just over 
half the countrys population and twothirds of its territory 
in russias secondlargest city leningrad outspoken reformer 
anatoly sobchak was elected mayor wednesday the official soviet 
news agency tass reported sobchak is a lawyer and member of the 
national legislature who has frequently clashed with soviet 
authorities he received 223 votes out of 320 in the leningrad 
council of peoples deputies the local parliament he faced two 
opponents 
gavrill popov the mayor of moscow the countrys largest city 
is also an outspoken reformer and member of the same opposition 
group as sobchak 
the russian congress is expected to end discussions on 
sovereignty on thursday and turn to nominations for president the 
president is chosen by the 1059member congress rather than in 
general elections the current president is vitaly vorotnikov 
yeltsin a populist who won the backing of millions with his 
calls to speed reforms and do away with privileges for the elite 
is the only contender for the presidency who has announced his 
candidacy he has said he expects to face alexander vlasov the 
current premier of russia and cannot predict whether he will win 
yeltsins speech tuesday on russian sovereignty proposed 
economic independence for the vast republic and said it should have 
the final say over whether soviet laws and decrees were valid on 
its territory 
a serious analysis shows what he suggests under the banner of 
restoration of russias sovereignty means a call to the breakup of 
the soviet union gorbachev charged 
some observers at the congress suggested gorbachevs overt 
intervention in the race for president which could be seen as 
inappropriate because he is not even a member of the congress 
would backfire and cause more deputies to vote for yeltsin others 
said his main goal had been to get across to obedient deputies 
their duty to vote against yeltsin and in that he surely succeeded 
the congress was generally raucous with a major disruption in 
the morning and loud heckling during gorbachevs speech 
in the morning deputies shouted shame shame and jeered a 
monarchist colleague who erected a small redwhiteandblue flag 
the symbol of czarist russia on his desk he was forced to remove 
it 
when gorbachev was speaking hecklers led him to retort 
youre active but ive met up with more active people 
he accused yeltsin of being confrontational and appealed 
for greater harmony to allow reforms to move forward 
yeltsin was gorbachevs protege at one point but in the past 
two years has become his most vocal public critic gorbachev has 
rarely responded to yeltsins criticism with direct 
counterattacks but he has complained several times of radical 
demagogues who care more about their own ambitions than the 
good of the people

hundreds of cubanamericans who came to 
washington to celebrate cuban independence day with president bush 
went home disappointed after the white house canceled the outdoor 
ceremony due to the threat of rain 
but several hundred others who showed up anyway at the white 
house gates tuesday were treated to a tour of the mansion and an 
east room rally where bush made a surprise appearance 
the standingroomonly crowd of 350 gave bush a tumultuous 
welcome as he strode into the east room just as vice president dan 
quayle finished a speech denouncing cubas fidel castro 
bush called cuba the only holdout against democracy and 
freedom in this hemisphere 
i am convinced in my own heart that it will not be very long 
before cuba is totally democratic and free he told the exiles 
and their families 
we are going to keep broadcasting the truth to cuba bush 
said of his tv marti broadcasts to the island which castro has 
jammed we will keep the pressure on 
quayle said he hoped next year we will celebrate cuban 
independence in havana 
david demarest who decided to cancel the event said wednesday 
that it probably was the right decision 
demarest white house communications director estimated a 
couple of hundred other cubanamericans came from miami and other 
distant places and never got into the white house 
although it poured tuesday morning and was raining as late as 1 
pm the sun was shining when bush spoke at 225 pm 
demarest said 1900 guests were expected on the south lawn 
which was soup when he decided at 8 am to cancel the event 
the tickets all say its canceled in case of inclement 
weather he said we sent some people to the miami airport to 
try to notify people 
but hundreds still came by plane and by bus from new york new 
jersey and elsewhere 
demarest hastily arranged the east room rally where the 
visitors sang the cuban national anthen and heard from cubanborn 
rep ileana roslehtinen rfla andrew card the deputy white 
house chief of staff and william price a national security 
council latin expert 
then bush showed up with john sununu his havanaborn chief of 
staff demarest said it was impromptu 
bush has held rose garden events in the rain including greeting 
the university of miami hurricanes football team after they won the 
national championship 
jacqueline tillman executive director of the cuban american 
national foundation said some members of her organization were 
disappointed 
the lesson is if youre going to do it outdors in washington 
in may when it rains a lot you need to have a backup plan she 
said 
but demarest said it would cost money to hire constitution hall 
or other alternative sites 
we dont have a budget for things like that he said 
we will follow up wed like to do a large cubanamerican 
event probably in miami at some point in the future demarest 
said

the three types of us nuclear munitions that 
reportedly have been modified for safety reasons or are undergoing 
review are designed to be fired from field artillery submarines 
and bombers 
defense secretary dick cheney acknowledged in brussels belgium 
on wednesday that officials found in 1988 that w79 howitzer 
shells currently deployed in europe did not meet minimum safety 
standards 
he said the problem was corrected and there was never any risk 
of an accidental nuclear explosion 
cheney commented on a report in wednesdays editions of the 
washington post which also said the w88 warhead atop the new d5 
missile being deployed on trident submarines this year would be 
reviewed by a special committee 
the newspaper said flight restrictions had been instituted 
pending review of the w69 warhead on the shortrange srama 
missile carried by some bombing aircraft 
the w79 warhead goes on an 8inch army artillery shell and is 
designed to explode in battle with a nuclear yield of up to 10 
kilotons that is about twothirds the force of the atomic bomb 
dropped on hiroshima in 1945 
the trident missiles are designed to be launched from navy 
submarines at sea their mission the pentagon says is to deter a 
nuclear attack by assuring us ability to retaliate 
sram or shortrange attack missiles are supersonic 
airtoground nuclear weapons designed to be slung below the wings 
of b52 b1b or fb111 bombers or carried in the internal bomb 
bay the post reported the pentagon has said such missiles are 
designed to enable the air force to strike defended targets without 
flying directly over them 
the post said the yield of the w88 is 475 kilotons and that of 
the w69 is 1100 kilotons

nato defense chiefs said wednesday the 
soviet military threat has declined so much they can begin reducing 
the readiness of their soldiers to fight a war in europe 
defense ministers of the north atlanic treaty organization ended 
two days of talks by setting in motion a wideranging study of the 
military strategy that guided the western alliance during the cold 
war years 
todays meeting signifies an important step toward a new 
security relationship in europe nato secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner said 
among the changes to be studied are less emphasis on troop 
readiness and cuts in availability the defense ministers said in a 
final statement more emphasis will be placed on reserve forces 
they said 
defense secretary dick cheney said that with the unraveling of 
the sovietled warsaw pact we can afford to change the current 
status of our forces 
these are drastic changes said gen klaus naumann security 
adviser to defense minister gerhard stoltenberg of west germany 
nato leaders will meet in london in early july to formally 
launch the overall review of alliance policy nato is under 
pressure to respond to the momentous changes in eastern europe by 
emphasizing its role as a political organization rather than a 
military pact 
in their statement the defense ministers also appealed to the 
kremlin to speed progress so that agreement can be reached this 
year on slashing troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms in europe 
the ball is in their court we are eager to negotiate such 
an agreement said cheney 
western officials in recent weeks have accused the soviets of 
footdragging at talks in vienna between negotiators of the 16 nato 
nations and the seven warsaw pact countries 
moscow and washington have settled on a plan to trim their 
forces to 195000 for each side in central europe with the united 
states retaining an additional 30000 in britain and southern 
europe the united states currently has 305000 troops in europe 
while the soviets have an estimated 565000 
still unresolved are reductions in combat aircraft and measures 
to ensure compliance with an eventual accord 
in washington on wednesday secretary of state james a baker ii 
said president bush will press soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to revive the vienna negotiations when the leaders meet 
at the may 31june 3 summit 
the ministers statement said an accord on troop reduction 
coupled with other security measures would virtually eliminate 
the possibility of a surprise attack on nato as a whole by vastly 
superior conventional forces 
as a result the minimum warning time for any largescale 
offensive operation will substantially increase the statement 
said 
cheney said later the warning period has been moved from a few 
days to at least a few months consequently us officials 
said readiness time for some nato units will be lengthened on july 
1 
a helicopter unit which is now supposed to be ready to 
go within four hours of the gun going off now has 48 hours said 
stephen hadley assistant defense secretary for international 
security policy 
cheney said earlier the united states could now also consider 
revising its readiness time to send troops to europe to fend off an 
attack 
currently the united states must be prepared to deploy 10 
divisions of soldiers within 10 days in the future he suggested 
reserve units might be given a few months to get ready 
the ministers also said they would make more cuts in military 
exercises and training programs some of which can be replaced with 
computer simulations 
this will reduce the impact on the public will benefit the 
quality of life and protect the environment the statement said 
many of natos war games take place in germany where residents 
are fed up with tanks rolling down their highways and military 
aircraft flying low over their houses

the aflcio will launch a 4 million 
television campaign in an effort to rally support for a national 
health care program union president lane kirkland said wednesday 
the 142 millionmember federation also plans to hold summer 
hearings around the country to explore options for containing 
health care costs that have been rising by 20 percent a year 
kirkland said 
americans who have health insurance are paying for the 37 
million americans who are uninsured because their employers are 
freeloading on the rest of us kirkland said another 50 
million americans have inadequate insurance he said 
the aflcio intends to expose the dimension of the nations 
health care crisis for the rest of 1990 and as far into the future 
as it takes to get a solution through congress kirkland said at 
a news conference 
last year organized labor enlisted polish solidarity leader 
lech walesa for its union yes tv blitz aimed at improving the 
image of us unions 
kirkland said the new round of tv campaigns which will run this 
fall will be designed to build support among americans for 
national health care legislation 
labor wants to spread the net of support as wide as we can 
kirkland said including soliciting business help 
to those who believe this crisis doesnt affect them we say 
you are wrong if you think its only your neighbors problem 
just wait until tomorrow kirkland said 
in the past the aflcio has backed legislation to require 
private employers to provide private health insurance to workers 
however at the federations executive council meeting in 
february labor leaders didnt back a specific proposal and instead 
said they were committed to finding a solution as long as it was 
fair affordable and provided access for all americans 
we are in a negotiating mode kirkland said 
on another matter kirkland said a special panel studying 
whether labor should take a stand on abortion expected to have a 
recommendation by august 
the president of planned parenthood and a highranking official 
of the roman catholic church will meet with labor leaders in july 
kirkland said 
women union members have been pressing the aflcio 
traditionally led by older men to back abortion rights for women 
antiabortion groups have urged the federation to stay out of the 
controversy saying a prochoice stand would cost the aflcio 
membership

groups critical of the governments new 
transportation policy laid out their own plan wednesday calling 
for more support for mass transit and pedal power and less reliance 
on autos and airplanes 
harriet parcells of the national association of railroad 
passengers said 27 organizations and several members of congress 
support the plan 
us transportation policy neglects clean energyefficient 
alternatives to driving alone and jeopardizes not only our mobility 
but the health of our environment economy and our cities and us 
energy security parcells told a news conference on the capitol 
lawn 
several speakers from environmental consumer and labor groups 
attacked the national transportation policy announced by the 
government in february the federal policy covers most of the 
concerns the groups cited but puts more emphasis on state and local 
funding and decisionmaking

the sidelines parcells said 
announcing the campaign for new transportation priorities the 
groups outlined eight goals preserve the existing infrastructure 
reduce congestion enhance energy security protect the 
environment improve safety curtail auto and truck subsidies 
create liveable communities and promote new research

increase funding to repair aging railroad tracks and rail cars 
fund and encourage highoccupancy vehicle programs bicycle 
paths and pedestrian walkways highspeed rail and peakhour 
pricing at airports

the umbrella organization of jews in the 
soviet union has asked president bush to press mikhail gorbachev at 
next weeks summit over his decision to keep silence on the 
problem of growing nazism in his own country 
a letter to bush from the vaad a confederation of soviet jewish 
communities accused gorbachev of connivance toward this 
great danger 
secretary of state james baker describing the summit agenda on 
wednesday said bush would raise the issue of antisemitism in the 
soviet union 
the may 20 letter from vaad a copy of which was obtained by a 
reporter wednesday said we feel the time has come to persuade 
the soviet government and president gorbachev that they cannot join 
the family of civilized nations carrying antisemitism in their 
luggage 
it described the revived neonazi ideology of pamyat a popular 
movement which has flourished under gorbachevs liberalized 
domestic policies 
soviet nazis comprise different groups united by 
xenophobia and the search for a scapegoat for the soviet unions 
problems the letter said 
all these groups are involved into mass incitement of the 
hatred towards the jews preparation for mass physical 
violence desecration of jewish sanctuaries the letter said 
a recent state department report found that antisemitism of the 
type described in the letter has spread over the past few years as 
barriers on free expression have been lifted 
growing antisemitism has resulted in massive jewish emigration

deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleburger on wednesday urged western allies to provide the 
emerging eastern european democracies with economic gifts rather 
than loans 
loans would just add to the great debt burden that eastern 
europe already has deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleburger told an international conference on aid to eastern 
europe 
most of the proposals from other countries have been for loans 
the united states is committed to 533 million in aid for poland 
and hungary this year most of it in form of grants or credit 
guarantees 
president bush has proposed adding 300 million next year to the 
205 million in assistance already approved for fiscal years 1991 
and 1992 
eagleburger acknowledged the administration has no overall 
blueprint for helping the region 
anyone who had such a blueprint would have had to change it 
several times recently he said 
despite his opposition to loans eagleburger endorsed the newly 
organized european bank for reconstruction and development which 
will have 12 billion available for lending to the area 
he said it would be useful for largescale projects which would 
be too big for any one donor country or small group of countries 
the united states one of 24 countries in western europe 
america and asia which set up the new european bank is expected to 
provide about 10 percent of the initial funding for the bank

the bush administration on wednesday 
dramatically boosted its estimate for rescuing the savings and loan 
industry saying the government will need to borrow between 90 
billion and 130 billion to clean up the sampl mess 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in an appearance before 
congress blamed the slumping real estate market for bloating what 
was already the largest government bailout in history 
it was the first time the administration has acknowledged what 
critics have been contending for some time that the amount of 
money included in last years massive sampl bailout bill would not be 
enough 
during debate on the legislation last year the administration 
insisted the problem could be largely handled with the 50 billion 
in longterm borrowing authority included in the bailout bill 
some democratic critics contended the new estimate showed that 
the administration was not moving quickly enough to close sick sampls 
rep charles schumer dny called the situation an 
unmitigated disaster and warned that without greater 
administration attention the crisis will get worse 
the administration said its more pessimistic projection was 
based on a belief that the slumping real estate market means more 
sampls are likely to fail and the cost of protecting depositors at 
the insolvent institutions will be greater 
since most of an savings institutions assets are in the form of 
loans based on the value of real estate falling real estate prices 
put more borderline institutions into trouble 
the administrations new cost range assumes that between 722 and 
1032 institutions could fail during debate on the sampl bailout 
bill the number of threatened institutions was put at around 500 
the new cost estimate does not include the cost of borrowing the 
money over the next 30 years when that price is included the 
bailout cost is expected to exceed 300 billion 
the general accounting office in april put the bailout cost with 
interest payments included at 325 billion saying that figure 
could skyrocket to 500 billion if the economy falters 
brady presented the administrations new estimate in testimony 
before the senate banking committee he refused to provide an 
estimate of the total pricetag with interest costs included but he 
did not dispute the gao assumptions 
brady said about 90 percent of the administrations higher cost 
estimate stemmed from falling real estate prices especially for 
commercial real estate such as office buildings he said depressed 
real estate prices were showing up not only in the southwest but 
also in the northeast southeast and other sections of the country 
we are dealing with a moving target made greatly more 
expensive by a weakening real estate market and constantly changing 
economic conditions he said this is a long hard job and it 
will take an extended period of time to finish it 
the administration estimated that for just the 1991 fiscal year 
which begins oct 1 the cost of the sampl bailout will be 61 
billion more than eight times the 73 billion called for in the 
presidents january budget request 
white house budget director richard darman told lawmakers at a 
separate hearing that the pricetag of the mushrooming sampl crisis 
played a major role in driving the administration to seek budget 
negotiations with congress 
it is extraordinary darman said the magnitudes are just 
very very much larger than the budget system is prepared to deal 
with 
darman said the sampl rescue cost would force automatic spending 
cuts under the grammrudman deficitreduction law that could exceed 
100 billion the cuts could reach 45 to 50 percent in many 
domestic programs he said the law will trigger spending cuts in 
october the start of fiscal 1991 if the new years deficit is not 
reduced to 74 billion 
the administration and some members of congress want to exclude 
a portion of the sampl costs from the deficit calculations a step 
that would make it easier to meet the deficit targets in the 
grammrudman balanced budget law 
brady appearing with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
and other members of the oversight board supervising the sampl 
bailout dodged questions on how the government should raise the 
extra money needed to complete the sampl rescue effort 
he said that issue should be addressed in the budget 
negotiations the administration was conducting with congress

a recently isolated chimpanzee virus is more 
closely related to the human aids virus than other aidsrelated 
monkey viruses are and may be a missing link between human and 
primate versions scientists say 
however the finding does not resolve the question of whether 
the aids virus originated in humans or in animals scientists said 
analysis of the chimpanzee virus is presented in thursdays 
issue of the british journal nature by scientists from gabon and 
from the pasteur institute in paris 
the virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in the west 
african nation and isolated from one of them it is classified as a 
lentivirus the same category that includes hiv1 which causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the united states 
other lentiviruses called simian immunodeficiency viruses or 
sivs have been found in four kinds of monkeys macaques sooty 
mangabeys african green monkeys and mandrills 
analysis of the new virus showed it was the first nonhuman 
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as hiv1 
the researchers reported and when the protein products of its 
genes were studied they were more like those of hiv1 than those 
of the simian viruses tested 
nonetheless when compared to the range of known genetic 
variants of hiv1 the chimp virus lay outside that range the 
researchers said 
they suggested it might be called chimpanzee immunodeficiency 
virus 
only two of 83 chimps tested in gabon carried the virus 
indicating it is not widespread there they reported and none of 
more than 250 chimpanzees caught over the last 15 to 20 years in 
west africa showed evidence of the virus 
the two chimps in which the virus was found were both infants in 
relatively good health if the virus had made them ill with 
anything like aids they probably would not have survived predators 
in the jungle researchers said 
it is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a 
precursor to hiv1 and even if it were analysis indicates that it 
could not be the immediate precursor they said 
but the virus may be a form of missing link between the 
african old world primate viruses and hiv1 wrote ronald 
desrosiers of the new england regional primate research center in 
southborough mass 
he agreed that the discovery does not settle the question of 
whether hiv1 originated in humans or came from a nonhuman 
ancestor but further study of the isolate may shed light on it he 
said in a nature editorial

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
wednesday rejected charges that he gave away too much to the 
soviets in an nuclear arms deal asserting weve got what we 
want he also said too much is at stake to allow disputes over 
lithuania to block ussoviet progress 
baker at a news conference also revealed a new stumbling block 
to the signing of an economic agreement leading toward normal trade 
relations with moscow 
baker previewing next weeks summit meeting between president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said the soviet 
legislature has again delayed adoption of a law allowing the free 
emigration of soviet jews and other dissidents 
bush has made passage of such a law a condition for giving 
moscow mostfavorednation trade status such a trade declaration 
would provide the soviets with the same benefits including 
lowestpossible tariffs that the united states extends to other 
major economic partners 
the soviets had been expected to pass the law may 31 but baker 
said the action has been postponed somewhat 
since returning sunday from arms negotiations in moscow baker 
has been attacked by conservatives who say the united states 
dealing from a position of strength made too many concessions to a 
weakened soviet union critics include richard n perle who served 
as assistant secretary of defense in the reagan administration 
baker and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze resolved 
most of the key differences to a treaty cutting longrange nuclear 
missiles but did not agree to any limits on modernizing the soviet 
ss18 heavy missile the most dangerous weapon in moscows arsenal 
baker however said there is very strong support for this 
agreement among the military leadership of the united states 
support for it as a good agreement that is very much in the 
national security interests of the united states 
and it would appear to me at least that most of the criticism 
is coming from those who in the past from time to time have 
simply rejected the concept of arms control generally baker said 
rather than the united states making concessions baker said 
its been pretty much all the other way around he noted that 
moscow will cut its force of ss18s in half and the superpowers 
had cut through longstanding differences on air and sealaunched 
cruise missiles 
and weve got what we want baker said 
the secretary said bush will press gorbachev to revive 
negotiations to cut tens of thousands of troops and tanks in 
europe however he said there should not be any linkage between a 
treaty to cut nuclear weapons and the separate agreement on 
conventional forces in europe 
baker said the united states still wants to sign a treaty this 
year to reduce the nonnuclear forces however he failed to make 
progress on the issue in moscow last week apparently because the 
soviets want assurances about reductions in german forces after 
unification 
baker said it was up to germans to decide the internal 
aspects of the unification of east germany with west germany on 
troop levels baker said outsiders could get involved in the 
discussions but here too the germans were in charge of their 
future 
baker said the main obstacle to a conventional force agreement 
concerned which aircraft to limit 
on lithuania baker said the soviet unions policies may 
disturb us deeply offending our fundamental values but as the 
president has made clear there is too much at stake in the united 
statessoviet relationship to dismiss cavalierly or imprudently the 
potential for progress 
we must continue the search for points of mutual advantage 
he said 
we have been saying for quite some time that we see a little 
bit of tension in the relationship as a consequence of whats 
happening in the baltics and wed very much like to see a peaceful 
dialogue resolve that issue he said

the government will lay its future on the line in 
the soviet unions first national referendum in which voters will 
consider a shift to a market economy that could cost tens of 
millions of jobs officials said wednesday 
the government believes it must have clear public support before 
starting the potentially destabilizing fiveyear reform plan first 
deputy premier yuri maslyukov told a news conference 
if the program is not approved it is my opinion the 
government should resign maslyukov said referring to the 
council of ministers led by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
it was unclear whether the public would endorse the reforms 
which would double food prices jan 1 1991 lead to widespread 
closures of inefficient factories and eventually allow private 
ownership of most businesses 
ryzhkov was to present the plan thursday to the supreme soviet 
parliament where some radical reformers were planning to seek his 
resignation he survived a similar noconfidence vote last fall 
no soviet government has ever fallen because of either a 
referendum or a parliamentary vote although prime ministers have 
been forced to resign by the communist party leader 
even if the government falls soviet law guarantees that mikhail 
s gorbachev would continue the fouryear presidential term to 
which he was elected by the congress of peoples deputies this 
year he is also general secretary of the communist party 
traditionally the top kremlin job 
but gorbachev has balked at standing for popular election and 
defeat of the referendum would throw the future wide open 
maslyukov said 
if the public refuses to consent to the price rises then 
perhaps we will have to resort to roundtable discussions 
maslyukov said referring to talks that led to the fall of the 
communist government in poland last year 
soviet reformers are seeking talks to discuss devolving 
political and economic decisionmaking power from central 
authorities where it has resided since the bolshevik revolution of 
1917 
the government has been wary of radical reform however 
officials rejected proposals for a more abrupt twoyear 
polishstyle shock therapy fearing public anger and soviet 
officials have said they do not enjoy the same popularity as 
polands solidarity leadership 
shocktherapy which calls for rapid reform to keep the period 
of dislocation short could put 40 million soviets out of work 
maslyukov said 
we are unable to offer normal living conditions to such a 
number if they lose their jobs it would the lead the country to 
the edge of an economic crash he said 
deputy premier leonid abalkin told a news conference that even 
under the proposed fiveyear transition tens of millions of jobs 
could be lost 
the plan calls for rapid conversion of stateowned enterprises 
to stock companies and the gradual sale of their stock to the 
public it would permit certain companies and industries to 
contract directly for their supplies and to sell their products in 
a free market unprofitable firms would go bankrupt 
the plan sets target price increases for various sectors of the 
economy including an 82 percent rise in energy prices an average 
43 percent rise in retail prices and doubling the price of food 
which is now subsidized 
wages and other compensation would rise to match only some of 
the price increases abalkin said 
maslyukov said the supreme soviet would set the date for the 
referendum which would be the first in soviet history 
the outcome is far from certain as soviet people cling to an 
ideology that brands individual wealth harmful to the collective 
good gorbachev has blamed public opinion for retarding reform 
a recent poll found 54 percent of soviets favor market reforms 
but 46 percent are opposed said stanislav shatalin the lone 
economist on gorbachevs advisory presidential council the council 
approved the reform plan tuesday 
nikolai petrakov one of gorbachevs top economics aides said 
wednesday he was unhappy with the plan 
asked whether announcing price increases seven months before 
they take effect would cause a rush on shops and hoarding by 
businesses petrakov said this will create a panic an economic 
panic 
the government discussed radical reforms last fall but backed 
away the economy has deteriorated sharply since then in the first 
three months of 1990 wages rose 134 percent while production 
declined official figures show that industrial output dropped by 
12 percent 
under the latest proposal workers are to receive raises 
businesses are to recalculate their books based on new prices and 
the government will discover how many businesses will need 
subsidies to continue operating 
petrakov said 220000 state enterprises or 70 percent of the 
total will be converted to stockbased companies within the next 
several months as a first step toward selling the shares to 
individuals companies and banks 
maslyukov said prices on 60 percent of the items sold will 
remain controlled these include prices for raw materials energy 
and products made by the monopoly firms dominating the economy 
an additional 25 percent of prices will be regulated and 15 
percent will float with the market maslyukov told the 
usussr trade and economic council

a court on wednesday ordered farright leader 
jeanmarie le pen to pay a symbolic fine for referring to the nazi 
gas chambers as just a detail in world war ii history 
judge lefoyer de costil presiding in the nanterre court outside 
paris said le pen should pay one franc to each of the 11 religious 
and human rights groups that filed suit against him following the 
remark 
he also ordered the judgment printed in five national 
newspapers five regional papers and six weeklies in addition le 
pen must pay 720 to each of the groups to cover their legal fees 
the judge ruled 
le pen committed a fault for which he cannot validly exonerate 
himself by invoking freedom of expression which has as a limit 
certain essential values and respect for others the judge told 
the court 
he called le pens choice of words shocking saying they 
put into question banalize or at the very least make less 
specifically dramatic the persecutions and sufferings inflicted on 
deportees and particularly on jews and gypsies by the nazis 
le pen who did not attend the trial said the decision was 
another move in the general offensive against his national 
front 
all means are good to try to sweep the national front and the 
millions of french who more so each day put their hope in it 
le pen said in a written statement he did not say whether he would 
appeal 
le pen 61 who has about 15 percent support in recent opinion 
polls has been increasingly ostracized since the desecration two 
weeks ago of a jewish cemetery in the southern town of carpentras 
several towns have refused to allow meetings of his national front 
party 
le pen maintains that france is being overrun by immigrants 
under the motto french first he wants to expell immigrants and 
enact laws to keep them out le pen has repeatedly been accused of 
racism and antisemitism but denies the allegations 
planning minister lionel stoleru said the decision was both a 
victory and a relief 
to be proud to be french is from now on to be proud to combat 
jeanmarie le pen the minister said 
le pen a deputy in the european parliament caused a scandal 
with his remarks about the gas chambers in a 1987 radio interview 
in the past six months the justice ministry has succeeded in 
having le pens parliamentary immunity lifted to prosecute him on 
two issues the first was a play on words he made in 1988 linking a 
cabinet minister to the nazi crematory ovens and the second a 
1989 interview in which he said large internationals like the 
jewish international play a nonnegligible role in the creation of 
this antinational spirit 
numerous political and civic leaders have accused le pen of 
creating an atmosphere of racial intolerance that led to the 
desecration at carpentras where a corpse was mutilated and 34 
tombs were desecrated 
on wednesday police questioned 15 people around the southern 
town of albi all the suspects were later released 
several newspapers in southern france published a letter 
wednesday claiming responsibility for the desecration in the name 
of a moslem organization the mohammed el boukhima group 
police sources said the letter was considered to have little 
credibility 
shortly after the discovery may 10 of the desecration an 
anonymous caller to a local paper claimed responsibility for the 
crime in the name of the same unknown group

the soviet union is building new warships at the 
highest rate in 20 years to replace old vessels that are being 
retired according to janes fighting ships 
the latest edition of the respected defense directory to be 
released thursday says the soviet union will be retiring 17 
nuclear submarines 80 diesel powered submarines three cruisers 
and 25 frigates under a program to rid the navy of technology from 
the 1940s and 1950s 
but a balanced view of the soviet fleet must include the 
unpalatable fact that at the same time as these obsolete ships are 
being paid off the new naval construction rate is in terms of 
tonnage the highest it has been in 20 years for surface warships 
and the highest in the last decade for submarines capt richard 
sharpe wrote in his foreword to janes fighting ships 19901991 
no precise figure on the total tonnage was available sharpe 
said he reached his conclusion after studying the figures following 
a comment by us rear adm thomas brooks director of naval 
intelligence 
testifying before a committee of the house armed services 
subcommittee on march 14 1990 brooks said in terms of tonnage 
of submarines accepted by the soviet navy 1989 was the most 
productive year since 1980 
brooks added in terms of tonnage of surface competence 
warships accepted by the soviet navy 1989 was the most 
productive year in more than 20 years 
sharp said soviet naval officials have been arguing the west has 
superior naval forces and that there has been no positive 
response to maritime arms control initiatives 
the arguments have convinced policy makers in moscow that the 
modernization of the fleets overall capabilities should continue 
without check said sharpe a former commander of submarines and 
destroyers for the royal navy 
he said the emphasis on fixedwing aircraft carriers and nuclear 
attack submarines seemed to contradict the soviets stated doctrine 
of defensive sufficiency 
analysts who attempt to portray such vessels as purely assets 
for strategic defense are being depressingly naive he says 
sharpe said improvements in the availablity of information from 
the soviet union made possible the first listing of soviet warships 
scrapped or awaiting the breakers

oliver north appeared in federal court 
wednesday apparently to challenge a subpoena for his appearance 
before a federal grand jury looking into the irancontra affair 
north and his lawyers attended a closeddoor session before us 
district court judge aubrey robinson while the grand jury met on 
another floor in the building irancontra prosecutors also were at 
the court session 
after a hearing that lasted more than half an hour north and 
his lawyers emerged from robinsons courtroom bypassed the 
thirdfloor grand jury room and walked out of the courthouse the 
grand jury adjourned for the day an hour and a half later 
one of norths lawyers brendan sullivan refused to comment 
irancontra prosecutor craig gillen and the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh also declined any comment 
norths brief appearance suggested he has been subpoenaed to 
testify before the grand jury but is challenging the subpoena the 
newly empaneled grand jury met for the first time last friday 
a court fight over a grand jury subpoena for norths testimony 
could take months to resolve north could appeal any order issued 
by robinson compelling the former white house aides testimony 
sources familiar with the 3yearold criminal investigation 
have said walshs office wants to use the new grand jury in an 
attempt to determine the precise roles ronald reagan george bush 
and others had in the affair 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said last month 
that it was likely north would be called before a grand jury and 
that irancontra prosecutors also were likely to call former 
national security adviser john poindexter 
robinson held north in contempt of court earlier in walshs 
probe when north refused to comply with a grand jury subpoena the 
legal dispute hinged on norths refusal to provide a grand jury 
with a sample of his handwriting in 1987 norths attorneys filed 
an appeal and obtained a stay of the judges order walsh 
eventually obtained samples of the handwriting of north and other 
irancontra defendants 
irancontra prosecutors also tried unsuccessfully to obtain 
norths notebooks through the use of a grand jury subpoena north 
ultimately was forced to turn over the notebooks at his trial last 
year when he took the witness stand in his own defense some 2600 
pages of norths notebooks have been publicly released over the 
past two weeks in connection with a lawsuit filed against the 
government by two private groups 
north 46 was convicted on may 4 1989 by a federal court jury 
after a twomonth trial 
he was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress altering and destroying national security council 
documents and receiving an illegal gratuity an appeal of his 
convictions is pending before the us court of appeals north was 
placed on two years probation and ordered to pay a 150000 fine 
he also is performing 1200 hours of community service work as part 
of his sentence 
poindexter convicted last month of five felonies in connection 
with the irancontra affair is scheduled to be sentenced june 11 
he could face up to 25 years in prison and 125 million in 
fines for his convictions on one count of conspiracy two counts of 
obstructing congress and two counts of making false statements

the anc stands by its policy 
of nationalizing major private industries but would be willing to 
negotiate government participation rather than takeovers nelson 
mandela said wednesday 
the african national congress leader spoke to 300 south african 
businessmen about 40 anc delegates and representatives of leading 
labor organizations 
after the conference he told reporters the anc has not changed 
its view that banks mining companies and other major private 
industries must be nationalized 
we are not rethinking our nationalization policy he said 
but he said government participation must be done in 
cooperation with the corporate sector there are different forms of 
government participation and this will be negotiated 
murray hofmeyr chairman of the johannesburg consolidated 
investment co ltd mining house said the meeting had shown 
there is a lot of disagreement between the business community and 
the anc we have a long way to go there is also a degree of 
mistrust which will have to be overcome 
but hofmeyr also said there were areas of common ground such as 
agreement on the need to end racial discrimination transform the 
economic political and social orders and to retain the confidence 
of investors 
mandela said the anc policy on nationalization is designed to 
bring social change in south africa 
if we are genuinely interested in ending the old social order 
and bringing in a new one it is quite obvious that the economic 
power relations represented by the reality of the excessive 
concentration of power in a few white hands have to change 
mandela said in his speech 
i would however like to share a secret with you mandela 
said the view that the only words in the economic vocabulary 
that the anc knows are nationalization and redistribution is 
mistaken 
mandela suggested considering methods such as the us 
antitrust laws or the british monopolies commission to ensure 
that there is no unhealthy overconcentration of economic power 
he also said future governments might place directors on the 
boards of private companies to see whether it is possible to 
balance pursuit of private gain with the need to promote common 
good 
in some areas mandela said it may be necessary to establish or 
strengthen public corporations to redress the disparity in economic 
opportunity and share of national wealth after centuries of white 
domination in south africa 
mandela said the anc was firmly opposed to the governments 
current program of privatizing public services 
it would seem only reasonable that so important a question as 
the disposal of public property should be held over until a truly 
representative government is in place he said 
the government led by fw de klerk has implemented a series of 
reforms that included releasing mandela from jail in february after 
27 years de klerk and the anc also met to pave the way for 
negotiations on blackwhite power sharing

israel rejected on wednesday the bush 
administrations attempt to link the slaying of seven palestinian 
laborers by an apparently deranged israeli gunman to lack of 
progress in mideast negotiations 
there is no correlation between the act of one crazed 
individual and the peace process the israeli embassy said 
the statement cautioned the bush administration that its linking 
of the violence to the diplomatic stalemate is liable to be seen 
by certain groups as a reason to continue the violence in the hope 
of attaining their ends 
terming the shooting sunday near tel aviv a tragedy israel said 
irresponsible elements led by the palestine liberation organization 
were cynically exploiting the incident to incite violence on the 
west bank and in gaza 
the israeli army is dealing with the extremely difficult 
situation with maximum restraint the embassy statement said 
in a related development wednesday secretary of state james a 
baker iii said the bush administration was willing to discuss at a 
un security council meeting the idea of sending a united nations 
observer team to the occupied territories 
the council will hold the meeting in geneva so plo chairman 
yasser arafat could attend arafat would have required a us visa 
to be at the meeting if it were held at un headquarters in new 
york 
arafat had approached the bush administration through un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar but a showdown was 
averted when the meeting was shifted 
baker asked at a white house news conference if he had opposed 
a visa for arafat replied there was never any formal application 
for a visa so the question is hypothetical 
on monday the state department said lack of progress in 
negotiations increases the likelihood of violence and bloody 
crackdowns such as the shooting and subsequent violence on the 
west bank and in gaza 
we see that as another sign that there must be a peace 
process the department said in a statement read by spokesman 
richard boucher 
in the absence of a peace process the potential for this kind 
of senseless violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up 
he said 
the statement was issued after prime minister yitzhak shamir 
deplored the shooting and expressed condolences to the victims and 
their families 
the embassy statement wednesday said israel and its citizens 
have condemned the coldblooded murder of seven palestinians and the 
wounding of 11 others at rishon la zion 
restrained and balanced reactions on the part of the 
international community will contribute to the restoration of calm 
in the area the statement said

a leading christian cleric urged president 
ibrahim babangida to include more christian southerners in the 
ruling military council that is dominated by moslem northerners 
newspapers reported wednesday 
roman catholic archbishop anthony olubumi okogie also appealed 
to babangida to spare the lives of soldiers who led a failed coup 
on april 22 the soldiers said they wanted to end moslem domination 
of nigerian politics 
okogie was speaking at a tuesday news conference in his capacity 
as president of the christian association of nigeria according to 
newspapers in the capital of lagos 
okogie said the nation could be on the path to a crisis if 
christians were not given more power in the government in his 
address he repeatedly referred to sudan where christians and 
animists in the south are fighting a guerrilla war against moslem 
northerners who dominate the government 
it is estimated moslems account for slightly more than half of 
nigerias 100 million people but previous attempts at a census in 
africas most populous nation have been foiled by groups that have 
registered inflated numbers of people for political purposes 
christians were deeply angered by a january reshuffle of the 
ruling council that removed two leading christian southerners 
defense minister lt col domkat bali and internal affairs minister 
john shagayi leaving no christians or southerners holding 
important portfolios 
on monday the military began a courtmartial of 10 soldiers 
accused of organizing the coup attempt two hundred other soldiers 
and an unknown number of civilians have also been detained for 
questioning in connection with the rebellion 
in the first few hours of the coup the rebels almost killed 
babangida during a tank bombardment of his house

a lawsuit that questioned the accuracy of a 
greta garbo biography was settled out of court both sides sides 
said wednesday 
greta her story was released last week 
its dust jacket says it is an unauthorized memoir of garbo 
based on a long and intimate friendship with garbos own 
memories as reported by the author the late antoni gronowicz 
the reclusive screen legend died last month at age 84 
a settlement of the suit by garbos niece and only heir grey 
reisfield was signed monday 
in confirming the settlement wednesday neither reisfields 
lawyer nor the publisher simon amp schuster would say if any 
changes would be made in the book or the way it is marketed 
theodore a kurz reisfields attorney said the terms of the 
settlement required it be kept confidential but in a statement 
wednesday he said he was extremely gratified by the outcome and 
that the estates concerns had been addressed 
simon amp schuster issued a statement calling the settlement 
amicable 
the words that purport to be garbos are not they are 
gronowiczs impersonating garbo and are imaginary the 
copyright infringement suit said 
attempting to block publication herself garbo swore in a 1978 
affidavit that to the best of my knowledge i have never even met 
gronowicz at any time in my life 
the nieces suit filed friday against simon amp schuster alleged 
the publisher was making false marketing statements about the book 
it didnt ask for money damages but sought an injunction against 
sale of the book 
this action is brought not to stop simon amp schuster from 
selling this book but to require that it do so accurately and 
honestly the suit said 
the court papers said publisher dodd mead amp co rejected the 
book in 1972 because gronowicz couldnt prove its authenticity 
simon amp schuster in a statement read by spokeswoman barbara 
reno said it would not have published the book had it not 
believed in the fundamental accuracy of the book 
gronowiczs work has been questioned before most notably in the 
early 1980s with gods broker which purported to be the life 
of pope john paul ii as told in his own words the vatican denied 
gronowicz had ever spoken to the pope 
the publisher withdrew the book in 1984 and sued gronowicz 
calling the book fraudulent and a disaster

lithuanias parliament tried again wednesday to 
get the kremlin to the negotiating table by offering to suspend 
some of the laws it passed after declaring independence march 11 
but not the declaration itself 
lithuanian officials said earlier wednesday that soviet energy 
sanctions imposed on the baltic republic five weeks ago will force 
all but emergency vehicles off the road by the weekend 
lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis encouraged 
countrymen to survive as though we were in a surrounded 
fortress 
we are poor but well not starve to death landsbergis said 
in a speech reported by the lithuanian news agency elta our main 
weapon is unity and stamina 
in a conciliatory gesture the republics supreme council voted 
7415 with 10 abstentions for a resolution that offers to suspend 
the laws if moscow agrees to talks 
the resolution did not spell out which laws could be suspended 
but soviet officials have objected to measures that would create a 
system of special identification cards for lithuanian citizens bar 
soviet army draft boards in lithuania and establish lithuanian 
control over its borders 
wednesdays resolution said lithuania decided to temporarily 
suspend for the period of official interstate negotiations those 
actions and decisions arising from realization of the march 11 
1990 acts of the supreme council of the republic of lithuania 
related to interests that could be defined by both parties as 
objects of negotiations said a text released by the lithuanian 
parliaments press office 
before wednesdays announcement the baltic situation was 
settling into a stalemate as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
insisted that lithuania and its sister republics of latvia and 
estonia retreat from independence 
landsbergis and other baltic leaders have said they are willing 
to compromise but will not surrender their goal of seceding from 
the soviet union which forcibly annexed all three republics in 
1940 lithuania latvia and estonia had been independent between 
world war i and world war ii 
gorbachev responded to lithuanias declaration of independence 
by cutting off oil natural gas and key raw materials since energy 
supplies were cut off april 18 factories in lithuania have ground 
to a halt traffic has thinned out and 19000 people have lost 
their jobs 
soviet authorities have blocked hard currency transfers to all 
three baltic republics but otherwise have not used the economic 
punishments against latvia and estonia for their more cautious 
approach to secession 
a committee directing a strike by nonestonian workers for the 
past three days to protest estonias secession drive decided 
wednesday night to call off the walkout tass reported the 
official soviet news agency said workers were told to return to 
their jobs thursday because the strike committee felt the main 
goal to publicize its cause was achieved 
the estonian news agency said soviet vice president anatoly 
lukyanov sent a telegram asking that the strike end in view of 
the complicated political and economic situation in the country 
the report said the telegram was sent on behalf of the soviet 
president gorbachev 
twentyone businesses reportedly were struck in tallinn the 
estonian capital the estonian government responded by trying to 
block food shipments to the strikers the soviet national newspaper 
izvestia reported 
the baltic independence declarations angered gorbachev and 
raised concerns among nonbaltic residents that their rights might 
be jeopardized gorbachev calls the declarations illegal 
he met tuesday with the presidents of latvia and estonia but 
did not budge from his hard line against their independence 
radio vilnius said wednesday that shutting down transport in 
lithuania would throw 28000 more people out of work 
food is plentiful but the energy crunch has forced authorities 
to curb electricity to industry for three hours a day lithuanian 
officials said 
the energy shortage is getting bad lithuanian parliament 
spokeswoman rita dapkus said by the end of the week most bus 
routes will be cut the only thing left will be emergency services 
like ambulances and fire trucks 
gasoline sales to private vehicles have all but stopped and 
only 3500 out of 13000 government and commercial vehicles will be 
running by the weekend radio vilnius said quoting the 
communications ministry 
by friday the oilburning electrical generation plant at 
elektrenai was expected to run out of fuel further curtailing 
industrial production ms dapkus said

deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleburger on wednesday urged western allies to provide the 
emerging eastern european democracies with economic gifts rather 
than loans 
loans would just add to the great debt burden that eastern 
europe already has deputy secretary of state lawrence s 
eagleburger told an international conference on aid to eastern 
europe 
most of the proposals from other countries have been for loans 
international financial leaders doubted if enough grants could 
be put together 
i hope mr eagleburger will take the lead said barber 
conable president of the world bank 
conable said interest rates for world bank loans to eastern 
europe could not even be reduced 
michael camdessus managing director of the intertional monetary 
fund said that although grants would be more desirable he doubted 
western nations had enough money available to send funds to eastern 
europe 
the united states is committed to 533 million in aid for poland 
and hungary this year most of it in form of grants or credit 
guarantees 
president bush has proposed adding 300 million next year to the 
205 million in assistance already approved for fiscal years 1991 
and 1992 
eagleburger acknowledged the administration has no overall 
blueprint for helping the region 
anyone who had such a blueprint would have had to change it 
several times recently he said 
despite his opposition to loans eagleburger endorsed the newly 
organized european bank for reconstruction and development which 
will have 12 billion available for lending to the area 
he said it would be useful for largescale projects which would 
be too big for any one donor country or small group of countries 
the united states one of 24 countries in western europe 
america and asia which set up the new european bank is expected to 
provide about 10 percent of the initial funding for the bank

only about one in four developmentally 
disabled americans consider themselves independent enough to 
control their own lives survey results released wednesday show 
the study commissioned by the national association of 
developmental disabilies councils found that while 75 percent of 
the respondents felt it important to be independent only 26 
percent believed they had achieved any level of independence 
independence was defined as making choices and exercising control 
over ones life 
only 16 percent of adults were allowed to choose their own 
places to live the survey said nearly 60 percent both adults 
and children live on their own or with families rather than in 
various types of institutions 
the survey also found that 
78 percent felt it important to be productive but only 38 
percent believed they fit the description of being able to work 
or make a contribution through productive activity 
only 11 percent said they were completely unable to work those 
who were employed were paid a weekly average of 60 for 24 hours of 
work with an average hourly wage of 287 statistics show that 
people with mental retardation earn nearly twothirds less than 
people with other disabilities 
75 percent of respondents felt it important to be integrated 
while only 40 percent felt they were integration was defined as 
participating in community life and interacting with other 
members of society 
far fewer respondents said they knew their neighbors than those 
participating in a survey of nondisabled americans the study 
said this is despite the fact that most people in the survey 
live in their own homes or with relatives 
the survey was conducted by the developmental disabilities 
center at temple university in philadelphia it was part of a 
larger report required by a 1987 law to help congress determine the 
needs of the developmentally disabled the results also will be

the association is the umbrella group for state and territorial 
councils that work to improve the lives of people with disabilities 
the report included a compilation of smaller studies from the 
state councils on the needs of the disabled

to assure that children grow up in families and using funding 
mechanisms that support individual choice and control that fund 
individuals rather than facilities and that reduce rather than 
reinforce dependency

ion iliescu romanias interim 
president and now its presidentelect accused his opposition of 
political immaturity wednesday for complaining that his lopsided 
victory in weekend elections was fraudulent 
he rejected a proposal that a commission be set up to 
investigate allegations of electoral fraud a major demand of the 
chief us government observer gov garrey carruthers rnm 
none of the foreign observers could point to even one fact 
that constitutes fraud iliescu insisted its all based on 
claims by the opposition 
iliescu reiterated at a news conference wednesday his claim of a 
complete break with his communist past and said he wanted the new 
government to include competent people regardless of party 
affiliation 
according to a nearfinal tally of the vote released wednesday 
iliescu received 85 percent of the votes for president and his 
national salvation front 67 percent of the votes for the 
twochamber parliament 
iliescu said the opposition doesnt want to accept the result 
because its not in their favor they misunderstand the 
political game and are displaying political immaturity its very 
sad when someone doesnt know how to lose 
iliescu and the front have dominated government since the 
december revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu opposition parties and demonstrators have accused both 
of being neocommunist 
the presidentelect called this charge an election slogan 
romanias break with communism was the most brusque and 
revolutionary in all east europe he said there is no way 
back and to try such a thing would be political suicide so its 
impossible 
he said his challengers radu campeanu of the national liberal 
party and ion ratiu of the national peasant party lost because 
they misunderstood the character of the revolution and slid to 
the extreme right 
he said they frightened voters away with violent language and 
incitements to violence 
he said ratiu and campeanu both elderly longtime exiles 
showed that they are detached from the realities of romania and 
failed to establish the necessary dialogue with the people 
but he added that the front which can govern alone if it 
chooses remains open to any possible coalition or parliamentary 
cooperation 
we need trained experienced competent people regardless of 
party affiliation 
he said the priority of the new government would be the creation 
of a constitution and development of a coherent strategy for 
transition to a freemarket economy 
iliescu refused to say if petre roman would continue as prime 
minister saying this is up to the new parliament 
roman said the antifront demonstration in downtown university 
square which has blocked the capitals central intersection for 32 
days was inadmissible now that the government had the 
legitimacy of being elected 
but iliescu said no force would be applied to clear the square 
i hope 
he pledged romania will be open to all countries of both east 
and west but added we dont want to be dependent on anyone 
any more romanian politics will be made in romania 
iliescu rejected the proposal made by carruthers and other 
foreign observers who monitored the election that romania must 
abolish the state monopoly over electronic media 
he said staterun television guarantees access to all political 
points of view and that a private channel would create a lack of 
democratic access 
he insisted at the present time the press is under no control 
or censorship

mutual retreat from their common border to settle a maritime 
dispute that has reportedly left 17 soldiers dead the senegalese 
embassy announced 
the two sides are arguing over who controls waters believed to 
contain oil deposits the area is off the land border between the 
two west african nations 
wednesdays settlement was reached by foreign minister seydina 
oumar sy of senegal and finance minister col manuel santos of 
guinea bissau during a meeting in paris the senegalese embassy 
said 
the meeting was held during a visit to paris by guinea bissaus 
leader gen joao bernardo vieira however there was no immediate 
comment from guinea bissau 
the senegalese embassy statement said the two countries hope to 
find through dialogue peaceful solutions to all questions 
regarding their relations 
the statement said the two nations troops would be pulled back 
to a reasonable distance from the border 
the dispute over maritime borders dates from colonial times 
since saturday clashes on guinea bissaus northern land border 
have left at least 17 soldiers dead according to news reports 
the disputed waters were confirmed as senegalese territory in 
1960 by an exchange of letters between portugal and france the 
colonial powers at the time 
however guinea bissau challenged control of the zone when it 
gained independence from portugal in 1974 
in 1989 guinea bissau rejected the verdict of an international 
court in geneva which found in favor of senegal it has taken its 
complaint to the international court of justice in the hague

president fernando collor de mello said 
wednesday his tough antiinflation plan is working better than 
expected despite an outbreak of strikes to protest layoffs and the 
loss of purchasing power 
he said inflation had plunged from a record 84 percent a month 
to 33 percent in april the governments goal initially had been 
to reduce inflation to 10 percent a month in 100 days 
the program has turned out much better than we imagined the 
president said during his press conference at the foreign ministry 
in this inland capital 
collor said the government had moved up its economic targets for 
the first 100 days because the results have been surprisingly 
positive 
the reform plan which went into effect march 16 froze 115 
billion in bank and moneymarket deposits fixed prices for a month 
and created a new currency 
in addition price controls have been lifted on everything 
except utility rates and basic foods the president said the 
exchange rate is on the verge of total freedom 
the bank freeze reduced the amount of money in circulation in 
latin americas most populous nation with 145 million residents 
officials believe an excess of cash was the main cause of brazils 
chronic inflation 
the success of the plan is palpable collor said the 
catastrophic predictions of recession and depression have not 
materialized 
however unions and private economic institutions claim the real 
inflation rate was as high as 40 percent last month buying power 
is estimated to have fallen by up to 63 percent in march 
in recent days strikes have broken out in cities across the 
country to protest the loss of buying power and a rise in layoffs 
bus and subway workers walked off their jobs in several state 
capitals 
labor leaders have talked of organizing a general strike 
the austerity measures have led private companies to fire an 
estimated 400000 workers and put 700000 others on paid holiday 
the government recently said up to onefourth of its 16 million 
employees would be laid off 
however collor said workers would not be jeopardized by the 
governments decision to eliminate official costofliving raises 
and allow free salary negotiations between managers and employees 
he said the government will intervene if employers try to 
impose impossible sacrifices on wage earners but he did not 
offer details 
he also said the labor protests would not shake his 
determination to carry out the cutbacks my will is firm and the 
goals will be met he said

a man who lost his political career and was left 
in financial ruin because of his fight to help people of all races 
get an education won the first profile in courage award on 
wednesday 
carl a elliott a 76yearold southern democrat was awarded 
the first john f kennedy profile in courage award instituted by 
the kennedy library foundation in boston 
during elliotts 16 years in congress in the 1950s and 1960s he 
pushed for civil rights and was instrumental in enacting the 
farreaching national defense education act 
called a living profile in courage elliott faced intense 
public scorn and suffered personal abuse and eventual political 
defeat while achieving victories for the good of a nation he 
loved said paul g kirk jr chairman of the kennedy library 
foundation 
elliott was defeated in 1964 by prosegregation forces 
spearheaded by gov george wallace and two years later lost a bid 
for governor to lureen wallace the wife of wallace who was 
prevented by law from succeeding himself 
that defeat left him in heavy debt he said 
i spent much more than every penny i had ive been wrestling 
with those debts ever since and still am elliott said 
but hell get some help from the award next tuesday hell 
receive a trophy crafted by tiffany amp co in the shape of a ships 
beacon as well as a 25000 stipend 
elliott once a hulking figure is now a frail diabetic 
confined to a wheelchair and legally blind kirk said 
bill barnard chairman of the history department at the 
university of alabama said elliott is the embodiment of the old 
adage about a prophet not being honored in his own country 
that is what happened to carl elliott you only hope you live 
long enough to be recognized for your accomplishments barnard 
said 
the profile in courage award was created by the kennedy library 
foundation in 1989 to honor president john f kennedy and encourage 
people to value courage in elected officials 
elliott now a retired attorney delighted in the longoverdue 
recognition as reporter after reporter telephoned his modest home 
in downtown jasper ala 
i understand there were 5000 nominations it makes me feel 
good to be chosen he said i feel this will help the cause of 
education 
heres a role model who was consistent with what president 
kennedy himself believed kirk said heres a fellow who knew 
what the price would be politically and paid it 
in 1948 elliott was elected to house of representatives two 
years after kennedy was first elected to the house but his 
commitment to education began when as the son of tenant farmers 
he believed thenuniversity of alabama president george denny when 
he said anyone willing to work could make his way through the 
university 
elliott took denny at his word and arrived on campus with 238 
denny soon found the impoverished student sleeping in a deserted 
building and gave him a batch of odd jobs 
that experience prompted elliott to spend 10 years trying to 
pass a bill that became the national defense education act of 1958 
the first billiondollar education bill ever passed by congress and 
the foundation for todays student loans and grants 
he continued to fight for federal education aid despite fears 
of many southerners that it would open the doors of colleges to 
more blacks 
there was a lot of talk of that but we wrote that bill to 
take care of all americans who were bright and wanted to go to 
college he said 
he admits to some bitterness about having his political career 
cut short but he said im not blaming anybody about any of it 
i fought the good fight and im proud of it 
of the more than 5000 nominations for the award four others 
were selected as finalists they are oklahoma gov henry bellmon 
a former us senator unita blackwell the mayor of mayersville 
miss and the first black mayor in the state leroy collins 
former governor of florida and morris k udall a member of the 
house of representatives since 1961

prince charles said wednesday that he speaks 
german better after a drink 
the 41yearold son of queen elizabeth ii and heir to the 
british throne told a group of businessmen i am the kind of 
englishman i think who finds conversing in a foreign language is 
made much easier with the assistance of a small alcoholic beverage 
maybe that is why i succeeded in failing my olevel german 
alcohol was restricted at school he joked 
olevels are britains schoolleaving examinations that are 
taken by students when they are about 16 
on a more serious note the prince said britain urgently needs 
to make up lost ground by learning foreign languages if it is to 
maintain its competitive edge in the world 
in a separate interview published wednesday in the scotsman 
prince charles said he was sometimes demoralized by the vitriolic 
personal abuse he has attracted with his sixyear campaign for 
better architecture 
i try not to but occasionally i get demoralized or dispirited 
by it the prince said 
but prince charles said he would intensify his campaign 
i would not have gone on with my activities on the 
architectural design and development front unless i felt there was 
support from the public or that i had struck a chord he said 
the prince last year produced a book on his personal view of 
architecture a vision of britain and made a television 
documentary on the subject his attacks on modern architecture have 
prompted protests from some architects 
the prince dislikes office blocks towering over st pauls 
cathedral in london wayside gas stations factories department 
stores and highrise apartments on open plains he tends to favor 
classicstyle buildings with porticoes and columns and 
turnofthecentury homes

a committee of experts urged congress on 
wednesday to let investigators monitor the personal finances of 
government and defense workers who know top secrets because most 
modern spies work for money 
after nine months of study on behalf of sens david boren 
dokla and william cohen rmaine chairman and vice chairman of 
the senate intelligence committee the panel proposed 13 new laws 
many of the proposals are aimed at the 700000 government and 
contract workers who have access to top secret information to get 
those jobs they would be required to allow investigators access to 
their bank and commercial credit records anytime up to five years 
after they leave the secret work 
they would be required to report any foreign travel or contacts 
by citizens of foreign countries 
employees who work with codes and code machines would be subject 
to random polygraph tests questions would be limited to whether 
they spied or sold secrets and not ask in sen borens words 
how many cocktails they drank or xrated movies they saw 
the experts also recommended making it a crime to possess spy 
tools like burst transmitters and secret writing devices with 
intent to commit espionage 
we hope this legislation would raise the risk that individuals 
would run by engaging in espionage first that they would be 
caught and second that they would end up paying a penalty 
serving time in jail said retired navy adm bobby ray inman 
former cia deputy director 
inman and other panel members told a hearing of the senate 
intelligence committee that the ninemember panel had looked for 
patterns in the spy cases of recent years in the 1960s there was 
an overwhelmingly shift from recruitment of spies through 
ideology to volunteer spies usually seeking money he said 
he presented an analysis of 19 wellknown cases in the last 20 
years money was a motive in 14 
sen boren said the experts had pointed out a blind spot in 
us defenses once workers obtain security clearances we know 
less about them financially than if theyre applying for an auto 
loan boren said 
the experts and the senators emphasized that the collapse of 
communism in eastern europe and its internal difficulties in the 
soviet union had not lessened the spy threat 
more and more foreign government will be out to steal our 
national economic secrets sen boren predicted 
warren christopher a los angeles lawyer who served as no 2 
official in the justice and state departments said looking west 
from the pacific rim the world does not seem so much changed it 
seems more dangerous particularly in terms of economic espionage 
but under questioning from sen john danforth rmo columbia 
university law professor harold edgar acknowledged that the 
proposals do not specifically treat economic espionage aimed at 
private corporate secrets unless they also are government defense 
secrets 
in addition the panel proposed 
two more criminal violations selling any document labelled top 
secret and removing top secret documents from government custody 
the government would no longer have to disclose what was in the 
secret documents 
giving the fbi the right to obtain credit records in secret 
with a letter assuring the credit bureau that the subject was 
suspected of spying and allowing the fbi to obtain secretly the 
names of unlisted telephone owners who call suspects in a spy case 
these two are being proposed already by the bush administration 
but have been rejected by congress before the american civil 
liberties union has opposed both arguing that the fbi has not 
shown a need and that the government could collect data on people 
making innocent calls 
barring spies from profiting from books about their crimes 
denying government retirement pay to us workers convicted in 
foreign courts of disclosing us secrets 
establishing a 1 million reward for turning in a spy 
requiring the fbi to obtain a warrant from the secret foreign 
intelligence surveillance court before burglarizing a suspected 
spy such warrants are required to plant listening device the 
burglaries socalled black bag jobs are done under inherent 
presidential powers 
the carter administration persuaded the court to issue three 
warrants for burglaries but the reagan administration convinced 
the judges that they did not have the power to issue burglary 
warrants 
allowing the national security agency the nations code 
agency to provide aftercare and counseling to troubled employees 
because several spies began work after they quit 
the panel was informally chaired by venture capitalist eli 
jacobs baltimore orioles baseball team owner and government 
defense adviser 
other members are former cia director richard helms former 
carter white house counsel lloyd cutler former reagan white house 
counsel arthur b culvahouse jr former ambassador to the 
organization of american states sol linowitz and former ambassador 
and state department official seymour weiss

thousands of flagwaving israelis celebrated 
the 1967 capture of arab east jerusalem and the government 
launched a counteroffensive at critics who link its hardline 
policies to the killings of seven arabs 
in neighboring jordan a palestinian rioter was shot to death 
and four other people including two policemen were seriously 
wounded during a sixhour clash at the hitteen refugee camp near 
the capital of amman police reported 
hundreds of jordanian police fired live ammunition and tear gas 
at the massed demonstrators in an effort to prevent looting and 
rioing but police said two branches of the jordan housing bank on 
the outskirts of the refugee camp were gutted by rioters 
police said the dead rioter was killed by a bullet of a type 
not used by the police implying he was shot accidentally by 
other demonstrators 
that raised the casualty toll in jordan to four dead and 29 
wounded in three days of violent palestinian demonstrations over 
the murder of seven palestinian laborers on sunday by a israeli 
civilian described by police as deranged 
in east jerusalems old city angry moslem worshipers hurled 
stones at jewish extremists when the jews tried to pray near the al 
aqsa mosque on the temple mount the site where tradition holds 
king solomon and later king herod built their temples no one was 
injured 
the army extended curfews on most of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip for a fourth day to quell violent protests of the sunday 
massacre about 15 million palestinians were confined to their 
homes 
in gazas bani suheila village 8yearold mustafa awad el fajem 
was shot and killed when an unidentified gunman opened fire from a 
passing vehicle an army spokeswoman said 
she was unsure whether a military vehicle was involved israel 
radio said the passing vehicle had yellow israeli license plates 
but gave no further details 
seven palestinians were reported wounded by army gunfire in 
clashes since sundays massacre 13 palestinians have been killed 
by israeli soldiers trying to put down protests and more than 800 
have been reported shot beaten or suffered from teargas 
inhalation 
el fajems death brought to 708 the number of palestinians 
killed by israelis in the 29monthold palestinian uprising at 
least 216 other palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree israelis 
have also died 
the european community echoing us government statements 
accused israel of excessive force to put down the 
demonstrations and said the lack of peace efforts had fostered 
the upsurge in violence 
israelius ties have suffered the past two months over the 
stalled middle east peace process and the settlement policies of 
hardline prime minister yitzhak shamir 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united 
states believes that absence of a peace process contributes to 
violence in the middle east 
foreign minister moshe arens a close shamir ally in the 
rightwing likud bloc acknowledged that israel was on the 
defensive 
there is no doubt we are having a difficult period in the 
international arena we have to prepare for a confrontation in this 
area he said 
foreign ministry spokesman yossi amihud said israel was 
especially concerned with embassy reports indicating that within 
foreign governments there is an attempt to make a connection 
between the murder of seven people and the peace process 
arens told israel radio were dealing with a man who went 
berserk killing people indiscriminately weve seen these kinds of 
scenes in other places including the united states 
israeli authorities say the man charged in sundays seven 
killings in a tel aviv suburb 21yearold ami popper was deranged 
and also upset by an unhappy love affair a judge ordered a 
psychiatric evaluation for him 
in jerusalem thousands of flagwaving israelis marched through 
the city to mark jerusalem day the 23rd anniversary of the capture 
of the gaza strip the west bank and arab east jerusalem from egypt 
and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
israel annexed east jerusalem in 1967 but the united states and 
other western nations maintain the final status of the city should 
be determined in peace talks palestinians want east jerusalem to 
be the capital of their wouldbe state 
in a related development a spokesman for yasser arafat said the 
plo leader scheduled to address the un security council in 
geneva on friday will seek un intervention to protect 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
shamirs adviser avi pazner said israel sees the idea of 
stationing un observers in the occupied territories as a 
violation of its sovereignity and would ask the united states to 
veto such a proposal 
in lebanon almost 10000 people marched to a local un office 
to protest the killing of the palestinian laborers and to demand 
swift action from the united nations and other international 
organizations

prime minister brian mulroney said wednesday some 
hope remains that differences among canadas 10 provincial premiers 
over the meech lake accord can be sufficiently narrowed to hold a 
conference 
mulroney is working against a june 23 deadline the accord 
which would recognize the frenchspeaking province of quebec as a 
distinct society and give all provinces expanded powers will 
expire then unless ratified by the holdout provinces of new 
brunswick newfoundland and manitoba 
by law all 10 provinces must ratify the accord which was 
designed to win quebecs support for the 1982 constitution 
sen lowell murray mulroneys personal meech lake emissary 
told the prime minister too much divides the premiers to hold an 
immediate meeting 
but mulroney who has slept little the last few days as he 
searched for a way to save meech lake told the house of commons 
that murray may have a way out of the impasse 
mulroney told opposition leader herb gray suggestions that have 
been advanced might facilitate the bringing together of the 
parties so that we could narrow the terrain that process might 
indeed lead to a fruitful first ministers conference meaning a 
conference of the federal prime minister and the 10 provincial 
premiers 
a special committee led by quebec tory jean charest made 23 
recommendations last week aimed at coming up with a meechsaving 
compromise 
on monday lucien bouchard mulroneys environment minister and 
his senior quebec minister resigned from the tory caucus and the 
cabinet quebec rankandfile member of parliament gilbert 
chartrant quit the conservative party tuesday both viewed the 
committee report as a sellout of their province 
treasury board president robert de cotret was named acting 
environment minister wednesday 
bouchard a longtime friend of mulroney campaigned for 
sovereigntyassociation for quebec in 1980 before joining the 
tories he said the government now was trying to amend meech lake 
breaking a promise it made to quebec which contains 67 million of 
canadas 25 million residents 
bouchards defection further dampened hopes of meech lakes 
surviving 
opposition to meech lake has fanned separation fears in quebec 
and renewed talk of sovereigntyassociation in which the province 
would be politically distinct but maintain economic ties with the 
rest of the country 
murray admitted time was running out and called meech lake the 
ultimate symbol of compromise and openness by quebec after its 
humiliation when the 1982 constitution was signed without quebecs 
participation 
murray called on mulroney and quebec premier robert bourassa to 
accept no changes to the accord and to let those who are trying to 
scuttle meech lake suffer the consequences 
the government of premier clyde wells in newfoundland rescinded 
approval of meech lake last month wells argues the accord 
entrenches regional disparities blocks senate reform and gives 
quebec special powers 
new brunswick and manitoba have never approved the accord

arab foreign ministers agreed wednesday to 
a fivepoint agenda for an upcoming conference of their kings and 
heads of state that will concentrate on soviet jewish immigration 
to israel 
syria has announced it will boycott the monday summit which is 
being hosted by its main arab rival iraq 
the agenda made available to the associated press by a 
conference source also listed perceived threats against iraq and 
libya and the lack of a peace treaty between iran and iraq 
the palestine liberation organization scored a political victory 
when its working paper was adopted with only minor changes as the 
recommended draft resolution on the middle east crisis 
egypt had suggested a working paper in line with a controversial 
us memorandum to the summit that called on arabs to support 
direct negotiations between israel and palestinians and made no 
formal reference to a role for the plo 
the adpoted draft resolution reiterates support for the plos 
peace overtures and calls for convening an international peace 
conference the us memorandum had suggested dropping the 
international conference from the summit resolutions 
the paper reiterates that jerusalem is the capital of an 
envisaged palestinian state and calls for economic and political 
sanctions by the arabs against any country that officially regards 
jerusalem as the capital of the jewish state 
most nations including the united states do not regard 
jerusalem as the capital of israel 
it also called for sanctions against any country or institution 
that facilitates the immigration of soviet jews to israel 
the paper urged governments to open their borders to soviet jews 
so the emigrants do not have to move to israel 
it also called on the united nations to secure international 
supervision of the occupied territories to guard against the 
settlement of soviet jews in the west bank and gaza strip 
the draft resolutions will only become binding if it is endorsed 
by arab leaders at the summit resolutions drafted at foreign 
ministerial meetings are usually approved with few changes 
the emergency meeting was called by arafat to discuss soviet 
jewish immigration to israel 
the us memorandum was delivered this weekend to arab league 
secretarygeneral chedli klibi who submitted a text in arabic to 
the foreign ministers on tuesday 
the memorandum said washington remains opposed to the 
establishment of jewish settlements in the israelioccupied 
territories but supported the immigration of soviet jews as a 
perfectly legitimate human right 
it urged the arabs not to try and block the right of jews to 
emigrate or israels right to absorb them within its own 
territories

the companys founder from the joffreys repetoire has been 
meeting with a committee from the ballets board of directors since 
then according to a statement issued by the company 
he resigned after the board voted to set up an operating 
committee that would run the company in place of both arpino and 
the 55member board ten board members resigned in protest over 
what one member called a takeover by businessmen ignorant of 
artistic matters 
arpino whose resignation was never accepted by the board 
continued as artistic director of the companys ballet school 
arpino earlier had given permission for his ballets to return to 
the companys repertory this friday two days before the end of a

company since its early days 
however critics and dance buffs alike have often called his 
works pedestrian instead of inspired and without structure 
purpose or artistry with the exception of such works as sea 
shadow 1962 and viva vivaldi 1965 arpino is considered a 
secondrate choreographer who merely moves dancers around a stage

most kids would rather play video games 
than fight ivory poachers but some university of connecticut 
educators worked to change that wednesday 
the first international peace games festival brought students 
from 94 high schools and middle schools around the state 
massachusetts and canada to participate in a celebration of peace 
and play peace games designed by the students 
we have to change the mind frame of children said francelia 
butler a uconn english professor and organizer of the event we 
have to make them look at tragedy and say what can i do to resolve 
this 
butler 77 said she is tired of singing songs and holding 
candles and other such demonstrations against world conflict she 
believes a more practical approach is changing the attitude of 
tomorrows peace makers 
glasnost has changed a lot of peoples mind and peace is 
possible she said 
the studentdesigned games had themes ranging from abortion to 
environmental causes one called tusk mania addressed the 
plight of the endangered african elephant 
the game board designed by sixth graders was in the shape of 
africa and the object was to get the elephantshaped game pieces 
safely to a sanctuary to avoid ivory poachers 
in another game entitled peace with nature players were 
penalized for bringing styrofoam cups to a picnic or for using 
aerosol spray cans but if they donated money to save the rain 
forest they were awarded an extra turn 
butler said her students at uconn have been designing board 
games for her classes for three years as a requirement of the 
course some of those students went around the state to show the 
younger children how to design a peace game 
a successful peace game should feature conflict resolution 
where peace wins and war is averted she said her students 
turned in 11 games last semester on the berlin wall including one 
where for each correct trivia question answered another brick 
would be taken off the wall

colombias presidential frontrunner said 
wednesday the united states must work harder at stopping the 
narcotics trade and more vigorously prosecute drug suspects like 
washington mayor marion barry 
cesar gaviria the only of four candidates in sundays election 
to take a hardline stand on colombias drug traffickers 
complained that colombians are dying in the drug war while other 
nations take only limited action 
in a statement released wednesday gaviria said the united 
states and other industrial countries must take more 
responsibility he said other countries are not showing a serious 
commitment to end this scourge of drug traffickers 
he also called for increased economic aid to this violentprone 
south american country 
the colombian public does not understand why we should assume 
the costs of the battle against drug trafficking and simultaneously 
put up with discrimination against our export products said 
gaviria he said exports likes coffee and flowers should receive 
preferential treatment 
the drug trade has been a major issue in the election gaviria 
of the governing liberal party has rejected negotiations with drug 
traffickers he has said he will continue extraditing us drug 
suspects 
the other three candidates have all allowed the possibility of 
some agreement with the traffickers to end the terror 
three more policemen were assassinated wednesday in medellin 
home to the worlds most powerful cocaine cartel officials blame 
drug traffickers for murdering 29 policemen there this month 
officials blame cocaine traffickers for killing more than 250 
colombians since august when president virgilio barco launched a 
usbacked drug crackdown among the victims are three 
presidential candidates including the liberal partys previous 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
despite us aid gaviria said wednesday for us it is 
discouraging that washington mayor marion barry caught using 
drugs continues to be free and seeking reelection 
barry has been indicted on cocaine possession conspiracy and 
perjury charges but his case has not yet come to trial barry 
hasnt said if he will run again but he has been making political

prime minister andrei lukanov on 
wednesday criticized the opposition for refusing to sign a 
nonviolence pact before june 10 elections his foes said the pact 
ignores campaign problems they encountered 
one called it a propaganda ploy 
lukanov was a major figure in the former communist party now 
called the socialist party 
he said relations with the opposition to date had been 
civilized referring in particular to the 16party union of 
democratic forces or udf 
but he alleged that a tendency existed in the opposition to 
campaign using unethical means and said if this increases his 
party may find itself unable to cooperate with the opposition after 
the elections 
the document was drafted at the initiative of president petar 
mladenov and was to have beeen signed at a televised ceremony last 
monday by all parties contesting the elections 
but udf chairman zhelyu zhelev and others refused to sign they 
complained that the language of the agreement papers over the 
obstruction intimidation and even physical violence suffered by 
the opposition during the campaign 
among accusations brought by zhelev and the other udf leaders 
were falsification of electoral lists violation of accords signed 
during negotiations with the former communists and a virtual ban 
on opposition campaigning in army barracks 
udf officials said their representatives were barred from 
joining electoral commissions in many constituencies and that many 
instances had occurred of physical attacks on opposition candidates 
among other organizations that refused to sign mladenovs pact 
were the political opposition bloc a grouping of 14 
rightofcenter and conservative parties and the alternative 
socialist party which broke away from the then communist party 
after a party congress early this year 
the alternative socialist party is the fourth biggest party in 
bulgaria after the governing socialists the udf and the agrarian 
party once a docile ally of the communists before longtime 
strongman todor zhivkov was ousted last november 
alternative socialist chairman nikolai vasilev told a news 
conference mladenovs propoosal was a propaganda move that may 
hoodwink the public at home and abroad 
he termed the text of the agreement nonsense since all its 
clauses are already in the constitution 
vasilev said he could conceive of close cooperation with one of 
the udf parties after the elections though not with the socialist 
party 
the asp can easily imagine a broad social democratic bloc 
which is led by petar dertliev leader of the social democratic 
party vasilev said 
he said if dertliev ran for the presidency the alternative 
socialists would support him

police and nbc are investigating allegations that 
a television station staged a fight between two pit bull terriers 
for a report on illegal dog fights 
kcnctv insists it received a videotape of the fight in the mail 
the allegations arose from a fourpart series on illegal dog 
fights compiled by kcnc reporter wendy bergen and two video camera 
operators in colorado staging a dog fight or attending one is a 
felony punishable by up to four years in prison and a maximum 
1000 fine 
one of the series of reports broadcast april 29 through may 2 
during a ratings sweep period featured the fight between two 
unmuzzled dogs that police say occurred on a grassy area near the 
south platte river in sheridan a denver suburb 
after the report sources telephoned some competing denver tv 
stations and a newspaper with claims the fight was staged for kcnc 
and that the station paid for it their reports identified the 
sources only as current or former kcnc employees 
kcnc general manager roger ogden on wednesday denied the claims 
saying the station received unsolicited tape of the fight 
anonymously in the mail 
investigations were launched by the sheridan and lakewood police 
departments and the district attorneys offices in arapahoe and 
jefferson counties 
sheridan is in arapahoe county and lakewood the hometown of a 
man who allegedly owns one of the fighting pit bulls is in 
jefferson county 
we are close to concluding our investigation lakewood 
police spokesman john hunt said we expect within the next few 
days perhaps to have some sort of statement 
ogden said an internal investigation is underway at the 
nbcaffiliated station and the network also is looking into the 
matter said nbc spokesman richard cutting in new york 
the station has released edited tapes of the fourpart series to 
police police say they identified the owner of one of the pit 
bulls involved but declined to identify him 
the tapes showed people at the dog fight but their faces were 
distorted to protect their identities said robin duxbury 
executive director of the rocky mountain humane society 
the organization has called for advertisers to boycott the 
station until it releases the unedited versions of the tapes kcnc 
news director marv rockford declined to say whether the station 
would release the tapes 
the organization sent letters to businesses this week asking 
them to boycott kcnc but it was too early to measure the efforts 
success she said 
ms bergen has declined to be interviewed 
ratings sweeps periods take place four times a year and are 
crucial to local stations because they help determine local 
advertising rates 
the controversy heightened local debate over the pressurecooker 
effect of the sweeps on news operations 
the staging of news is unethical period david bartlett 
president of the radio and television news directors association 
said from washington he declined to speak specifically about the 
denver case until the investigations are completed

the former skipper of the uss kinkaid was 
acquitted of criminal liability wednesday in the collision of the 
destroyer with a merchant ship off the malay peninsula an accident 
that killed one crewman 
a military judge said the prosecution failed to prove charges of 
negligence and dereliction of duty during cmdr john cochranes 
courtmartial which lasted eight days 
cochrane who was relieved of his command about a week after the 
accident smiled and embraced his attorneys then his wife 
suzanne upon hearing the judges verdict 
im not bitter towards the navy i love the united states 
navy he said afterwards in the end i was exonerated and it 
proves the military justice system works 
the destroyer collided with a panamanianregistered merchant 
vessel in the strait of malacca 240 miles northwest of singapore 
on nov 12 the accident killed one crewman and injured five others 
lt tom courtney one of cochranes attorneys said the case 
should never have come to courtmartial because the navy had 
assigned accountability to cochrane for the accident by stripping 
him of his command 
the judge capt richard reed agreed noting in his decision 
that accountability traditionally assigned a navy skipper for the 
safe navigation of his ship and wellbeing of his crew differs from 
criminal liability 
the standards applied are significantly different said 
reed adding that criminal sanctions demand proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt 
prosecutor lt cmdr leroy dickens left the courtroom 
immediately after the verdict without comment but cmdr danny 
barrett the chief navy prosecutor in san diego said the verdict 
changes very little 
the defense attorney cmdr bayne smith said during his closing 
argument earlier wednesday that cochrane should not be held 
criminally liable for the failings of subordinates 
a commanding officer cannot do everything hands on 
ultimately he must rely on his men to do their jobs and obey his 
orders smith said 
dickens said in his closing argument that cochranes weak 
management style and failure to follow established procedures led 
to the accident in the heavily traveled strait of malacca 
cochrane was charged with failing to obey navy instructions 
dereliction of duty and hazarding his vessel he faced up to two

the government wednesday rejected a 
bailout of weak east german companies amid new signs that 
unification may bring negative side effects to west germans 
also wednesday the president of the east german parliament said 
political unification could be complete by the end of the year 
the two germanys last week signed a treaty on joining their 
economies that merger is to take place july 2 
however west germanys opposition social democrats charge that 
the treaty should go further in protecting east german factories 
and jobs and giving east german goods a fair chance of competing 
with west german products 
chancellor helmut kohls government has refused to change the 
accord known as the state treaty but indicated a willingness 
to negotiate new provisions 
i am always ready for compromise if compromise means 
reasonable cooperation but if it means renegotiating the state 
treaty my answer is a clear no kohl said wednesday he said 
he would meet with social democratic leader hansjochen vogel next 
week 
however the government said it would not pump huge sums of 
money into failing east german businesses 
economics minister helmut haussmann said the opposition demands 
would cost the west german government an additional burden of way 
over 100 billion marks the equivalent of 60 billion 
he said measures will be taken to help east german businesses 
survive the sudden immersion into capitalism but he acknowledged 
that some would collapse 
it doesnt make sense to preserve uncompetitive operations 
against market forces said haussmann my course is adaptation 
yes but artificial preservation no 
however the social democrats renewed their charge that too many 
east german factories and jobs will become extinct after july 2 
east germany must not be turned into an extended supermarket 
for west german goods said west berlin mayor walter momper a 
social democrat 
at the same time the social democrats softened their stand 
saying they wont try to delay the economic merger 
also wednesday a major utility company said west german 
electrical capacity could be pushed to the limit if east germans 
become dependent on it 
there could be huge problems if there is an especially harsh 
winter said klaus knizia head of the united electrical works of 
north rhinewestphalia state 
east germany which uses airfouling brown coal for heating is 
expected to switch to cleaner methods during the unification 
process 
west germans also fear tax hikes and inflation as a result of 
their aid to east germans during unification 
in bonn on a visit parliament president sabine bergmannpohl of 
east germany said she could imagine the east german states 
declaring themselves part of west germany by the end of the year 
kohl who is pushing for quick unification has suggested joint 
german elections in december

the president of colts manufacturing co 
assailed a senate vote wednesday to outlaw some assault weapons as 
a sad and dishonest effort to make voters think lawmakers are 
fighting crime 
a spokesman for intratec in miami which makes one of the guns 
on the proposed weapons hit list was more optimistic 
weve had proposals in the past and we really dont know what 
the final outcome will be said mike solo national sales and 
marketing director of intratec this of course doesnt look good 
but it doesnt tell us where our future is 
the restrictions which await final senate action would bar the 
import of five foreignmade assault weapons and outlaw us 
manufacture of four others 
the 5248 vote came as a sharp defeat for the national rifle 
association which had lobbied to kill the curbs in the 
wideranging bill law enforcement groups had called on the senate 
to support the restrictions 
the bush administration opposes the restrictions 
colt has said it no longer makes the ar15 once the 
bestselling semiautomatic rifle in the nation and one of the 
weapons named in the omnibus crime billthe bill also outlaws 
production of the car15 made by colt 
it is a sad and dishonest effort to make the public think the 
politicians are actually doing something about crime said 
richard f gamble president of colts manufacturing 
in fact rifles of any description are almost never used in 
crimes and semiautomatic socalled assault rifles have been used 
in less than threehundredths of 1 percent of all crimes where a 
gun was involved gamble said 
he refused to comment wednesday on what effect if any the ban 
would have on colts manufacturing 
colt firearms a division of colt industries stopped production 
of the ar15 in 1989 shortly after bush banned the importation of 
similar weapons 
colts new management has begun producing a weapon it calls the 
sporter which guncontrol advocates contend is nearly identical to 
the ar15 the company maintains it is a different weapon noting 
it cannot be fitted with a bayonet and its magazine capacity is 
only five rounds 
the sporter is sufficiently different from the ar15 to be 
unaffected by the bill which listed specific models of weapons 
said bob maynes press secretary to sen dennis deconcini dariz 
a supporter of the ban 
intratecs solo said the public would suffer most from the 
restrictions the intratec tec9 was one of the guns targeted for 
restrictions 
its just a shame the average joe citizen whether it be a 
plinker or a target shooter gets muddied from the bad guys solo 
said 
the other domestic guns on the restricted list are the street 
sweeperstriker 12 and the mac 10 and mac 11

a provincial court on wednesday sentenced a 
29yearold man convicted of a series of rapes to 142 years in 
prison one of the stiffest sexcrime penalties in recent spanish 
history sources said 
but francisco javier amedo a former coalminer can only serve a 
maximum 30 years according to the spanish constitution which 
places a maximum limit on imprisonment 
the sentence came as feminist groups have stepped up protests 
against sex crimes and rulings by conservative judges who have 
imposed light sentences on rapists 
there are no trials by jury in spain 
a threejudge court in this northern city found amedo married 
with a young daughter guilty of seven counts of rape and five 
counts of sexual molestation 
the trial gained national attention because of protests outside 
the oviedo courthouse by feminist groups demanding stiff sentences 
for the rapist who terrorized women in the city from 1985 to 1988 
police arrested amedo in january 1989 after he was identified by 
one of the victims 
amedo was described by the local press as the station rapist 
because all the attacks occurred near train and bus stations he 
received prison terms of 17 years and four months on each rape 
count and four years and two months for each of five counts of 
sexual molestation 
during his trial amedo denied any involvement in the attacks 
nine victims testified against him saying they had been raped or 
molested at knife point after accepting rides in his car 
womens groups praised the stiff sentence saying it served as a 
strong deterrent to sexual attacks

more research is needed before injections of 
immunoglobulin blood cells are used generally to treat babies with 
aids a national institutes of health committee said wednesday 
the committee made the recommendation after studying the uses of 
an treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or ivig 
which is becoming widely used for a variety of illnesses related to 
the immune system 
dr peter e lipsky the committee chairman and a professor at 
the university of texas southwestern medical center said that 
although ivig has been reported in one limited study as useful in 
treating newborns with aids there have been no clinical trials to 
prove its value 
the treatment is unpleasant said lipsky if it doesnt 
afford much benefit it doesnt make sense to subject them to this 
expensive treatment 
clinical trials are now underway the committee said to 
determine if the ivig therapy can help babies born with aids to 
develop natural defenses against disease 
the panel was organized to establish a medical consensus for the 
uses of ivig the immunoglobulin therapy has been approved to treat 
some types of immune deficiency diseases but experimental uses 
have developed what lipsky called anecdotal evidence that ivig 
may be useful in treating other illnesses 
immunoglobulin is the antibody component of human blood 
antibodies are diseasefighting proteins made by the bodys immune 
system antibodies will attack any bacteria virus tissue cell or 
substance that that appear foreign to the host body 
doctors have used human antibody shots for years to protect 
patients from a variety of infections or to boost a patients 
immune system but the shots are very painful and as a result 
were used only when no other therapy was available 
in the 1980s however pharmaceutical companies developed a way 
to process immunoglobulin so that it can be injected into veins 
this is far less painful and enables doctors to use massive amounts 
lipsky said the new treatment had such a dramatic effect on 
patients with immune problems that many doctors began using ivig to 
treat other conditions 
the enthusiasm has caused there to be lots of therapeutic 
adventurism said lipsky he said the nih committee was 
established to determine which of the new treatments actually work 
the committee recommended that ivig continue to be used for 
patients whose immune systems do not create natural antibodies a 
condition called primary immunodeficiency 
ivig is also appropriate the committee said for reducing 
infection among patients who have received bone marrow transplants 
or who have chronic lymphatic leukemia 
the committee said ivig also has been shown effective among 
children who develop kawasaki syndrome an inflammatory disease 
that often causes heart disease 
lipsky said that though there have been limited examples of ivig 
preventing infection among premature babies and relieving symptoms 
of such disorders as arthritis or brain seizures the committee 
could not recommend ivig for those uses until further study is done 
seven companies now produce ivig but lipsky said the therapy 
continues to be very expensive ivig treatment for some patients 
with chronic immune system problems may cost up to 5000 monthly 
he said

defense secretary dick cheney on 
wednesday acknowledged a safety problem with us nuclear artillery 
shells in europe but said it was fixed and there never was a risk 
of accidental nuclear explosions 
in 1988 he said officials found that the w79 howitzer shells 
did not meet minimum safety standards the necessary steps were 
taken to assure it does meet our very high safety standards 
today cheney said 
the washington post reported wednesday that the united states 
was repairing artillery shells and examining the design of two 
kinds of missiles because of the risk of an accidental nuclear 
explosion 
responding to the story cheney told reporters it is 
important here not to overdramatize the nature of the problem i 
will simply say that there was no danger but that the shells 
in question did not meet the very high standards that we have i 
dont believe there was any cause for concern 
he declined to go into details of what was done to correct the 
problems saying such matters are classified he spoke after a 
twoday nato defense ministers meeting 
the bulk of us nuclear shells are in west germany with the 
remainder stockpiled in the netherlands and italy 
cheney said the west german government was told we had 
identified the problem and that we had solved the problem 
speaking at a separate news conference in brussels west 
germanys defense minister gerhard stoltenberg confirmed this but 
said his government was not told what was wrong with the shells 
he said this was normal in the past he said us officials 
have informed bonn of modifications to us nuclear arms on 
german soil without detailing the modifications 
he said us officials have said there was at no point in time 
any danger to either personnel or the environment stoltenberg 
said 
in the netherlands where some us nuclear weapons are based a 
dutch defense ministry spokesman said we are always informed 
when the americans are planning maintenance on nuclear weapons 
there 
the spokesman martijn verbrugge would not say when or if 
dutch officials were told about problems with the nuclear shells 
the washington post said us troops in europe were warned not 
to move the shells until they were fixed 
the problem with the w79 shell was one of three found recently 
by energy department experts it said 
a special committee will review the w88 warhead on the new 
seaborne d5 missile the post said and it said special flight 
restrictions have been instituted pending review of the w69 
warhead on the shortrange srama missile carried by some bomber 
aircraft 
the two warheads use the same volatile fuel that experts feared 
could explode in certain accidents and set off the conventional 
explosives that trigger the nuclear ones 
those conventional explosives surround a mass of plutonium and 
compress it from all sides to the point where the nuclear chain 
reaction begins causing a nuclear explosion in a split second 
john c tuck an acting assistant secretary at the department of 
energy told a congressional subcommittee wednesday that his agency 
is satisfied that the w79 howitzer warhead is safe he said 
the w88 a trident missile warhead is a safe warhead as well 
however he said the w69 may be removed from alertstatus 
aircraft and stored until actually needed 
stanford university physicist sidney d drell who has been 
named to a subcommittee panel with two other outside physicists to 
study the safety of us nuclear weapons said wednesday i dont 
think there is any question of coverup or negligence 
they just wanted to appoint three of us with some experience 
to give our best technical judgment about whats being done and how 
its being done and whether its appropriate 
in the telephone interview from his new york office he said he 
expected the panel to start work this summer he said he was 
uncertain how long its studies would take 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he believed a nuclear war would more likely result 
from an accident or safety problem than from a deliberate attack 
he said the united states should enter into an accord with the 
soviet union for a thorough and failsafe review of nuclear 
safety 
the artillery shell problem was discovered by special computer 
studies in 1988 the post said 
it said these raised the possibility that a bullet striking the 
conventional explosive could set off part of it dispersing the 
highly toxic plutonium though not necessarily causing a chain 
reaction 
but if the bullet hit while the shells were in the artillery 
piece the barrel of the weapon might reflect neutrons back into 
the plutonium to cause a nuclear explosion according to experts 
questioned by the post 
the w88 was feared to be vulnerable to an accidental nuclear 
explosion but the w69 threat was dispersal of plutonium the 
paper said 
an unidentified senior military official was quoted as saying 
for a while we were worried that these things might go off if 
they fell off the back of a truck and landed in a certain way 
special teams early in 1989 installed safing mechanisms and 
the shells are being modified the post said

baseball card experts raised doubts 
wednesday about the authenticity of a honus wagner baseball card 
that turned up in this central maine town 
an authentic card in good condition featuring the hall of fame 
shortstop from the early 1900s could be worth 10000 to more than 
100000 according to card shop dealers 
arlo quint 12 said he unearthed the wagner card and three 
others while digging for worms in his back yard monday the cards 
were in an old tooth powder can quint said 
the wagner card surfaced only about a month after a boy in 
stockton springs about 30 miles away found a what was said to be 
honus wagner card under similar circumstances 
the similarity of the discoveries almost immediately sparked 
doubts about quints find 
bob thing an area man who has been collecting cards for 40 
years inspected quints card wednesday 
he said the paper on which the wagner card is printed appears to 
be thinner than it would be on an original and the ink colors 
appeared wrong he also noted that the lower portion of the card 
where reproductions printed in later years would have been marked 
as a reprint was missing 
baseball card authority lew lipset in new york who hadnt seen 
the card said honus wagner cards are so rare that a find would be 
extremely unlikely 
he said it is believed that all of the original honus wagner 
cards remaining with perhaps one exception were issued by sweet 
caporal cigarettes however quints card is marked as a piedmont 
cigarette issue

public pressure over the health risks their products pose critics 
have focused on advertising they maintain is intended to persuade 
the young and uneducated to take up smoking and on efforts to 
boost tobacco exports 
the city university of new york policy was adopted monday at a 
regular board meeting 
the policy is that the university will divest itself of its 
stocks in companies that manufacture cigarettes said rita rodin 
a spokeswoman for cuny on wednesday they will do it in a way 
that will not adversely affect the universitys portfolio

completed the sales in march according to harvard president derek 
bok 
he revealed the sale may 18 in a letter to three harvard school 
of public health students who had been demanding the university 
sell its investments in companies manufacturing cigarettes 
in reaching its decision the corporation was motivated by a 
desire not to be associated as a shareholder with companies engaged 
in significant sales of products that create a substantial and 
unjustified risk of harm to other human beings bok wrote 
dr allan blum a houston physician and chairman of doctors 
ought to care a national antismoking group that pushes for 
divestment of tobacco stocks called harvards decision a 
breakthrough morally and financially

fiji on wednesday ordered india to close its 
embassy in suva and told the indian charge daffaires to leave 
within 24 hours 
the announcement by fijis ministry of foreign affairs also 
ordered all indian embassy staff to leave within two weeks 
in new delhi indias government said it would not comment on 
the move 
a government statement said the embassy was ordered closed 
because the indian government was conducting an unwarranted and 
unacceptable international campaign against fiji and was similarly 
blocking fijis readmission into the commonwealth 
earlier this month the indian government said it would conduct 
an international campaign against fiji to protest what it called 
political discrimination against indians born in fiji 
relations between india and fiji have been strained since 1987 
when the first of two racially inspired coups by the predominately 
ethnic fijian army ousted the indiandominated coalition government 
that had been elected only weeks earlier 
fiji was expelled from the commonwealth as a result of the coup 
and india has said it will oppose fijis reentry as long as the 
country discriminates against its indian population 
indians make up nearly onehalf of the 720000 people on the 
south pacific island 
in october fiji expelled indias ambassador thettalil 
sreenivassan claiming he had interfered in local affairs 
sreenivassan had made public comments after ethnic fijian 
methodists burned four indian places of worship in the city of 
lautoka 
fiji refused to permit india to replace sreenivassen and the 
indian embassy has been headed by charge daffaires vidya bhusan 
soni 
fijis interim government has said a constitution that would 
give ethnic fijians a guaranteed majority in a new bicameral 
parliament would be the best way to restore parliamentary rule

the bush administration for now has backed 
away from its insistence on limiting the ammunition capacity of 
semiautomatic assault weapons the white house acknowledged 
wednesday 
president bush as part of his anticrime package last year 
proposed a ban for private citizens on gun magazines of more than 
15 rounds but now he supports legislation by sen strom thurmond 
rsc that doesnt include that ban said white house spokeswoman 
alixe glen 
its better to support a bill that gives us ninetenths of our 
goal rather than go without any reforms she said 
glen said bush still supports restricting magazine capacity 
another white house official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the white house would try to get the provision into 
the house version of the crime legislation when the senate bill 
reaches the house 
bush opposes the senate democraticbacked anticrime package 
the wideranging bill would among other things restore capital 
punishment for 30 federal crimes including presidential 
assassination and overhaul the way courts review the 
constitutionality of criminal trials 
bush suffered a defeat when senators voted 5248 wednesday to 
retain a ban on the manufacture of four types of semiautomatic 
weapons they also upheld a ban on imports which bush has already 
put into effect 
there is no similar bill on the house calendar 
while banning imported semiautomatics bush has refused to act 
against the manufacture and sale of similar domestic models 
contending some are used for sport 
bush has threatened to veto the democraticbacked crime bill 
which is a vastly revamped version of the package he sent to 
capitol hill last year thurmonds package incorporates many of the 
proposals bush made but not his ban on ammunition capacity 
bush proposed a prohibition on the importation sale or 
manufacture of gun magazines of more than 15 rounds as a way of 
curtailing use of militarystyle guns whose deadliness is enhanced 
by the ability to fire many bullets before reloading

a panamanian lawyer testified wednesday his firm 
was asked by associates of imelda marcos to fabricate documents 
showing that companies they secretly controlled were owned instead 
by financier adnan khashoggi 
the attorney jaime arias said he refused because the request 
did not correctly reflect the situation but in the end he 
said his firm agreed to handle a document that was notarized with 
a phony date 
arias testified as the government sought to show how bienvenido 
tantoco and his wife gliceria intimates of the former philippine 
first lady tried to keep the companies from falling into the hands 
of president corazon aquinos government after it took power in 
manila in 1986 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband former 
president ferdinand marcos embezzle more than 220 million from 
their countrys treasury to secretly buy four new york properties 
and artwork 
the prosecution alleges that khashoggi agreed to falsely claim 
ownership of all the properties as a favor to the marcoses 
tantoco a onetime philippine ambassador to the vatican and 
his wife also were named as coconspirators in the 1988 indictment 
but are fugitives mrs tantoco was owner of manilas leading 
department store and widely regarded as mrs marcos closest friend 
under stern cross examination by khashoggi attorney james linn 
arias acknowledged that he originally was indicted as well but 
that the government dropped the charges of mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice in exchange for his cooperation 
in reply to defense questions he said that to his knowledge 
neither khashoggi nor mrs marcos had any direct role in the 
discussions to falsify the documents 
the government says the offshore companies located in the 
netherlands antilles and the british virgin islands were part of a 
network of shell companies set up by the marcoses to conceal their 
ownership of the four new york properties and other financial 
dealings 
arias said his law firm assumed power of attorney for the new 
york properties in 1985 replacing a new york firm with whom the 
tantocos were feuding shortly after the marcos government fell in 
february 1986 he said he met with the tantoncos in rome to 
discuss a new crisis an aquino government move to seize all 
marcos holdings including the new york properties 
they were worried about the impact of new york legal 
proceedings on their philippines business and assets if the 
companies were known to be theirs it could have a negative impact 
under the philippines monetary and tax laws arias said 
arias said mrs tantoco came up with the name of khashoggi a 
friend of the marcoses as someone who might be able to help if 
he would allow himself to be identified as the beneficial owner 
of the properties 
the lawyer said an agreement to this effect was reached in may 
1986 after meetings between the tantocos and karl bock peterson an 
aide to khashoggi in panama city 
the saudi financier was not present he said but some documents 
brought by peterson bore the initials ak along with some 
proposed changes in dates that would make it appear that khashoggi 
had organized and managed the companies from 1981 on 
james linn khashoggis attorney did not object to the 
documents being introduced as evidence by the prosecution but 
asked us district court judge john f keenan to instruct jurors 
that they were only drafts and not documents executed by mr 
khashoggi

prime minister jozsef antall was sworn 
in wednesday as chief of hungarys first democratically elected 
government in 43 years and said again he intends to pull the 
country out of the sovietled warsaw pact 
he also defended the program of national rebirth he 
presented to parliament the day before which calls for halting 
inflation creating a broad social safety net of welfare services 
and changing over education and health services while transforming 
hungarys socialist economy into a market economy 
critics complained in debate prior to antalls winning a vote of 
confidence that he was vague about how to carry out the changes and 
how to pay for them 
viktor orban leader of the league of young democrats 
parliamentary faction called antalls program a loosely 
collected wish list 
katalin bossanyi a socialist party lawmaker said she consulted 
experts and in their view the program would require an 
additional 32 billion in the budget 
antall retorted it is easy to give advice but the 
responsibility of governing rests upon our shoulders 
but he promised the opposition parties their criticism will be 
heeded when it comes to spelling out details 
antall promised the deputies this program which we view as a 
guideline will be replaced by a detailed program within three 
months by which time we shall have had a chance to assess the 
concrete situation 
the 58yearold politicianhistorian said hungarian officials 
will soon start negotiations on leaving the sevennation warsaw 
pact military alliance since the agreement cannot be unilaterally 
abandoned 
hungary wants to leave the warsaw pact because the pact is not 
suitable for guaranteeing anything to hungary antall said 
other pact members are the soviet union poland czechoslovakia 
east germany bulgaria and romania 
antall stressed that withdrawal would come in the context of new 
security arrangements for all of europe 
he said he hoped hungary could join the european community in 
the next decade 
the communist party which long ruled hungary reshaped itself 
in advance of the elections in march and april but was 
overwhelmingly defeated 
antalls hungarian democratic forum has 165 seats in the 
386seat parliament and its coalition partners the independent 
smallholders and the christian democrats 44 and 21 seats 
respectively 
the new prime minister told parliament his government intends to 
dismantle the system of repression and inaugurate the 
system of liberty 
his new government faces serious economic problems the annual 
inflation rate is in double digits unemployment is rising and 
hungary has a 20 billion foreign debt the highest per capita in 
eastern europe

floods from torrential rains three 
weeks ago 200 miles to the north pushed the trinity river toward a 
crest wednesday in liberty the last sizeable texas city before the 
gulf of mexico 
federal emergency management agency officials began distributing 
relief funds to flood victims in the livingston area 50 miles 
north of liberty 
everything ive got is under water i cant even find my 
house said joe tomlinson 35 of goodrich just south of 
livingston he was applying for federal aid 
an estimated 10000 texans have been forced from their homes by 
flooding laureen chernow of the texas division of emergency 
management said fortyone texas counties are eligible for disaster 
assistance 
elsewhere flood waters started to recede in southern indiana 
and louisiana officials said flooding there wasnt as bad as 
expected causing about 10 million damage to farms 
in arkansas tourism officials assured travelers that holiday 
weekend visits to state parks shouldnt be cancelled for fear of 
flood damage they stressed that the weekends flash flooding 
while serious in some places was localized 
in texas federal and state officials in livingston and liberty 
briefed local agencies about programs available to people displaced 
by the floods 
the trinity river was expected to crest in liberty at 30 feet 
six feet above flood level and one foot higher than a record set in 
1942 the trinity river authority said 
liberty is about 16 miles from the trinity bay which feeds into 
galveston bay and eventually the gulf of mexico 
i think were getting the worst of it now said jim mitchum 
liberty county emergency management coordinator 
water from rainswollen lake livingston has been funneling at 
record levels through a 208square mile area downstream but the 
amount of water released from the lakes dam dropped for a third 
straight day wednesday 
liberty city employees and volunteers continued a twoweekold 
effort to shore up a milelong levee protecting highpriced 
lakefront homes 
but as soon as we get one low spot fixed the waters seem to 
come over someplace else liberty city secretary beth staton said 
in livingston officials said it is too early to determine the 
extent of flood damage 
one problem here is that the water is still up and we cant 
get in to inspect said graham nance of fema 
about 1 million in federal money already has been distributed 
nance said flood victims should be able to get federal checks 
within four to six days the agency had received 3800 applications 
for help he said 
in southern indiana the east fork of the white river continued 
to spill over its banks from petersburg to the indianaillinois 
state line the national weather service said at the indiana route 
57 bridge the river was more than 1 miles wide 
the wabash river along interstate 64 stretched from graysville 
ill to near griffin ind nearly 3 miles wide water covered 
much of western gibson county the weather service said 
more than 10000 people in pike and gibson counties remained 
without drinking water which was lost saturday when the white 
river tore through a section of levee and burst the towns main 
water line 
in central louisiana farm bureau president ronnie anderson said 
that more than 100000 acres of cropland have been flooded and more 
are expected to go under 
theres no doubt that this can be considered a disaster and 
were going to ask congress as well as secretary of agriculture 
clayton yeutter to declare it so anderson said 
but arkansas tourism officials sought to downplay reports about 
flood damage 
i think a lot of people are taking it that the whole state is 
under water said richard davies interim state parks and tourism 
department chief 
flash flooding occurred saturday night in hot springs one of 
the states top tourist areas but the water was gone 24 hours 
later much of the flooding earlier along the arkansas and red 
rivers involved farmland 
joe rice state tourism director said employees in little rock 
have fielded about 200 calls a day from tour operators and 
potential tourists people want to know if they should cancel their 
holiday weekend plans at state and national parks because of 
flooding davies said 
ive never seen it like this he said were trying to get 
the word out that flooding is localized thats not to say that 
some places werent hit hard they were but others are completely 
unaffected

current us policy toward el salvador in a largely symbolic vote 
to slap sharp restrictions on military aid to the central american 
country 
but moments after tuesdays 250163 vote on that issue the 
lawmakers reversed course and voted to kill the bill to which the 
aid curbs had been attached 
despite the murkiness of the situation it was apparent that a 
solid majority in the chamber believes continued human rights 
violations by the salvadoran military dictate an end to what some 
have called a blank check policy 
the american people and the american congress have been played

the national commission on testing and public policy released a 
highly critical study of standardized multiplechoice tests and 
called for a restructuring of educational and employment testing so 
that the talents of all americans are promoted 
we recognize that in the past some tests have been a positive 
force for numerous individuals and institutions the report said 
however the growing overreliance on testing over the past 
several decades deprives the nation of much of the talent it needs

the countryside offers no escape from the social 
and economic pressures that lead kids to do poorly in school a 
study suggests 
a study that surveyed school officials in 312 rural urban and 
suburban districts last year cast doubt on the popular image of 
rural children leading wholesome troublefree lives compared with 
youngsters in crowded communities 
the study asked officials to estimate the percentage of their 
students who fit into one or more of a dozen risk categories 
including involvement in crime sexual activity drug or alcohol 
abuse depression child abuse poverty or parents who are 
substance abusers 
rural children fared worse than nonrural children in 34 out of 
39 statistical comparisons according to the survey by the national 
rural development institute based at western washington university

after nearly a century in which most 
residents paid a few dollars a year the only us city on land 
leased from an indian reservation has agreed to a fourteenfold 
increase in rent to the seneca indians 
the agreement reached monday nine months before a 99year lease 
expires also calls for a 60 million payment from the federal and 
state governments to compensate for what both sides said were 
unfairly low rents under the old pact 
but city officials and residents tuesday worried about how the 
community would raise its annual payments to the indians from 
57000 to at least 800000 
if the economy of salamanca is really impacted by this lease 
it cant survive as a city said patrick callaghan chief city 
negotiator the package we worked out is about the best package 
we can get from the senecas whether we can get through this i

the exxon oilshale debacle eight years 
ago this month was the biggest and most expensive boom and bust in 
the history of the west and exxon has to shoulder most of the 
blame for it according to a new book boomtown blues 
battered by criticism over the past year for its alaska oil 
spill exxon inflicted human misery at least as damaging as the oil 
spill during the western colorado oilshale bust of may 1982 says 
author andrew gulliford who also wrote americas country 
schools in 1984 
in boomtown blues gulliford who lived in silt colo from 
197683 chronicles 100 years of western colorados oil shale booms 
and the people who tried to make money from it his books history 
of booms and busts culminates in black sunday may 2 1982 
the day exxon shut down its colony oil shale project near here 
les rogers exxons chief spokesman at the companys houston 
headquarters said the company will not comment on the book 
exxon was hardly the only player in the boom that swept the 
rural western slope in the late 1970s and early 80s but the 
actions of the worlds largest oil company both exacerbated the 
boom and triggered the bust according to gulliford 
after black sunday 2200 people immediately were thrown out of 
work and by the time related industries packed up more than 
10000 people in sparsely populated western colorado had lost their 
jobs 
so many people had to leave that local humor called the exodus 
the parachute uhaul races that was a misnomer in a way 
because for two years it was literally impossible to rent a moving 
van anywhere in western colorado 
eight years later the area has yet to recover fully 
though the recent oil shale boom poured millions of dollars 
into the western slope of colorado on the human side of the 
equation the net result was only economic instability and personal 
chaos gulliford writes 
the colony shutdown was not just an isolated incident of an 
industrial project gone sour but the largest most expensive and 
fastest mining boom and bust in the history of the west his book 
says 
boomtown blues reads more like sociology than history with 
plenty of interviews with the people who lived through the boom and 
who have survived the bust 
not everyone survived gulliford includes the tragic story of a 
grand junction banker who shot himself in the economic rubble exxon 
left behind 
the residents of garfield mesa rio blanco and moffat counties 
are still suffering from the aftereffects of the bust bankruptcies 
are still being filed by professionals and others who struggled to 
recover from black sunday but failed 
gulliford attributes many of the divorces in the area to the 
boom and bust foreclosures were common and families were split up 
when younger people had to leave colorado to find work mothers 
became weekday widows when their husbands were forced to 
commute to jobs several hundred miles away 
the social fabric of smalltown western colorado towns was torn 
he writes both by the fast development of the boom that brought 
developers to the area and by the shock of the bust 
gulliford who is the director of the museum at western new 
mexico university in silver city attributes the outofcontrol 
development mentality to exxons nowinfamous white paper 
issued in 1980 exxon predicted shale oil production of 8 
million barrels per day by the year 2010 with production reaching 
1 million barrels a day by 1990 to cope with the resulting growth 
it was estimated the area would need 700 new schools 3000 
teachers and 700 new police officers and firefighters with 140 
vehicles an estimated 75000 new housing units would be required 
to handle the influx of 15 million people into the colorado river 
valley between glenwood springs and grand junction 
those predictions threw colorado historically ready to jump on 
any development into a growth frenzy 
while the oil companies mostly at the insistence of thengov 
richard lamm pumped millions of dollars into schools sewer 
plants roads and apartments gulliford argues that their promises 
of neverending prosperity only contributed to the inevitable bust 
the trauma of the bust was in direct proportion to exxons 
grandiose expectations gulliford writes because people 
believed in oil shale and exxon the bust created deep feelings of 
anxiety and doubt coupled with realistic fears of financial 
failures 
the historian concludes that companies need to be held 
accountable for agreements they make before the building starts 
corporate responsibility must be spelled out to the letter it 
cannot be assumed grandiose promises and projections mean nothing 
in the face of declining prices he wrote 
exxon executives have contended it is unfair to blame the oil 
company alone for the economic disaster an executive in charge of 
heading exxons slim western colorado operation during the latter 
part of the 80s has argued that it is time to look to the future 
and not dwell on the past 
gullifords answer 
the issues of investment disinvestment and corporate ethics 
are significant but so too are the houses that sat vacant in 
rifle and grand junction the 1600 foreclosures in 1985 alone the 
high local unemployment rates loss of selfesteem spouse abuse 
child abuse and bustrelated suicide 
far too little energy has been spent looking backward

persecution and public condemnation 
didnt stop bai hua from writing and now that he faces unofficial 
ostracism hes still committed to his work 
bai one of chinas bestknown writers has little hope that his 
plays will be published or performed in the current political 
atmosphere inspired by a ccommunist opposition against 
bourgeois art and literature but the 60yearold writer said 
it is too late for him to cease his work 
writing is my occupation i should write only time can decide 
whether a work is good or bad he said in an interview at the 
shanghai writers association 
the great classics of chinese literature were not written 
after receiving instructions he told a reporter they were 
original ideas 
bai said he will not write differently because of the current 
politics 
it is meaningless for me to write rubbish he said 
nonetheless he and other artists are holding off on the 
presentation of their works to avoid trouble a year after the 
military suppression of chinas prodemocracy movement 
an unofficial campaign against artists is part of a general 
return to ideological orthodoxy following the studentled popular 
movement which pressed for liberalization in china 
communist party chiefs have criticized the artists saying they 
have become tainted by bourgeois liberalization or western 
ideas 
the leaders also revived a 1942 mao tsetung speech in which he 
said art and literature must be a component part of the whole 
revolutionary machine 
at a recent forum representatives of the official chinese 
writers association criticized advocates of pure literature 
for divorcing themselves from the masses and socialist 
modernization 
they called for marxism and mao tsetung thought to be given the 
leading role in all works of art and condemned symbolism and other 
literary techniques as incomprehensible to ordinary chinese 
bai a peoples liberation army playwright until 1985 is a 
veteran of such campaigns 
he was branded a rightist and persecuted during maos 1957 
crackdown on outspoken intellectuals again silenced during the 
196676 cultural revolution he was not rehabilitated until the 
late 1970s 
bai was singled out again in 1981 when the official press 
reportedly on orders of senior leader deng xiaoping condemned his 
play bitter love as a blasphemy against the communist party 
the play depicts a patriotic painter who is persecuted during 
the cultural revolution and in a death scene on a snowcovered 
field utters the words i love the motherland but does the 
motherland love me 
bai was accused of being antagonistic to the party and the 
people and forced to write a selfcriticism 
today he says the attacks were misguided because the 
protagonist was speaking only of the chinese nation under the 
cultural revolution i think the motherland is eternal he said 
he was also among the numerous writers censured in a 1983 
campaign against spiritual pollution 
bai spent five months in the united states in 1988 and 1989 
lecturing at 20 universities he returned last may to join the 
prodemocracy rallies in shanghai and to sign a petition calling on 
the students and the government to refrain from violence 
later he was called to account for his actions 
i told them the truth and said i thought the petition was 
correct said bai who has not been persecuted and can travel 
freely within china he remains vice chairman of the shanghai 
writers assocation 
most writers who supported the democracy movement have received 
similar treatment despite some instances of harsher treatment 
writer wang ruowang 72 has been labeled a reactionary and 
social parasite and is under police investigation he was one of 
three intellectuals expelled from the communist party after student 
protests in 198687 
bai said he has had to turn down invitations to visit west 
germany south korea and japan because of the current atmosphere a 
play set for performance by the beijing peoples opera troupe last 
june is indefinitely on hold 
his play cant get out of the deep mountains is a story of

said the theme includes the reality of all chinese 
he expressed sympathy for editors who are forced to reject such 
controversial works to protect their organizations or who cant 
act without approval from senior party leaders 
art in china is not the same as in other countries he said 
in other countries writers would love to have state leaders comment 
on their works in china they have no other choice 
bai said the current situation was like crossing a river where 
we are afraid of deep holes even when walking slowly 
we may laugh at our fears when we reach the other side he said

vladimir pozner the soviet journalist who for 
years was an apologist for the kremlin on american television is 
making an apology of his own 
with his perfect english and knowledge of all things american 
from joe dimaggios batting average to brands of breakfast cereal 
pozner was the first soviet commentator able to put the kremlins 
spin on events without turning americans off 
he is proud of his efforts during the 1980s to counter what he 
calls enemy images of angry boorish downtrodden and dangerous 
russians of khrushchev banging his shoe and brezhnev slurring his 
speech crowds queuing for food and tanks crossing red square 
although he insists he should not be considered an official 
soviet spokesman he is pleased to be known throughout america as 
an embodiment of the soviet union 
in short he believes hes done a lot of good 
so why should he feel bad 
because he admits in his new autobiography parting with 
illusions he said many things he didnt believe and didnt 
have the courage to say some things he believed strongly 
in commentaries broadcast around the world by moscow radio and 
appearances on american television shows such as abcs 
nightline he excused the warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 endorsed the internal exile of andrei 
sakharov in 1980 idealized the accomplishments of the soviet 
economy and sang phony paeans to justice in a communist society 
why did i do this some things i did not see and others i did 
not want to see he said in an interview in new york it 
was very painful to come to the realization that i was trying to 
defend things that really werent defendable 
to many americans pozners confession that he was not 
completely honest with his listeners or with himself will come as 
little surprise he never has lacked critics or doubters here 
the timing of his admission in a period when the kremlin is 
encouraging selfcriticism and historical revision also invites 
skepticism 
a decade ago such a confession could have landed him in jail 
and would have been courageous but now that resentment against 
orthodox communists is running high in the east bloc his admission 
of past ideological impurity appears useful even necessary to his 
career 
pozner confident and sharpwitted at age 56 knows that for 
these reasons his apology might not meet rapid acceptance in 
either the soviet union or the united states yet he is undaunted 
he has trumpeted the confession in his autobiography published 
this spring by the atlantic monthly press 
the book recounts pozners childhood in new york city where he 
learned to love the brooklyn dodgers pete seeger and mark twain 
his mother was french his father a russian emigre who earned a 
handsome salary in the american film industry but remained a 
devoted communist and never gave up his soviet citizenship 
despite a classic american boyhood paper route baseball 
games summer camp pozner says he never felt fully american 
other kids at stuyvesant high school thought of him as russian for 
a while he thought of himself as french 
when his father lost his job because of his communist sympathies 
in the late 1940s the teenage pozner and his family headed for 
the soviet union 
they went first to warravaged berlin where his father grew 
impatient with a soviet diplomat who found one excuse after another 
to delay the familys permission to go to moscow 
only much later pozner says did he and his family realize that 
the diplomat had been trying to protect them from josef stalin who 
feared the influence of russians with experience in the west 
had we arrived in the soviet union any earlier than we did 
there is little doubt that we would all have ended up in one of the 
gulag camps he writes 
as it happened stalin died not long after the family arrived in 
moscow in 1952 and they were spared vladimir studied at moscow 
university and managed to apprentice himself to samuel marshak 
perhaps russias greatest translator of english literature later 
he broke into journalism and became a commentator for moscow radio 
today he works for the state television network hosting two 
talk shows at the very start of his career pozner says he made a 
promise to himself that he would not lie 
i made that promise in all honesty but i cannot honestly say 
i kept it he says in the book it was not that i deliberately 
misinformed my audience rather i censored my statements i 
deleted passages that could be threatening to me i rarely spoke my 
mind fully 
more than once i questioned what was really influencing my 
decisions fear for myself and my familys wellbeing the desire 
not to furnish the enemy with ammunition a false sense of 
patriotism or a real lack of courage probably a bit of each 
the book written in a conversational tone mixes political 
arguments with personal recollections sometimes switching abruptly 
from one to the other as it charts pozners two marriages his rise 
through the ranks of soviet journalists a bout of depression and 
heavy drinking in 1977 and his success in the we stopped allowing vending 
and camping because facilities and 
halls with which we had been doing business with for years said 
we love you but we cant do business with you anymore 
said duffy it was one of the few ways left in america to grow 
up youd have your adventures in the old days it was the west 
now there is no west

their classmate was a slain democratic 
president but today they are mostly republicans 
they fought for the western democracies but more than a third 
now think western culture is marking time and only slightly fewer 
think it is declining 
in what harvard officials say is the oldest college class poll 
in the country the men who graduated from harvard college in 1940 
have answered a questionnaire about their lives and the world three 
times over the past 50 years 
the latest results compiled by classmate donald md thurber 
and mailed to the class last month contain a few surprises 
although john f kennedy jr graduated with them members of 
harvards class of 1940 harbor an abiding mistrust of national 
government dubbed by one alumnus national theater and public 
relations 
their median income is more than threequarters of a million 
dollars but the class has its share of radicals one of whom 
professes to get redder as i age 
more than anything reading the survey results is like taking a 
ride in a time machine 
step into the world of the class of 1940 as represented by the 
answers members gave and you hardly would know that decades had 
passed since they graduated years of wars at home and abroad of 
the beatles watergate aids 
who is their favorite musician george gershwin the most 
popular sports player joe dimaggio beloved entertainer fred 
astaire 
particularly telling is the man voted the most admired figure 
overall former british prime minister winston churchill 
an englishman a man whose career peaked about 50 years ago a 
man with no harvard connections these questions could easily be 
asked by a man who is 40 years old said thurber 72 a retired 
public relations executive from grosse pointe mich 
but in fact the choice does not surprise him he said 
almost on the exact day the class of 1940 graduated thurber 
pointed out france fell to the germans the british left their 
military equipment for the enemy at the beaches of dunkirk as the 
allied soldiers fled for their lives the world seemed on the brink 
of vast change 
it was just a very traumatic thing that the free world hung by 
such a thread at that time many of us thought that we were 
graduating into a nazi world thurber said that we did not do 
so is due more to the efforts of winston churchill than any other 
single person 
it is because the class spent years gripped by world war ii that 
they list nuclear war as their greatest fear thurber said 
we fought a war to prevent all wars and now were going to be 
blown up and our grandchildren are going to be blown up 
explained augustus soule the class secretary 
the results of the latest poll vary slightly from its 
predecessors which posed mostly the same questions more think 
harvard is a worse place to go today than when they attended and 
more favor a conservative approach to society 
a dramatic change however was recorded over the three polls in 
class opinions about western culture in 1940 a third of the class 
thought it was advancing and in 1965 that number jumped to 49 
percent today however only 30 percent think so 
the class which once included more than 1000 men now numbers 
688 495 of whom completed the latest questionnaire in time to have 
their answers tabulated 
medicine led the list of occupations with 68 alumni with 
education ranking second with 62 and law third with 54 most of the 
respondents however said they were retired or semiretired 
almost 90 percent said that on the whole their lives have been 
very happy or fairly happy fairly happy we won world war ii 
one wrote sixtythree percent said they were happier than their 
parents who were part of the generation hit by the great 
depression 
i can remember the depression very very well said soule 
72 a lot of our parents lost their jobs some committed suicide 
or literally had to go out and beg on the streets 
skepticism about government and society runs deep in the class 
of 1940 
asked to choose among a number of positive characteristics to 
describe the countrys current leadership 59 percent marked none 
of the above wrote one alumnus strong and dependable you 
can depend on it to do strongly the wrong thing 
executive department waffles on issues congress is completely 
selforiented judiciary swamped in endless frivolous litigation 
one disillusioned graduate penciled in 
ethics and integrity forget it another wrote 
the class came up with a wealth of suggestions for improvements 
some earnest some plaintive others humorous at times 
inadvertently 
clean out the entire congress and replace the incumbents with 
their challengers wrote one get rid of television said 
another eliminate polling one alumnus wrote in the middle 
seat on an airplane answered another get people to think 
one graduate pleaded 
i have no panacea answered a classmate 
one in all seriousness offered a blueprint for change that was 
a near parody of the socalled harvard liberal he advised not 
allowing anyone to own over 1 million 
soule disapproved 
theres always a few kooks in every class he said

it used to be lonelier at the top the summit 
is so heavily booked for meetings these days that even president 
bush has had trouble keeping the schedule straight 
there are four summit meetings one domestic three 
international on the bush agenda for the next six weeks sometimes 
they blur a bit but if this is london it must be nato houston 
means its economic washington has the budget summit which will 
drag for weeks 
and the big one bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
whose fourday summit conference begins in a week 
in advance of the gorbachev summit bush has met individually 
with the leaders of western allies conferring with chancellor 
helmut kohl of west germany at the white house last week bush was 
reminded that the gorbachev meetings end june 3 
we go off to nato the next day dont we the president said 
nein nein nein corrected kohl who also will be at the 
nato summit in london one month later on july 5 and 6 thats to 
be followed by the sevennation allied economic summit in houston 
opening a threeday stand on july 8 
theories of summit diplomacy have changed since the cold war 
days when every step statement and gesture was supposed to be 
carefully planned lest a misreading make trouble that may have 
happened at the 1961 summit between president john f kennedy and 
nikita s khrushchev miscalculations in moscow the next year led 
to the cuban missile crisis 
but the structured scripted summit conference was yielding to 
something less structured and more informal long before the berlin 
wall came down that also carried risks when ronald reagan met 
gorbachev in reykjavik iceland in 1986 for what was to have been 
a warmup for an arms control summit they wound up talking about 
the elimination of all nuclear weapons then parted at odds over 
the us strategic space defense program 
thats the kind of thing that makes diplomats wary of 
unstructured meetings between their bosses 
bush and gorbachev held one at malta in the mediterranean last 
december bush proposed it as an informal feetup session at which 
they could get acquainted and make sure no messages were missed 
amid the changes sweeping eastern europe but he took along a 
detailed agenda of arms control items he wanted negotiated in 
preparation for the real summit now coming up 
summits take on a definition an expectation of grand design 
and grand agreements bush said before the malta meeting 
this time there are agreements ready to meet that expectation 
one to ban most chemical weapons two treaties strengthening limits 
on nuclear tests 
the biggest deal cutting strategic nuclear weapons isnt 
finished although an administration official said bush and 
gorbachev should be able to announce substantive agreement on 
major start issues 
a strategic arms reduction treaty will take more negotiation 
final terms could be signed at another summit meeting in moscow 
late in the year 
nor has there been the pace and progress bush sought in 
negotiations for the reduction of conventional soviet and us 
forces in europe bush said he still hopes an agreement to cut 
troops and conventional weapons can be signed before the end of the 
year that would be a 35nation agreement and some summit 
overall bush said tuesday preparatory talks on arms accords 
went well clearing the way for what i hope will be the highly 
successful meeting with mr gorbachev 
successful outcomes are more elusive for the summit meetings 
bush has been calling to deal with problems at home his education 
summit with the governors and the drug summit in colombia produced 
promises and plans for action but real results will be a long time 
coming the current budget summit can succeed only with a clear and 
workable agreement to cut the federal deficit 
when world leaders meet at the summit they usually part with 
mutual congratulations on the success of their talks the 
perception of success equals success and the scoring system 
assures the outcome

it used to be that there were three 
distinctions between madeforcable television movies and those 
produced for cbs nbc and abc naked bodies hardcore curse words 
and no commercials 
cable movies still have bare breasts a whole lot of profanity 
and no bathroom breaks 
but times have changed for pay cable films and now they have 
more namely big stars bigger distribution sophisticated 
scripts and critical acclaim 
in the seven years since home box office pioneered the field by 
making the terry fox story movie legends including elizabeth 
taylor bette davis and jimmy stewart have starred in 
madeforcable films 
newer stars such as ellen barkin andy garcia rebecca demornay 
ben kingsley and powers boothe also have debuted on the small 
cable screen 
but as the industry has grown so too has controversy over who 
gets a piece of the increasingly lucrative pie 
at recent hearings before the federal communications commission 
over whether to reregulate the cable industry independent 
producers screamed that cable networks operate closed shops 
that practice programming apartheid 
marcy carsey whose carseywerner co produces such megahits as 
roseanne and the cosby show said she cant get in the door 
of cable networks such as showtime the message she testified 
during a los angeles fcc hearing held in february is loud and 
clear 
do it their way creatively and financially or dont come at 
all 
what carsey and others were referring to is socalled vertical 
integration a fancy term that simply put means cable networks 
and their big corporate owners can control virtually every aspect 
of moviemaking from production to distribution to overseas rights 
to syndication 
and what carsey and other hollywood independents want is for the 
fcc to implement the financial interest amp syndication rules of 1970 
which prohibit broadcast networks from owning financial interests 
in their programs in the cable industry 
fcc commissioners did not seem overly sympathetic 
ive heard some strange arguments in my time commissioner 
andrew barrett said at the hearing it sounds like you folks want 
to have your cake and eat it too and you want us to protect your 
cake 
cable network officials feel likewise and they say the 
assertions of producers such as carsey are simply not true 
we do not produce our films inhouse said showtimes senior 
vice president of original programs steve hewitt weve used 
independent producers for a lot of our films 
and while backend deals hollywood jargon for splitting up 
who gets the proceeds from distribution and syndication rights are 
not as profitable in cable movies hewitt said showtime wouldnt 
use independent producers just to cheat them on the back end 
hbo leads the pack in cable movies having produced 47 of them 
it also is the only cable network to have won an emmy for best 
screenplay in the critically acclaimed murderers among us the 
simon wiesenthal story 
over the years hbo has tackled social issues and charismatic 
leaders from mandela in 1987 starring danny glover as 
thenimprisoned antiapartheid leader nelson mandela to 
sakharov in 1984 starring jason robards as the dissident 
russian physicist and nobel peace prize winner 
our goal s to get the best movie possible said robert 
cooper senior vice president of hbo pictures and well buy from 
anyone to do that 
hbo just spent 7 million to make by dawns early light a 
doomsday thriller that debuted last week it was the most money the 
network had ever spent on a movie on average cable networks such 
as showtime usa network and ted turners tnt spend between 3 
million and 5 million 
the revenues from such productions are generated by subscriber 
fees home video sales domestic syndication and foreign theatrical 
distribution 
showtimes hewitt said his network is happy just to break even 
on cable movies hbos cooper said his company sometimes ends up 
writing off a big chunk of what it costs to make a movie 
dont let them fool you however according to estimates by the 
media research firm of paul kagan associates inc a wellreceived 
cable film can bring 2 million to 4 million in foreign revenue 
alone 
and in an era of intense competition between broadcast networks 
cable networks independent television stations theatrical movies 
and home video rentals madeforcable television movies are in an 
enviable position 
they attract big stars theyre made on relatively small 
budgets some have garnered rave reviews and in the language 
that speaks best to the cable networks corporate owners they can 
bring in big bucks

if restaurants priced services the way hospitals 
do customers would be charged for each use of the salt shaker 
each pat of butter each glass of water 
still there would be a difference at least the customer could 
read the restaurants bill 
that description is from a report on health care by the national 
center for policy analysis a dallasbased think tank with a strong 
inclination toward freemarket solutions to economic problems 
john goodman its president says health care is dominated by 
insurers government and employers leaving individuals little 
control over the prices they pay or the quality of care they 
receive 
his hope he says is to restore the patient as the principal 
buyer of health care and unleash an army of millions of informed 
shoppers into the medical marketplace 
while that prospect seems distant the report suggests that a 
beginning could be made by requiring any hospital that receives 
medicare money to quote preadmission prices to all patients 
at the moment it says nobody understands a hospital bill nor 
do many patients or even their insurers read them thoroughly or 
with understanding 
at discharge the report states the patient is probably no 
better informed than on entering the reason literally hundreds of 
line items prices why after just a few days a typical bill can 
stretch 30 feet in length 
the potential is much longer a single hospital the report 
states can have as many as 12000 different lineitem prices 
comparison shoppers in the chicago area it says would have to 
contend with 600000 prices 
it isnt so much the length of the bill thats sickening the 
report suggests as it is the likelihood that about 90 percent of 
the items listed on a hospital bill are in principle unreadable 
as a result it continues patients often cannot even recognize 
the service rendered and even when they can recognize the service 
they cannot form a judgment about whether the charge is reasonable 
for example a 30 charge for a tylenol capsule is common but 
clearly outrageous as is a 45 charge for an admissions kit 
similar to the free kits airlines give patients on international 
flights says the report 
what is a reasonable price for an xray a blood count or a 
urinalysis the center answers they can be many times the cost at 
one hospital compared with another within walking distance 
here are some examples of total charges for outpatient services 
reported to the state by chicago hospitals in 1988 
mammogram from 13 to 127 ct scan from 59 to 635 however 
the center failed to specify the types of scans tonsillectomy 
from 125 to 3365 cataract removal from 125 to 4279 
if patients knew about these differences says goodman they 
might be able to significantly reduce their medical bills 
how do such variances occur one reason the report states is 
that lineitem prices have little to do with supply and demand as 
do prices in most businesses they are artifacts of the 
reimbursement system they arent real it says 
because they are reimbursed by insurers on the basis of costs 
hospitals have an incentive to artificially raise or lower prices 
in order to manipulate their reimbursement from thirdparty 
payers 
reading this report you might conclude is enough to make a 
person sick well at least mildly so but nothing like the shock 
of being confronted by 600000 hospital prices or receiving a 
hospitalstyle bill in a restaurant 
but sick enough certainly to avoid going to the hospital

charles w chuck colson probably has been in as many prisons 
as anyone including serving a term in one his latest incursion 
into the lockups of the soviet union turned up an approach he 
considers lacking in this country 
they have better organized work programs said the veteran 
traveler of the behindbars circuit and fervent advocate of bracing 
up prisoners body and soul 
its an area where we can learn something from the russians 
he said in an interview one of the troubles with american 
prisons is that we dont give inmates meaningful work that can 
drive a person crazy 
colson is head of prison fellowship a group based in reston 
va that has grown into a worldwide organization to bolster 
religious faith among prisoners and seek reforms in the system 
talking about the work programs in the two countries prisons 
he said the russians are doing a better job of it 
that was his conclusion after a rare visit inside five soviet 
prisons with a us department of justice delegation at the 
invitation of the soviet bureau of internal affairs 
all of them had work programs including for juveniles he 
said it was especially good in a womens prison everbody had a 
job there was plenty of work to do they got twothirds of the 
going wage for their work 
they were paid bonuses if they produced more they were 
charged for room and board morale was excellent i told them they 
were more capitalistic than on the outside they didnt understand 
that 
its one of the best industry work programs ive seen anywhere 
in europe or the united states 
colson who became a staunch christian after serving seven 
months in prison as a watergate conspiracy offender started his 
prison organization in 1976 he has since visited prisons in 28 
countries including about 300 in the united states 
he said most of the soviet prisons he visited one the remote 
perm 35 where several notable political prisoners once were held 
remained repressive restricting mail and family visits but all 
had work programs 
developing such productive programs would improve american 
prisons he said its a reform also advocated by retired chief 
justice warren burger but opposed by labor and businesses as 
unfairly competitive 
since human beings are made in the image of god purposeful 
and creative work gives a person a sense of purpose in life 
colson said take away that sense of purpose and you kill him 
to deprive him of work is to deprive him of human dignity 
thats one of the worst things we do in american prisons 
colsons prison fellowship conducts bibletraining seminars in 
about 600 us prisons with courses given 50000 inmates last 
year served by 33000 volunteers 
also last year 50 workrelease programs were conducted in each 
of which several prisoners were furloughed for community renovation 
projects 
the movement is spreading very rapidly colson said noting 
the group has chartered programs in 39 countries and some work in 
20 others 
he also expects it to be functioning soon in the soviet union at 
the invitation of interior minister vadim bakatin who colson said 
told him crime was up sharply and religion needed 
they welcome it he said the russians thoroughly realize 
they need religious values to give order to society 
colson said a training program was planned for the soviet union 
in june with russian orthodox baptist and other denominations 
invited to participate 
colson 58 a baptist added ironically the russians for 
pragmatic reasons want religion and were trying to eliminate it 
its crazy its one of the great ironies of history 
for example he noted the us supreme court has banned display 
of the ten commandments at public schools but said a committee of 
the soviet academy of sciences is studying how to integrate the 
commandments into education 
theyre now treating them as the greatest moral code ever 
colson said but americans wallowing in selfindulgent 
materialism are working to expurgate religion from every area of 
life 
he attributed the unexpected overturning of communism across 
eastern europe to an overflowing of pentup spiritual energies 
citing its churchbased origins in poland east germany and romania 
and similar processes elsewhere 
however he contended the us government and news media had 
largely ignored the religious impetus as they did prior to similar 
upheavals in iran and the philippines 
us embassies typically dont understand it he said 
they dont know whats going on the spiritual is hard to discern 
and theyre just not with it they dont look beneath the surface 
intelligence satellites cant see into human hearts 
when we take our political measurments we count the nuclear 
situation and gross national product but mark religion as a 
throwaway 
partly he said its a result of religious illiteracy among 
journalists and other analysts 
but theres also a bigotry that wont take religion very 
seriously he said theres a denial of religion by our 
cultural elite as irrelevant and simpleminded so we dont see it 
when its there

a year after the massacre that left their friends 
dead and bloodied on tiananmen square the fervoas 
faded and many chinese students in the united states have put away 
their protest signs and reopened their br of last june hooks 
chinese students here still push for democratic reforms but 
many are split over what road the movement should take and some 
former activists even suggest their counterparts in china pushed 
the government too far and are partly responsible for the infamous 
crackdown 
xu chenggang 38 a graduate student in economics at harvard 
university watched the televised images of the tanks rolling into 
the gates of heavenly peace as the square is called in chinese 
he saw his friends maimed and killed like many others he was 
roused to action 
in that time in my mind the most important thing was to stop 
the killings so i got very active and emotional xu said for 
two months i went to ralli not be true li said in certain places 
people 
dont have food anymore that information could trigger 
prodemocracy movement 
a prodemocracy newspaper set up by chinese journalists and 
students in los angeles has a circulation of 30000 and is 
published every 10 days it is distributed in china and several 
western nations 
we get into china three ways fax mail and smuggling said 
editorinchief ben tang we are in at least 20 major cities 
there 
many students however continue to be frightened to speak up 
both because they want to return home someday and because they fear 
reprisals against loved ones in china pei said 
the students fears were heightened recently by reports from a 
chinese bureaucrat who defected to the united states he said the 
communist party planned to send officials to us college campuses 
to court sympathetic students and intimidate the chinese activists 
they saw what happened in china they know politics is a risky 
business pei said we lost quite a large number of people 
especially after the new revelations 
pei said students no longer believe change will take china by 
storm as it has eastern europe so their concerns are less urgent 
than last spring and their goals have become longterm 
key issues now are economic sanctions against china and whether 
the country will continue to enjoy favorable trading status with 
the united states he said 
here there is disagreement some students said they support 
strong economic sanctions against china for the crackdown xu 
however said sanctions would hurt fledgling entrepreneurs and 
joint business ventures with the west 
joint ventures are really good things xu said removing 
those things would remove the seeds of the revolution 
pei said student emotions have cooled a little bit since last 
june some people say tough sanctions others say less people 
differ on how the movement should proceed 
the students do agree that the long march toward democracy in 
china began in earnest last june 4 
before last spring democracy as a goal was illegitimate 
pei said now its been branded by blood into the national 
consciousness 
the gains made they also note sadly came at a high price both 
for the students who stood in the square that night and those who 
stood with them from afar 
im one of the socalled extreme counterrevolutionaries 
said pei whose parents sisters and brother are back home in 
shanghai it would be suicidal to go back

the superpowers suddenly dont seem so super 
anymore or so threatening 
so the notion of george bush and mikhail gorbachev sitting down 
at a superpower summit as they will in four days seems vaguely 
out of date they can still destroy the world but they cant 
control it 
even the idea of chipping away at nuclear stockpiles each side 
has about 25000 nuclear weapons lacks the urgency it had only a 
few years ago theyre not about to go to war 
the less the threat of war the less the need for superpower 
protectors and the more the rest of the world can go its own way 
summits are good things the more the better says sam 
lambroza professor of soviet studies at st marys college in st 
marys city md everyone benefits no one walks away the loser 
but it is not roosevelt churchill and stalin dividing the 
world 
moreover in the 1 years since bush took office the soviet 
union has lost its empire its constituent republics are rebelling 
and its economy the cia says is near crisis 
we dont need to rub the soviets face in the fact that they 
are not that relevant any more in most respects says helmut 
sonnenfeldt a veteran soviet expert and former henry kissinger 
sidekick they are a receding power and you can argue whether or 
not we are an ascending power 
the soviet union is a superpower in the sense that it is a 
huge land mass although it is a restless and messedup land 
mass says sonnenfeldt a hardliner in ussoviet relations 
it remains a superpower because it has a formidable military 
capacity even though theres some question even about the morale 
of its troops 
adds lambroza were not talking to them about cuba or africa 
or the middle east because in some ways the soviet union has 
stopped being players 
in 1986 the world gasped when gorbachev and ronald reagan in 
the frosty city of reykjavik iceland came it seemed within a 
handshake of agreeing to cut their strategic stockpiles by half 
now the world would nod approval if gorbachev and bush did that 
then go about its business 
but the notion that the leaders of the united states and the 
soviet union could settle the worlds problems no longer resembles 
reality if it ever did experts say 
what were talking about is power that cant be measured in 
janes fighting ships anymore says james h billington head of 
the library of congress and a scholar of soviet affairs 
bipolar summitry doesnt fit in the multipolar world now taking 
shape billington says he notes the drive toward a united western 
europe the rise of the japanese economic giant and down the road 
the potential clout of china india brazil and the belt of islamic 
nations 
we are heading for a very interesting polycentric world 
billington says 
former sen charles mcc mathias a maryland republican and 
close observer of international affairs agrees the superpowers 
he says are not talking about the problems in which they could 
make a real difference 
just imagine if they got on the agenda i would like to see 
population problems the environment drugs problems proven 
beyond the scope of even the most powerful nation to control 
says mathias if the soviet union and the united states would 
join on that agenda it would vitalize the world 
it has been a long time since world leaders could impose their 
wills in the manner of the congress of vienna of 1814 and 1815 
where the crowned heads of europe redrew the continents boundaries 
under the tutelage of prince klemens wenzel nepomuk lothar von 
metternich of austria the master diplomat who dominated the 
continent for a third of a century 
the leaders of the united states and the soviet union have met 
16 times since world war ii once a year since 1985 
but the world is no longer sharply divided into two antagonistic 
armed camps and a nonaligned third world that sometimes managed to 
turn the competition to its own advantage 
in those days the superpowers fought proxy wars in korea or 
angola or vietnam or afghanistan or nicaragua 
the proxy wars have ended so has the superpowers unchallenged 
ability to call the shots in friendly countries the united states 
opened negotiations with the philippines this month by saying that 
if filipinos want this country to give up its bases there it will 
leave with our pride fully intact 
festus brotherson jr a former senior foreign policy official 
in the south american country of guyana and now a political 
scientist at baldwinwallace college in berea ohio says 
traditionally when a superpower speaks the whole world 
listens but now when gorbachev speaks there is a perception that 
he lacks the will and wherewithal to execute his policies 
brotherson a specialist in third world politics adds the 
troubling aspect at the summit for people like myself is that 
whenever there is a cozy relationship between the united states and 
the ussr there is always trouble in the third world 
the third world movement can no longer play one against the 
other once theres no eastwest conflict the west ignores the 
third worlds claims 
another observer stanford university historian gordon craig an 
expert on germany refers to the united states and the soviet union 
as the two former superpowers 
there has been a very perceptible weakening of their power 
he says the russians are incapable of doing or even 
threatening what they once could and the united states has not 
been acting like a superpower 
their inability to control what is happening in europe is 
shown by the german unification process which has gone on with 
tumultuous speed without any brakes by any powers let along the 
superpowers 
just as czechs hungarians poles and romanians shoved the 
communists out of power ordinary germans on german streets brought 
down the german democratic republic the berlin wall and the idea 
that two germanys must exist separately craig says 
he says ordinary people compelled moscow and washington to 
negotiate an orderly german reunification even as it was becoming a 
fait accompli

simon serfaty executive director of the johns hopkins foreign 
policy institute raises a cautionary note 
the devaluation of superpower influence in shaping events does 
not mean it has acquired zero value he says we remain 
relevant to unification in western europe and the soviets to the 
process of liberalization in eastern europe the negotiations over 
germany show that what has been devalued can be revalued 
he says that if gorbachev were to be overthrown there could be 
a renewed assertiveness of soviet power which even now 
remains far from insignificant 
meantime serfaty asserts the united states remains relevant 
to what happens in the middle east southern africa and western 
europe if we have the will 
serfaty makes another point raw military might has not lost its 
relevance 
soviet influence totally disappeared in central europe 
extraordinarily fast but only after gorbachev made it clear to his 
communist allies that soviet military power was no longer 
available serfaty says 
political scientist bruce jentleson of the brookings institution 
says both superpowers have had trouble turning allies into puppets 
he says the united states was unable to call the shots in south 
vietnam or israel and the soviets could not make things happen in 
the arab states or afghanistan 
for all that the fact remains that this summit is at least 
the single most important meeting in the world jentleson says 
he cites the possibility of reaching historic armsdestruction 
agreements as well as the need to maintain the relationship in 
the face of tensions newly arising from gorbachevs move to squelch 
the secessionist movements in the baltics 
and he points to bushs decision against imposing economic 
sanctions on the soviets because of their crackdown in lithuania as 
a demonstration of the limits of american power every ally said 
they wouldnt go along with sanctions he says 
the largely nonviolent uprising in eastern europe and 
guerrilla warfare in the third world have undermined the importance 
of military force to impose dominance says political scientist 
stephen zunes of whitman college in walla walla wash meanwhile 
the rise of japan and the european community have demonstrated that 
military might is not the only the way to go 
so i would argue that the upcoming summit may not in fact be 
between the leaders of two superpowers but between the leaders of 
two countries desperately trying to justify their standing 
i just think that summits are less important than they used to 
be adds zunes a student of third world politics the issues 
that need to be addressed are beyond the control of the 
superpowers 
even bush feels obliged to argue that all is not settled in the 
world that american power still matters 
president gorbachev has made profound progress in his country 
reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned back bush 
said in a commencement speech at oklahoma state university in 
stillwater a few weeks ago yet neither can we turn the clock 
ahead to know for sure what kind of country the soviet union will 
be in years to come 
still the world has moved so far from armedtotheteeth 
confrontation between communism and democracy that manfred woerner 
the secretary general of nato raises no eyebrows when he says as 
he did may 7 we are looking towards the soviet union as a 
partner in security

international camera crews couldnt get enough 
of the soviet chic featured at a punk georgetown boutique when 
mikhail gorbachev came to town in 1987 
this time therell be no cyrillic logos or lenin tshirts at 
commander salamander weapons watchdogs will not give daily press 
breakfasts and demonstrators will be relatively sparse 
its the second time around for gorbachev and the capital is not 
exactly reeling with the thrill even four days before the 
president of the soviet union sits down with president of the 
united states 
firsttime events are more exciting than reruns said tom 
cochran a nuclear physicist who helped found summit watch to 
analyze and explain the landmark armsreduction treaty signed by 
gorbachev and president reagan during gorbachevs first visit 
the group of nuclear arms experts put on 80000 worth of 
briefings and breakfasts at a hotel across lafayette park from the 
white house this year theyre giving out their phone number 
we deliberated about whether or not there would be a 
foundation out there to give us money this time said stan 
norris another founder its hard to sell it when the perception 
is that the cold war is over and theres not a specific focus 
such as the treaty signing 
its the second time around and the protests wont be as 
passionate 
in 1987 a crowd of 200000 including several presidential 
contenders turned out to make a poignant plea for freer emigration 
of soviet jews 
this year the baltic states want out but a proindependence 
rally is expected to draw no more than 10000 people organizers 
acknowledge gorbachevs role in the stunning events of eastern 
europe and say they hope their confidence in him can be restored 
its the second time around and the glitz is gone 
wendy red coowner of commander salamander ordered piles of 
merchandise keyed to a soviet theme for the last summit but the 
funky shop recently discontinued a line of jeans and shirts that 
had cyrillic logos and came in soviet cans 
we thought it was going to be phenomenal but it didnt sell 
probably two years ago i would have had people banging down the 
door to get it red said its not as trendy since were all 
friends now 
still a summit is a summit and gorbachev will not be ignored 
soviet and american flags will hang side by side across the 
city souvenir pins tshirts and key rings will appear as always 
bars will rename their drinks and at least one restaurant the 
hard rock cafe will feature soviet musicians and dishes like 
pirogi and potato soup 
gorbachev himself will be treated to a ceremonial welcome a 
state dinner and a day at camp david but he may create more 
excitement once he leaves town 
at stanford university in palo alto calif where the soviet 
leader has scheduled a twohour stop vice president bob freelen 
said the visit and a possible speech are the highlight since 
queen elizabeth came seven years ago weve gotten lots of 
inquiries for volunteering to be on the invitation list he said 
dryly 
in minnesota officials said their phones have not stopped 
ringing since gorbachev arranged to spend six hours in minneapolis 
eight limousine companies have offered to provide his 
transportation people want to give him a wolfhound a lamb a 
giant sheet cake decorated with the soviet flag they want to show 
him tame black bears a preserved log cabin a fathers world war 
ii memento hes been invited to rotary meetings high school 
graduations and town picnics to have coffee visit an art gallery 
stay at a cabin on the st croix river 
the only thing that this compares to is when the minnesota 
twins won the world series in 1987 said eileen biernat an aide 
to gov rudy perpich people were just going wild then and they 
are just wild over this 
the hubbub has not reached that level in washington at least 
not yet 
typical was the reaction of george washington university 
president stephen trachtenberg his schools basketball court will 
be turned into a press center for thousands of journalists 
this is kind of an exclamation point but it is representative 
of a regular excitement that we are accustomed to trachtenberg 
said the university is glad to help out but doesnt need the 
visibility he said 
washingtonians were not quite so blase when gorbachev turned up 
in 1987 
sen bob dole rkan was among the stalwart few who refused to 
succumb to the gorbymania engulfing the city he had been invited 
to the state dinner honoring gorbachev but ate that night instead 
with some contractors in new england he was running for president 
and as his spokesman said mikhail doesnt vote in the new 
hampshire primary

ann getty wife of one of the worlds richest 
men had a problem she loved to read all day but she also 
believed in the protestant work ethic 
i come from nice puritan stock and i grew up believing that 
you have to work all day she explained 
lord weidenfeld one of britains most distinguished publishers 
also had a problem he had been wanting to break into american 
publishing for 20 years but where would he get the money 
it seemed getty and weidenfeld had solved their problems in 1985 
when they teamed up to buy grove press and start weidenfeld amp 
nicholson new york a mediumsize independent publisher of quality 
books 
but five years later groveweidenfeld was put up for auction 
like some paperback rights routinely are as losses approached 15 
million gettys financial advisers reportedly told the voracious 
reader her job was prohibitively expensive 
the story of groveweidenfeld is merely one trauma in what 
random house executive peter osnos has described as a season of 
anxiety in publishing 
the source of the anxiety is money big corporate 
international money and its transformation of what had been a 
small industry run and staffed by people who cared as much about 
literary quality as profit 
almost every famous name in publishing now has a famous business 
name behind it simon amp schuster owed by paramount 
communications harper amp row rupert murdochs news corp 
macmillan co robert maxwell publications little brown 
timewarner inc william morrow amp co hearst corp 
indeed corporate takeover of the word was the title of a 
recent writers conference at new york university im struck by 
the level of concern that 120 people would spend a sunny saturday 
indoors talking about the publishing industry says alec dubro 
president of the national writers union 
if an author is very concerned about the handling of a book 
about its content he or she is being driven away from the major 
publishers he adds the majors are perceived as being far more 
homogenized and commercialized than they once were 
the complaint which is difficult to document runs like this 
corporations want books that earn quick profits create little 
controversy and accord deferential treatment to any person product 
or cause that it or its subsidiaries hold dear 
however limited their grasp of literature corporate managers 
can usually read a balance sheet and it is to this not ideology 
or censorship that much of the seasons anxiety can be traced 
simon amp schuster posted pretax losses of 140 million and the 
chairman of doubleday was forced out because of financial problems 
there harcourt brace jovanovich borrowed 3 billion to fend off a 
takeover bid raising questions if the company can meet its 
interest payments let alone invest in its future 
the predictable corporate response to such conditions smaller 
advances for authors layoffs for employees and since only two 
books in 10 make money fewer new titles for the public according 
to preliminary figures compiled by publishers weekly new title 
output declined by about 4 percent last year 
so far the most notable casualty of the money crunch has been 
pantheon books a random house subsidiary long known for its 
intellectually challenging books on a variety of subjects 
in february andre schiffrin resigned as pantheons managing 
director rather than accept orders from random house itself a 
subsidiary of the newhouse familys advance publications to 
publish fewer books at this several authors defected six senior 
editors resigned and several hundred members of the literary 
community demonstrated on the street outside random houses offices 
whatever the merits of its books pantheon had lost 3 million 
last year on sales of 20 million the demonstrators said random 
house should absorb pantheons losses but industry sources say 
random house made little or no profit in 1989 advances si 
newhouse insisted pantheon pay its own way saying i do not like 
charity cases 
publishings crisis has its roots in the 1950s when the heart 
of the retail book market moved from a relatively few large city 
bookstores to many more smaller ones in suburban shopping centers 
by the late 70s bookstore chains such as waldenbooks and b 
dalton bookseller were adding hundreds of new stores a year and 
they featured hardcover best sellers at discounted prices readers 
who once waited for best sellers to come out in paperback could now 
snap up the new tom clancy or danielle steele for only a few 
dollars more than they would pay for the paperback a year later 
the hardcover best seller became the industrys cash cow but it 
also changed the relationship between some bestselling authors and 
their publishers what had been a sort of marriage for better or 
worse evolved into a temporary alliance based on the highest bid 
and as long as new stores kept opening no bid seemed too high 
shopping mall construction and bookstore openings slowed over 
the last five years but literary agents continued to demand 
everlarger advances and guarantees 
jason epstein a top editor at random house cites stephen 
kings sales figures to illustrate the consequences 
in 1985 kings skeletn crew sold 720000 copies two years 
later as chain store volume was peaking sales of his 
tommyknockers doubled to 14 million copies last year 
however only 16 million copies of kings new novel the dark 
half were shipped to retailers and many of those were returned 
with fewer stores opening there is no way sales of the dark 
half can exceed those of kings previous novels at anything like 
the rate at which sales of tommyknockers exceeded those of 
skeleton crew yet for the dark half and kings next three 
novels kings publisher is said to have guaranteed between 35 
million and 40 million sums that presuppose a continually 
expanding market epstein says 
even in this inflationary atmosphere groveweidenfeld was 
conspicuous as one observer put it for noisily slapping money 
down on the table one of its editors was quoted as saying 
they have given me a very big budget to acquire very big books 
very big sales however proved more elusive shana alexander 
was paid 500000 for a book on the pizza connection heroin trial 
but booksellers sold only 26000 of a 100000copy printing and 
sent the rest back 
on feb 27 the same day schiffrin resigned at pantheon 
groveweidenfeld was put up for sale potential bidders were 
reported to include the usual corporate subsidiaries including 
macmillan harper amp row simon amp schuster and random house 
but two months later getty said the firm would not be sold 
because of the strong feeling among authors agents and 
booksellers that we should not be swallowed by a publishing 
conglomerate 
in fact according to industry sources the conglomerates 
decided grove was indigestible 
the publishing house once described as famous for low sales 
and high advances had failed to elicit a decent bid

the polish publisher had struggled for 12 years 
in the underground to provide books to an audience hungry for the 
truth now all those clandestine times were behind him and he was 
touring the west to seek the help of friends in transforming his 
press into a commercial venture 
but grzegorz bogutas first taste of the western publishing 
trade was a bit sour arriving on a new york visit he learned that 
his friend andre schiffren had been forced to resign as director 
of prestigious pantheon the publishers corporate parent random 
house inc found that schiffren hadnt been paying enough 
attention to the bottom line 
this lesson about the duress that money can exert on artistic 
endeavors was a good one for us to learn boguta said somewhat 
ruefully in a recent interview it showed us we have to mix 
books we think are important with books that will sell 
bogutas nowa independent publishing house press published 
more than 500 titles between 1977 and march when he closed it 
most were tiny editions distributed free among friends among the 
authors he published were nobelists alexander solzhenitsyn and 
andrei sakharov jean paul satre and philip roth 
but one advantage to underground publishing boguta said is 
that as long as it remains free of the security polices clutches 
it is totally independent as he attempts to restart nowa as a 
commercial publisher boguta is coming to grips with a new variety 
of problems 
no one in poland has the money to invest in a publishing house 
and boguta is leery about relying on the polish state or foreign 
investors furthermore polands brusque experiment with 
freemarket capitalism has sent prices skyrocketing 
people dont have enough money to buy food let alone books 
he said 
coming into a free market economy is hurting publishers even 
more than its hurting other people said roland algrant 
director of the international freedom to publish committee of the 
association of american publishers 
the group provided money to clandestine publishers of 
manuscripts in the soviet union in the old days and continues to 
help them but their needs have increased dramatically algrant 
said 
when they did everything with carbon copies 100 was a lot of 
money he said now a 2000 grant is practically nothing they 
need paper they need equipment all of a sudden they have a market 
and want to make 10000 copies instead of 10 
americans are helping writers such as william styron and kurt 
vonnegut have donated the rights to their novels to publishers in 
the newly democratic countries of central europe the us 
information service is providing grants for equipment 
schiffrin who as pantheons director led a group called friends 
of nowa had signed an agreement that provided the polish publisher 
25000 for rights to the english translations of future nowa 
books but out of solidarity with schiffrin boguta hasnt 
approached the publishers new directors to ask about the status of 
that loan 
the pantheon brouhaha is part of a wave of mergers shakeups and 
financial troubles at quality american publishers in recent years 
amid the general nervousness some editors questioned whether these 
houses were capable of showing greater interest in eastern european 
writers 
you have a whole attitude in the publishing industry these 
days that you dont publish unless you can make profits said 
algrant the editors are all dying to get new eastern european 
writers but the financial managers say wheres all this going to 
lead 
said one editor who has worked with czech writers i think 
its sadly ironic that just when the eastern european writers have 
an opportunity to publish without smuggling their manuscripts out 
the climate in the united states is a little hardernosed as far as 
the bottom line goes 
some believe the apparent end of communist rule will diminish 
interest in a literature whose piquancy partly resided in its 
dissident character 
wendy luers who befriended many of czechoslovakias leading 
intellectuals when she and her husband thenambassador william 
luers were in prague in 198386 recalled telling a czech 
novelist if you want to be judged on your merits not as a 
dissident you have to hit the hard old business of getting your 
manuscripts rejected 
luers as president of charter 77 foundationnew york has been 
involved in a variety of programs to support czech culture and 
bring czech and american writers together she is organizing a 
prague visit for top literary agents lynn nesbitt and mort janklow 
we hope that if we can get american publishers interested in 
eastern european writers well get the latin american literary 
phenomenon creating a genre that people will be interested in 
reading she said 
knopf is publishing two of czechoslovak president vaclav havels 
books this year as well as two books by novelist ivan klima but 
the lasting appeal of many important dissident writers both in 
translation and their home countries remains to be seen some 
suggest that many members of the underground will stay there 
although it will be a legal underground 
nobody knows yet whether the alternative culture that 
existed can continue to exist in a free society said czech 
writer iva pekarkova there were some writers who were read 
simply because they were illegal now they may have to face the 
fact that nobody wants to read them anymore not all of them are 
great writers 
pekarkova who has lived in new york for four years took part 
in a panel of young czech and american writers at new york 
university in march when some of the american participants 
complained about publishers timidity the czech panelists nodded 
sympathetically pekarkova said but they didnt really understand 
the problems because the translator was unable to convey what the 
americans meant by censorship 
i personally have had problems trying to publish my book in 
english said pekarkova who has been driving cabs for a living 
but you cant call it censorship if the american public does not 
want to read a book and therefore a publisher doesnt want to buy 
it thats not the fault of the government 
czech writers havent had to worry about money but how 
can you worry about money when you cant get published at all for 
political reasons 
yet some in eastern europe are beginning to have to confront 
such dilemmas as their economies shift to market emphasis 
boguta watched uneasily for example when rupert murdoch and 
west germanys axel springer newspaper group bought into two 
independent hungarian newspapers last year 
we could sell our stock to foreigners but what about our 
independence boguta said instead he is attempting to set up a 
consortium of publishers in poland hungary and czechoslovakia who 
could negotiate as a group with foreign investors without fear of 
losing editorial control

jerry seinfeld thought his new nbc show would 
be a showcase for his standup comedy but the background story and 
characters of seinfeld took it over 
our original concept was that my standup act would be the 
main thing and the story would be filler he said its turned 
out to be just the opposite we have some good actors and the 
relationships really clicked we said hey lets do more of this 
we thought we were going in one direction but ended up going 
in another which was totally against my will the characters at 
first were just props now theyre the show 
seinfeld is running for four episodes behind cheers on 
thursday nights through june 21 
jason alexander a tony winner for jerome robbins broadway 
who appears in the box office hit pretty woman plays 
seinfelds best friend julia louisdreyfus is his former 
girlfriend and michael richards is his nextdoor neighbor 
im really intrigued by the idea of fitting in tiny pieces of 
standup into the story seinfeld said i write the standup to 
go with the story we tape that separately on a comedy club set i 
do a whole routine and we edit it down 
seinfeld calls himself a comic without a hook or a shtick 
i just do observations about life he said ill take an 
idea like a sock trying to escape from a dryer then ill turn it 
into a whole prison escape thing i dont use things from my 
personal life its not that funny 
seinfeld is a popular comic who makes at least 300 appearances a 
year at nightclubs concert halls casinos conventions comedy 
clubs and colleges he was voted the funniest male standup 
comic in the 1988 american comedy awards show 
he appears at the improv in los angeles catch a rising star in 
new york and the sands in atlantic city in las vegas he and cher 
split the bill at the mirage he also makes frequent guest 
appearances on the tonight show and late night with david 
letterman 
seinfeld said he has no plans to spend a lot of time on 
television in fact he still sees television mainly as a means to 
promote his standup appearances 
to me the big thing is to get people to come and see you 
he said thats an accomplishment watching a comedian on tv is 
no big thing i wouldnt want to go from show to show like bob 
newhart this is going to be it for me as a sitcom actor 
i love meeting people and traveling thats what standup 
comics are supposed to do i dont have a personal life but i 
dont seem to require one i think personal lives are overrated i 
do a lot of onenighters but i get back to my home in new york 
regularly i have as much free time as anyone 
seinfeld who grew up in brooklyn said he decided at age 8 to 
become a comedian 
i didnt really do any comedy until i was out of college but 
i was always fascinated by it he said i liked bill cosby a 
lot when i was young he was great hes still great i liked alan 
king george carlin lenny bruce robert klein i was always 
fooling around like kids do i just couldnt stop doing it it was 
fun to laugh and make other people laugh 
i started out on amateur nights at the comedy clubs i was 
nervous at first then i really got into it i knew i was going to 
make it from my first moment onstage 
seinfeld writes all of his own material because it gives his act 
a point of view he said most of the episodes for seinfeld were 
written with another comedian larry david 
a few years ago he appeared on benson three times as the 
governors joke writer 
the idea was that the jokes would be so bad they would be 
funny he said but bad jokes arent funny theyre just bad 
that was my only previous acting experience i had no idea what i 
was doing thats how im most comfortable

japan officially bans rice imports but theres 
a loophole that allows shipments of processed rice products a 
major share comes from japanesefinanced companies in the united 
states 
the niche market has shown promising growth for us 
exporters says james v parker us ministercounselor for 
agricultural affairs in tokyo 
manufacturers are prevented by japans foodcontrol law from 
importing cheaper foreign rice so they have turned to importing 
processed rice items which are not covered by the ban 
japan has stubbornly resisted attempts by the united states and 
other rice exporting nations to relax its import restrictions 
parker writing in the june issue of agexporter magazine said 
the united states ranks second behind thailand as a supplier of the 
processed rice products which include rice flour preparations 
rice crackers rice mixed with meat or seafood and rice wine 
most of the processed rice products are imported by smaller 
trading houses with ties to japanese food processors and retailers 
the big jump in rice product imports from the united states 
at the expense of thailand can be traced to japanese investment in 
the united states parker said in the past year japanese 
firms have invested in four food processing plants in california 
besides ensuring that the products suit the palates of japanese 
consumers the companies are familiar with government import red 
tape and japans distribution systems 
however parker said japanese customs officials carefully 
analyze the rice mixtures to see that they conform to standards 
and there are tariffs on the processed items 
the niche market is relatively small but it apparently is 
attractive to japanese investors who are using it to circumvent 
tokyos official policy against rice imports 
it also is attracting other suppliers besides thailand and the 
united states competition is developing from taiwan china 
australia new zealand south korea indonesia and others parker 
said 
although the niche market for us rice products is a help it 
still skirts the broader issue of japans flatout refusal to open 
its import door to foreign rice 
the rice issue came to one of its periodic heads in the last few 
weeks after agriculture secretary clayton yeutter predicted april 9 
that japan would abolish its rice import bank by the end of this 
year when the uruguay round of trade talks is scheduled to end 
in a televised satellite interview with european reporters 
yeutter said tokyo could not stand for world trade liberalization 
without looking at its own policies 
and my judgment is that the political leadership of japan will 
come to that same conclusion between now and december and 
therefore japan will open its rice market yeutter said 
but yeutter conceded there will be a great debate among japanese 
leaders as to how far the rice door will open 
no one is suggesting that japan must open its rice market 
totally he said thats unrealistic 
earlier this month japans minister of agriculture forestry 
and fisheries tomio yamamoto told reporters in tokyo that yeutter 
had been interfering in japans internal affairs 
yamamoto asked about remarks by us trade representative carla 
hills also touching on rice policy replied that his country is 
not patient enough to endure further meddling by us government 
officials in japans rice policy 
yeutter after reading press reports about yamamotos remarks 
fired off an angry letter to the japanese official with copies 
delivered last week to news organizations 
yeutter was us trade representative in the reagan 
administration before taking over as secretary of agriculture for 
president bush 
after working so hard over the past three years to manage this 
issue in a nonconfrontational way i am personally offended and 
deeply distressed to read that i am nonetheless accused of 
interfering in japans internal policy he wrote yamamoto 
yeutter said japan agreed conceptually to negotiate on its 
agricultural import restrictions when yamamotos government 
concurred in the formation of the uruguay round of talks under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
meanwhile yeutter and other american critics say japanese 
consumers are paying two to three times the world price for 
domestic rice because of their governments import policy

if your image of the office desk is a 
flat rectangular surface with drawers on the side then get ready 
for the work station of the future 
officials at steelcase inc the worlds largest office 
furniture manufacturer unveiled prototypes tuesday of six 
futuristic stations designed by art college students 
among the prerequisites for each design a place for a fax 
machine videocassette recorder personal computer and telephone 
one model featured a mini marble conference table that folds up 
like an ironing board into a shelving tower with space for a vcr 
fax machine and computer protruding from the sides of the tower 
are large fans used as office dividers when everything is folded 
up it becomes a freestanding unit on wheels 
another model has a small work space with a computer but is 
linked to a larger station with what appears to be a low round 
coffee table in the center images from the computer terminal are 
projected onto a flat monitor on the table which is surrounded by 
three lighting columns 
the worker reaction some would probably be attracted to them 
and then some would wonder how did it land said paul cornell 
manager of behavioral and environmental research at steelcase 
nineteen students at the art center college of design in 
pasadena calif worked for three months on the 
steelcasesponsored project called smart box which is on display 
at steelcases corporate development center through may 24 
another requirement for the work station is that it allow three 
people to work there at the same time to meet the trend toward 
group problemsolving but that it be flexible enough for the 
worker who wants privacy 
as a result you have components that can be moved 
reconfigured to meet the situation said terry west industrial 
design director for steelcase 
some of the designs were relatively simple one had two 
trapezoidal glass tops surrounded by posts between which a 
tarpaulin is stretched to create a kids clubhouse atmosphere 
west said 
the designs emphasized natural materials lighter colors and 
warmer lighting to replace the hard plastics and flashy chrome 
of the 1970s cornell said 
through the program steelcase hopes to stimulate curriculum 
toward office furniture design at the art school west said 
however he said some components of the work stations may be coming 
soon to an office near you 
we are blueskying with this project but there is an anchor 
to real life west said it may not be that far into the 
future

soviet president mikhail gorbachev will try 
to forge some strategic business alliances to help revitalize his 
countrys slumping economy during a postsummit visit to the west 
coast june 34 
the soviet leader might squeeze in a quick ride on a cable car 
or a peek at the golden gate bridge but his mind will be on 
business during his trip to stanford university and san francisco 
his hosts say 
gorbachev is really interested in business opportunities with 
west coast business leaders said carol piasente director of 
communications for the san francisco chamber of commerce the 
chamber plans a luncheon for gorbachev with leaders of 150 area 
businesses and local politicians 
he wants to hear from the business leaders learn about their 
ideas and concerns and tell them what he is interested in i 
expect there will be some sort of question and answer exchange 
ms piasente said 
gorbachevs advance party from moscow which spent monday and 
tuesday working out details of the visit with bay area officials 
said he is most interested in meeting executives in the areas of 
finance agriculture food processing and computers 
gorbachev is expected to arrive with his wife raisa the night 
of june 3 after a sixhour stop in minnesota following summit talks 
with president bush in washington 
tentative plans confirmed by officials tuesday include a 
breakfast meeting june 4 with former president reagan and former 
secretary of state george p shultz that will be followed by a 
visit to stanford university where gorbachev will make a speech 
and meet scholars from the hoover institution and the school of 
business 
hoover director john raisian said gorbachev will not be in the 
area long enough for substantive dialogue but his visit could 
set in motion a relationship between hoover and soviet economists 
rep tom campbell rcalif said gorbachev may be less 
interested in discussing economic theory than in meeting with 
business school professors about programs to teach soviets how to 
start and run businesses 
gorbachevs visit coincides with a previously planned soviet 
silicon summit in santa clara june 414 which will bring 
together leading soviet and us hightechnology business leader to 
build trade relations 
even if gorbachev doesnt go to that conference his mere 
presence and his interest in economic development is charging up 
excitement among silicon valley executives 
but not everyone is planning a warm welcome for gorbachev 
the armenian community plans demonstrations to protest military 
rule and alleged human rights violations in nagornokarabagh an 
autonomous province in soviet azerbaijan 
estonians latvians and lithuanians also are preparing protests 
to demand the independence of the baltic states 
we want gorbachev to see what hes doing is really wrong 
especially the economic blockade of lithuania said joe sidas 
of the new baltic alliance an umbrella group for various 
organizations of the nearly 5000 estonians latvians and 
lithuanians in the bay area 
the soviet jews bay area council angry about virulent 
antisemitism in the soviet union considered protests but 
decided not to because it wanted to acknowledge soviet progress on 
jewish issues said spokesman marshall platt instead the council 
plans to collect petitions outside the soviet consulate and ask the 
consulate to submit them to him

united auto workers leaders promised to 
seek costofliving adjustments for pensioners in this summers 
contract talks despite turning back a local initiative to require 
such inflation protection 
the issue of cola for retirees attracted the most attention of 
any proposal at a twoday special bargaining convention that ended 
tuesday one day ahead of schedule 
resolutions passed by the convention will serve as a road map 
for bargaining committees when they sit down with the big three 
automakers in the first two weeks of july 
asked after the convention closed if he would seek 
costofliving protection in pensions uaw president owen bieber 
said oh sure well have the whole six miles out there 
earlier tuesday delegates killed an effort that would have 
required bargainers to seek cola protection for the unions 446000 
retirees 
in refusing to consider a resolution from a flint mich local 
delegates backed biebers plea to keep negotiating committees 
unfettered 
bieber repeatedly told delegates that a resolution before the 
convention that did not specifically refer to cola protection did 
not bar negotiators from seeking pension adjustments keyed to 
inflation 
i do not believe that there is one single person in this 
convention hall and certainly your president who reads that 
language to preclude our attempting to get cola bieber said 
indexing pensions could be extremely costly for general motors 
corp ford motor co and chrysler corp the companies and the 
union have said the union estimates such a provision could cost 
more than 1 billion a year for the big three 
the uaw isnt required to bargain for retirees but in the past 
the union has negotiated lumpsum payments for retirees to counter 
inflation 
bieber cited five major goals of this years bargaining better 
job security higher wages pension improvements better health 
care and more responsive management 
contracts with the big three automakers expire at midnight sept 
14 its the first time in 11 years that each of the contracts 
expire at the same time some of biebers political allies broke 
ranks to argue for costofliving protection for retires 
we must help these brother and sister retirees who have lost 
the battle against inflation said jerry melillo president of 
local 1250 in cleveland and a member of the uaws ford bargaining 
committee 
among other business delegates also approved a proposal to 
merge three of the unions 15 regions into two some delegates 
opposed the move saying it would water down their clout 
but the union like the automakers it bargains with is 
shrinking during the past 15 years uaw membership has dropped by 
about a third to about 1 million members 
the threeregion merger which would affect members in ohio 
west virginia and western pennsylvania would occur only when one 
of the regional directors leaves office there are about 113000 
members in the three regions

directors of debtridden pinnacle west capital 
corp citing success in early stages of a retrenchment plan have 
rejected a 182 billion cash takeover offer from pacificorp 
tuesdays rejection of the latest offer from the northwest 
utility was expected to heat up todays annual meeting of pinnacle 
west 
the arizona utility holding company suspended common stock 
dividends in october and has told stockholders not to expect a 
return for several years pacificorp in turn threatened to take 
its offer directly to pinnacle west shareholders 
pinnacle west chairman richard snell said the board also 
rejected as too low a 500 million offer by the salt river project 
utility to buy part of arizona public service cos service 
territory in the phoenix area 
aps is pinnacle wests flagship subsidiary and has been its only 
profitable company for two years 
pacificorp based in portland ore last week made its fourth 
offer since last fall in an attempt to acquire aps through pinnacle 
west 
company executives said they would not make another pitch to 
pinnacle west directors verl topham pacificorps executive vice 
president said tuesday his company was ready to take its offer to 
pinnacle west shareholders 
we have yet to hear any positive statement from pinnacle west 
management concerning the future topham said in a prepared 
statement 
continued rejection of a better alternative for shareholders 
and customers is unacceptable he added we think it is 
appropriate for shareholders and customers to seek responsible 
action from pinnacle west management 
pinnacle wests annual meeting was expected to be raucous even 
before the takeover rejection after incurring a 676 million loss 
from its former merabank subsidiary pinnacle west reported a 
5514 million net loss in 1989 
snell said pacificorps 21ashare offer 825 higher than 
the companys stock price at the time was financially inadequate 
and did not reflect the value of this company 
more importantly this is not the time for us to sell this 
company snell said 
he said it would take two to three years to win regulatory 
approval for a takeover 
shareholders would not receive their money until approval was 
won snell said and by then pinnacle wests business strategies 
will have significantly increased both equity and the intrinsic 
value of the company 
he said pinnacle west has resolved its problems with merabank 
which lost more than 400 million before the federal government 
took it over jan 31 
the prospect of better operations at the palo verde nuclear 
generating station also bode well for the company he said 
malfunctions have kept most of the 93 billion threereactor 
power complex out of operation since march 1989 
i am convinced based in part on discussions with the nuclear 
regulatory commission that we are very close to getting the plant 
up and running snell said 
he said units 1 and 2 were expected to be in operation before 
the end of june unit 3 has been producing power since last month 
at the generating site 50 miles west of here 
snell said pacificorp would be in for a long fight if it pursued 
a takeover by a shareholder proxy fight 
pacificorp which owns pacific power amp light and utah power amp 
light has begun an advertising campaign here to solicit support 
from shareholders and aps ratepayers the company is running 
fullpage advertisements in newspapers along with radio ads and 
direct mail pieces

restaurants will be judged in the 1990s not by 
what they serve but how they serve it experts said 
with more twoincome families people value time more and are 
unwilling to put up with secondrate service insiders in the 200 
billionayear industry said tuesday at the national restaurant 
association trade show 
people expect topnotch service even in fastfood 
restaurants dru scott a san francisco psychologist who advises 
organizations on customer satisfaction told about 100 
restaurateurs in an address 
to survive restaurants must use psychological tricks to keep 
the customer satisfied she said 
think more of customer delight not just satisfaction she 
said 
that means using only positive behavior in negative situations 
if a restaurant runs out of a certain item the server should not 
say we dont have that but instead should offer something on 
the menu that is similar as an alternative ms scott advised 
if theres a long wait give those in line menus to keep them 
interested and if a customer complains assure them that their 
comfort is your top priority she advised 
seek customer feedback to learn how to please them and 
encourage employees to serve better by developing games such as 
keeping track of which server tallies the biggest checks for the 
day ms scott said 
john iannotti manager of nicks fishmarket in chicago said his 
restaurant has discovered the recipe for keeping the customer happy 
service is definitely our main priority said iannotti one 
of thousands of restaurateurs who gathered at the fiveday show 
we want people to walk out of the restaurant commenting first 
on the service and second on the food he said 
you really cant do that much with food to improve on 
another quality restaurants menu iannotti said service is the 
variable that can determine if a customer returns he said 
service showed up as a top concern among consumers queried for 
this years yankelovich survey an annual study of 2500 consumers 
nationwide conducted for consumeroriented industries by the 
connecticutbased consulting firm said bonnie schwartz director 
of restaurant marketing for american express 
were moving into a much more financially conservative decade 
with intense competition for discretionary dollars which of course 
forces services to become more attentive she said 
american express unveiled a program it calls the american 
express salute to restaurant service in which the company will 
give cardmembers certificates to award to restaurant staffers who 
give the best service the staffer who gets the most certificates 
will receive 10000 in travelers checks 
the customer who gives out the most certificates will win a 
culinary tour to france ms schwartz said in an announcement timed 
to coincide with the restaurant show 
the nationwide contest runs from june through september

the bush administration says the savings and 
loan industry bailout will cost 61 billion next year almost eight 
times more than an earlier estimate documents show 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady planned to provide detailed 
projections of the costs today before the senate banking committee 
brady and fellow administration officials unveiled some of the 
figures tuesday during the third round of budget negotiations with 
congressional leaders according to papers distributed at the 
closeddoor session an administration guesstimate is that the 
sampl rescue will cost 116 billion over the next five years 
at that threehour meeting in the capitol democrats and 
republicans moved toward a consensus that about 500 billion in tax 
increases and spending cuts would be needed to balance the budget 
over the next five years but they remained divided over precisely 
how much savings would be needed 
participants in the talks emphasized that the administration 
estimates of the sampl bailout costs could change dramatically 
variables include how the economy performs how many additional 
thrifts fail and how successful the government is in selling sampl 
assets it takes over 
its a real hit and miss number said house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif 
in the 1991 budget he proposed in january president bush 
estimated that the sampl rescue would cost the government about 8 
billion next year fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
the thrift industry has been wracked by regional economic 
downturns and fraudulent managers in recent years forcing the 
government to make good on its pledge to protect depositors 
savings the general accounting office congress investigative 
arm has calculated that it could ultimately cost the government 
500 billion to deal with continuing sampl failures 
last year alone the 2878 surviving thrifts reported 192 
billion in total losses the office of thrift management has said 
hundreds more of them are expected to eventually fail 
the administration documents distributed tuesday also showed 
that the white house has increased its estimate of the size of the 
deficit over the next several years 
in january bush projected that an improving economy would push 
the budget into balance by 1995 but the papers show that the 
administration now says the budget still will be 32 billion in the 
red that year 
nonetheless the administration estimates are much more 
optimistic than those embraced by the nonpartisan congressional 
budget office according to cbo the 1995 deficit will be 119 
billion unless action is taken 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn emerged 
from tuesdays bargaining session to say that democrats want a 
fiveyear package saving at least 500 billion 
sen pete domenici rnm ranking gop member of the budget 
panel said republicans preferred a plan in the 450 billion to 
500 billion range 
it seems to me were beginning to see some daylight that that 
might be doable domenici said 
the two sides do not expect to begin exchanging specific offers 
on how to slash the deficit for weeks they meet again thursday to 
continue studying technical issues 
in recent days white house budget chief richard darman has 
conceded that next years deficit will be about 138 billion bush 
said in january that the shortfall would be 100 billion the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law sets a 1991 budget gap target of 
64 billion

here are the widely discussed alternatives to 
conventional gasoline for power motor vehicles their benefits and 
tradeoffs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gasoline modified to contain more oxygen so it burns more 
completely thereby reducing emissions of smogcausing 
hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and toxic chemicals contains lower 
concentrations of aromatics chemicals that boost octane but also 
cause toxic releases 
advantages existing distribution system requires no 
modification in vehicle has no loss of driving range 
drawbacks slightly more expensive not available in all grades 
of gasoline does not meet all toxic and smog emission control 
requirements in clean air legislation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an alcohol fuel from natural gas may also be made from coal 
but environmental benefits then are significantly reduced 
advantages reduces emissions of air toxics such as benzene 
substantially lower emissions of smogcausing hydrocarbons high 
octane rating easily blends with gasoline adaptable to current 
retail distribution system 
disadvantages highly toxic and emits formaldehyde a 
carcinogen costs more than gasoline and provides less energy per 
gallon highly corrosive and will require modifications in 
vehicles difficult starting in cold weather burns without flame 
when at 100 percent lower energy content and lower driving range 
per tank

house and senate negotiators must decide 
whether the americans with disabilities act can limit the 
employment rights of aids sufferers and still be regarded as 
landmark civil rights legislation 
the house voted 40320 tuesday to pass the disabilities act the 
act guarantees the millions of disabled americans equal access to 
jobs businesses and services transportation and telephone service 
three democrats and 17 republicans voted against the bill 
except for an amendment letting employers remove workers with 
contagious diseases from foodhandling chores the house bill 
closely resembles the senate bill that passed last september on a 
768 vote 
the bill which has white house support has been hailed as the 
most significant piece of civil rights legislation since the 1964 
act that opened doors to blacks and other minorities 
we have just assured that 43 million americans who suffer from 
a disability but who have great abilities if accommodated will be 
included in our american society said rep steny h hoyer 
dmd lead house sponsor 
this is landmark legislation which extends civil rights 
protections to those with disabilities said steve bartlett 
rtexas who managed the republican debate on the bill it is 
legislation that is 20 years overdue 
both agreed that a bill would likely be ready for bushs 
signature before the july 4 break but bartlett and hoyer disagreed 
on whether the final version will include the foodservice workers 
amendment which was sought by the restaurant industry 
when the facts are known the senate may not feel it is 
necessary said hoyer who attributed the amendments passage to 
misunderstanding of the protections already offered in the bill 
my view is that the chapman amendment needs to survive the 
housesenate negotiations said bartlett either the senate can 
include it or the house can revote it i think everybody 
understood it really well 
bartlett was referring to the 199187 vote thursday on an 
amendment by rep jim chapman dtexas the amendment would let 
employers reassign a worker with an infectious or contagious 
disease so that worker wouldnt handle food 
both sides agreed that the amendment was intended to address 
irrational public fears about aids 
this congress should not license discrimination of any kind 
rep john miller rwash said last week he said the same 
argument about public perception was used to justify discrimination 
against blacks 
dr louis sullivan the secretary of health and human services 
said the amendment is unnecessary because aids is not spread 
through casual contact and the bill already restricts people with 
dangerous infections 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said tuesday the 
administration did not take a position on the amendment and that 
president bush will sign the bill with or without it 
among key provisions of the bill 
a ban on job discrimination would be phased in over two to four 
years companies with fewer than 15 employers would be exempt 
hotels restaurants shopping malls drug stores and business 
and professional offices along with any other public 
accommodations would have to be accessible to disabled people 
transportation public and private would have to be 
accessible timetables for implementation vary according to system 
speech and hearingimpaired people would have access to 
telephone service by means of relay services these services would 
have to be provided by phone companies within three years

the government plans to call its first national 
referendum to seek public approval of an economic reform plan that 
could throw tens of millions of people out of work soviet 
officials said today 
first deputy premier yuri maslyukov told a news conference that 
the government believes it must have a clear indication of public 
support before instituting a program that will switch the country 
to a market economy 
the plan is expected to double food prices and lead to massive 
closures of inefficient factories 
no date was set for the referendum 
if the public refuses to consent to the price rises then 
perhaps we will have to resort to roundtable discussions 
maslyukov said in response to a question there have been calls in 
the soviet union by reformist groups for such discussions with the 
government and the communist party to accelerate political and 
economic reforms 
the new plan sets target price increases for various sectors of 
the economy including an 82 percent rise in energy prices an 
average 43 percent rise in retail prices and a doubling in the 
price of food which is now heavily subsidized 
deputy premier leonid abalkin told the news conference the 
potential number of jobs that could be lost might be in the tens of 
millions even under the slow lessdrastic response the government 
is recommending 
maslyukov said if the soviet union had chosen polishstyle 
shocktherapy reforms that instituted the economic changes in 
only two years unemployment could rise as high as 40 million 
we are unable to offer normal living conditions to such a 
number if they lose their jobs it would the lead the country to 
the edge of an economic crash maslyukov said 
the longawaited plan was approved by gorbachevs advisory 
presidential council on tuesday and was to be presented to 
parliament on thursday 
nikolai petrakov gorbachevs top economics aide made it clear 
in a speech to a sovietamerican trade group that he is unhappy 
with the proposal which will increase retail prices on jan 1 
asked if announcing the price increases seven months before they 
take effect would cause consumers to buy everything now and cause 
businesses to hold back their products until the price rise 
petrakov agreed he said bluntly this will create a panic an 
economic panic 
vladislav malkevich chairman of the soviet chamber of commerce 
interrupted thats happening now he said 
petrakov nodded and continued well have to see what the 
parliament has to say about the steps taken by the government 
i think we should not lose these seven months he added 
a bloc of progressive legislators with similar discontent over 
the reform is planning to call for a vote of noconfidence in the 
government of premier nikolai ryzhkov when he presents the reform 
package thursday in a speech to be broadcast live on soviet radio 
and television 
the progressives lost a noconfidence vote in december when 
ryzkhov proposed three more years of central planning before 
installing any market reforms 
the soviet economys precipitous decline since december prompted 
gorbachev and ryzhkov to abandon that economic plan and accelerate 
transformation to a market economy 
in the first three months of 1990 wages spiraled up 134 
percent while production declined official industrial output 
dropped 12 percent but some estimates are as high as 5 percent 
petrakov said the most crucial battles had been won because the 
government finally agreed on the need to convert to a market 
economy 
many ideological barriers have been removed barriers which 
prevented economic reform for a long time petrakov said 
referring to the communist partys recent decisions to permit such 
capitalist notions as private ownership of factories 
but the presidential council chose a slow fiveyear 
transformation rather than the shock therapy working in 
poland for fear the shaky soviet government could not withstand 
public anger over sudden jumps in prices plant closures and 
unemployment 
workers are to receive 40ruble raises with smaller sums for 
nonworking spouses and children enterprises then are to 
recalculate their books based on the new prices and the government 
will discover how many will need subsidies to continue operating 
petrakov said 220000 stateowned enterprises or 70 percent of 
the total will be converted to stockbased companies within the 
next several months as a first step toward the government 
gradually selling the shares to individuals companies and banks 
according to maslyukov 60 percent of prices will remain 
controlled these include prices for raw materials energy and 
products made by the monopoly firms dominating the economy

the soviet union wants to eliminate wheat 
imports and intends to more than double purchases of soybeans while 
cutting back on corn a top soviet agriculture official says 
but ivan skiba did not give a timetable for what would be a 
drastic shift in grain trade and he also said the soviet union 
would stick to its grain purchase agreements 
one such accord slated to be signed at the june summit between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev would 
increase minimum soviet grain purchases from the united states by 
more than 11 percent over each of the next five years 
skiba who is chief of the agrarian department of the central 
committee of the soviet communist party discussed grain imports 
tuesday in response to reporters questions at a symposium at iowa 
state university 
he also said there may be grounds behind reports the soviet 
union has made late payments to suppliers but said he believed the 
problem was temporary 
we do pay our bills we dont borrow from peter to pay paul 
skiba said through an interpreter 
he said that to meet new requirements for increased protein in 
animal feed purchases of soybeans and other oilseeds on world 
markets would have to rise to 8 million to 10 million metric tons a 
year from the current 3 million to 4 million 
skiba said the shift in grain procurement policy would mean 
smaller purchases of corn the leading feed for livestock he also 
said the soviet union wants to do away with buying wheat 
theoretically we can satisfy our domestic demand for wheat 
he said 
skibas comments came in response to questions on recent record 
soviet grain purchases from the united states and reports of 
criticism within the communist party that such spending is using up 
limited ussr reserves of hard currency 
hard currency has become scarce in the soviet union because of 
falling world prices for oil and natural gas two commodities the 
soviets have relied on to help finance their foreign purchases 
in the 12 months ended june 30 1989 the ussr bought 155 
million metric tons of wheat from all world sources and 186 
million tons of corn according to the us department of 
agriculture the us share was 46 million tons of wheat and 168 
million tons of corn 
the us grain purchases were a record skiba said some of that 
could be attributed to weather problems that reduced wheat 
production in the soviet union 
under a previously announced grain agreement to be signed with 
the united states annual minimum american grain shipments to the 
soviets would rise to 10 million metric tons from 9 million a 
metric ton is approximately 2205 pounds 
under the agreement the ussr will be committed to buying at 
least 4 million tons each year of wheat and feed grains in any one 
year the soviets may substitute up to 750000 tons of one 
commodity for the other the agreement for the first time includes 
sorghum and barley as well as corn under the definition of feed 
grains 
the additional purchases under the agreement could be made up of 
wheat feed grains soybeans or soybean meal 
the accord also will allow the soviets to buy up to 14 million 
tons of grain annually without further discussion with washington 
the pact it replaces had an automatic limit of 12 million tons 
but skiba said that as the soviet union moves to introduce 
private farms and improve farm productivity it needs to prod 
farmers by reducing imports 
he said relying on imports has caused the soviets to become 
couch potatoes when it comes to productivity

whats a fair price to pay for financial advice 
that alwaysthorny question can be especially tough to answer 
when you engage the services of a financial planner a sort of 
family doctor specializing in the health and wellbeing of your 
personal finances 
much effort has been expended over the past decade or so to 
create a set of standards against which members of this growing 
occupation can be measured still wouldbe customers of financial 
planners can find themselves faced with a wide array of choices 
one subspecies charges a flat fee in the manner of a physician 
providing a medical checkup or a given surgical procedure 
another may work for an hourly rate much like a lawyer or 
accountant still another makes its living on commissions for 
products sold the way many stockbrokers and life insurance 
representatives do 
still others like bob hewitt a monterey calif planner and 
chairman of the 17000member international association for 
financial planning use a combination of those systems 
each type has its advocates depending to a great extent on the 
kind of service the customer wants 
the public at large shows no strong preference for any given 
method according to the results of a new survey conducted for the 
iafp by the gallup organization 
among the 1058 households taking part in the april survey the 
iafp reports 51 percent saw benefits to be gained from the 
services of a financial adviser 
within that 51 percent respondents cast a split vote among the 
types of planners for instance they leaned toward commission and 
commissionandfee planners over the flatfee variety by 49 percent 
to 43 percent on the question of which was likely to make available 
the best investment 
but flatfee planners outpolled the commission and 
commissionandfee groups as the ones likely to provide the most 
objective advice 
that prompts the conclusion that the method of compensation 
as long as its fully disclosed is not that important to them 
hewitt said in an interview 
in most cases a planner working on commission may be the 
logical first choice if you are operating on a relatively small 
scale or seeking ways to pursue a single goal such as planning for 
a childs college education 
by contrast a flatfee planner could be the likely candidate to 
consult for someone who was seeking to resolve broad debt problems 
or find a way to manage a windfall such as an inheritance or 
proceeds from a winning lottery ticket 
even in cases where the customer has no preference a strong 
case can be made for inquiring how much and through what 
arrangement a planner gets paid 
among the iafp survey respondents who saw merit in getting 
professional investment advice 95 percent either agreed or 
strongly agreed that all clients should get written notice in 
advance of how an adviser is paid 
the idea behind that seems sensible first of all simply to 
help gauge whether any planner is worth his or her price whats 
more a knowledge of the compensation setup puts you in a better 
position to consider the source of the advice you are getting

hundred pounds of milk would never go below 1010 under current 
law dairy support prices have no minimum and could drop as low as 
about 860 per hundred pounds 
with the new plan the government price support would rise by at 
least 25 cents if surpluses fall below 35 billion pounds 
if dairy surpluses grow in the subsequent year to between 501 
billion and 7 billion pounds the government could drop the price 
by 25 to 50 cents but it could never drop it below a total 1010 
per hundredweight 
if more than 7 billion pounds of surpluses result in any one 
year of the fiveyear farm bilan sen james mcclure won his partys primary

the house began considering a string of 
amendments to sweeping clean air legislation today including 
proposals requiring cleaner gasoline in smogclogged cities and 
assistance to workers who lose jobs to tougher pollution controls 
house speaker tom foley dwash said he expected a final vote 
on the bill possibly as early as late wednesday but more likely by 
thursday floor fights were anticipated on several issues including 
one calling for a 250 million fiveyear jobloss assistance plan 
the bush administration has opposed the jobs assistance proposal 
as well as a proposal to require automakers to build 1 million cars 
that run on fuels other than gasoline the automakers have waged an 
intense lobbying campaign against the car production proposal 
white house chief of staff john sununu told republican members 
shortly before floor debate began that the white house had strong 
opposition to both the car production and unemployment assistance 
program and that both could threaten the legislation 
the jobs amendment sponsored by rep robert wise dwva 
would apply to all workers an attempt to require a much broader 
and more expensive unemployment assistance provision in the senate 
failed by a close vote in april 
sununu stopped short of suggesting that president bush might 
veto legislation containing either provision but said the white 
house wanted a bill without unnecessary amendments said rep 
sherwood boehlert rny who was at the meeting 
house negotiators have reached a compromise agreement on 
amendments that would require cleaner fuels to be sold in the most 
smogpolluted cities and also on requiring tougher controls on air 
pollution from offshore oil platforms both provisions are expected 
to be approved on the floor 
automobiles cause nearly half of the smogproducing pollutants 
that plague the nations major cities they also are the source of 
dangerous toxic emissions including a number of cancercausing 
pollutants 
tougher air pollution controls included in the clean air 
legislation now before the house and approved by the senate 
earlier this year call for sharp reductions in emissions from cars 
and trucks automakers will have to install new emission controls 
to meet the new standards and oil companies will have to produce 
cleaner fuels 
but some congressmen say neither bill goes far enough at least 
in the nine cities where the smog problem is the worst and where 
motorists buy 22 percent of the nations gasoline 
among the amendments cleared for consideration by house 
rulemakers late tuesday were proposals requiring 
production of 1 million cars a year by 1997 that burn fuels 
other than gasoline the cars would be sold in nine cities with the 
worst pollution 
auto industry lobbyists who oppose the proposal argue the 
amendment calls for such stiff emission cuts that the cars could be 
run on only pure methanol or compressed natural gas supporters 
argue truly alternative fuel vehicles are needed to rid urban areas 
of smog 
the sale of cleaner gasoline blends that have specific oxygen 
content in nine cities with the worst smog and 44 other cities that 
fail to meet carbon monoxide standards 
the requirements likely will be met only by selling a 
gasolineethanol blend of fuel despite a 1 million advertising 
and lobbying campaign against the measure by the oil industry in 
recent weeks the measure is expected to be approved by the house 
a similar proposal is in the senate bill 
among the other amendments that were cleared for floor 
consideration were proposals that would 
extend the warranty requirements on pollution control equipment 
on cars direct a phaseout of ozonedamaging chemicals such as 
chlorofluorocarbons and require visibility controls for many 
national parks and wilderness areas 
in addition to controls on auto emissions the clean air bill 
requires industry to curtail smogcausing emissions calls on 
electric utilities to cut 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide 
emissions that cause acid rain and will require tough new controls 
on toxic industrial releases

victor kiam once got so excited 
watching a football play he knocked himself unconscious and speared 
his hand on a tennis trophy he probably wont be doing that again 
the new england patriots owner and successful entrepreneur 
known for trying to buy businesses he likes says hes still 
enthusiastic about his favorite spectator sport and the team he 
acquired two years ago but after last years dismal season hes 
containing his expectations 
im not counting one single chicken until its in the 
broiler said kiam 63 whose hapless patriots were 511 and 
missed the playoffs for the third straight time last year his 
first full year as owner 
im just as enthusiastic about winning but i think i have 
tempered my anticipation kiam said in an interview im 
saying ok it looks good lets see what happens now 
kiam is perhaps best known as that gravelly voiced guy in the 
bathrobe whos appeared on television screens pitching the shaver 
made by his remington products inc as he reminds tv viewers and 
others who meet him he loved the shaver so much he bought the 
company 
well he likes football so much he bought the patriots in 1988 
from team founder billy sullivan which kiam at the time called 
the ultimate football fanatics dream 
his purchase was especially notable because other bigtime 
takeover entrepreneurs like marvin davis and donald trump had 
unsuccessfully attempted to buy the patriots earlier 
kiam was skinny growing up and concentrated on tennis which 
eventually earned him a national ranking he couldnt play football 
himself but came to love its strategy and unpredictability he 
admits he knocked himself cold once in his living room when running 
along with a play on monday night football 
unfortunately for kiam and patriots fans the team isnt nearly 
as successful as its owner the patriots finished fourth in their 
division and hurt for a quarterback important teammates suffered 
untimely injuries 
last year we had three of our key players out for the last 
exhibition game you go home exceedingly depressed absolutely 
destroyed and say how do we recover that was so damaging 
its a tough one to come back from he said 
kiam acknowledged owning a football team is different than 
owning remington or the friendship collection his wife ellens 
jewelry company theres a lot more media attention and more focus 
on shortterm results similar to the pressure faced by companies 
answerable to stockholders kiam hated that when he was president 
and chairman of benrus watch corp 
i didnt like the fact that we were constantly saying if we 
do this now whats it going to do to our earnings in this 
quarter you cant have two masters you can only have one master 
and thats the business said kiam who left that company 12 
years ago to buy remington from sperryrand 
nor does he relish the fact that the bounce of a ball can change 
the outcome of a football game 
in business you can catch these miscues it takes a real 
letdown in the organization or a screwup when your product gets 
affected but the nature of athletics is they dont have the 
systems built into the structure and at any moment something can go 
wrong and that is something you cannot control he said 
nonetheless kiam said hes mesmerized by the same 
uncertainties he even likes the shape of the ball because its 
prone to unusual bounces 
the reason i got into this is to be part of a football 
adventure kiam said i dont think ill ever give up the 
ghost now that im into it 
the patriots will improve if kiam gets his way after suffering 
large losses last year the franchise has already strengthened 
financially partly because of a 9 million increase in the 
patriots share of the nfls network tv contract kiam said the 
business could come close to breaking even 
he also expressed confidence that he could make the team more 
successful on the field with the same kind of perseverance he used 
to revitalize remington which at the time he bought it was a 
comatose business that sperryrand was eager to unload 
in what became one of the first successful debtfinanced 
takeovers now commonly called leveraged buyouts kiam borrowed the 
money to buy remington repaying the debt partly by trimming his 
acquisitions fat 
he started by cutting 79 executive positions eliminating perks 
like country club memberships and consolidating operations at the 
companys headquarters in bridgeport conn 
he also cut the price of the shaver streamlined its packaging 
and improved quality control eventually increasing sales from 43 
million in 1979 to an anticipated 350 million this year 
i look at the patriots like a business how are we going to 
do five 10 years down the pike kiam said when you get 
married you dont say well im going to have a nice honeymoon 
and then move on to happy hunting grounds 
kiams satisfaction at turning remington around is so big hes 
written two books about his business triumphs and lessons learned 
along the way going for it and live to win 
he spent his first five years working on its shaver but has 
since branched into a wide range of household goods from an 
instrument that sucks up bugs to a device that keeps nose hairs out 
of sight 
this thing i think is going to be a zinger he said at his 
desk holding up the latest gizmo a handheld tanning wand which 
he demonstrated on his arm this is a revolutionary new product 
it certainly fills a need 
hes also keeping busy selling belts mens ties travel 
accessories precision instruments and a monthly magazine for day 
care centers 
live to win published last year describes his fateful 
selfinflicted knockout while watching the monday night game 
as soon as i recovered my wits all i wanted to know gore and 
all was did they win we zealots are a breed of diehards

japans land prices are so inflated that many 
experts fear a sudden drop could devastate domestic financial 
markets and send shock waves throughout the global economy 
nonetheless few believe such a calamity is likely although 
pressure for land reform in japan has grown dramatically over the 
past year any changes are expected to be slow and cautious 
japan has only 4 percent of the united states land area but its 
real estate assets are worth four times the value of us real 
estate 149 trillion economic planning agency figures show 
a doubling in nationwide land values since 1984 has put home 
ownership out of reach for most japanese and driven up business 
costs in city centers this has led to calls for reform of what 
critics call a byzantine system of taxes and regulation that would 
make more land available and stop the spiral 
high land prices also have become a trade issue us officials 
complain that high rents make doing business here prohibitively 
expensive for foreign companies subverting japans claim that it 
is leveling the playing field for competitors from abroad 
but analysts say the cost of significantly cutting land prices 
would far outweigh the benefits promises made by tokyo during 
trade talks to increase the land supply through tax and other 
reforms theoretically reducing land prices are likely to happen 
over a long period of time they say 
the overheated real estate market has underpinned phenomenal 
growth in japans stock markets and overseas investment the sense 
of wealth evoked by ballooning property values has fueled 
unprecedented consumer spending contributing to four years of 
uninterrupted economic expansion 
a bank of japan report issued may 9 said the government should 
find ways to cool overheated land prices gradually but avoid sudden 
measures that could hurt the economy 
experiences abroad suggest that it is important to forestall 
any turbulence which might arise from a sudden change in land 
prices in order to maintain a safe and sound financial system 
the central bank said 
economists here agree that a sudden drop in prices would have a 
disastrous impact on the stock market on banks and other lenders 
the integration of japans economy with the rest of the world 
ensures that such a shock also would hit foreign financial markets 
the financial markets here are founded on trust in rising land 
prices said susumu kato head of economic research at goldman 
sachs japan lots of borrowing for stock trading at home and 
overseas is based on land collateral 
a fall in land values would generate bad debts throughout the 
system and cripple major banks and securities houses kato said 
major financial institutions would face a cash crunch as the 
value of collateral evaporated many would pull out of foreign 
markets 
that possibility could do particular damage in the united 
states where japanese investment has become an increasingly 
influential force especially in the market for us treasury bonds 
used to finance the large federal deficit 
a drop in japanese demand for us treasury bonds could force 
the united states to raise interest rates dramatically to attract 
other buyers of its debt some economists say that would set off a 
chain reaction of events that could lead to a recession 
most overseas investment is based on borrowing against real 
estate at home they dont have that kind of cash just lying 
around said ronald b talmage assistant director in tokyo of 
the british investment bank nm rothschild and sons 
the risk of exposure if real estate prices here fall has 
worsened recently commercial finance and leasing firms for 
example have ignored finance ministry warnings and increased their 
lending based on real estate said david pike manager of research 
at ubs phillips and drew international 
after real estaterelated loans grew 141 percent last year to 
an aggregate total of 310 billion the ministry told banks not to 
let such lending grow faster than overall lending 
barring more drastic government action there is little 
likelihood of a downward spiral in land prices because demand for 
land remains strong pike said 
land prices climbed only 2 percent in tokyo last year down from 
238 percent in 1987 and 653 percent in 1988 but nationwide 
prices jumped 17 percent last year as inflation spread to tokyos 
distant suburbs and other major cities 
theres demand for residential construction and a shift in 
preference toward larger homes pike said growth in economic 
activity new roads and railways all these use land 
demand continues to rise on these islands crowded with 123 
million people but supply remains limited the construction 
ministry estimates that tax laws and zoning regulations are 
preventing the conversion of 148200 acres of farmland and 
underutilized sites in the tokyo metropolitan area alone to 
commercial and residential use 
government plans to revise tax laws to encourage development of 
such land are unlikely to bring about a sudden change the analysts 
say 
if they puncture the land price balloon it would shock the 
market but theyre not going to do that pike said 
the bank of japan report called for reforms to curb property 
speculation and encourage more efficient land use financial 
institutions should also be monitored it said 
in our view the report showed that the bank of japan was 
serious about the land price problem said kermit l schoenholtz 
senior economist at salomon brothers asia ltd 
he said the report which attributed some of the land price 
inflation to easy credit indicated that the central bank would 
keep interest rates high to help curb excessive lending to land 
speculators 
the banks discount rate the loan fee to banks that strongly 
affects other interest rates remained at 25 percent for nine 
years until last may since then the bank has raised it four times 
to curb inflation and help support its weakening currency it is 
now 525 percent 
its easy to make doomsday statements but i dont think the 
problem should be exaggerated the gap between land prices and 
other prices has been growing for 20 years i dont see any of 
that changing overnight schoenholtz said

pepsicola went on sale in india for the 
first time in 28 years wednesday following a bitter fiveyear 
battle to sell the us soft drink in the tightly controlled indian 
market 
pepsi sevenup and mirinda an orange soda hit the market in 
jaipur capital of the western state of rajasthan said christopher 
sinclair president of pepsicola international 
in the coming weeks the drinks will be sold throughout the 
country he said 
as part of an agreement with the indian government to 
indianize the soft drinks they will carry the prefix lehar 
meaning wave in hindi 
to sweeten the pot sinclair also promised the company would 
invest 1 billion over 10 years in bottlers distributors and other 
small businesses in india 
he also released a copy of a letter written to us trade 
representative carla hills in which he urged the us government 
not to take action against india for alleged unfair trading 
practices 
the compromises are expected to pay off say analysts who 
believe pepsi is poised to dominate the market 
indias 350 millionayear softdrink industry is controlled by 
three domestic soda kings but industry analysts say there is room 
for growth indians consume an average of only three bottles of 
soft drinks a year compared to 13 in neighboring pakistan 38 in 
thailand and 550 in the united states 
indians view western products as superior to their own and 
their domestic softdrink market currently faces turmoil because 
the government recently banned an additive brominated vegetable 
oil used by all three producers 
pepsis position is also enhanced by the absence of its 
principal foe cocacola in march the indian government turned 
down a coke proposal to build a 3 million plant 
the agreement sinclair said shows that india can be a 
vital part in the system of world commerce and that it can 
accomplish it on its own terms and not on terms dictated by the 
west 
but many view the pepsi announcement as the last good news for 
foreign investment here at least in the near term 
with the fall of prime minister rajiv gandhi in november india 
appears to have ended its brief economic liberalization and is 
again closing its markets to foreigners prime minister vp singh 
recently said india is interested only in foreign investment in 
high technology 
last year foreign investment totaled only 200 million and this 
year isnt expected to be much better 
pepsis experiences here testify to the difficulties of 
investing in india analysts say 
pepsi has been accused of paying bribes unfair business 
practices and even possible links to terrorists its investment 
proposal faced more than 20 parliamentary debates and 15 committee 
reviews 
in a lastminute move the government forced pepsi to change the 
name of the soft drink from pepsi era to lehar pepsi because era 
wasnt considered sufficiently indian the action cost pepsi 
150000 in bottle fees 
indian newspapers hypothesized without proof that pepsi might 
want to destabilize the indian government because its operations 
are based in punjab state the site of a bloody separatist movement 
led by members of the sikh religion 
our project here has been an unprecedented experience on all 
fronts said ken ross spokesman for pepsicola international 
its been very tough sledding all the way 
the pepsi project began in india in 1985 when pepsicola 
international submitted a proposal to the indian government which 
immediately rejected it pepsi then joined with a staterun 
company agroindustries corp and the privately owned tata group 
in february 1990 the first products potato chips under the 
hostess brand name and cheeseflavored cheetos snacks hit the 
market 
the project based in the northern state of punjab includes 
agricultural research crop diversification processed fruits and 
vegetables along with softdrink concentrate and snack foods 
pepsis share in the 15 million project is 399 percent due to 
an indian law which restricts the holding of foreign partners in a 
joint venture to 40 percent 
according to the governments terms softdrink production will 
be restricted to 25 percent of the projects turnover and exports 
of food items will have to be five times the value of imports 
indians were cut off from us soft drinks in 1977 when 
cocacola was forced to leave because it would not agree to the 40 
percent ownership rule pepsi left india in 1962 because of slow 
sales

gold prices plunged wednesday in hectic european 
trading following a confusing morning fixing session and amid 
reports of heavy selling by mideast investors 
the dollar meanwhile ended slightly lower against other major 
currencies 
gold lost 11 in london to settle at 375 a troy ounce and 
1135 in zurich to close at 364 an ounce earlier in hong gold 
had risen 366 to 37724 an ounce 
by midday on the new york commodity exchange gold was trading 
at around 364 an ounce 
gold began to tumble after the five leading london dealers had 
trouble matching demand and supply during a record 2hour morning 
london fixing session traders said the fixing was finally set at 
36325 a troy ounce 
the fixing is an average price calculated twice a day by the 
five dealers from what they hear on the market and it is a 
guideline for other traders and investors 
nobody had a chance to get out of positions during the 
fixing said a zurich dealer and no business was possible 
this decline wasnt predictable another zurich dealer said 
dealers said news of big middle east sell orders plus 
followthrough selling escalated golds sharp decline the 
downturn also was attributed to a market perception that gold 
having approached 378 an ounce had to fall back they said 
the upside began to look vulnerable to some people said a 
zurich trader 
the dollars slight drop against other major currencies in 
europe was attributed largely to speculation that west germany 
might raise its interest rates that would push up the value of the 
mark at the dollars expense 
a member of the bundesbanks central council wilhelm noelling 
said in a newspaper interview that he couldnt exclude another rate 
hike he said price and tax increases were likely as a result of 
the planned reunification of the two german states 
foreign exchange dealers said activity was moderate but 
diminishing with the approach of thursdays ascension day holiday 
in continental europe many traders planned to take friday off as 
well to get an extralong weekend and monday is a public holiday 
in britain 
in london the british pound rose to 16975 from 16915 late 
tuesday it traded at around 169275 in new york

the nations major airlines seeking bigger 
market shares during the summer travel season are battling one 
another with fare discounts on domestic flights 
american airlines joined the fight today saying it would match 
cuts announced tuesday by trans world airlines usair said it would 
match the discounts on a casebycase basis 
united airlines opened the fray on monday by running newspaper 
advertisements that contained coupons for 35 off roundtrip 
tickets of 175 or more the coupons are good on flights through 
dec 14 but excluding nov 1630 
the offer requires a saturday night stayover and tickets must be 
bought seven days in advance of departure and no later than aug 31 
twa responded to uniteds move by cutting its domestic 
roundtrip fares by as much as 30 percent for travel tuesday 
through thursday twa also is requiring a saturday stopover and a 
sevenday advance purchase and tickets must be purchased by june 
7 the discount is in effect for flights through dec 13 
for example the lowest coasttocoast fares would fall to 298 
from 42850 
usair said today it would honor the united coupons and would 
selectively match the twa discounts spokesman david shipley said 
usair fares were already lower in some markets and would not be 
discounted in those areas 
northwest airlines said it would also honor the united coupons 
and was studying twas discount program and decide later whether to 
match it 
spokesmen for continental airlines eastern airlines and delta 
air lines said today their carriers were also studying the fare 
changes and had not yet decided what action if any they would 
take 
the fare war comes during the airlines big vacation season and 
the discounts in particular the twa program are aimed at 
vacationers 
passengers are likely to gleefully greet the lower fares but 
the battle for bigger shares of the domestic travel market could 
take a toll on airline company profits

the dun amp bradstreet corp said wednesday it 
plans to sell most of the donnelly marketing division which 
provides an array of services to help marketers of packaged goods 
and consumer services reach customers 
the assets for sale include carol wright sales which markets 
merchandise to consumers by direct mail and distributes centsoff 
coupons through a cooperative mailing program 
its donnelly direct program also included in the sale is a 
major provider of consumer mailing lists 
the huge business information marketer said the proposed sale is 
part of a previously disclosed strategy of focusing on key markets 
for its information services 
dun amp bradstreet said the assets for sale generated revenue of 
about 225 million in 1989 and were profitable it said the absence 
of operating income resulting from the sale will be offset by 
investing and redeploying the cash proceeds 
the company which earned 5864 million or 314 a share on 
revenue of 432 billion last year has said it expects earnings to 
fall to the 280 a share range this year 
the expected decline stems partly from lower sales and higher 
costs within its us credit services business stung last year by 
complaints from some customers who said they had been overcharged 
the company said it has taken corrective action in recent months 
j kendrick noble jr who follows the company for painewebber 
said he estimates the assets for sale could bring a price exceeding 
200 million 
the company said the assets for sale exclude donnelly marketing 
information services the unit that provides products to help 
customers define and execute their marketing strategies 
in addition the company said it expects to make leaseback 
arrangements with the new owner that will give it continued access 
to the donnelly marketing consumer database which has information 
on about 84 million us households 
charles w moritz chairman and chief executive of dun amp 
bradstreet said in announcing the sale plans that the longterm 
interest of dampbs shareowners are best served by focusing our 
investments and resources on the informationintensive businesses 
of our consumermarketing information group 
that group includes nielsen media research which compiles 
television audience ratings and nielsen marketing research which 
helps companies track the movement of products through the stores 
and gauge the effectiveness of their advertising and promotion 
programs 
earlier this year dun amp bradstreet announced it would sell five 
other operations datastream international interactive data 
neodata services zytron and petroleum information which had 
combined revenue of about 355 million last year 
datastream international is a londonbased provider of 
investment information and portfolio accounting services to clients

frances stateowned elf aquitaine signed an oil 
exploration and production accord wednesday with the soviet union 
which the companys president called the first such kremlin deal 
involving a western oil concern 
the ageement signed in moscow gives elf access to more than 
13500 square miles of soviet territory north of the caspian sea 
near the volga river loik le flochprigent told a news conference 
he said it was the first fullscale exploration and production 
deal that the soviet union has signed with a foreign oil company 
the soviet government up to now has restricted such relationships 
to technical assistance on the part of the foreign concern 
the elf president declined to say whether this meant the french 
oil company and the soviet government would be joint partners in 
the venture or whether elf had been awarded an exclusive area in 
which it could exploit oil and gas reserves 
le flochprigent said details of the agreement including the 
method of marketing the oil and gas produced remain to be worked 
out 
he said the soviets will provide manpower transport and 
communications support while elf will furnish and manage the 
technology used in the process in the same fashion that it runs 
operations in other foreign countries 
le flochprigent said he expected the agreement to lead to a 
longterm collaboration lasting 20 to 30 years and that it could 
lead to cooperation with the soviet union in other areas including 
refining chemicals and cosmetics production 
he provided no details on the financing of the exploration and 
production project

western nations have agreed to lift 
most cold warera restrictions on hightech deliveries to east 
germany officials said wednesday east germany promised the goods 
wont fall into the wrong hands 
more than 380000 soviet troops are stationed in east germany 
and washington has made clear it is not ready to lift the ban on 
many hightech goods to moscow 
east german and west german officials announced that after their 
two countries become a single economic entity on july 2 east 
germany will have access to a lot of hightech products long barred 
from the former communistrun nation 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said that as of 
that date all goods with the exception of a small category of 
highly sensitive technology can be shipped to east germany 
without export license or coordination with other members of the 
cocom group 
the decision was made in close cooperation with our partners 
in cocom haussmann said in a statement 
for the first time east germany will be able to legally obtain 
westernmade telecommunications equipment machine tools and other 
goods officials said 
cocom stands for the 17nation coordinating commitee on 
multilateral export controls which has worked together since the 
cold war days to try to keep the warsaw pact from obtaining 
products that could be used for military purposes 
the united states has previously said it has no objection to 
easing restrictions for east european countries undertaking 
democratic political reforms washington has indicated it wants to 
keep more stringent rules for the soviet union itself 
haussmann said an important goal has been achieved with the 
decision 
namely making available to the gdr east germany those 
modern investment goods and technologies that it needs so that its 
companies can compete with advanced industrial lands he said 
a spokesman for the east german government matthias gehler 
said east germany will strictly control access to the new products 
and technology and assure that there is no misuse 
the west german economics ministry said among the items that 
will still be banned for delivery to east germany are submarine 
technology and super computers 
the united states and other cocom nations have given their 
informal approval to the change the economics ministry said 
formal approval is expected at a may 29 cocom meeting in paris

many sons of famous corporate tycoons who take 
over the family business do so with trepidation thomas j watson 
jr son of longtime ibm chairman thomas j watson was no 
different 
id heard so many stories about sons of prominent men failing 
in business and i could imagine their devastation at finding 
themselves unable to fill their fathers shoes i worried id end 
up the same way watson writes in his autobiography father 
son amp co which goes on sale thursday 
needless to say watson did not fail 
watsons father had transformed international business machines 
corp from an obscure tabulating machine company to a worldwide 
powerhouse before he turned over control to his son in 1956 he 
died a few months later at age 82 
watson jr furthered ibms growth leading it into the age of 
computers an area his father originally shied away from 
the book coauthored with a fortune magazine editor peter 
petre provides a rare firsthand account of the coming of age of a 
ceo and his company central to the story is the tense relationship 
between watson and his largerthanlife father 
in public he would praise me lavisly the 76yearold 
watson writes but in private father and i had terrible fights 
that led us again and again to the brink of estrangement 
watson left ibm in 1971 after suffering a heart attack at age 
56 he later served as us ambassador to the soviet union and 
remains ibms chairman emeritus he said in a telephone interview 
that writing the book has allowed him to relive his life and to 
clarify his relationship with his father 
its a love story it is a story of a son who was terribly 
terribly fond of his father but the son didnt know how to express 
it watson said in the interview 
he was the greatest man i ever knew 
among the books insights into watson sr 
he ran ibm along the lines now associated with japanese 
companies employees sang company songs and recited company 
slogans watsons favorite motto think was emblazoned on 
posters and company newspapers along with watsons picture but 
watsons son worried that his father was creating a personality 
cult 
watson sr believed that you got the best out of employees by 
treating them with respect ibm offered the best benefits money 
could buy his son writes including education and company 
country clubs however he was tough with ibms managers often 
badgering them with obscure questions about ibms operations 
in the book watson jr describes himself as an aimless spoiled 
youth who partied his way through brown university while barely 
keeping his grades high enough to keep from being expelled 
watson decided to join ibm after college despite having little 
idea what he wanted to do with his life he went through ibms 
sales training program where he first became painfully aware of 
how hard it was to be the bosss son 
on his first sales call a corporate executive gave him a 
lecture on the difficulty of following his fathers footsteps he 
told of one such young man who became a drunk from too much high 
living and was fired by his father 
i was tempted to abandon my ibm career on the spot watson 
writes 
but he perservered and rose to become ibms top salesman after 
a lucrative account was added to his sales territory to make him 
look good the achievement won him headlines in the company 
newspaper i felt demeaned watson writes everyone knew that 
i was the old mans son and that otherwise i never could have sold 
so much in such a short time 
watson escaped the pressures of ibm and his father for several 
years by flying for the air force during world war ii but at the 
wars end he decided to return to his fathers company 
watson rose quickly and was named president in 1952 but he 
never escaped the heavy hand of his father as ibm entered a period 
of explosive growth 
i dont think my father realized how far he was pushing me 
watson writes there were times when i wondered if i was going to 
have a nervous breakdown 
in 1956 watson was preparing to sail in a yacht race when he 
was called back to new york his father was in the hospital and 
soon died 
watson ran the company on his own for five years but in 1961 
he relinquished the job of president to prepare for an eventual 
successor he kept the job of chief executive and also became 
chairman 
that period led to what watson jr calls the biggest mistake of 
his life watson believed that his younger brother dick who was 
in charge of ibms international operations would be his natural 
successor as chief executive but instead of preparing dick for the 
job outright he set him up in a competition with other executives 
dick watson ran into trouble during the launch of a computer 
line that was crucial to ibms future the project was severely 
behind schedule watson decided his brother just couldnt handle 
the job and gave it to another executive that put dick watson out 
of the running for president 
i felt nothing but shame and frustration at the way id 
treated him watson writes 
watson says he never regrets leaving ibm before retirement age 
having a heart attack made him realize how much he had been pushing 
himself 
ive never missed ibm as ibm he said in the interview 
ive just missed things to do sometimes 
watson who has six daughters and a son also doesnt regret the 
fact that none of them is involved with the company today he said 
he didnt want them to feel the pressure he felt from his father 
i dont think i ever thought of them working at ibm he said

bat industries plc reported a 39 percent gain in 
firstquarter earnings wednesday largely because of a onetime 
gain resulting from an antitakeover strategy that helped repulse a 
hostile takeover bid 
on a pretax basis the british conglomerate said earnings sank 
27 percent because of winter stormrelated claims at bats eagle 
star insurance unit 
bat said earnings for the three months ended march 31 totaled 
445 million vs 320 million in the same period a year earlier 
when there were no extraordinary items it said pretax earnings 
totaled 393 million down from 541 million 
sales rose 65 percent to 87 billion from 81 billion sales 
gains by the groups tobacco and other interests offset a slight 
overall decline in financial services the company said 
chairman patrick sheehy said the first quarter will not be 
representative of the year as a whole i expect the group to be 
able to make solid progress in what is very much a transitional 
year 
bat is completing the disposal of several large us retail 
stores including saks fifth avenue and marshall fields and the 
spinoff of its huge paper and pulp manufacturer wiggins teape 
appleton 
these were among various measures taken to fend off a hostile 
takeover from financier sir james goldsmiths hoylake investments 
group which bid 227 billion for the company last year the 
anglofrench financier and his fellow investors dropped the offer 
in april because of regulatory frustrations 
bat said its reshaping plan yielded a 243 million extraordinary 
gain in the quarter the result of the sale of its 69 percent 
interest in vg instruments plc 
the figures were converted at the current exchange rate of 170 
to the pound

a judge has approved a 13 million 
settlement for shareholders of smithkline beckman corp who sued 
the company last year after it announced a merger with the beecham 
group plc 
the 13 million will be paid to shareholders of smithkline who 
held shares between april 10 1989 when the merger was first 
announced and july 26 1989 when the deal was consummated and 
smithkline beecham was formed 
the approval by common pleas court judge i raymond kremer on 
tuesday will benefit about 25000 shareholders 
dianne m nast one of several attorneys representing 
shareholders in the case said distribution of the proceeds would 
begin in 30 days if no appeals are filed the 13 million will be 
prorated based on the number of shares held by each member of the 
class 
nearly two dozen attorneys representing the shareholders will 
share a separate 19 million as reimbursement for their services 
in the case nast said 
beginning on april 12 1989 nine lawsuits were filed against 
smithkline beckman its officers and directors and beecham group 
the cases were later consolidated 
the suits alleged that smithkline has engaged in conduct which 
has been detrimental to its shareholders 
among the allegations in the suits were accusations that the 
individual defendants had failed in their duty to seek potential 
buyers for smithkline at a higher price than that offered by 
beecham

general electric on wednesday announced 
a settlement of its 115 billion breachofcontract suit against 
daimlerbenz the west german technology giant working with both ge 
and its fiercest us rival in designing jet engines 
ges lawsuit claimed that daimlers new alliance with pratt amp 
whitney a division of united technologies corp breached an 
agreement it already had with ge to develop highthrust engines for 
jumbo jets 
under the settlement currently pending in us district court 
in new york motoren und turbinen union the aerospace division of 
daimlerbenz will be free to continue its cooperation with pratt amp 
whitney on the highthrust pw4000 engine ge said in a press 
release 
in return daimlerbenz and mtu agreed to drop out of ges 
parallel venture the development of the ge90 engine ge said 
daimlerbenz also agreed to return to ge any trade secrets it has 
gained so far from its cooperation in the ge90 program and to keep 
confidential all other proprietary information it has gained from 
cooperating with ge 
daimlerbenz also agreed to renegotiate its contract with ge 
under which the companies cooperate in designing smaller engines to 
power most large commercial aircraft such as the boeing 747 and the 
mcdonnell douglas md11 
ge said the renegotiation of that contract will provide it with 
significant additional revenues from the sales of engines and 
parts 
ge spokesman george jamison would not estimate the value of the 
renegotiation david franus an aerospace industry analyst for 
forecast international in newtown conn said the renegotiation 
could be worth as much as 500 million to ge over the next 15 years 
that arrangement gives ge a partner in what is now the most 
lucrative slice of the jet engine industry most large commercial 
aircraft are powered by engines that range in power from 50000 
pounds of thrust to 75000 
but the industrys giants are scrambling to develop larger 
highthrust engines to power the bigger wider commercial aircraft 
of the future and the settlement leaves ge without a partner in 
that venture 
it still comes with that slap in the face that for engines 
over 75000 pounds of thrust ge has lost a longtime partner 
franus said ge is going to have to scramble to find other 
partners 
another industry analyst paul turk of virginiabased avmark 
said ge faces only minimal risk of losing trade secrets to pratt amp 
whitney 
thats a shortterm concern he said these things change 
twice a week 
he said most of the inside information from ge that would be of 
value to pratt amp whitney would be financial rather than 
technological and would probably not differ significantly from 
pratt amp whitneys own information 
utc spokesman dan harrison said the hartfordbased company would 
have no comment on the lawsuit in which it was not a party he 
added that utc and daimlerbenz are still working out the details 
of their alliance 
when ge first filed the lawsuit harrison said neither utc nor 
pratt amp whitney needs wants or would accept confidential ge 
information

wheat futures prices closed mostly lower while 
corn and soybeans advanced modestly in quiet trading wednesday on 
the chicago board of trade 
traders were cautious amid the uncertainty over future sales of 
us grain to china and the soviet union 
the bush administration is expected to announce soon whether it 
will renew chinas favorable trade status analysts say economic 
woes in the soviet union could force moscow to reduce grain imports 
the two nations are among the largest foreign buyers of us 
agricultural products 
pessimism about export sales was offset in the corn and soybean 
markets though by reports of more rain in the midwest heavy 
precipitation during the past two weeks has slowed the pace of corn 
and soybean planting and further delays could affect crop yields 
especially for corn 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 333 a bushel corn 
futures were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with july at 275 a 
bushel oat futures were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with july at 
151 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with

running big blue is an even tougher job today 
concedes former chairman thomas j watson jr 
watson details the challenges of his 15 years at the helm of 
international business machines corp in his newly released 
autobiography father son amp co 
in an interview with the associated press he said the demands 
of the job have grown considerably for current ibm chief john f 
akers 
i had real trouble managing 7 billion in annual revenue 
and hes managing 70 billion watson said 
another fundamental change the company has shifted its focus 
from rentals to sales watson said 
in 1956 when watson took over from his father thomas j 
watson nearly all of ibms machines were rented by selling 
oneyear rental and maintenance contracts instead of the machines 
themselves ibm was guaranteed a steady annual revenue stream 
watson said 
with rental you didnt have to sell anything as long as you 
kept them customers satisfied then you got the same rental this 
year as next year he said it makes for a much steadier 
financial base 
but that comforting arrangement was challenged by an antitrust 
suit filed by the federal government in 1952 settling the suit 
required ibm to start selling some of its machines recalled 
watson who retired from ibm in 1971 watson says the computer 
industry has changed dramatically since his departure one of the 
most profound changes is the miniaturization of electronic 
components that culminated in the development of microprocessors 
or computers on a silicon chip which werent commercially 
available until several years after watson left ibm 
it was thrilling for me to see us move into electronics but i 
had never any idea that somebody could give me something an eighth 
of an inch square and maybe an inch long and say that could store a 
400page book he said describing a device he was shown on a 
recent visit to an ibm facility 
watson says he has full confidence in ibms current management 
despite the companys lower profits of recent years and increasing 
competition from upstart competitors but he says hes glad he left 
the business when he did 
perhaps the industry was the best at the time to be in he 
said of his tenure ten years earlier it wouldnt have been an 
industry and 20 years later it would have been terribly difficult 
as it is today

that doesnt mean the summer bargaining will be a cakewalk

resolutions laying an agenda for the unions three bargaining 
committees talks between the union and general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp open in july the contracts expire 
sept 14 
officials of each of the big three automakers declined to 
comment wednesday on specific uaw bargaining positions 
uaw president owen bieber outlined five priorities for the

said auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co in new york 
i think they have finally come to grips with the reality of the 
situation the degree of competition that exists in the automotive 
world and particularly in the united states 
during the 1980s the role of the big three on the worlds 
automotive stage changed drastically mostly because competition 
from japanbased automakers eroded their dominance as the 
companies roles changed so did the uaws 
membership in the nations largest industrial union dropped from 
a peak of about 15 million in the mid1970s to about 1 million 
today the uaws leadership in the us labor movement 
particularly in setting model contracts for other heavy industries 
has eroded 
consequently the general priorities of the uaw have changed 
from wages and benefits to job security 
clearly there is one key issue and thats job security 
said auto analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc 
in new york 
job securitys emergence as the no 1 bargaining issue was no 
surprise at the convention monday and tuesday 
fact number one is that we have a more urgent need for job 
security and a more legitimate claim to job and income security for 
our members than at any previous time in our history bieber 
said monday 
current contracts with the uaw permit plant closings only when 
products made at the factory suffer a sales slump gm and chrysler 
have used that clause to justify closing eight assembly plants and 
laying off 17000 employees during the past three years 
we must compel them automakers to retain all current workers 
unless their ability to survive is severely at risk as a result of 
conditions beyond their control bieber said in a speech to the 
convention 
just what causes such a financial hardship may be a bone of 
contention in itself said brady the oppenheimer analyst 
keeping a plant operating when its not productive is a 
financial hardship he said i think the more enlightened 
members of the union have said the only real way to job security is 
to get the consumer to demand our product 
uaw bargainers also are going to have to pay attention to the 
446000 retirees carried on pension rolls most of the debate at 
the uaw convention centered on providing costofliving 
adjustments or colas for retirees 
the proposal puts bieber and the uaw leadership in a tough spot 
members are demanding it but bieber knows as automakers have 
said that colas for retirees are extremely expensive some 
estimates put the cost at more than 1 billion a year for the big 
three 
if such a proposal were adopted other contractual benefits 
would be cut some have contended 
bieber told delegates he didnt want bargaining committees 
handcuffed by proposing a costofliving adjustment as the only 
inflation hedge for retirees 
auto analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co said he was 
optimistic about the upcoming contract talks 
what struck me about the demands is that never before have we 
had so much potential for easy agreement when it comes to 
pension he said i think management will give some kind of 
inflation protection some kind of lumpsum payment 
he said the atmosphere at the convention modified his thought of 
a month or so ago that a uaw strike was more likely this year than 
in recent years 
the leadership ultimately has to be responsive to the rank and 
file merlis said and with the lack of dissidents the odds of 
a meaningful strike become much less likely

gold futures prices tumbled to sevenmonth lows wednesday on new 
yorks commodity exchange amid frantic selling prompted by a cash 
sale of an estimated 10 to 30 tons of the metal by middle eastern 
interests 
the plunge of more than 11 an ounce shook the confidence of 
investors who had begun returning to the gold market aftr being 
burned by a similar but even steeper drop two months ago 
on other commodity markets crude oil futures fell sharply pork 
futures plummeted and grain and soybean futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 1180 to 1310 lower in new york with 
the contract for delivery in june at 36460 a troy ounce the 
lowest settlement of a nearmonth contract since oct 13

commodity exchange with may at 523 a troy ounce platinum futures 
settled 630 to 670 lower on the new york mercantile exchange 
with july at 49820 a troy ounce 
the large middle eastern sell order which some analysts believe 
originated in jidda saudi arabia coincided with the opening of 
the london gold market and triggered so much sympathetic selling 
that dealers were unable to agree on a morning price fix until 
nearly 2 hours after trading began 
like the march 26 event which involved a sale of an estimated 
94 to 125 tons the middle eastern order seemed designed to shock 
the market possibly to abort a fledgling rally gold prices rose 
about 5 an ounce last week and gained more than 2 tuesday 
im not so sure it was done because they needed to sell but 
because they needed to drive the market said john jonat a gold 
trader with deak international inc a large currency and precious 
metal dealer 
but other analysts said the sale may have been prompted by a 
need for cash to buy arms 
investment interest in gold has been notably slack since the 
march 26 collapse but the markets recent strength appeared to 
again be attracting the public sector 
yesterday they began to get some faith again but that shifted 
today very quickly said bette raptopoulos a metals analyst 
with prudentialbache securities inc 
crude oil prices crumbled in frenzied trading on the new york 
merc amid concern that continued opec overproduction could lead to

greyhound lines inc is rolling but with mounting 
financial problems and an unresolved strike bankruptcy court could 
be the bus companys next stop 
with its nearly 3monthold drivers strike eating up cash 
reserves the company is struggling to pay bills and is about 60 
days behind in most payments 
it needs an immediate infusion of cash to buy back junk bonds 
from investors at a deep discount and reduce expenses 
the question is who steps up to the plate said one 
analyst speaking on condition of anonymity banks are very 
cautious i dont think the union problems will go away i dont 
think the bondholders are going to roll over and play dead 
p anthony lannie greyhounds executive vice president 
answered wednesday therere lots of very wealthy investors that 
are interested in investing in small companies that they can earn a 
good return on a number of those are very sophisticated about 
unions and the risks inherent in our particular situation 
lannie said the company is meeting with various investors to 
line up financing for the bond buyback announced monday 
greyhound said it would purchase up to 85 percent of the face 
value of 225 million worth of highyield debt at steep discounts 
one of the conditions of the offer however was obtaining 
financing plus additional working capital 
lannie said greyhound figures it needs to borrow between 125 
million and 150 million to swing the deal although he points out 
that the company is committed to repurchasing only 51 percent of 
the bonds 
without the refinancing the company likely will be forced to 
seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court because of 
losses from a bus drivers walkout that began march 2 chairman 
fred g currey estimates the strike will end up costing greyhound 
between 75 million and 100 million 
greyhound lost 56 million in the first quarter and last week 
missed a 975 million interest payment on its most senior debt 
combined with its failure to make about 5 million in lease 
payments at the end of april the company has opened the door for 
creditors to begin the process of forcing it into bankruptcy such 
a move could come as early as june 14 although the company says 
its bondholders have not indicated they will demand payment 
lannie said he believes about 70 percent of the bonds are held 
by investors who purchased them in secondary markets meaning that 
the companys offer of 54 cents or 275 cents on the dollar 
represents a fair profit on their investments 
some analysts question whether so many of the bonds have been 
sold by their original investors who are unlikely to be happy with 
the prices offered 
greyhounds chances are further clouded by a finding this month 
by an official with the national labor relations board who said 
the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by implementing a 
contract on the day the union walked out 
the finding plus the unions offer tuesday to return to work 
sets the stage for a legal battle that could end with the company 
being forced to rehire union drivers and pay 10 million a month in 
back wages 
greyhound has been operating at reduced levels since the strike 
using newly hired drivers plus crossovers earlier this month 
currey said the strike had become irrelevant because greyhound had 
enough drivers to operate 
on tuesday greyhound said it had reached its highest level of 
ridership since the strike began as it carried 91666 passengers 
or 80 percent of the same day last year the company is nearing the 
end of a twoweek halfprice fare promotion that it credits for 
the surge in ridership 
whatever financing greyhound ends up with will almost certainly 
come from a private placement with an investor demanding a 
lucrative return for the risk lannie said 
theyre going to want somewhere between 25 and 30 percent 
return he said and how they get it will be a matter for their 
creativity 
he did not rule out giving up equity in the company as an 
enticement for new money and most analysts expect an investor to 
demand equity in the company some suggest currey will not be able 
to retain his position as chairman 
the type of ideal would be someone whos willing to make a 
loan at an aggressive interest rate but also with a big equity 
kicker said leigh walzer at rd smith amp co in new york no 
ones going to do this as a straight coupon investment 
greyhound already has been turned down by one equity holder 
greyhound dial corp of phoenix its original owner 
the bus company was created three years ago when an investor 
group led by currey paid greyhound corp as it was then called 
270 million for its bus operations 
lannie said the bus company had made a direct request to 
greyhound dial but was turned down

gold prices plunged worldwide wednesday 
reaching a sevenmonth low in domestic trading as reports of heavy 
mideast selling brought chaos to the morning fixing session in 
london and triggered a sympathetic selloff in the united states 
the dollar meanwhile ended mixed against major foreign 
currencies after falling slightly overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold tumbled 1150 to 
settle at 36410 a troy ounce after losing about 11 an ounce in 
europe gold had been as low as 360 an ounce on the exchange 
before rebounding somewhat 
republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
36395 an ounce down 1055 from late tuesday 
the last time gold was near the 364 level was in october 
according to william oneill research director at elders futures 
inc 
market watchers said golds nose dive was triggered by one huge 
sell order from saudi arabia they said the saudis are believed to 
have sold between 10 tons and 30 tons of gold and some speculated 
that the proceeds may be earmarked for arms purchases from britian 
the saudis also are believed to have been responsible for a 
similar sharp drop in gold prices two months ago according to 
analysts and traders 
bernard savaiko a senior metals analyst for painewebber inc 
said gold had been overbought in recent weeks though and traders 
were preparing for a correction of sorts 
because of the lack of buyers the large sell order had a 
profound impact on gold prices savaiko said 
the saudi sale resulted in an order imbalance in europe and 
ultimately brought chaos to the morning london fixing session the 
five leading london dealers that set the fixing spent a nearrecord 
2 hours trying to set a price after having trouble matching demand 
and supply the fixing was finally set at 36325 a troy ounce 
the fixing often used as a guideline for traders is an average 
price calculated twice a day based on market demand 
nobody had a chance to get out of positions during the 
fixing said a zurich dealer and no business was possible 
dealers said market sentiment was that gold eventually had to 
fall back after approaching the 378anounce level but as one 
dealer in zurich explained this decline wasnt predictable 
trading was more subdued in foreign exchange activity was 
diminishing with the approach of thursdays ascension day holiday 
in continental europe and mondays memorial day holiday in the 
united states monday also is a public holiday in britain 
traders said technical factors were largely responsible for the 
dollars movement wednesday 
in the spotlight again was the canadian dollar which has been 
under pressure in recent days canadas progressive conservative 
government was thrown into turmoil after a senior cabinet minister 
resigned amid growing doubts about the future of a constitutional 
reform package 
the canadian dollar did regain some strength wednesday in europe 
and new york 
in tokyo where the global trading day begins the dollar fell 
105 yen to a closing 15135 yen it traded at 15090 yen in 
london and at 15145 yen in new york up from 15125 yen tuesday 
the dollar was weaker against the british pound compared to 
tuesday sterling rose to 16975 from 16915 in london and to 
16940 from 16930 in new york 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
tuesdays quotes included 16760 west german marks up from 
167315 14175 swiss francs down from 141765 56400 french

secretary of state james a baker iii laying 
groundwork for the expected renewal of trade benefits to china 
said wednesday that human rights should not be the only factor 
in such a decision 
the real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide 
youre not going to extend it baker told a white house news 
conference 
he said ending chinas mostfavorednation status as many in 
congress are suggesting would harm significant and substantial 
us economic interests 
administration and congressional sources said bush would 
formally announce his decision to extend the trade benefits to 
beijing for one year on thursday 
even before the announcement the move has provoked angry 
outcries from congressional critics who consider bush too 
accomodating toward the current regime in beijing 
although he stopped short of actually announcing bushs 
decision baker rattled off a list of reasons to justify extension 
of the preferential trade status 
you should consider the effect of this upon the reformers in 
the chinese government people that want to take china toward more 
openness and toward more democratization you ought to consider i 
would think the effect on some very significant and substantial 
economic interests that the united states has the effect on hong 
kong baker said 
mostfavorednation status gives china the same trade benefits 
including lowestpossible tariffs that the united states extends 
to its major trading partners 
supporters of extending the mostfavorednation status 
frequently cite chinas connection to hong kong 
the freemarket enclave on the coast of south china now under 
british control serves as a middleman between much of the trade 
between the united states and china 
some 85 billion in hong kongs exports to the united states 
each year are actually products made in china and would be 
subject to sharply higher tariffs if the trade benefits are 
withdrawn 
at the same time baker cited a disappointing lack of 
progress on human rights since the june 4 1989 tiananmen square 
crackdown 
however he said the administration welcomed chinas release 
recently of 211 detainees the lifting of martial law in tibet 
and what he called a general indication of willingness to take 
steps such as that 
but baker said you ought not to draw that type of linkage 
the real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide that 
youre not going to extend it and what are the consquences of 
terminating it 
thats the way you ought to look at this not so much what 
has been done in the one year period since tiananamen although 
thats one of the factors it should not be the only factor 
the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asia postponed a 
hearing that had been planned for wednesday to explore chinas 
trade status with richard solomon an assistant secretary of state 
the hearing was rescheduled for thursday afternoon 
the office of subcommittee chairman steven solarz dny said 
the administration asked for the postponement because they werent 
ready to testify on the issue

nearly 9000 fourslice toasters will be 
replaced because a defective switch poses a fire hazard or could 
burn or severely shock users the manufacturer said wednesday 
toastmaster inc of columbia mo told the consumer product 
safety commission it will replace 8857 of its model d126t toasters

result of switch failure the commission said in a written 
statement 
the chromebased toasters were manufactured and sold nationwide 
between april and june 1989 the toastmaster name appears on a 
black and silver nameplate in the lower righthand corner of each 
toaster 
consumers should also check the crumb tray at the bottom of the 
toaster for a fiveletter and digit date code enumerated from el101 
to el158 
the cpsc said no other toastmaster products were involved in the 
recall

the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange said wednesday they have reached a tentative 
agreement to share an electronic trading system 
the announcement by the worlds two biggest commodity exchanges 
came one day after the merc announced japanese government approval 
of its proposed globex electronic trading system 
japanese participation is perceived as the linchpin of globex 
which would allow traders to buy and sell certain financial futures 
even when the exchange itself is closed 
globex is a joint venture of the merc and londonbased reuters 
holdings plc which is supplying the computer terminals and other 
technology through its worldwide marketinformation network 
the board of trade has been developing a separate electronic 
trading system called aurora 
the exchanges didnt make clear if the tentative agreement would 
produce a single electronic exchange or establish links between the 
two systems 
the exchanges began talking a year ago about the possibility of 
offering both trading systems on the same terminals to reduce costs 
for the exchanges and for traders who want access to both systems 
the exchanges said committees of technical and legal 
representatives had been formed to hammer out a formal agreement 
the system could begin operating by november they said

of last years 5514 million loss and the rejection of a takeover 
offer from another utility holding company 
some of the more than 1000 shareholders who packed a hotel 
ballroom for the annual meeting also voiced anger over the 
companys suspension last october of quarterly stock dividends 
two of about 20 who reached microphones after the conclusion of 
business remembered the promise of vice president henry b sargent 
at last years meeting that dividends were safe 
we have a chief financial officer who earns 300000 a year 
keeps the books and who is so inept that he cant do the job 
properly i ask that you fire him summarily shareholder peter 
ranke told new chief executive and chairman richard snell 
others called for the resignations of directors keith turley 
who retired as ceo feb 5 and carl eller whose expansion of 
circle k corp drove the conveniencestore chain to file for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection may 15 eller resigned as circle 
ks chairman and ceo eight days before the filing 
turley left the room after the meeting without commenting but 
eller told reporters he had no intention of resigning 
i have been on the board a long time and i have contributed 
as much as i can he said 
snell was booed and called a liar for defending the credentials 
of directors one shareholder yelled out from the audience fire 
snell 
the chairman said he could not ask directors to resign because 
they were elected by shareholders 
formal business was completed quickly approval of minutes the 
reelection of incumbent directors and rejection of a shareholder 
proposal to force board members to hold at least 2000 shares of 
pinnacle west stock 
the proposal received only 14 percent approval company officers 
said 
jeanne rossi of boonville calif who offered the idea said it 
would instill loyalty in a board she called mediocre at best 
snell told reporters later that he expected most of the 
criticism but was surprised by the sniping at sargent who is 
respected in the utility industry and at the salaries and 
retirement packages of top management 
its easy to look at those numbers and be affronted by them 
but it is almost impossible to attract the people you need without 
a golden parachute and if you dont have it the headhunters come 
and take them away he said 
snell defended the companys rejection tuesday of a fourth 
takeover offer from pacificorp as inadequate the portland 
orebased utility offered 21 a share or 182 billion a premium 
of more than 25 percent of the market price 
complaints about tuesdays rejection reflected more on the 
effectiveness of a 200000 pacificorp advertising campaign than 
the offer itself he said 
in his address to shareholders snell acknowledged problems from 
a fiveyear expansion that saw the company acquire uraniummining 
realestate and banking subsidiaries but said the company was on a 
clear path to recovery he noted the company recently sold a 
resort and is close to finishing the sale of its unprofitable 
malapai resource co mining subsidiary 
pinnacle wests 1986 purchase of merabank the states largest 
thrift nearly proved pinnacle wests undoing snell said merabank 
lost more than 200 million in 1988 and 1989 federal regulators 
took it over in january and required pinnacle west to infuse 465 
million into the thrift before cutting ties to it 
snell also acknowledged problems with the palo verde nuclear 
generating station owned by the companys chief subsidiary 
arizona public service co the threereactor plant operated at only 
24 percent of capacity last year 
snell said he plans to operate palo verde efficiently raise 
morale at aps contain costs and improve relations with the arizona 
corporation commission which regulates aps 
it may be three years before dividends are restored snell said 
however a stronger performance should strengthen the companys 
stock price he said

health secretary louis sullivan plans to ask 
states to ban cigarette vending machines and take other action to 
limit sales to youth government sources said wednesday 
sullivan was to present his proposal at a senate finance 
committee hearing thursday said the sources who spoke on the 
condition they not be identified 
it will be a proposal for the states to review and decide 
upon and sullivan will not propose new federal legislation said 
one source 
another source said the secretary will propose that retailers be 
licensed to sell cigarettes 
fortyfour states and the district of columbia prohibit the sale 
of cigarettes to children but the laws are widely unenforced 
on may 16 the senate labor and human resources committee 
approved a 110 million program aimed at encouraging states to 
enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes to minors including 
restrictions on vending machines the bush administration in 
february called the legislation unnecessary 
a study in this weeks issue of the journal of the american 
medical association estimated annual cigarette sales to youths 
under age 18 at 947 million packs and revenues at 123 billion 
about 33 percent of all tobacco sales 
nearly 19 percent of high school seniors smoke daily 11 
percent of them more than a half pack per day according to an 
annual survey of high school seniors by the national institute on 
drug abuses annual survey of high school seniors 
surveys have also shown that the vast majority of adult smokers 
started in their teen years 
sullivan has made antismoking issues one of his top priorities 
at the department of health and human services 
in january he took on rj reynolds tobacco co for planning to 
test market a cigarette aimed primarily at blacks saying the 
company was promoting a culture of cancer the next day 
reynolds canceled its plans 
then he called on professional athletes to turn away the blood 
money from cigarette companies that sponsor sporting events 
more recently lawmakers were wondering if sullivan had changed 
his views on smoking when his assistant secretary for health james 
mason canceled his appearance at a congressional hearing on 
cigarette exports reportedly at the direction of the white house 
but sullivan said one of his top priorities remains to 
eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as 
intended causes death 
cigarettes the department says cause about 390000 premature 
deaths annually from lung cancer heart disease and other 
cardiovascular disorders

britains midland bank plc is 
establishing a 15 billion fund of brazilian bank debt to swap for 
equity in state companies to be privatized by the government 
officials said 
wednesdays announcement by nicholas reade midlands 
representative in brazil came during a conference on 
privatizations organized by the british embassy in the capital 
the fund to be sponsored by several foreign banks would be 
ready by july and in operation in september reade said 
chase manhattan corp and the bank of tokyo are discussing 
becoming sponsors of the fund and negotiations with other banks 
that have loans to brazil are continuing he said 
midland is the countrys largest british creditor with about 2 
billion in loans brazil owes about 62 billion to commercial banks 
worldwide and has a total foreign debt of 114 billion 
loan commitments made by the banks to the fund will be counted 
at the original loans face value but debtforequity trades will 
be negotiated with a discounting of the debts value expected he 
said most of brazils bank debt sells for less than half its face 
value on the open market 
the government which has announced a wideranging privatization 
program to cut a bloated public deficit has considered selling off 
most of the almost 200 staterun enterprises these enterprises 
have a combined deficit of 62 billion 
reade said the idea of creating a fund to participate in the 
process of privatizing brazilian state firms came about because of 
the volume of capital needed which no bank could provide alone 
we prefer to unite our resources at the start of the process 
rather than create unions afterwards he said 
another reason was the success of a similar fund organized by 
midland in argentina in which 12 large creditor banks 
participated he said

the house by a wide margin approved sweeping 
clean air legislation late wednesday requiring tougher pollution 
controls for factories automobiles and electric power plants 
the bill the first revamping of federal air pollution controls 
in 13 years now must be reconciled with a similar senate version 
approved in april before going to president bush for his signature 
the final vote was 40121 
the way was cleared for house passage after daylong closeddoor 
negotiations led to a compromise easing a requirement for 
alternatefuel cars the agreement erased the last obstacle to the 
bill which had been approved by the energy and commerce committee 
six weeks ago 
while clean air legislation over the years has been one of the 
most contentious issues before congress the broadreaching bill 
moved through floor action in less than two days most of the 
thorniest issues had been resolved in committee or closeddoor 
negotations 
like the senate version the bill imposes tougher air pollution 
controls on automobiles and industry including curbs on acid rain 
precursors from electric power plants and toxic industrial 
chemicals the costs of the legislation to the economic has been 
put at more than 215 billion by the bush administration when all 
provisions go into effect 
the vote approving the compromise on alternatefuel cars was 
40515 
under the agreement rep henry waxman dcalif chief backer 
of the bill agreed to abandon a proposal requiring automakers to 
build 1 million cars annually that burn fuels other than gasoline 
instead the production of such cars would be limited to a 
pilot program of up to 300000 for the los angeles area which 
has the nations worst smog by 1997 emission controls on fleet 
vehicles and urban buses also would be toughened for many cities 
with major smog problems 
the last remaining issue has now been resolved declared 
rep norman lent rny senior republican on the energy and 
commerce committee on the house floor 
the house has struggled months to pass the sweeping clean air 
bill which will impose tougher air pollution controls on 
automobiles and industry including curbs on acid rain precursors 
from electric power plants and toxic industrial chemicals the 
costs of the legislation to the economy has been put at more than 
215 billion by the bush administration 
the senate passed a bill similar to the one before the house 
last april differences between the two bills have to be worked out 
in a conference committee of members from the house and senate 
before anything is laid before the president for signing into law 
among other differences is the absence of any clean car 
provision in the senate bill 
waxmans original clean car amendment would have applied to 
nine cities with the worst smog problem los angeles chicago san 
diego milwaukee houston baltimore philadelphia new york city 
and hartford conn 
negotiations continued most of the day to find ways to 
accommodate waxman who argued that his proposal for the mandatory 
production of 1 million cars was little more what president bush 
had suggested a year ago the white house has since abandoned 
mandatory production requirements 
the auto industry had vigorously fought the measure and had on 
their side rep john dingell dmich the powerful chairman of the 
energy and commerce committee whose district includes ford motor 
co headquarters 
dingell calling the waxman proposal the most contentuous 
issue faced by the house announced the compromise on the house 
floor 
earlier the house by a 274146 vote approved a 250 million 
financial aid package over five years to help workers who lose 
their jobs because of tougher air pollution controls 
the jobloss relief measure came despite strong opposition from 
the white house as bush administration officials argued the measure 
could be many times more expensive than expected 
the plan would extend unemployment compensation for an 
additional six months and provide retraining assistance at a cost 
of 50 million a year for workers displaced by tighter air 
pollution requirements 
unlike a proposal defeated in the senate it would provide 
relief to workers in all industries and not just coal miners but 
the assistance is considerably more modest said rep bob wise 
dwva sponsor of the measure 
i think its a matter of simple justice argued rep gerry 
sikorski dminn 
the worker assistance amendment was aimed primarily at helping 
an estimated 5000 coal miners who may lose their jobs to tougher 
acid rain provisions in the legislation 
wise however emphasized that the financial aid would apply to 
all industries critics of the bill have argued that there could be 
widespread unemployment in some industries if plants close because 
of tougher standards 
lent said the measure holds the environmental bill hostage to 
labor protection the bush administration is expected to push to 
delete the provision when differences between the house and senate 
bills are negotiated later this year 
white house chief of staff john sununu and william reilly head 
of the environmental protection agency wrote house leaders that 
such assistance would create a potentially openended liability 
for the government because it would be impossible to determine when 
a worker loses employment because of clean air legislation 
meanwhile the house put its formal approval on a series of 
compromise amendments 
a provision requiring cleaner gasoline blends in cities with 
the worst pollution the oil industry opposed the tougher emission 
standards arguing they will require use of gasolineethanol blends 
a requirement for the environmental protection agency to 
develop new regional visibility regulations within two years for 
many national parks and wilderness areas 
a requirement that offshore oil platforms off the california 
coast and elsewhere outside the gulf of mexico adhere to federal 
air pollution regulations to please oil state congressmen 
platforms in the gulf of mexico where most offshore oil is 
drilled were exempted 
a mandatory phaseout of chemicals such as chlorofluorcarbons 
or cfcs as well as a number of substitutes 
a requirement that automakers provided expanded warranties up 
to eight years and 80000 miles on pollution control devices
