the 9yearold son of a zimbabwean diplomat 
who had been accused of abusing the boy has been returned to his 
native land according to a published report 
us officials said terence karamba left new york for zimbabwe 
on sunday accompanied by a zimbabwean social worker but was not 
to be returned to his fathers custody the washington post 
reported in tuesdays editions 
the boy was to be placed in foster care under the auspices of 
the courts and the zimbabwean ministry of social welfare said 
robert j mcmahon director of the social services agency that had 
cared for the boy for the past two months 
mcmahon executive director of st christopherottile services 
for children and families said the karamba family would undergo 
counseling in hopes of eventually being reunited with terence 
with any of these cases theres always a lump at the bottom 
of your stomach but i think the level of risk is as low as you can 
possibly get it mcmahon told the newspaper 
a city agency had charged that the boys father floyd had 
beaten the boy and the child in december was removed from his home 
and placed in foster care 
the father who served for more than a year as a member of 
zimbabwes delegation to the united nations was ordered to leave 
the united states because of what state department officials called 
clear evidence of child abuse 
in january the supreme court refused to block the us 
government from sending the boy home after the legal aid societys 
juvenile rights division had argued that the boy was afraid to go 
home 
mcmahon said sen daniel patrick moynihan dny interceded 
and persuaded the state department that the boy should not be 
returned immediately 
we received what we asked for which was time to work with the 
boy said gary kipling a st christopherottilie official who 
served as terences foster father part of the time 
the state department had a psychiatric consultant accompany the 
boy on his trip home and also engaged a law firm in zimbabwe to 
monitor his case the post reported

prince andrew and his pregnant wife sarah 
lingered over a museum incubator but declined to cuddle the kicking 
mechanical infant inside monday the fourth day of a 10day trade 
trip by the royal entourage 
the couple awoke aboard the 416foot royal yacht britannia 
beneath typically british gray skies with rain stalking their 
motorcade to a museum department store and a supermarket sojourn 
described as a first royal visit to an american supermarket 
it was retail day for the duke and duchess of york 
the day began with andrew welcoming top us executives for an 
investment seminar on the royal yacht aimed at attracting american 
money to britain the couple then went ashore 
the incubator was the final stop on the royal couples walk 
through the los angeles county museum of science and industry 
which also included a tour of an exhibit on british technology 
despite repeated entreaties from a british photographer sarah 
wouldnt pick up the kicking pink babe dubbed samantha by the 
exhibitors 
can you believe them she asked her guides laughing at the 
jostling crowd of newsmen kept in check by a chain barrier and us 
state department security guards the duchess is expecting a child 
in august 
at the vons pavilions market a deluxe hightech supermarket in 
suburban arcadia the duchess tasted coffeetoffeechip ice cream 
and turned up her nose at a corn dog and both she and the prince 
tried their hand at cake decorating as they cruised the aisles 
earlier andrew told us executives that angloamerican 
business bonds are as important as historical and cultural ties 
britain wants american investments the duke of york said during 
a brief appearance before 80 delegates attending a daylong 
investment seminar aboard the royal yacht britannia which included 
a fivehour luncheon cruise 
greetings from queen elizabeth ii were relayed by sir paul 
greening chairman of the royal household 
the queen says she hopes you have a worthwhile day the queen 
has personally chosen what youll have for lunch today said 
greening who didnt divulge the menu 
the economic ties between our two nations are no less 
important than our cultural ones andrew said 
there were delegates from such companies as hewlettpackard 
hughes aircraft ford motor co apple computers and lockheed 
aircraft among them was henry termeer of bostonbased genzyme a 
biotechnology firm 
its definitely a public relations ploy to create good will i 
think its an excellent idea every european country does this sort 
of thing but not every country has a royal family with a ship like 
this said termeer 
the days events also included a visit to bullocks wilshire 
department store which was touting british goods 
celebrities michael york morgan fairchild and roddy mcdowell 
and hundreds of store employees were among those who greeted the 
royal couples arrival at the posh art deco landmark 
at one point during the tour the duchess scanned the first 
floor vestibule and was asked by a guest if she was looking for her 
husband who had gone ahead no i see him every day sarah 
replied 
monday evening the royal couple took a moonlit stroll through 
the lush wetherly gardens at the four seasons hotel in los angeles 
the cocktail party was tossed by british consul general donald

when cara dunne listened to broadcasters narrate 
the olympic skiing events she recalled the thrill of winning her 
own medals last month at international games for the disabled 
the 17yearold chicagoan was blinded by cancer as a baby after 
years of training she won two silver medals in the 1988 winter 
olympic games for the disabled in innsbruck austria 
miss dunne a senior at william howard taft high school on the 
northwest side said she feels every bit an olympian 
in the opening ceremonies when you march in with your 
teammates you feel so proud because you are representing your 
country she said 
miss dunne said the olympic coverage from calgary reminded her 
of her own triumphs and defeats 
when people are falling you can relate to them said miss 
dunne she said she lost the gold in austria because she slipped in 
the second run of the giant slalom 
basically you work all your life for the goals you set when 
you are competing you feel an enormous amount of pressure she 
said 
but when the race is over you feel this great spirit i think 
that is what the olympics whether ablebodied or disabled is 
all about 
miss dunnes parents started teaching her to ski when she was 7 
when we got into skiing i looked at it as a chance for 
cara to prove to her friends and her schoolmates that she is just 
as capable as they are said her stepfather richard zabelski 
zabelski a lawyer has been her guide skiing in front of miss 
dunne yelling directions 
initially i was trying to get the attention of a new 
stepchild he said now we are strictly training for success 
prior to the latest competition miss dunne and zabelski trained 
full time for about six weeks he pays for most of the training 
because disabled athletes are not sponsored by the government and 
landing corporate sponsors is tough 
miss dunne the youngest member of the disabled olympic ski 
team said she has won nine medals in international competition 
she said she received an acceptance letter from harvard 
university last week so i dont know how much time ill have for 
training 
but she is already looking forward to the 1992 games when the 
disabled and ablebodied winter olympics will be held 
simultaneously in albertville france

a roman catholic high school wrestling 
team is traveling to the soviet union this week to compete against 
soviet athletes in what school officials have dubbed an 
experiment in glasnost 
the sacred heart high school team is apparently the first roman 
catholic group officially welcomed to the soviet union to compete 
said the rev philip j cascia the schools chaplain and wrestling 
coach 
the soviets are very conscious of their image he said 
this could be a very positive statement from them that they are 
willing to take steps toward more openness 
one team member is gary shvartsbeyn a 16yearold soviet jew 
who immigrated to the united states in 1980 shvartsbeyn says the 
trip will be a chance for him to avoid the severe travel 
restrictions he faced when he lived in the soviet union 
id just like to see something in russia i never saw before 
said shvartsbeyn a native of the village of donetzk in the ukraine 
the 30 wrestlers are set to leave wednesday the team which had 
a disappointing 222 record this season has scheduled three 
matches with soviet wrestling clubs one at the olympic village in 
moscow and two at the sports complex in leningrad 
also making the trip are 20 honor students from sacred heart 
along with 37 coaches teachers and parents who will act as 
chaperones 
cascia said he wants to make sure the energetic teenagers are 
on their best behavior because they will be acting as goodwill 
ambassadors not only for the united states but for the roman 
catholic church as well 
cascia hatched the idea for the trip seven months ago formal 
approval came from the soviet government the day that mikhail s 
gorbachev headed home after his summit meeting with president 
reagan in december 
cascia thinks the timing was evidence that the schools trip is 
another experiment in glasnost the soviet leaders muchtouted 
policy of openness 
the fact that theyve given us the olympic village which is 
their showpiece indicated right away they are going to give us 
a lot of attention he said 
the students are paying just 200 apiece with the rest being 
financed by a 25000 grant from the us government 5000 from 
the waterbury tourism council and the sale of tshirts bearing the 
message in english and russian that glasnost is real 
the soviet government is donating 5000 in services the school 
said

the cia and the agriculture department have 
teamed up to report that the cabbage is king in the soviet union 
while americans bow to the tomato 
the study of food supplies in the united states and the soviet 
union says that radish and carrot tops are common fare among soviet 
consumers but are rarely found on american grocery lists but then 
the united states has the sweet potato while the soviet union 
doesnt 
on the other hand the overall nutrient levels in the two 
nations are not too far apart on the average the soviet union 
supplies about 3200 calories per day to each citizen compared 
with 3500 for the average american 
protein availability at an average of 100 grams per day is a 
tossup but americans have more fat and cholesterol in their food 
supply while soviet people get more carbohydrates 
the study was conducted jointly by the cia and the agriculture 
departments human nutrition information service the report by cia 
and hnis analysts was published in the latest national food review 
a quarterly magazine of the departments economic research service 
a 16year period 1965 to 1981 was used in the study 
information about soviet per capita food use was supplied by the 
cias office of soviet analysis from various published and 
unpublished sources the report said the usda agency drew on 
extensive food statistics kept on americans 
the report cautioned that the food use statistics for both 
countries were derived mathematically from production exports 
imports yearend inventories and other annual figures 
but within those limitations analysts said the study reveals 
some interesting differences and similarities between the united 
states and the soviet union 
for instance sources of food energy differed the report 
said carbohydrate provided most of the energy in the soviet food 
supply while carbohydrate and fat provided almost equal 
proportions in the us supply protein provided the same 
proportion in both countries 
among the soviet vegetables cabbage ranked number one the 
report said soviet use reached 66 pounds per capita in 1981 
compared with 55 pounds 16 years earlier us use stayed at about 
10 or 12 pounds 
cabbages accounted for 34 percent of all vegetables used in the 
soviet union in 1981 while providing only 6 percent of the us 
vegetable menu 
tomatoes led the us list accounting for 24 percent of all 
vegetables while ranking second in the soviet union at 28 percent 
carrots and beets were next among soviet vegetables while lettuce 
was second in the united states followed by cucumbers 
the per capita use of foods in nine major categories increased 
between 1965 and 1981 in the soviet union those included poultry 
eggs fruit fish vegetable fats dairy products vegetables 
sugars and sweeteners and meat 
at the same time the united states gained in the use of meat 
poultry vegetable fats and sugars and sweeteners the report 
said potato and grain use declined in the soviet union while the 
use of animal fats eggs dairy products and potatoes dropped in 
the united states 
one of the reasons behind huge soviet grain imports of recent 
years is a drive by moscow to increase the production of livestock 
and poultry to help upgrade the diets of soviet consumers the 
report shows how the situation has changed 
in 1965 the soviet unions per capita use of dairy products was 
244 pounds compared with 453 pounds in the united states by 1981 
soviet use rose to 347 pounds while the us average dropped to 
405 pounds 
meat use by the soviets in 1965 was 78 pounds per capita against 
the us average of 146 pounds in 1981 the averages 
respectively were 98 and 154 pounds 
the soviet per capita use of potatoes in 1965 was reported at 
313 pounds compared with 86 pounds in the united states in 1981 
potato use had dropped to 232 and 78 pounds respectively 
although soviet use of grain products declined from 343 pounds 
per capita in 1965 to 304 pounds in 1981 it was still 
approximately twice as much as in the united states 145 pounds in 
1965 and 151 pounds in 1981 the report said 
wheat accounted for the largest share in both countries but 
rye rice barley corn buckwheat and oats were also used 
grain products in the soviet union were primarily in the form of 
whole grains and groats or coarsely ground hulled grain the 
report said white flour was the major grain product used in the 
united states

it may be the most implausible gambit of the 
year or the most naive or just the dumbest but there isnt any 
doubt that paul simons decision to skip the south on super tuesday 
turns 1988 political theology on its head 
we urged him to take a midwestern industrial strategy said 
illinois democratic chairman vince demuzio perhaps with a straight 
face 
the accepted dogma is that no democrat in this lifetime will 
grace the white house without winning a fair share of states in the 
south 
its simple arithmetic the republicans have had a lock on the 
west theyve done whatever it takes to win california and theyve 
added support from the farm belt and the upper reaches of new 
england 
democrats who won hubert humphreyland in 1984 but little 
else generally can rely on some industrial states the islands of 
hawaii and the four corners of the district of columbia 
of course that doesnt add up to a democratic victory in the 
electoral college and during a 20year stretch the republicans 
have lost the white house just once to georgias jimmy carter 
and so party leaders agree the democrats must work the south 
the need for a southern strategy was an underlying rationale for 
creating next weeks super tuesday primaries and is one explanation 
for the tremendous effort being poured into the region this week by 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis jesse jackson rep richard 
gephardt of missouri and sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
but not paul simon 
simon is the senator from illinois whose campaign is 
floundering to be polite after a secondplace finish in iowa 
thirdplace finishes in new hampshire and minnesota and a complete 
collapse in south dakota he is out of money and out of the running 
the book of campaign etiquette says this is where simon thanks 
his staff thanks his supporters and gets out of the race perhaps 
throwing his endorsement to a candidate who shares his values 
maybe dukakis or maybe a dramatic homestate boost for jackson 
yes thats the way its generally done 
simon embraced the etiquette just after new hampshire 
if i dont win either minnesota or south dakota im going to 
drop out of the race he said i dont want to just continue 
indefinitely running second or third 
he expressed high hopes for victory declaring the place 
where my natural roots are is right here in hubert humphreyland 
the logic was unassailable but his resolve didnt last 
before 24 hours simon was hedging because of the reaction 
weve been getting from around the country whose reaction was 
he talking about certainly not the reaction of the voters in 
hubert humphreyland he finished just behind uncommitted just 
behind jackson and way behind dukakis 
and so simon announced that hes going to skip the south and 
pick up in illinois on march 15 in michigan on march 26 and so 
on he says the southern vote will be scattered and that 
were not going to have a firstballot nominee were going to 
have a very open convention 
fair enough but will the convention turn to paul simon 
the dogma of 1988 says the last thing the democrats will do is 
nominate a candidate who bypassed the south he could put minnie 
pearl on his ticket and it wouldnt keep the republicans from 
rubbing their hands together in excitement 
not that simon is talking about a southerner for his ticket no 
hes got a midwestern industrial strategy in michigan the 
other day he said hed want to consider lee iacocca as a running 
mate 
its possible that simon blinded by presidential ambition 
simply does not see this strategy as futile but simon didnt enter 
the race until failing to draft sen dale bumpers of arkansas so 
blind ambition doesnt ring true and naive or stupid he is not 
instead this skipthesouth gambit is probably a reluctant 
deference to local pols who want to ride his homestate coattails 
into atlanta 
there are people in illinois who want to go to the convention 
and who are simon delegates simon said last week 
thats all well and good for them but simon himself stands to 
become a quintessential spoiler draining votes from compatible 
liberal candidates without a prayer of winning himself in return 
he might hope to amass the kind of good will in illinois democratic 
clubrooms that provides an uncontested primary for reelection in 
1990

if lawyer e robert wallach had stayed with 
his original plan attorney general edwin meese iiis files would 
never have contained a 1985 memo outlining a plan to pay the 
israeli labor party to ensure the safety of a proposed 1 billion 
iraqi oil pipeline 
the memo to meese is part of a threedocument package that 
wallach gave to the attorney general on the same day in september 
1985 in an attempt to revive the project which was foundering over 
iraqs demand for an insurance package against israeli bombing 
the documents now part of special prosecutor james mckays 
criminal investigation into meeses activities were released last 
week by the attorney generals lawyers in addition three telex 
messages from wallach to a swiss oilman who was a partner in the 
pipeline project surfaced last week and showed that wallach and 
other project backers attempted to have pentagon budget money paid 
to the israelis not to bomb the pipeline 
the pipeline memos also have drawn the attention of irancontra 
independent counsel lawrence walsh because they draw the first link 
between the pipeline project and the trade of arms for hostages 
the burgeoning paper trail in the meesepipeline episode 
includes a sept 19 1985 handwritten letter from thenisraeli 
prime minister shimon peres expressing support for the proposed 
pipeline 
but mckay who is investigating meeses role in the pipeline 
project is focusing on two memos both dated sept 25 1985 from 
wallach to meese the peres letter was attached to the first memo 
a fourpage explanation of the problems surrounding the project in 
it wallach urged meese to help round up support from top us 
officials 
one problem wallach wrote was that seeking the insurance 
package required disclosing to a number of bankers and others the 
nature of the security package guaranteeing that israel 
wouldnt destroy the line 
wallach said this package involved the nevertobestated but 
fully understood quid pro quo 
meeses lawyers say the quid pro quo was a reference to plans by 
wallachs client swiss oilman bruce rappaport to make available 
to israel substantial amounts of oil from the pipeline discounts 
on the oil were to amount to 650 million to 700 million over 10 
years 
however government sources familiar with the investigation of 
meese say mckay is trying to determine whether the quid pro quo 
memo is related to the second memo that wallach handed over to 
meese at the same time 
the second memo marked personal amp confidential for your 
eyes only contains a paragraph which says that rappaport 
confirmed with peres the arrangement in which israel was to 
receive up to 700 million over 10 years from the pipeline the 
next sentence says what was also indicated to me and which 
would be denied everywhere is that a portion of those funds will 
go directly to labor 
mckay wants to know whether the money for the israeli labor 
party headed by peres is the quid pro quo mentioned in the 
first memo 
if it is the two memos suggest that meese may have known about 
a plan to bribe israeli politicians as a way to assure the safety 
of the planned pipeline if meese knew about such a proposed 
payoff he might be charged with violating or conspiring to violate 
the foreign corrupt practices act that law bars bribes to foreign 
officials and gives the attorney general authority to file civil 
suits to stop us companies from bribing potential foreign 
customers 
in the quid pro quo memo wallach was trying to explain to 
meese the importance of rappaport to the pipeline project to 
demonstrate the credibility and relationship of rappaport to 
israel wallach a longtime friend of the attorney general also 
said that he was preparing a memorandum for my own files on 
other matters wallach said he had discussed with the swiss oilman 
i will communicate orally the contents of that memorandum 
wallach said 
but he changed his mind for reasons as yet undisclosed 
instead of giving meese a verbal summary of that memo wallach 
gave the document to meese thus allowing the special prosecutor 
and the public to see what wallach said were rappaports thoughts 
about money for the israeli labor party 
was this a planned bribe 
peres who is now israels foreign minister denies receiving 
any bribe offer a peres aide is quoted as saying the thenprime 
minister was told israel would get oil discounts but peres didnt 
take that seriously rappaport denies making any payoffs and meese 
says he doesnt recall reading the portion of the second memo 
mentioning labor party payments

republican jack kemp trying to breathe life into 
his lagging presidential campaign blasted george bush and bob dole 
as taxraising twins in a southern debate and said if either is 
nominated the reagan revolution is over gone dead 
and bush and dole tangled repeatedly at a debate sunday 
afternoon on their differing calls for a budget freeze on the 
irancontra affair and on protecting the souths textile industry 
from foreign competition 
the gop debate may be the last confrontation of the four gop 
candidates before the big round of primaries across the south on 
march 8 super tuesday 
bush forces confident that the vice president commands the 
field in dixie said after the debate that bush had no plans to 
attend the next scheduled debate set sunday in nashville and 
sponsored by the league of women voters his move could scrap the 
final gop debate of the southern campaign 
were simply at a point where weve got 20 states bush 
campaign manager lee atwater said weve got a pretty busy 
schedule 
only a week ago the bush forces expressed shock that sen dole 
of kansas and the fourth contender pat robertson backed out of a 
similar debate in dallas 
rep kemp of new york whose white house aspirations are on the 
ropes after a series of poor showings in the earlier primaries and 
caucuses tried to depict himself as the true conservative in the 
race and lumped bush and dole together as moderates who would raise 
taxes and turn their backs on the legacy of president reagan 
frankly under bob dole or george bush youre going to get 
exactly the same thing kemp said in the debate sponsored by the 
atlanta journalconstitution newspapers 
they sound alike they talk alike and they have supported 
together every single tax increase in the last eight years 
if theyre nominated i want you folks to know the reagan 
revolution is over gone dead he said 
bush and dole both objected saying they have fought against tax 
increases and for the reagan administrations agenda for the past 
seven years they charged that kemp wasnt willing to take steps to 
solve the federal budget deficit even as both said raising taxes 
wasnt the way they would do it 
jacks never met a deficit he didnt like dole said 
bush told kemp you dont care about deficits you never have 
and theyre public enemy no 1 
dole raised the irancontra subject and holding a copy of a 
report by a commission bush headed that recommended no deals with 
terrorists charged that bush had condoned selling weapons to iran 
in exchange for hostages 
we should never trade arms for hostages we shouldnt issue 
these reports and say we shouldnt trade arms for hostages the 
vice presidents report and then later go to a meeting and say 
its all right we shouldnt do those things dole said 
bush who contends he did not know the arms were being exchanged 
for hostages said only that mistakes were made in the 
irancontra affair 
asked later if the affair had occurred on his watch bush 
replied i think when the president found out what happened he 
took the proper steps 
robertson the former television preacher offered a defense of 
embattled attorney general edwin meese iii saying intense scrutiny 
has made it difficult to attract people to government meese is 
under investigation by an independent counsel 
after spending the last two weeks explaning his own remarks 
that nuclear missiles are in cuba that bush forces have engaged in 
dirty tricks and that his christian broadcasting network knew where 
american hostages were held in lebanon robertson criticized the 
press 
i know its very difficult dealing with the press of america 
to get the truth out they love to distort our words robertson 
said 
kemp accused dole and robertson of changing positions to please 
southern voters with their support for legislation limiting textile 
imports the textile industry is particularly large in south 
carolina which holds a key southern test on saturday two days 
before primaries across the rest of the south 
he referred to rep richard gephardt of missouri a democratic 
candidate who has called for tough trade sanctions against unfair 
trading partners when he said after the debate pat robertson 
and bob dole sound like dick gephardt to me on trade 
robertson said that foreign imports now make up a large portion 
of the domestic textile market and asked how much do you want to 
give them communist china and communist russia 
bush and dole attacked each others proposals for a federal 
budget freeze as a way to deal with the deficit bush said his was 
more flexible and that doles plan would cut defense spending 
dole countered that bushs plan was a fouryear copout 
the confrontations of the two gop leaders bush and dole so 
dominated the first part of the gathering that kemp protested 
this is a fourman debate

actor sean penn says being married to a star like 
madonna is a strain but that recent reports the couple was close 
to divorce were created by the press 
penn discussed his marriage in a story published in sundays 
chicago tribune which said it was the first interview with 
filmdoms bad boy since he was jailed for 32 days after striking a 
movie extra 
penn 27 vowed to refocus himself to avoid outbursts he 
said reports of his marital problems with madonna 29 stem from 
her fans possessiveness of her and their view of him as 
lessthanideal marriage material 
she belonged to them to the public penn said and if 
anybody took her i think they thought it should have been someone 
more acceptable like donald trump 
madonna filed divorce papers in santa monica calif on dec 4 
citing irreconcilable differences two weeks later she asked to 
withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same 
day court records show no reason was given in the court papers 
for her change of heart 
but penn said the divorce story was more people magazine than 
reality my attitude with the press right now is that i hope 
theyve had their share of me theyve been very busy trying to 
find or make dirt id like to get back to acting

freddy gorman cowriter of the song please 
mr postman says hes content to be a fulltime mail carrier 
again like he was in 1960 when he wrote the motown classic that 
led him into a musical career 
it honestly didnt bother me to have to return to the post 
office he said in an interview in this weeks people magazine 
i started looking around but realized i wasnt qualified for too 
many other jobs it was sort of ironic that i ended up back where i 
started 
the song gorman cowrote for the marvelettes put him on the 
route to fame with his own group the originals but gorman says he 
went back to his appointed rounds after 15 years in the music

and he had family responsibilities 
gorman 48 lives in the los angeles suburb duarte with his wife 
of 27 years dodie and their 18yearold son dillon

liberation classic the feminine mystique says women working in 
the media face the threat of a new feminine mystique to send them 
home again 
there are patterns here a pattern where disproportionately in 
the restructuring of networks and movie studios women are being 
dislocated friedan said sunday at women men and media a 
conference she chaired at the university of southern california 
marlene sanders a former correspondent and news executive at 
abc said the setbacks resulted from cutbacks caused by takeovers 
and mergers of media corporations and reduced federal regulation of 
broadcasting 
los angeles times television critic howard rosenberg told the 
conference male media executives were less likely to take women 
seriously in entertainment shows he said a study found that men 
were the central characters in 42 tv series and women in only 17 
and in dramas the ratio was 23 men to 3 women

the federal government is paying about 203 
million a year in irrigation subsidies in the west for crops that 
also receive price supports or other farm subsidies according to 
the first estimate of the double subsidy ever made by the bureau of 
reclamation 
the bureau also calculated its total 1986 subsidy to farmers as 
534 million about 54 an acre 
the calculations have been given to rep george miller 
dcalif chairman of the water and power subcommittee of the house 
interior committee who conducted hearings on the doublesubsidy 
issue last may and october 
miller has been a skeptic of reclamation projects and has 
sponsored legislation opposed by the bureau to make farmers 
eventually pay the full cost of water used to irrigate crops that 
get other subsidies 
in a letter to miller wayne marchant deputy assistant 
secretary of interior for water and science defended the 
irrigation subsidies 
the irrigation subsidy reported here is responsible for much 
of the current character of the western united states marchant 
said without the support for development of irrigation 
established by congress much of the agricultural development in 
the west especially in california would not have occurred 
he said the projects also have provided important electricity 
and recreational benefits 
but the bureaus own calculations also show that those benefits 
have come at a substantial price 
the bureau provides all or part of the irrigation of 99 million 
acres on 150300 farms in 17 states crops subsidized in the farm 
program were grown on 57 million acres 
overall water revenues averaged only 19 million a year for 
1983 1984 and 1985 while irrigation subsidies just on the 
subsidized crops were estimated at 203 million a year 
since the bureau was created in 1902 through 1986 the total 
irrigation subsidy was estimated at 98 billion calculated in 
1986 dollars 
farmers are supposed to pay for construction operation and 
maintenance of the irrigation systems but congress often has 
specified that construction repayments be made at zero interest or 
a rate well below the treasury rate what it costs the government 
to borrow 
critics say the bureau has devised other subsidies as well 
persuading congress to allocate a toosmall share of a projects 
cost to irrigation and allowing farmers to postpone capital 
repayments until a project is complete even though their part may 
be delivering water 
the bureau calculated the double subsidy indirectly in the 
previous 10 years an average of 38 percent of the land irrigated 
by the bureau was used to produce crops with farm subsidies so the 
bureau estimated the value of the irrigation subsidy as 38 percent 
of its total 1986 subsidy of 534 million 
the bureau said it could not answer three questions from miller 
how much the water might have been worth in alternate uses how 
much would have been collected if it had charged full cost and how 
much it would collect if it had to charge full cost in 1995 
millers bill would apply as contracts came up for renewal but 
marchant said the bureau thought it unfair to farmers who had 
invested under a promise of subsidy 
the effect of the bill may vary from area to area the 
westlands water district in californias san joaquin valley could 
probably afford to pay full cost but in our view a lot of farmers 
could be driven out of business with all the attendant social 
costs marchant said 
he said he was disappointed that congress last year forbade a 
change in administration policy that would require agriculture 
subsidies to be disregarded when project costs and benefits are 
calculated this would have been the right thing to do he 
said i do not think we should be piling one subsidy on top of 
another 
westlands is served by one of two projects for which miller 
requested subsidy costs the central valley project and the 
columbia basin project in washington state the bureau said central 
valley got an annual subsidy of 135 million 60 per acre and 
columbia basin got 54 million or 102 per acre 
annual subsidies for some uncompleted projects will be larger 
up to 719 per acre for the garrison diversion project in north 
dakota where 52 percent of the crops are in the farm program 
these are outrageous subsidies said ed osann water 
specialist for the national wildlife federation and longtime critic 
of water projects

thirdgraders in mary alice blantons 
class look at each other knowingly these days whenever she takes an 
unruly child out into the hall 
they say mrs blanton is going to give the kid the same thing 
she gave that gunman who came into our school three weeks ago 
said west end christian school headmaster dan carden its become 
a sort of standing joke 
carden was referring to the morning of feb 2 when mrs 
blanton 57 whacked one of two intruders with a book of bible 
stories the man she struck james l harvey fended off the blow 
and went on to hold mrs blanton and her pupils hostage for the 
next 12 hours 
harvey a 43yearold tuscaloosa native was wrestled to the 
ground after he was lured out by a phony pardon from gov guy hunt 
and a false promise that he would be able to air his complaints 
about poverty and homelessness at a news conference he has 
undergone psychiatric evaluation authorities said a preliminary 
hearing on the kidnapping charges against him is set for wednesday 
carden whose two sons were in school during the takeover said 
his children and the other pupils seem to have survived the episode 
in remarkable fashion 
everything is going very smoothly here he said last week 
i can honestly say i dont know of any serious repercussions 
among our staff students or their parents 
allan goodwin a psychologist who helped out during and after 
the hostage taking which involved 80 of the baptist schools 280 
students said he is amazed by the lack of psychological fallout 
its hard to believe but its true that everything has 
returned to normal at the school said goodwin director of the 
indian rivers community health center here i dont detect any 
malice even the parents have been able to forgive and forget i 
think this may have something to do with the fatalism that goes 
along with their fundamentalist faith a feeling that such events 
are out of our hands 
john rhodes jr who accompanied harvey during the school 
invasion apparently was duped by harvey all charges against 
rhodes an unemployed laborer who first met harvey only minutes 
before they went to the school were dropped 
as for harvey goodwin said the children apparently viewed him 
as a harmless blowhard 
i think they see harvey as someone who was strange but not as 
a menacing figure goodwin said i dont think the children 
inside the room with him ever picked up the degree of tension that 
existed among the law enforcement officers and parents outside the 
school 
mrs blanton who spent 12 hours as a hostage said much the 
same thing 
after the first few minutes i dont think the children really 
felt threatened she said last week frankly the biggest 
adjustment problem weve had has been adjusting to the flu it has 
really been going around 
however she said she did have the class write about the episode 
a couple of the kids who were released early in return for 
pizzas seemed a little indignant she said they thought they 
were worth more than a pizza 
as for her own role and her brief attempt to disarm harvey with 
her book she said i never thought about being a hero i was 
just acting on instinct in retrospect it was probably a pretty 
dangerous thing to do 
carden is still confused by one aspect of the case 
i still dont know why harvey picked our school he said 
ill be interested to hear what he has to say about that at his 
trial

wyoming this week becomes the first state 
in the west to allocate presidential delegates but the contest has 
gotten relatively little attention in the rush to the super tuesday 
states 
still state officials and wyoming political leaders are touting 
their caucuses this saturday as the kickoff contest in the region 
saying results in the state will help set the stage for larger 
contests to come 
we have a real potential to influence the process especially 
since were the first western state to assign delegates said 
muffy moore state democratic party chairman 
its not our numbers that are important its our position on 
the calendar she added 
the wyoming caucuses are three days before super tuesday march 
8 when 20 states mainly southern and border states will hold 
caucuses and primaries 
wyomings caucus process according to republican and democratic 
campaign directors calls for little in the way of media 
advertising instead campaign staffers spend most of their days on 
the phones to individuals who will attend the county conventions 
you make the calls you make the personal contacts this is a 
retail state said mickey munley a codirector for tennessee 
sen albert gore jrs wyoming campaign down south there are so 
many people all the candidates are buying tv in wyoming its 
more personal people want a phone call 
state gop chairman mark hughes said he expected the republican 
race to come down to sen bob dole and vice president george bush 
who have spent more time and effort in wyoming than rep jack kemp 
and pat robertson 
my opinion is that bush and dole are far more organized and 
have been in the state a much longer period of time said hughes 
i dont believe jack kemp has campaigned extensively here and 
dont think his campaign has been that strong here he said 
adding that robertson also has been weak in wyoming 
on the democratic side leaders are reluctant to make 
predictions 
its hard to tell how people are going to vote at this 
point moore said late last week i still think we have a very 
large portion of our democrats who havent made up their minds 
yet 
twentyeight years ago it was wyomings position in the alphabet 
that brought it glory as the states democratic delegation cast the 
deciding vote in los angeles that gave john f kennedy the partys 
presidential nomination 
some state and party officials believe that with that in mind 
it might be in wyomings best interest to send an uncommitted 
delegation to the convention 
gov mike sullivan holds that belief at least for the time 
being one of wyomings five super delegates to the democratic 
national convention sullivan does not have to commit himself to 
any candidate prior to the convention 
so far he has remained uncommitted although hes been lobbied 
by the candidates to cast his support prior to super tuesday 
not all democratic leaders are taking that tack however 
former gov ed herschler the states chief executive officer 
for 12 years before sullivan took over in 1987 will get an idea 
this saturday of how much political clout he carries he endorsed 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee last month 
mike beson deputy campaign director for rep richard gephardt 
said endorsements arent the only thing that count 
were not going to let that hinder our campaign he said 
we have a grassroots aggressive campaign 
on the democratic side each of the 23 counties will hold party 
conventions saturday at which a secret ballot will determine the 
allocation of 13 delegates once the results are known nominees 
for delegates to the state party convention on may 7 in sheridan 
will campaign on behalf of a certain candidate or perhaps as an 
uncommitted delegate 
later in the day delegates to the state convention will be 
selected and at the convention the 13 delegates to the national 
convention will be chosen 
on the republican side things are not so simple 
precinct caucuses started earlier this month at which delegates 
to the county conventions were selected at the county conventions 
which start tuesday and end the following saturday there will be 
no formal presidential preference poll taken to base delegate 
selection said mary ann collins state gop executive director 
twelve counties are considered delegate counties and will send 
12 presidential delegates to the state gop convention on may 7 in 
cheyenne the nominees for these positions must declare which 
candidate they are supporting according to party bylaws 
the remaining counties plus one will send alternate delegates 
to the state convention at the state convention the remaining six 
delegates will be selected

arrests for driving under the influence of 
alcohol rose more than 220 percent from 1970 to 1986 while the 
number of licensed drivers increased by just 42 percent in that 
period a government report says 
in 1986 some 18 million people were arrested for driving under 
the influence compared to 556000 in 1970 said a report issued 
sunday by the bureau of justice statistics in 1983 the peak year 
there were 19 million such arrests one for every 80 drivers 
the study also found that rates for driving under the influence 
were highest among 21yearolds reaching a peak in 1983 with a 
rate of one arrest for every 39 licensed drivers of that age 
since 1983 most states have phased in new laws raising the 
minimum age for buying or selling alcohol to 21 arrest rates for 
dui for the ages 18 to 20 have declined by 14 percent since then 
more than twice the rate of decrease for those aged 2124 
another portion of the study found that half the jail inmates 
convicted of drunken driving had consumed the equivalent of at 
least 12 bottles of beer or eight mixed drinks before their arrests 
almost half of the people jailed on drunken driving charges or 
serving a sentence for that offense had been sentenced for the same 
offense previously 
the jail portion of the study based on a 1983 survey of inmates 
in 407 locations also found that one in five of the convicted 
drunken drivers had been consuming two or more kinds of alcoholic 
beverages when arrested 
the median age for those in jail for drunken driving was 32 
about 5 years older than the median age for all jail inmates some 
95 percent of the jailed drunken drivers were men and nearly 80 
percent were unmarried separated divorced or were widows or 
widowers

a southwestern bell calling card which the newspaper used to make 
longdistance calls on american telephone amp telegraph cos 
network according to editor robert m white ii 
southwestern bell using a computer to monitor callingcard use 
by its customers detected unusually high use by the newspaper one 
weekend in january after consulting the newspaper it canceled the 
card and issued a new one 
publisher max thomson says that on the same day the new code was 
issued he got a call from a man who said he was from atampt and 
needed to verify the new credit card number assigned to the 
newspaper because someone was trying to use it unsuspecting 
thomson gave the caller the new number 
within days the card again was being used to charge calls 
around the world and by the time southwestern bells computer sent 
up another red flag the newspapers card had run up charges of 
more than 4500 
the calls included one for 15546 from a new york pay phone to 
mali and another costing 10527 from the same phone to the same 
number in mali 12 hours later a 14415 call that lasted two and a 
half hours between a jersey city nj phone booth and china 
others calls went to kuwait bangladesh gambia senegal spain 
taiwan and the dominican republic among other places 
as is the practice of most phone companies southwestern bell 
didnt charge the newspaper for the unauthorized calls 
but the ledger has ensured that it wont happen again we no 
longer have credit cards thomson said 
southwestern bell officials arent sure how the newspapers card 
number was stolen initially some codes are obtained by computer 
hackers who dial into a longdistance companys electronic files 
and find secret billing codes 
longdistance companies are improving their network software to 
help detect unauthorized access quickly and they are phasing out 
their shorter codes and adopting 14digit replacements which are 
harder for hackers to crack 
but thieves dont need a computer to get a code some hang 
around phone booths where callers are dialing from cards and 
theyll use binoculars mirrors anything they possibly can to 
read the numbers off the cards or even memorize the numbers as the 
caller is punching them into the phone said everick bowens 
president of the fraud control association 
with codes in hand hustlers and hackers then look for customers 
at banks of pay phones in transit areas the hustlers offer 
domestic and international calls at deeply discounted rates aware 
that with frequent use the life of a code can be just a few hours 
bolder hustlers are passing themselves off as legitimate 
resellers of longdistance service or even as a representative of a 
longdistance company 
us sprint communications co which lost 80 million to toll 
fraud last year and is one of the most active longdistance 
companies in going after code theft recently uncovered a 
multilevel marketing operation that sold codes to about 200 
people and businesses including insurance companies accountants 
lawyers and retailers said security director robert f fox 
a man walks in wearing a threepiece suit and says hes a 
reseller with a contract with a major longdistance company and 
that he can cut your longdistance phone bill fox said 
recounting the scam 
he looks at a companys phone bill say its 10000 a month 
he says i can cut it to 5000 a month fox said he says 
hell give you authorization codes and for your protection the 
codes will be changed every few days 
some of the buyers are caught unaware fox said but some 
people dont ask a lot of questions because they dont want a lot 
of answers 
sprint has been going after many of these buyers in civil court 
actions and collecting restitution he said 
fox advises it may sound legitimate but if it sounds too 
good to be true it probably is

the us economy has shrugged off the worst 
effects of the october stock market collapse and should be able to 
escape a recession this election year economists for top us 
corporations predicted today 
the national association of business economists said optimism 
among its members has risen appreciably since the last survey 
conducted in the month following the oct 19 plunge in stock prices 
in november more than half of the business economists were 
predicting a recession would begin before the end of 1988 an 
outlook that could have spelled bad news for republican hopes of 
holding onto the white house 
now the number of economists expecting a recession this year 
has dropped to about onefourth 
as we move farther away from october we are a little less 
nervous we are seeing continued improvement in manufacturing and 
other good signs that the expansion will keep going said 
kathleen cooper chief economist for security pacific national bank 
of los angeles 
the next president is likely to face a recession soon after 
taking office the analysts believe with about 60 percent of them 
picking 1989 as the most likely year the downturn will begin 
but for 1988 the economists are projecting further growth at a 
modest pace stable interest rates and a slight drop in inflation 
the analysts predicted that the economy as measured by the 
gross national product will expand just 2 percent this year down 
from a 39 percent gnp increase in 1987 when measured from the 
fourth quarter of 1986 
this is more pessimistic than the reagan administration which 
is calling for gnp growth this year of 24 percent 
ms cooper who compiled the associations survey said the 
decline in the stock market caused the majority of economists to 
reduce their growth forecasts for this year but she said most of 
them had cut back their projections by less than 1 percent 
economists see the largest effect of the markets plunge on 
consumer spending for durable goods she said noting that they 
are now expecting car sales to total only 98 million units this 
year down from an expectation of 105 million sales made before 
the market decline the forecast of housing starts also was trimmed 
to 152 million units this year compared to 162 million new 
houses built in 1987 
ms cooper said the analysts expect growth to be most sluggish 
in the first half of the year as businesses cut back on production 
to reduce high inventories gnp growth will average 15 percent in 
the first six months and then improve to 25 percent growth for the 
rest of the year the economists forecast 
this sluggish growth rate will not be enough to keep the 
unemployment rate from rising the economists forecast that 
unemployment which now stands at 58 percent will rise to 61 
percent by the end of the year 
but the slow growth will help to keep inflation from getting out 
of control the analysts predicted that consumer prices will rise 
42 percent this year slightly slower than the 44 percent 
increase in 1987 
in other predictions the economists said 
interest rates as measured by the prime lending rate will 
stay steady banks cut their prime rate used to set interest rates 
on a variety of corporate and consumer loans to 85 percent in 
early february and analysts forecast it will remain at this level 
through the end of the year 
the federal budget deficit which fell to 1504 billion in 
1987 will rise to 157 billion in the current fiscal year but 
then resume falling dropping to 140 billion by 1990 this is more 
pessimistic than the reagan administration which sees this years 
deficit falling to 1467 billion and a further decline to 1042 
billion by 1990 
the countrys foreign trade deficit which hit a record 171 
billion last year will finally start to come down dipping to 150 
billion this year and 130 billion in 1989 
the optimism on the trade deficit is based on a belief that the 
dollar has finally fallen far enough to stem americans appetite 
for imports while making us products competitive once again on 
overseas markets 
ms cooper said the economists are now less pessimistic about 
the fate of the dollar with less than onefifth of them thinking 
the dollar will drop by 10 percent in value this year against other 
major currencies in november more than 40 percent were looking 
for a decline in the dollar that was at least that large

the internal revenue service has put out the 
definitive word on a confusing new law affecting taxation of 
investors in mutual funds 
investors will not have to report certain operating expenses of 
their publicly offered mutual funds as 1987 income because the 
funds will not pass along those expenses to shareholders said irs 
spokesman rod young 
people dont have to be concerned at all about those expenses 
on the returns they are filing now said mike delaney of the 
investment company institute which represents most of the nations 
2400 mutual funds 
this means investors will have to do nothing on their 1987 
returns to get a oneyear reprieve from a new tax 
however unless congress intervenes about 20 million 
shareholders will have to count such expenses as income on future 
tax returns and then attempt to write them off as a miscellaneous 
itemized deduction 
the taxation of these expenses has been surrounded by confusion 
because of the wording of a new provision affecting them that was 
signed into law by president reagan only last dec 22 that 
provision delayed for one year implementation of a section of the 
big tax overhaul enacted in 1986 
because of the december change publicly offered mutual funds 
will not allocate their 1987 operating expenses among shareholders 
thus shareholders will not have to mention such amounts on their 
tax returns at all 
but all that changes for 1988 mutual funds will be required to 
pass on operating expenses to shareholders in turn shareholders 
will list that amount as income and hope they can deduct it as a 
miscellaneous expense 
that is unless congress intervenes again 
under the 1986 tax overhaul the deduction for all kinds of 
miscellaneous expenses is limited to those that exceed 2 percent of 
adjusted gross income a mutualfund shareholder whose 
miscellaneous expenses did not reach that threshold would have no 
way of deducting the funds expenses and as a result would be 
taxed on income never received the same would be true for a 
taxpayer who did not itemize deductions 
reagan has asked congress to grant shareholders permanent relief 
from taxation on that phantom income at a cost of 400 million 
a year 
the lions share of money invested in mutual funds is in those 
that are regularly traded on securities markets but there are 
numerous nonpublic funds that are traded privately 
the irs notes those that are not publicly offered or owned by at 
least 500 persons may have to allocate expenses among shareholders 
for 1987 any fund that is so affected should be advising 
shareholders to report as income the expenses that are designated 
in box 2 on form 1099div 
if you are not sure that your fund qualifies as publicly 
offered you should contact your fund advises young of the irs

a bitter open debate marked by 
charges that some prominent historians are trying to tone down the 
horror of nazi atrocities is capturing the attention of west 
germans 
the controversy has been the topic of a bestselling book 
numerous newspaper articles and tv reports it is known as the 
historians dispute and has split prominent professors into 
feuding camps 
one group represented chiefly by prominent berlin historian 
ernst nolte is calling for a new perspective on the third reich 
and german identity 43 years after world war ii 
six million jews were killed in europe between 1933 and 1945 as 
part of adolf hitlers final solution 
nolte and his supporters tend to compare what happened under 
hitler to atrocities carried out by other governments such as the 
deaths of millions in the soviet union under stalin 
but their opponents led by frankfurt university philosophy 
professor juergen habermas say the conservative historians are 
trying to lessen the magnitude of nazi crimes through such 
comparisons habermas one of west germanys best known 
intellectuals also says his opponents are paving the way for 
nationalistic impulses 
in december more than 300 historians sociologists and 
philosophers met in frankfurt to discuss the disputes impact no 
resolutions were passed there but lectures held at the meeting 
will be published in a book scheduled for release in march 
the debate however has moved far beyond academic circles 
a book documenting the dispute made the bestseller list in the 
news magazine stern last year and new arguments regularly make 
headlines in leading newspapers as recently as jan 20 regional 
television in the state of bavaria devoted a bookreview show to 
new history books associated with the dispute 
nolte told the associated press in a telephone interview 
wednesday that he stands by his arguments 
those who want to make the nazis mass murder stand alone by 
forbidding every comparison with other events are guilty of having 
an incredibly unhistorical attitude nolte said 
nolte sparked the historians dispute with an essay called the 
past that wont go away published in the conservative 
frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper in june 1986 
he suggested that stalins infamous forced labor camps and the 
communists murder of millions of peasants were in a sense a 
forerunner of the nazi death camp auschwitz and hitlers genocide 
program 
wasnt the bolsheviks class murder the logical and actual 
precursor of the national socialists racial murder nolte 
asked in the essay 
noltes opponents have frequently called his phrasing unclear 
and open to many interpretations 
his critics also say he tries to justify hitlers motives for 
attacking the soviet union in world war ii by arguing that the 
dictator was mainly responding to the soviets goal of spreading 
communism 
to nolte hitler is a european citizen who was historically in 
the right in that he unwillingly went to war for democracy the 
bayerischen rundfunk television show lesezeichen said in 
reviewing noltes new book 
nolte and his supporters however say their arguments raise 
valid questions in historical interpretation 
other nolte arguments include comparing nazi atrocities with 
those of cambodias pol pot regime in the 1970s 
nolte says that he does not adhere to any one political party 
but many historians call him a conservative 
i would say nolte is a conservative historian christian 
meier of the university of munich told the ap conservatives in 
this dispute are those who see the horrible events of world war ii 
and the holocaust as an instance of fascism which also took hold 
in other european countries and not as a failure of german society 
and values 
habermas in a newspaper essay charged several conservative 
historians with reinterpreting history to justify and minimize the 
nazi regimes crimes the article appeared in the hamburgbased 
weekly newspaper die zeit in july 1986 
the nazi crimes lose their singularity in noltes arguments 
habermas wrote in the article 
many historians hold that the nazis genocide cannot validly be 
compared with other atrocities 
never before had a state with the authority of its 
responsible leader decided and announced it would completely kill 
off a specific group of people and put the plan into aciton 
historian eberhard jaeckel of stuttgart university wrote about the 
nazi genocide in a 1986 essay as a response to conservative 
arguments 
some historians say that too much dwelling on the nazi past 
could cause west germans today particularly younger ones to 
resent what they may see as a steady stream of accusation 
many west germans today are at least one generation removed 
from the nazi period meier said but the west germans are 
constantly being reminded of past actions if it goes too far it 
could even provoke a counterreaction 
some liberal historians attribute the airing of conservative 
views to a new conservative political climate in west germany 
in 1982 chancellor helmut kohls conservative christian democrats 
toppled the leftist social democrats 
ten years ago they the conservative historians wouldnt have 
risked advancing such notions historian hansulrich wehler told 
the ap the conservative historians arguments fit into todays 
political climate

the food and drug administration says it is 
concerned about possibly misleading advertisements that describe 
regular aspirin use as a way to prevent heart attacks 
the agency has summoned the nations aspirin makers to a meeting 
this week to discuss to what degree they can make that claim in 
their ads an fda official said sunday 
the meeting is scheduled for wednesday at the agencys 
headquarters in rockville md it comes a month after the new 
england journal of medicine published preliminary results of a 
study showing that aspirin taken every other day could reduce the 
risk of heart attacks in middleaged men 
we do have some concerns about this said fda spokesman 
donald mclearn even the study itself was accompanied by an 
editorial saying dont jump to conclusions folks 
some aspirin makers have launched advertising campaigns 
featuring young men who have suffered heart attacks 
the study was conducted on physicians aged 40 to 65 years old 
it was clear from the preliminary results that it could be 
helpful for heart attacks for men between 40 and 65 mclearn 
said our concern is people will read about the study and say 
im a 20yearold female maybe i should take aspirin every day 
thats not what the study was all about 
mclearn said that because the studys results are still 
preliminary doctors still may need to know more before prescribing 
regular aspirin dosages to patients one possible side effect is an 
increased risk of strokes he said 
also asked to participate in the meeting were associations 
representing the prescription and overthecounter drug industries 
also likely to attend are officials of the federal trade 
commission which oversees advertising of overthecounter drugs

a survey suggests the mailing of surgeon 
general c everett koops report on aids to individual households 
in alaska was well received and helped those who read it understand 
the disease 
the alaska department of health and social services mailed 
217000 copies of the report last november and had a professional 
polling company assess the impact the following month 
officials believe it is the first followup study of a mass 
mailing of aids material in the united states 
that study by dittman research corp found 91 percent of the 
people who read some or all of the booklet judged it appropriate 
well done and covered the topic adequately only 3 percent found 
it inappropriate too sexually explicit and offensive 
among other things the report says people who do not limit 
themselves to one aidsfree sexual partner should use condoms it 
contains a photograph of a condom and instructions on use 
the report issued in october 1986 also contains a brief 
section calling for sex education in schools as one way to help 
control spread of the deadly disease 
those who read the surgeon generals report had distinctly 
different understanding of aids compared to those who hadnt read 
the report the research company wrote in its analysis 
dittmans scientific telephone survey of 521 residents from 51 
communities found that 58 percent of those contacted reported 
receiving the booklet and that 76 percent of those read at least 
some of it 
moreover 46 percent of those questioned said other household 
members had read at least part of the report 
dr john middaugh the alaska state epidemiologist said the 
pollsters who did not include a margin of error in their summary 
told him they considered the 58 percent who recalled receiving 
the booklet unusually high for an unsolicited mailing 
he said some copies probably did not reach their destination for 
a variety of reasons but that a majority of those who could not 
recall the booklet probably discarded it without realizing what it 
was 
the significance of the study he said was the high ratio of 
those who did recall getting the 36page booklet who then read it 
and the even higher proportion who approved of it 
this proves the acceptability of doing this and the 
effectiveness of doing it middaugh said in a telephone 
interview this was an overwhelming response that should forever 
lay to rest whether this is an appropriate step to take 
he referred to controversy at the federal level over whether to 
mail aids information to every household whether the surgeon 
generals report or some other format 
middaugh said republican state sen tim kelly pushed 
authorization for the alaska mailer through the legislature after 
it became apparent the federal government was not going to do it 
last year 
us public health service spokesman jim brown said 12 million 
copies of the report have been printed including 9 million 
supplied to members of congress for mailing to their constituents 
congress allocated money for a national mailing last year 
although not necessarily the surgeon generals full report but it 
was never done the current phs budget contains more explicit 
language directing a national mailer and health and human services 
department officials say a brochure now under preparation will be 
in the mail by june 
im delighted that the state of alaska has chosen to educate 
its people by using the surgeon generals report said koop 
im even more thrilled that they did a followup survey to see the 
reaction to it weve had good general reaction to the surgeon 
generals report but this is the first real formal tracking that i 
know of 
the dittman survey included an analysis of different responses 
from 345 readers and a 176person nonreader control group 
on a variety of questions such as can you get aids by being 
bitten by a mosquito twentythree percent of the nonreaders 
said yes compared to 17 percent of the readers the report says 
the answer is no 
twentytwo percent of nonreaders said you can get aids from 
donating blood compared to 11 percent for readers 
eightytwo percent of the readers said they would let their 
children attend school with an aidsinfected child compared to 75 
percent nonreaders

the union representing 6700 northwest 
airlines flight attendants continued to threaten to strike sunday 
night although both sides in the labor talks said just one issue 
divided them 
negotiators for the airline and the union met with a federal 
mediator for four hours sunday and agreed on all but one contract 
issue according to northwest spokesman william wren 
william genoese international director of the international 
brotherhood of teamsters airline division agreed that only one 
issue separated the two sides the issue of how long newly hired 
workers will stay on a lower pay scale but he declined to 
characterize the rest of the days discussions except to say we 
talked around other issues 
a strike was still a possibility he said late sunday 
at this moment were in strike position it can happen two 
minutes from now or any other time under the law we have that 
right genoese said about 930 pm cst sunday 
about two hours later after meeting with other union 
negotiators genoese said tomorrow monday will be the really 
big day monday is the first weekday since the contract expired 
at midnight friday 
northwest officials said sunday the airline continued to operate 
a normal flight schedule no delays were reported at airports 
served by the carrier 
genoese and northwest agreed that the only sticking point in the 
negotiations is northwests proposal to stretch from five to nine 
years the time in which an employee advances from a b or lower 
pay scale to the a pay rate the union is resisting the 
proposal 
the airline issued a press release sunday night saying that its 
contract offered the union would make the flight attendants the 
secondhighestpaid in the airline industry 
according to northwest the contract which would run through 
dec 31 1992 also calls for two 2 percent wage increases for all 
flight attendants through 1992 and lump sum bonus payments in 1988 
and 1989 
earlier in the day the two sides had been reported to be apart 
on other issues such as the length of the contract and retroactive 
pay 
a strike deadline last friday night was extended as the two 
sides continued negotiations that began wednesday the two sides 
resumed talks one day after the teamsters airline division 
announced that nearly 95 percent of the attendants had authorized a 
strike 
on saturday the talks broke off but a union spokesman said 
strike preparations had been put on hold 
genoese said late saturday that a request by the federal 
mediator to delay a strike helped avert a walkout saturday morning 
meanwhile there was no word on whether flight attendant picket 
lines would be honored by pilots or machinists if there is a strike 
spokesmen for the pilots union were in a meeting sunday morning 
to discuss the flight attendants matter and were unavailable for 
comment 
if flight attendants do strike the airline has said it will 
keep flying 
about 2000 managers trained as flight attendants were posted 
throughout the northwest system with 200 newly hired replacement 
flight attendants also ready to move terry erskine the airlines 
vice president for law and labor relations said saturday

the justice department says it made an 
honest error by erroneously giving the impression for nine 
months that attorney general edwin meese removed himself from the 
pollard spy case 
it now acknowledges he was briefed twice about the case and he 
never was excluded 
in what chief department spokesman terry eastland called a 
correction he said meese is only excluded from the espionage case 
against the israeli air force officer who recruited jonathan 
pollard a navy counterterrorism analyst to spy for israel 
meese is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the 
stillopen pollard case to the extent that they dont involve the 
case against israeli brig gen aviem sella eastland said 
we were confused about the sella case eastland said it 
was an honest error 
eastland acknowledged that last month and on one previously 
undisclosed occasion assistant attorney general william weld head 
of the criminal division had briefed meese about the pollard case 
without touching on sella 
meeses own lawyer nathan lewin was unaware of the situation 
as recently as last week even though it was lewins work for meese 
and sella in separate cases that triggered the exclusion known as 
a recusal 
the turnabout comes as a government source said independent 
counsel james mckay is examining another meese recusal for clues 
about his motives in dealing with a mideast oil pipeline proposal 
in 1985 
meese hired lewin last may to represent him in mckays 
investigation of whether the attorney general and his attorney e 
robert wallach violated or conspired to violate a federal law 
barring bribes to foreign officials 
in may 1985 meese was recused from all matters involving 
wallach but arranged for wallach to meet national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane to promote the pipeline investigators say that 
examining that meese recusal might help determine whether the 
attorney general was aiding wallachs plan or as lewin argues 
directing it to the proper official 
at the office of government ethics last week general counsel 
donald campbell explained if youre a federal official and 
youve hired a law firm to represent you you should recuse 
yourself that is take no action in any matter involving that firm 
just as a matter of appearances even if you have no financial 
stake 
for that reason eastland said meese advised justice officials 
last may i hereby recuse myself from participating in any matter 
before the department in which the law firm of miller cassidy 
larroca amp lewin represents any party or is otherwise involved 
the washington post reported then that the recusal covered the 
pollard affair the justice department did not dispute that 
pollard was sentenced last year to life in prison for giving 
reams of secrets to israeli agents but justice officials still 
pursued the case in part because sella had fled to israel and has 
not been brought to trial here 
so there was surprise and consternation when the post reported 
feb 19 after being briefed on the case last month meese 
ordered that the pollard case be kept officially open so 
investigators can pursue their inquiry 
asked by the associated press last monday for an explanation 
justice department spokesman john russell said i have problems 
with that account because meese is recused in pollard 
russell bucked the question to deputy chief spokesman pat 
korten citing the same problem korten bucked it to eastland who 
was with meese in california until wednesday 
on tuesday lewin said hed never discussed pollard with meese 
because i think he certainly has recused himself because i am 
representing sella expressing surprise at the post account 
lewin said at the department they have known all along that it 
has been very much up front that he is not involved in pollard 
while eastland sought an answer a senior department official 
demanding anonymity said wednesday there was no problem because 
meese merely was briefed and made no decisions 
some former department lawyers dispute that view one who once 
worked in the attorney generals office said a recusal has 
always meant a chinese wall you are not even kept up to date 
a former justice career lawyer said that to avoid making a 
decision by a wink or a nod briefings were restricted to 
situations where the information was essential to decisions in 
other areas 
but friday afternoon eastland provided an official explanation 
that did not claim an exception for briefings 
he said the client lists regularly provided by lewins firm 
have not included the pollard case and so the attorney general 
is not recused from pollard 
the lists do include the sella case and the attorney general 
has been very careful to avoid taking any action in that case or in 
any other related case where his action might at all affect the 
sella case 
eastland denied meese kept the pollard case open he didnt 
have to because it has been open for some time

one point in morning trading to 12795 yen its first trip below

sidelines in anticipation of a slight correction in prices 
following the recent gains 
during the 13 previous trading days the nikkei index rose a 
total of 162260 points or 7 percent 
the market is taking a respite which many participants had 
expected for some time said an analyst at nomura securities 
japans largest brokerage who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a record 14 consecutive days of gains in the nikkei average was 
set in early 1961 
foreign exchange dealers said sentiment toward the dollar was 
relatively weak with the market still searching for the currencys 
bottom level but they said the dollars decline was being tempered 
by fears of possible market intervention by japans central bank 
below the 128yen level profittaking by speculators and light 
activity by commercial dollarsellers 
despite the fears of dollarbuying by the bank of japan a 
senior trader at a commercial bank who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the central bank was unlikely to intervene unless 
the dollar began falling at a faster pace below the 1275yen level

new englanders michael dukakis and george 
bush claimed victories in the maine caucuses but jesse jacksons 
unexpectedly strong secondplace showing was the surprise of the 
evening 
our message is winning declared jackson who finished with 
1 percent of the democratic vote in maines caucuses four years ago 
but gained 28 percent on sunday 
anything but first place would have been a major setback for 
dukakis the massachusetts governor who was winning 42 percent of 
the delegates to the state democratic convention in maine 
twentyone percent were uncommitted 
the alsorans were paul simon with 4 percent richard gephardt 
with 3 percent and albert gore and gary hart with 1 percent each 
today our message shone through again and that gives 
our national campaign another push towards success on super 
tuesday dukakis said sunday from cleveland 
bush too needed the overwhelming victory he claimed sunday 
with no official tally the bush campaign cited its own reports 
from 259 caucuses and said the vice president had the nonbinding 
support of 65 percent of the gop state convention delegates chosen 
over the weekend 
that added up to a huge lead for bush in the state where he has 
a vacation home robertson garnered 147 delegates or 14 percent 
senate majority leader bob dole 88 or 8 percent and rep jack 
kemp 14 or 1 percent the bush campaign said adding that 123 
delegates or 12 percent were uncommitted 
i am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victory 
in the maine caucuses assuring my campaign of all 22 national 
delegates bush said from washington 
if the democratic results held up at the state convention 
dukakis would win 10 of the states 23 pledged delegates to the 
democratic national convention jackson is in line for 8 delegates 
and the uncommitted group 5 
the numbers were unquestionably on the side of dukakis but the 
runnerup emerged with a victory no less sweet 
maine has sent a message to america that we can win that 
america wants bold leadership and a new director with sound 
ideas jackson said from the campaign trail in texas 
if it hadnt been for the strong grassroots organization that 
we had we would have been in trouble acknowledged david 
villarino manager of dukakis maine campaign villarino asserted 
that jacksons victories in two of maines largest cities portland 
and bangor reflected defections from the recently scaledback 
campaign of illinois sen paul simon 
whatever the reason for their success the jackson forces were 
ecstatic 
what were doing in maine is building an electoral victory 
from the grass roots to the top of the blades said scott nova of 
the jackson national campaign staff 
bush aides had worried earlier in the week that robertsons 
invisible army of supporters would flood the caucuses here as 
they did in michigan iowa and other states but robertsons 
supporters did not total the numbers feared by bush aides and 
deals with dole supporters diluted robertsons impact 
with the state party planning no count of results the various 
campaigns agreed in general that bush was running well ahead 
jeff nelson a spokesman for robertson in the state said of the 
bush supporters i dont think theres any question that they are 
going to be able to claim victory 
a top dole organizer state sen pamela cahill also conceded 
this is bush country up in new england up in maine and new 
hampshire she said 
in assessing the results in maine dukakis and jackson both 
dutifully invoked super tuesday the megaprimary next week in 
which 20 states and one territory will hold primaries or caucuses 
at stake in the march 8 contests are 1307 delegates to the 
national convention 
were right where we want to be and were heading into the 
final turn said villarino 
jackson spokesman mel king said people across the country 
when they find he came in second in maine are going to dispel the 
notion that a person who is black cant do well 
bush supporters acknowledged that they needed a big margin over 
robertson before the contests in the south where the former 
television evangelist has a strong core of support 
we couldnt afford to have the national story out of maine be 
that robertson comes in a close second said gov john r 
mckernan jr one of bushs strongest backers in the state 
maines conservative gop wing and fundamentalist churches were 
fertile recruiting grounds for robertson and his forces mounted an 
energetic challenge but outmaneuvered if not outmuscled by bush 
backers in caucus brokering robertsons followers were unable to 
turn their raw numbers into a matching proportion of delegates 
the party and the procedures favored bush over robertson 
said jeff nelson state spokesman for the robertson campaign

a strong earthquake in the bering sea 
shook the aleutian islands but there were no immediate reports of 
damage 
sunday nights quake struck about 100 miles east of bering 
island and had a preliminary magnitude of 66 on the richter scale 
said the alaska tsunami warning center 
paul whitmore of the tsunami center said the quake occurred at 
832 pm sunday 
he said no alerts were issued for a tsunami a fastmoving ocean 
wave caused by sesimic action its too small for that area to 
potentially cause a tsunami whitmore said 
he said the center had no contact with the area and did not know 
if there had been any damage 
bering island is part of the commander islands just west of attu 
in the aleutian chain 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion on a seismograph 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage

a rapemurder case nearly 13 years old 
will be the focus tuesday of a us supreme court review that many 
inmates see as a ticket off death row 
in my opinion it will affect everybody said jim 
vanderbilt who has spent more than 11 years on texas death row 
for the 1975 slaying of an amarillo teenager we will have 
commutation of everybody 
lawyers for the state and for donald gene franklin will present 
arguments to the high court on the constitutionality of a texas 
statute that limits consideration by a jury of mitigating 
circumstances that could benefit a defendant 
since october when the court agreed to hear the case dozens of 
deathrow inmates in texas whose 27 executions in the last six 
years are the most in any state since executions resumed in 1977 
have attached franklins arguments to their own in efforts to win 
stays 
its an issue that could potentially affect everybody on death 
row in texas said richard h burr iii coordinator of the 
death penalty project of the naacp legal defense and educational 
fund inc in new york i think probably everybody now is raising 
the issue and if theyre not they should be 
franklin 36 who has had three trials and four execution dates 
blamed the abduction rape and stabbing death of 27yearold mary 
margaret moran on a friend who used his car 
franklin was arrested hours after the july 1975 abduction but 
refused to say where the missing san antonio nurse was search 
parties combed san antonio but it took four days to find her 
bleeding in a bed of insects suffering from loss of blood and 
irreversible shock she died the next day 
mark stevens who is representing franklin before the high 
court said jurors should have had doubt about franklins guilt 
because of circumstantial evidence in the case 
stevens also said franklin at the time of the last trial had 
caused no disciplinary problems while in prison which goes to 
show among other things he shouldnt be executed 
stevens contends although such mitigating circumstances are 
presented at the punishment phase of a trial the jury is given no 
guidance as to how heavily to weigh them 
franklins trial attorneys suggested a jury charge that spelled 
out ways to handle mitigating circumstances the judge refused to 
include it in his instructions to the jury which determined 
franklin should die he has been on death row since 1982 
the state is real confident it will prevail said bob walt 
an assistant state attorney general 
a texas jury now has these questions to consider before deciding 
a person convicted of capital murder should be executed whether 
the defendants act was deliberate and with the expectation death 
would result whether the defendant is likely to commit a future 
violent act whether the victim may have provoked the attack and 
whether the response by the defendant was reasonable 
what theyre saying now is that the constitution requires a 
jury to consider mitigating evidence walt said i cant think 
of a case in texas that has less mitigating evidence than donald 
gene franklins 
he was in custody on a prior rape there aint no doubt in 
this case they had the victims clothes soaking in bloody water in 
his house all the victims property was at his house 
stevens and walt agree one one thing it is impossible to 
predict what the supreme court will do 
if the court rules in franklins favor anyone who requested 
similar jury instructions could be entitled to a new trial stevens 
said 
even if you didnt request these instructions you might be 
entitled to raise that fundamental constitutional right stevens 
added 
its real tough to speculate walt said of course hope 
springs eternal on death row 
hope is indeed the prevailing word on death row where more than 
260 people await execution 
there are a lot of options but commutation is the most 
likely said james beathard who arrived on death row in 1985 for 
killing a 14yearold boy 
what could they do hold new trials for 250 people 
everybodys real hopeful about it and figure its their best 
chance

friends and enemies of the confederate flag say 
they aint just whistlin dixie when they promise a fight over 
whether the rebel battle banner will keep waving from state 
flagpoles in the south 
the confederate flag flies over the capitols of alabama and 
south carolina along with state flags the state flags of georgia 
and mississippi incorporate the design 
in georgia a bill to redesign the state flag languishes in a 
legislative committee and in alabama black lawmakers who hoped to 
remove the confederate banner from atop the capitol dome were 
arrested 
this is a very emotional controversial issue we knew that 
when we took it on said earl shinhoster southeastern regional 
director of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people we think we deserve a vote on the issue 
south carolina state sen glenn mcconnell said opponents are 
being intolerant of differing views 
it does not breed good relations to pull the flag down 
and brand it as a symbol of racism and hate mcconnell said if 
we become a society that cannot bridge differences then we 
become a society built on extremes 
shinhoster said the flag represents the heart and soul of a 
defeated cause 
it represents state sovereignty state rights a rejection or 
resistance to federal control and it has an adverse effect on 
basic issues of human need he said 
georgias legislature voted to include the confederate battle 
emblem on the state flag in 1956 as a reaction to federal school 
desegregation orders a bill seeking to reinstate the former state 
flag has been sent to a house committee where it will likely die 
quietly 
judith damewood president of the grassroots lobbying group 
common cause georgia said she is embarrassed whenever she looks at 
the georgia state flag 
when the democratic national convention comes to atlanta this 
summer this is not the flag i want those delegates to see she 
said 
in alabama the battle flag has flown since 1961 when thengov 
john patterson had it put up in commemoration of the civil wars 
100th anniversary 
since there is no law allowing the flag to fly gov guy hunt 
has said he will allow the legislature to resolve the dispute 
on feb 2 the house turned down a resolution to remove the 
flag so 13 black legislators led by rep thomas reed of tuskegee 
tried climbing a fence surrounding the capitol to pull down the 
flag the group was arrested on trespassing charges a march 11 
court date has been set 
other states that made up the confederacy arkansas florida 
louisiana north carolina tennessee texas and virginia do not 
fly the battle flag officially 
the norfolk va city council under pressure from the local 
naacp recently voted to stop displaying the flag at meetings 
while flag opponents hedge their bets on intense lobbying and 
public outcry for action flag supporters are preparing to talk the 
issue down 
if it takes a filibuster im going to do it mcconnell 
said i hope we can reach a consensus where the naacp will 
decide that conciliation rather than confrontation is better for 
all of us on this

israels staterun television and radio have 
been accused of playing down the extent of palestinian unrest in 
the occupied lands 
since the violence in the west bank and gaza strip began 
israeli viewers only once saw troops beat protesters and rarely see 
pictures of arabs wounded by gunfire tv anchors often refer to the 
situation as relatively quiet 
by contrast tv viewers in the united states often see soldiers 
beating arab protesters and palestinians who have been wounded or 
killed by gunfire 
after nearly three months of violence un figures show 74 
arabs have died in rioting mostly by israeli gunfire 
there appear to be three reasons for the lowkey coverage in 
israel concerns that too much publicity will encourage arab 
protesters and spark more violence patriotic journalism or 
the reluctance to report stories that weaken the morale of 
soldiers and in some cases official censorship 
if i compare the reports we are getting from around the world 
to what the israeli people are watching it looks like we are 
talking about two different places said israel peleg a former 
member of the israel broadcast authoritys board of directors 
the israel broadcast authority which runs television and radio 
barred this reporter from interviewing broadcast journalists 
but yair stern head of the tvs news division said the 
coverage was considered too critical by many israelis if the 
action is tough we get up to 100 calls a night most from people 
who say they dont want to see this or want us to be more favorable 
to the government he said 
stern rejected charges that tv intentionally softpedaled bad 
news he acknowledged the station had only once shown soldiers 
beating palestinians but cited as the reason lack of footage not 
censorship 
the footage of the only beating shown was provided by cbs 
television and showed soldiers kicking and hitting with rocks two 
bound arabs in the west bank city of nablus last week 
but israeli editors cut the most gruesome scenes including one 
in which a soldier who seemed to be breaking the arms of one of the 
arabs 
israel radio quoted uri porat the directorgeneral of the 
israel broadcast authority as saying the scenes were deleted 
because of a television ban on showing atrocities and because some 
viewers might not be mature enough to deal with such images 
in defending the coverage stern said israel tv tried to present 
longer background pieces while american networks collect the 
highlight of action from here and there and then wrap it up in 50 
seconds thats why the impression in america is of violence and 
only violence 
but several israeli print journalists rejected those 
explanations israeli newspapers cover the arab protests much more 
aggressively than television and radio and have broken several 
stories about army brutality including an incident in which 
soldiers allegedly buried alive four arabs after a protest 
the yediot ahronot newspaper described the television and radio 
coverage as vegetarian sterile 
they have this longwinded piece that there were disturbances 
and then you hear five people were badly wounded said ari rath 
managing editor of the englishlanguage jerusalem post 
in an editorial he complained of a new clean language by 
israels radio and television that calls major clashes between 
civilians and troops mere disturbances 
rath said he didnt know of widespread official censorship but 
said some broadcast journalists apparently held back on their own 
in part it could be a subconscious selfdefense to an 
increasingly embarrassing and painful situation rath said you 
try not to call a spade a spade 
peleg a former director of the government press office added 
the selfrestraint in israel tv has reached a point where there 
is no need for censorship or political interference

dr henry heimlich the physician who developed 
a maneuver to save choking victims is trying to treat cancer 
patients in mexico by deliberately giving them malaria a newspaper 
reported 
heimlich has treated three people at a mexico city hospital 
since december by infecting them with a nonlethal strain of 
malaria on the belief that the 103 to 104degree fever produced by 
the disease kills cancer cells the cleveland plain dealer said 
sunday 
heimlich 67 believes that malaria in addition to killing 
cancer through fever can stimulate the bodys natural immune 
system to fight cancer 
malaria is an infection caused by parasitic microorganisms and 
is spread by mosquitoes it causes high fevers sweats and chills 
some medical researchers say heimlichs procedures should be 
tested first on laboratory animals and tissue cultures they also 
said they were skeptical about the quality of cancer research in 
mexico 
us food and drug administration officials said heimlichs 
socalled malariatherapy was not an acceptable treatment or 
therapy 
george blatt director of the health fraud unit in fdas drug 
evaluation and research center said mexico was more lenient than 
the united states in what they allow in the practice of 
medicine 
most of what we call quack clinics are not prohibited in 
mexico blatt said 
heimlich contacted sunday at his home in cincinnati said that 
describing his work as southoftheborder research is 
despicable he said cancer research regulations in mexico were 
more stringent than those in the united states 
we had conferences with the very highest levels of mexicos 
government and very careful protocol was laid out to protect the 
rights choice and selection of patients much much more than is 
required in this country said heimlich a professor at xavier 
university in cincinnati and head of the heimlich institute 
the first patient was given the nonlethal strain of malaria 
plasmodium vivax on dec 23 she was a 27yearold woman dying of 
rectal cancer two others men in their 50s were given malaria in 
january the newspaper reported 
heimlich said he developed his theories after he said studies 
showed that third world nations with high malaria rates had low 
incidences of cancer 
officials of the american cancer society and the federal 
governments national cancer institute said they had never heard of 
the malaria therapy according to the newspaper

donald kaschalk has had fewer birthdays than any 
of his seven children 
my youngest boy is 19 and im just going to celebrate my 14th 
birthday says the east detroit milkman who was born on leap day 
in 1932 
like other folks born on feb 29 kaschalks actual birthday 
rolls around only once every four years its a studder step in 
time that compensates for the 365 days it takes the earth to orbit 
the sun 
the us census bureau estimates about 9600 babies were born in 
the united states on feb 29 1984 and a similar number of infants 
should be born today 
its truly delightful said ypsilanti businessman peter 
fletcher who was born the same day as kaschalk the common 
reaction is one of sympathy and lament because you dont have a 
frequent natal commemoration 
but that very streak of sympathy provokes people to make it 
even more memorable when i was in my callow youth people would 
try to compensate for it by having a veritable spate of shivarees 
and celebrations for me 
jason weiner whos celebrating birthday no 3 though he turned 
12 today takes it all in stride 
its ok i guess said the sixthgrader at maple elementary 
school in walled lake 
this is his third birthday said jasons mom joyce weiner 
we used to celebrate it on the 28th of february but the last 
few years hes said he wants to celebrate it on march 1 
the traditional observance of leap year began in 46 bc when 
julius caesar adopted the egyptian calendar and the western world 
began counting years with 365 days each 
the added day every fourth year keeps the earths calendar in 
line with the suns rotation

residents of the rural valley where 
arizona gov evan mecham grew up find it hard to believe he has 
done anything wrong no matter that he has been indicted and 
impeached 
the dairy farmers son who left the uintah basin when he joined 
the army air corps in 1943 was industrious and studious kind of 
quiet and a model citizen neighbors and relatives recall 
we cant believe he isnt a good man and see no reason for 
impeachment ive not found anybody who couldnt praise evan and 
his integrity said birdie swasey a retired teacher who has 
known the mecham family since the great depression 
beverly fieldsted who was one year behind evan in school and 
whose brotherinlaw lives in the former mecham residence down the 
road in mount emmons agrees 
they were not a crooked family evan didnt steal money she 
said he worked hard on the farm he went to school he minded 
his own business he wasnt a smartalecky showy kid 
while defending mechams integrity mrs swasey acknowledged 
that the governor whose impeachment trial was scheduled to begin 
today may have spoken carelessly at times 
i suppose hes not a politician he may have spoken quickly 
you have to learn the rules of society be sophisticated you 
cant be naive like a child and say everything that pops into your 
head she said 
mecham and his family occasionally return to this expansive 
valley along the south slope of the uinta mountains to visit 
relatives who remain supportive 
i hate to see them treat him so badly said edith burton 
mechams aunt i just stopped listening to the news because it 
made me feel bad i knew much of it wasnt true 
mecham said recently that his home country was the greatest 
place to grow up i always apologize to my children that i raised 
them in the city and not in a place like that 
mechams father adelbert settled in mountain home in 1908 and 
married ina hanberg there in 1916 evan the fifth of six children 
was born may 12 1924 
when evan was 12 the family moved to mount emmons where they 
had a humble home a dairy ran a store and raised a few crops 
the governor said we didnt have much but we werent poor ive 
never felt poor in my life 
being a dairy farmers son during the depression and early war 
years forged evans character including those traits responsible 
for his current problems friends said 
hes never been a quitter said his cousin ona rust 
thats why hes hanging in there now to clear his name 
in 1942 18yearold evan took over most farm duties when his 
father became incapacitated by rheumatoid arthritis evan was 
forced to cut back on schoolwork but kept up his grades and earned 
an agricultural scholarship to utah state university 
he had a reputation of someone who always worked hard to get 
what he got said former neighbor harry fieldsted adding i 
dont know if he was any smarter but he seemed to apply himself 
more 
mecham sang and danced at mormon church functions and was 
elected student body president his junior year at altamont high 
school though he was kidded about his shyness in the 1941 yearbook 
mechams date at the altamont junior prom florence lambert 
became his wife and they later had seven children the couple 
settled in arizona after world war ii when mecham studied business 
at arizona state university and became an auto dealer

take note of today monday there wont be 
another like it until 1992 
its leap year when a day which seems to come from nowhere is 
added to february and the year is 366 days long instead of 365 
the astronomers of julius caesar in 46 bc decided it 
they said that as the solar year was 365 days and 6 hours the 
hours made an extra day every four years 
why leap 
the oxford english dictionary says and you may have to read 
this twice that the year probably got its name because any fixed 
festival after february in such a year falls on the next weekday 
but one to that on which it fell in the preceding year not on the 
next weekday as usual 
a leaping over day you see 
according to popular tradition in britain a woman on this day 
has the right to ask a man to marry her instead of the other way 
round 
english folklore has it that any woman having her feb 29 
proposal rebuffed can claim a silk dress from the man 
in 1288 a law was enacted in scotland to give women the right to 
propose on feb 29 it said any maiden lady shall hae liberte to 
bespeke ye man she likes 
if the man refused he had to pay the lady a pound a lot of 
money in those days unless he could claim he was already 
betrothed 
a few years later france passed a simliar law and it was also 
legalized in the 15th century in the italian cities of genoa and 
florence 
a british romantic fiction publisher named silhouette seeking 
to find out modern manners of proposing asked the gallup poll to 
include a leap year question in its survey 
the poll found that women who propose to the man of their dreams 
on feb 29 have a 92 percent chance of success 
but only 12 percent of the women questioned for the survey it 
didnt say how many responded that they would seriously consider 
popping the question on this day 
jane ellison a columnist on a london daily the independent 
asked today how many men are worth waiting four years to propose 
to these days 
ms ellison suggested using leap year sensibly by relocating 
those annual events you dread to feb 29 
among her choices the university boat race the next andrew 
lloyd webber musical and christmas

to the state john gacy is a sex murderer many 
times over who deserves to die to sue terry hes a real nice 
person shed like to marry 
ms terry came to this feeling by exchanging letters during the 
last 16 months and through repeated visits to gacy at menard 
correctional center where hes on death row for murdering 33 young 
men and boys 
most of the victims were buried in the crawl space under his 
home northwest of chicago 
excerpts of some of gacys 41 letters to the 43yearold 
centralia woman from oct 5 1986 to feb 16 were published sunday 
and today in the chicago suntimes 
she said gacy 45 expects to be paroled and she believes hes 
innocent of the sex killings 
gacy is under 12 separate death sentences and 21 terms of 
natural life in prison with no hope of parole 
were real close she said i like john and he trusts me 
i guess i love him yes 
ms terry a divorced mother of eight children who is also 
helping to raise two grandchildren said gacy has asked her to 
marry him she said she would 
i was gullible and trusted others thats how i got where i am 
today gacy wrote in one letter published today i could lay 
back and say its not my fault i am here because i know i never 
killed anyone the facts will back me up but i am guilty of being 
gullible and trusting others so i belong here for letting myself 
down 
gacy also wrote of how he cried watching the olympics and the 
devotion of the athletes he scolded ms terry for not selling any 
of his oil paintings and he told of how he was going to run a 
strict household for ms terrys children when he gets out of 
prison and they all live together 
however attorney terry sullivan who prosecuted gacy said he 
is more likely to be executed than paroled 
ms terry said she first met gacy at menard in august 1986 
seven months after she first wrote him a brief note 
i decided to go back because well hes real nice hes a 
real nice person and he seems to be really concerned about me and 
my kids

cardinal bernard f law says the roman catholic 
church has been guilty of racism and has put horrendous 
obstacles in the way of black catholics 
at a special mass sunday where more than 1000 black catholics 
celebrated the past and future of blacks in the boston archdiocese 
the boston archbishop said the faith of black catholics has been 
tremendously tested by the church which put such horrendous 
obstacles in their way but the faith endured even under the most 
extraordinarily difficult circumstances 
following the mass which also marked black history month law 
said racism is not conquered not here or anywhere else but 
what were seeing is a very positive sign 
racism is a sin it offends god the church is made up of 
sinners not saints and one of the churchs sins has been racism 
for that we are repentant 
there are an estimated 25000 blacks among the 19 million 
catholics in the boston archdiocese 
the mass at the cathedral of the holy cross featured the singing 
of hymns by soloists meyer chambers philiss baker and denise 
graves 
were so accustomed to holding back in the catholic church 
but today was a chance to live our own heritage to open up 
chambers said its been a long time coming

northwest airlines 6700 flight 
attendants continued to keep the carrier guessing today on whether 
they will strike three days after a union deadline for reaching a 
new contract 
both sides in the labor talks said just one issue divided them 
but william genoese international director of the teamsters 
unions airline division said late sunday that no further 
negotiations were scheduled 
at this moment were in strike position it can happen two 
minutes from now or any other time under the law we have that 
right genoese said 
he said absenteeism had increased among flight attendants 
they are calling in sick its on the increase genoese 
said but he declined to categorize the absences as a negotiating 
tactic saying im not going to say that 
representatives of the airline and the union met with a federal 
mediator for four hours sunday and agreed on all but one contract 
issue said northwest spokesman william wren wren and genoese said 
the issue is northwests proposal to increase from five to nine 
years the period that newly hired workers stay on a lower pay scale 
genoese said he sent a telegram to steven g rothmeier chairman 
and chief executive officer of nwa inc the parent company of 
northwest requesting a meeting wren said late sunday he did not 
know if rothmeier knew of the request 
northwest officials said sunday the airline continued to operate 
a normal flight schedule no delays were reported at airports 
served by the carrier 
if flight attendants do strike the airline said it will keep 
flying using about 2000 managers trained as flight attendants 
were and 200 newly hired replacements 
genoese said he planned to meet today with representatives of 
the pilots and machinists on whether they would honor flight 
attendant picket lines 
a strike deadline late friday was extended as the two sides 
continued negotiations that began wednesday genoese said saturday 
night that a request by the federal mediator to delay a strike 
helped avert a walkout earlier in the day 
former republic airlines flight attendants have been working 
under their old contract since northwest acquired republic in 1986 
and many of them are paid less than their northwest counterparts 
the company the nations fifthlargest airline is trying to 
bring the workers under one contract and offered to bring former 
republic employees up to the salary levels of northwest employees 
but the union claimed the airline wanted too much in exchange 
including cuts in vacation pay and retirement benefits

in a sundappled forest on the outskirts of 
geneva a soviet negotiator and his american counterpart meet to 
discuss among other things the nuclear arms race and the fate of 
the world 
they are a diplomatic odd couple the russian andrey botvinnik 
is gregarious impulsive and almost childlike in his enthusiasm for 
the frivolous the american john honeyman is officious 
humorless a bit priggish and irritatingly sincere about his new 
job as the us representative to the arms control talks 
their oneonone marathon conversations make up lee blessings 
a walk in the woods a wise and witty evening of theater that 
arrived sunday at broadways booth theater 
the russian wants to discuss country music italian suits and 
making love to redhaired women he wants a pal not protocol 
formality is simply anger with its hair combed he coos 
the earnest american wants to steer the talk back to the 
negotiations he wants results friendship he says takes 
you away from commitment to solving problems 
the twocharacter play was inspired by a true incident in 1982 
involving american arms adviser paul nitze and a soviet negotiator 
blessing takes their reallife rustic ramble and embellishes on it 
transforming their meeting into a theatrical situation laced with 
humor grace and intelligence 
some twoperson plays are like tennis matches they are made up 
of relentless backandforth banter that exhausts the audience 
without leading anywhere a walk in the woods has its share of 
volleys and it dallies a bit particularly in the second act 
still it manages to make its point about the need to keep trying 
for peace with a minimum of preaching 
in part the play succeeds because blessing refrains from 
overloading the evening with technical jargon and antiwar sermons 
there may be references to mx missiles megadeaths star wars 
bargaining chips lasers and afghanistan but the emphasis is on 
the men not specific ways of averting nuclear destruction 
by the time the two diplomats have walked through these woods 
during four different seasons they have grown to understand and 
even like each other that knowledge comes at the same time they 
realize their two countries while proclaiming interest in peace 
have little desire to slow down the arms race 
if that makes the play sound unusually somber it isnt a 
walk in the woods has its share of belly laughs most of them 
supplied by robert prosky best known as sgt jablonski on 
televisions hill street blues hes a big beefy actor who 
inhabits the very soul of the soviet diplomat and who even 
negotiates a convincing russian accent but the characters 
joviality masks a cynicism fed by too many years at the bargaining 
table if mankind hated war there would be millions of us and 
only two soldiers he says 
sam waterston as the somber american plays straight man to 
prosky except for one wonderful comic monologue in the second act 
when he explains what happened after he threw a gum wrapper on 
switzerlands spotless soil but for much of the time this 
reliable actor is left to deliver conventional presentday 
attitudes on the horrors of the arms race its to waterstons 
credit that he makes them seem part of his characters idealistic 
beliefs rather than soapbox oratory 
the play has been directed by des mcanuff in an understated 
manner with movement kept to a minimum for a good deal of the 
evening the two actors just sit on a park bench set squarely in 
the center of a woodsy glade designed by bill clarke and washed in 
a delicate light by richard riddell 
richlooking earth nearly spills into the first few rows of the 
theater and a forest of trees soars to the top of the proscenium 
arch its an inviting tranquil setting the perfect place to 
ruminate on what would be lost if the two superpowers didnt 
continue their walks in the woods 
in other reviews 
the new york times frank rich offered guarded praise for the 
actors work and called the set with the trees changing with the 
seasons pretentious rich said the play fudges the 
distinctions of actual international politics and arms negotiation 
choosing instead to telescope the messy lifeordeath conflict 
into a sentimental relationship between two likable envoys 
in the daily news howard kissel roundly praised waterston and 
prosky it is waterstons most moving work in years he wrote 
it is hard to imagine a more perfect actor to play the wily 
soviet 
said kissel a few times the play seems coy or tendentious 
but the two are so powerful we never forget its about frail men 
fighting quixotically against their awareness of futility

a pakistani delegation left for 
geneva today for what could be the conclusive round of peace talks 
on afghanistan as the islamabad government hastened efforts to 
reach a consensus on its position 
prime minister mohammad khan junejo spent the weekend consulting 
cabinet ministers and opposition lawmakers over whether to couple a 
soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan with the formation of an 
interim kabul government 
he convened a closed joint session of parliament to debate the 
issue sunday night and was scheduled to hold another cabinet 
meeting today 
we will contribute positively to the talks in accordance with 
the aspirations of our people the state minister for foreign 
affairs zain noorani said today as he prepared to depart from 
islamabad airport as head of the pakistani delegation 
on wednesday it is to begin working out the final details of a 
soviet troop withdrawal indirectly with kabuls communist 
government 
informed pakistani and foreign sources in islamabad speaking on 
condition of anonymity said islamabad still has not decided 
whether to sign an accord with the governing peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan under its current leader najib 
moscow which first sent troops to afghanistan in december 1979 
announced feb 8 it is prepared to start pulling out its estimated 
115000 troops beginning may 15 
however pakistani officials recently have insisted that a peace 
accord should be accompanied by a political settlement to ensure 
the safe return of about 35 million afghan refugees now in 
pakistan 
afghan resistance leaders headquartered in peshawar pakistan 
last week proposed an interim government virtually excluding 
najibs party najib criticized the proposal over the weekend 
according to official radio kabul 
washington the moslem rebels main military backer has said a 
political accord was desireable but should not hold up the 
geneva document which would pave the way for a soviet pullout 
prime minister junejo has taken the unprecedented step of 
calling opposition groups outside parliament for consultations on 
the issue on march 5 minister noorani is scheduled to return to 
islamabad for the meeting 
opposition leaders including benazir bhutto of the pakistan 
peoples party withheld immediate response to the invitation 
officials of their umbrella organization the movement for the 
restoration of democracy indicated they will reply in unison 
the hectic political activity has been typical since soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev made his dramatic feb 8 offer to start 
bringing the red army home 60 days after the signing of a geneva 
accord 
in a surprise move prime minister rajiv gandhi of india on 
saturday invited pakistan president mohammad zia ulhaq to new 
delhi to discuss the issue but zia declined by reversing the 
invitation 
indian foreign secretary kps menon on tuesday will come to 
islamabad instead it was decided 
pakistan based its rebuff on indias prosoviet stance and 
gandhis repeated refusal to accept zias invitations to islamabad 
zia went to new delhi in december 1985 in hopes of launching 
friendship talks but gandhi has never reciprocated

at least 20 government soldiers were 
killed in clashes with communist rebels and an aide to president 
corazon aquino said she will not extend an amnesty for communist 
and moslem rebels 
mrs aquino first made the controversial amnesty offer in 
february 1987 following the breakdown of peace talks with the 
communistdominated national democratic front she extended it for 
another six months the following august 
an official at the presidential palace speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the program administered by the national economic 
development authority would expire on schedule tonight at midnight 
rebels who will come down from the hills starting tomorrow 
will be charged in court for crimes they committed he said 
the official added that rebels who had already surrendered will 
continue to receive government assistance 
the military had been unenthusiastic about the program because 
senior officers complained it enabled rebels to avoid prosecution 
for killing soldiers military dissidents arrested after previous 
coup attempts also complained that they should be granted the same 
amnesty as the rebels 
officials at the national economic development authority claim 
nearly 60000 people mostly communist rebels or their supporters 
surrendered under the amnesty program but the authority admitted 
that only 6252 were regulars of the 23000strong communist new 
peoples army 
critics of the program believe those figures are inflated 
journalists who attended several mass surrender ceremonies found 
that many of those claiming to be rebels or their supporters were 
simply impoverished peasants seeking government handouts or trying 
to avoid military attacks on their villages 
as the deadline approached it appeared the communists were 
gearing up for a new round of fighting at least 20 soldiers were 
killed in scattered battles with the rebels over the weekend 
the rebels on sunday stormed a philippine constabulary 
headquarters on negros island killing six government troopers and 
looting the garrison of its weapons the military said today 
on saturday 12 elite scout rangers died when their truck ran 
over a land mine between guinobatan and jovellar towns in albay 
province 200 miles southeast of manila 
troops killed four ebels in the ensuing gun battle the military 
said 
elsewhere rebels killed two philippine constabulary sergeants 
in leyte province saturday and soldiers killed two rebels in bohol 
province according to military reports

look down on the ground its a bird 
its a plane its an eyesore 
its a stinson reliant spotter plane strange visitor from 
another era that now looms behind william surgis home 
if we had really wanted to look at airplanes we wouldve 
moved next door to an airport said barbara reeks see how 
youd like it day after day out there where you have no choice 
but to look at it 
said her nextdoor neighbor anne sullivan whats he think 
hes going to do fly that thing out of here 
the single engine is missing from the plane built in 1943 for 
the royal canadian air force the original fabric covering its 
wings has been reduced to ragged strips of cloth fluttering from 
the rusty steel frame 
surgi 64 a retired navy mechanic and world war ii veteran 
said he is restoring the aircraft as a hobby until it is 
airworthy he wants to work on it behind his home 
city officials say theres no law against that though some 
neighbors are complaining that the industrial flavor of surgis 
yard may drive down property values 
surgi who concedes that his hobby is an eyesore at the moment 
has been cited by the city for running a junkyard and for storing 
so much debris that it attracted rats 
however he said his project has the support of most of his 
neighbors and displayed a petition he said was signed in his 
behalf by 98 neighbors 
the city has set a march 21 public hearing on the issue a 
proposed amendment to the city code would prohibit the storage or 
repair of an airplane in residential areas unless it is inside a 
building 
if he makes the plane flightworthy hell have to dismantle it 
and take it to an airfield to fly it surgi said

two decades after the kerner commission 
issued its report on us racial conditions panelists at a 
conference here said prejudice is no longer the main reason many 
innercity blacks live in poverty 
the problem is not a problem of a defective people the 
problem is a problem of a politically and economically defective 
system said roger w wilkins an assistant us attorney general 
under thenpresident johnson 
and until we get that message across we are going to continue 
to grind up and destroy people 
wilkins said nationwide programs focusing resources on specific 
disadvantaged areas and people will be neccessary before any 
progress can be made 
a growing number of people are living in an urban underclass 
in inner city neighborhoods where the social and family support 
system has been eroded by the flight of people who could afford to 
leave participants said 
the report by the national commission on civil disorders also 
called the kerner commission was issued feb 29 1968 the panel 
named by johnson and chaired by illinois gov otto kerner examined 
the causes of racial tension that led to riots in large cities 
across the united states 
the report in addition to calling for solutions to the problems 
of the black ghettos tied the riots to a trend in which america 
was moving toward two societies one black one white separate 
and unequal 
participants at the weekend conference due to end today said 
racial prejudice still exists but that the growth of a black 
middle class has made the ghettos less a racial phenomenon than a 
structural one 
william julius wilson a professor of sociology and public 
policy at the university of chicago said there are 20 percent more 
underclass people living in the ghettos of the nations 50 
largest cities than when the kerner report was issued he said this 
is so despite the fact that those cities suffered a 5 percent 
overall population decrease between 1970 and 1980 
the extreme poverty in such areas eliminates many of the 
services and social outlets available in the larger more 
prosperous society at large resulting in an increase in crime and 
a decrease in the aspirations of the impoverished wilson said 
banks stores professional services churches theyre 
either leaving or losing their audiences he said 
ronald mincy of the urban institute in washington said racism 
was at the root of the rage that spurred the urban unrest of the 
1960s but that social class should be the focus of contemporary 
discussion of the impoverished 
the black poor of today dont just compare unfavorably with 
white america but also with a growing section of black america 
he said 
wilkins now a professor of history and american culture at 
george mason university in fairfax va said it will ultimately be 
up to both whites and blacks to solve the problems of the 
underclass 
the conference was cosponsored by the institute for public 
policy of the university of new mexico the 1988 commission on the 
cities and the johnson foundation

the st petersburg times has 
endorsed republican bob dole and democrat michael dukakis in 
floridas super tuesday primary 
senate minority leader dole of kansas demonstrates a capacity 
for independent leadership and the ability to study a complex 
issue to make up his own mind about its merits and to persuade 
others to follow the newspaper said sunday 
in the democratic column the newspaper said dukakis strongest 
suit was his 2 terms as massachusetts governor and praised his 
reputation for conciliation and consensusbuilding 
dole and vice president george bush are siamese twins in their 
positions on the issues but the newspaper faulted bush for his 
failure to separate his views from those of the reagan 
administration

president abdou diouf declared a state of 
emergency to quell violent demonstrations that began today 
following radio reports that he was winning reelection by a 
landslide 
witnesses said truncheonswinging riot police battled students 
in the northern section of the capital and rockthrowing protesters 
destroyed several buses in the southern section 
a broadcast on national radio said all public meetings were 
banned and that the emergency declaration was being made in 
response to grave troubles this morning 
the radio said diouf who polled 835 percent in the 1983 
election received 77 percent of the vote in early returns it said 
early returns showed the leading opposition candidate abdoulaye 
wade of the senegalese democratic party got 21 percent of the 
vote two other candidates split the rest 
diouf had been expected to easily win reelection to a second 
fiveyear term in sundays voting but opposition candidates 
charged sunday that dioufs socialist party was handing out 
fraudulent voting cards to his supporters 
reporters saw riot police break up a meeting today of the 
opposition senegalese democratic party outside party headquarters 
a photographer for the associated press was arrested and his camera 
and film confiscated 
the opposition party earlier had threatened demonstrations if 
the government announced election returns before they had been 
certified by the countrys supreme court which hears challenges to 
results 
armored personnel carriers mounted with machine guns blocked 
major entrances near the opposition party headquarters and to the 
university of dakar where dozens of people were arrested today 
during clashes with police 
witnesses said police moved in to break up a group of students 
who had gathered on campus and that police broke into the 
students residences knocking down doors and throwing tear gas 
grenades into the rooms 
a group of moroccan students told reporters they had been taken 
out of their beds by police dragged outside on the lawn and beaten 
with rubber truncheons 
those who had been singled out for beatings also had their heads 
shaved by police students said 
although the election campaign had been marred by battles 
between police and opposition supporters the only reported trouble 
on election day was in the northern town of kebemer a radio france 
international reporter said police fired on a group of young 
senegalese democratic party supporters who were throwing rocks at 
them 
the kebemer hospital said four people were treated and released 
and two others were hospitalized after surgery no other details 
were available 
diouf was appointed to succeed president leopold senghor who 
retired in 1981 
his party was expected to maintain its majority in the national 
assembly although it appeared likely it would lose some of the 111 
seats won in the 1983 elections 
candidates from four parties were contesting the presidency 
while six parties had candidates running for seats in the 
legislature 
the opposition parties have called for changes in the electoral 
process 
wade has repeatedly claimed there was widespread fraud in the 
1983 voting and threatened to turn his party into a national 
liberation movement if sundays voting was rigged

the body of a 23yearold northern 
ireland man who was shot to death at a british army checkpoint 
was reburied in the irish republic after a second autopsy 
irish prime minister charles haughey was expected to tell 
parliament on tuesday about the results of the examination of the 
body of aidan mcanespie 
in a snub of britain haughey has ordered an investigation into 
the feb 21 killing which occurred across the border in the 
britishruled north a british soldier has been charged with 
unlawful killing 
mcanespies body was exhumed sunday after his family requested 
that an autopsy by done by an irishman a british autopsy already 
had been completed 
the second postmortem was conducted at monaghan general 
hospital by dr john harbison irelands chief state pathologist 
the body was then reburied sunday night 
haugheys order for the inquiry has upset the british government 
and infuriated the majority protestant politicians in the north 
who see it as interference in their affairs 
harold mccusker a protestant lawmaker said it was always 
clear that this inquiry was designed not to help but to embarrass 
the british government and to question its procedures and honesty 
my own view is that this inquiry will not produce anything 
startling or embarrassing though it will be used for that 
purpose mccusker said 
mcanespie belonged to the roman catholic minority and his 
sister eilish mccabe claimed sunday that her brother had received 
a number of death threats from the british army 
she said british soldiers constantly harassed her brother as he 
crossed the border between his home in the north and his workplace 
in the republic 
the army said the bullet that hit mcanespie was fired 
accidentally and ricocheted an 18yearold soldier charged with 
unlawful killing is held on bail in military care 
the mcanespie family lawyer pat fahy said there was autopsy 
evidence to show the fatal shot entered the body from the front 
rather than the back as indicated by authorities in northern 
ireland 
mcanspie was buried last tuesday in clara county monaghan 
across the border from his home at aughnacloy

super tuesday was hailed today as the 
main event of the primary season as centrist democrats who had 
hoped to give the presidential campaign a southern flavor opened a 
twoday meeting 
democrats cant win the white house without winning the 
south former gov charles robb of virginia told the democratic 
leadership council 
robb is the outgoing chairman of the council and a prime mover 
in getting southern states to hold nearly all their primaries and 
caucuses on march 8 now dubbed super tuesday he said the 20 
states that will vote that day represent the first broadbased 
test of the primary season the first opportunity for the 
candidates to address a truly national audience 
he said that as the sun rises on super tuesday fewer than 10 
percent of the delegates to the democratic national convention will 
have been selected by sunset as a result of voting that begins on 
the shores of the atlantic ocean and ends thousands of miles away 
in the pacific ocean over 40 percent of the delegates to atlanta 
site of the convention will have been chosen 
robb also noted that the super tuesday states represent 207 
electoral votes 76 percent of the total needed to be elected 
president 
so to a large extent he said the general election 
chances of the democratic party rest with these 20 states the 
preliminaries are over and super tuesday is indisputably the main 
event of the primary season 
in at least one sense however super tuesday is not turning out 
as some of its creators had hoped three of the leading democratic 
contenders were pursuing agendas far from that advocated by the 
democratic eadership council 
the candidate with the largest base in the south is jesse 
jackson who has referred scornfully to the dlc as the democratic 
leisure class 
another leading contender is gov michael dukakis of 
massachusetts whose northeast base is exactly the wrong place most 
dlc members think the party ought to look for its next nominee 
rep richard gephardt of missouri was a founder of the dlc but 
has become a leading 1988 contender by advocating the kind of trade 
sanctions sought by organized labor and anathema to the dlc 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee the southerner in the race 
but never a particular favorite of the dlc is pursuing a super 
tuesday strategy taking stands to the right of his rivals 
the democrats dlc members most wanted to see in the presidential 
race were sen sam nunn of georgia and former gov charles robb of 
virginia robb is ending a term as dlc chairman and will be 
replaced by nunn 
the dlc was established in the wake of the 1984 election in 
which democratic presidential candidate walter f mondale carried 
only one state that landslide defeat was the partys fourth loss 
in the last five presidential elections 
the problem decided many democratic officials from the south 
and west was the disproportionate weight wielded in the party by 
labor minority groups and eastern liberals it was time to give 
the south a stronger voice in choosing the next nominee and time to 
diminish the importance of iowa and new hampshire 
thus was born super tuesday which amounts to a southern 
regional primary twenty states will hold primaries or caucuses on 
march 8 a majority of them south of the masondixon line 
a discussion of the super tuesday challenge was on the 
agenda for the dlcs twoday meeting at colonial williamsburg 
other topics included democratic capitalism new strategies 
for growth with equity and citizenship and national service 
but the most watched event of the meeting will be a debate 
monday night between five of the partys six presidential 
candidates 
participating in the forum at the college of william and mary 
are gephardt jackson gore dukakis and former sen gary hart of 
colorado 
not joining was sen paul simon of illinois who is passing up 
super tuesday 
the most recent democratic debate on saturday in atlanta was a 
contentious confrontation with dukakis gephardt and gore attacking 
each other 
displaying his most aggressive style of the campaign dukakis 
focused on gephardts vote in favor of president reagans 1981 tax 
cut and said gore has never run a government 
gephardt retorted that dukakis had raised taxes about 10 
times in massachusetts while gore said the governor would need 
on the job training in foreign policy

mayor edward i koch called president reagan a 
wimp in the war on drugs today after taking out a fullpage ad in 
the new york times urging the president to cut economic aid to 
drugproducing countries 
the mayors ad bore a blackbordered picture of a 22yearold 
rookie policeman murdered last week in the drugravaged south 
jamaica section of queens 
we are truly in a war with the drug pushers but the president 
is not acting as the commanderinchief if anything hes acting 
as a wimp koch said today on cbs this morning 
koch said the ad attempted to channel this rage that the whole 
city is feeling about the killing friday of officer edward byrne 
who was shot three times while guarding the house of a threatened 
witness in a drug case 
the 12900 ad paid for by kochs 1989 reelection committee 
said byrne was killed by a gunman who very probably was acting 
on instructions from a new york drug kingpin 
reagan is expected to sign an order tuesday exempting some 
countries from a law mandating cuts in economic and military aid

the united states will not impose maximum 
penalties against panama for failing to take steps to control drug 
trafficking a newspaper reported today 
under a 1986 antidrug law the president has until tuesday to 
certify whether countries in which major drug trafficking occurs 
are fully cooperating in efforts to fight the trafficking 
the new york times quoting senior reagan administration 
officials said president reagan last weekend signed an order to 
decertify panama but that he declined to use his discretionary 
powers to impose the maximum penalties 
however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president has not made a decision it hasnt gone to him yet 
its going today 
the law requires the united states to vote against new loans by 
international development banks such as the world bank and the 
international monetary fund to decertified countries in the case 
of panama the united states also would be obliged to keep in place 
the military and economic sanctions imposed last year 
other sanctions reagan has the power to impose include the 
barring of airline flights between panama and the united states 
imposition of a 50 percent tax on all panamaniam imports and the 
loss of preferential tariff treatment 
some administration officials have said the president should 
impose full sanctions as a means of conveying disapproval to gen 
manuel antonio noriega panamas de facto leader noriega was 
indicted in florida this month on drugtrafficking charges 
it was not known why reagan chose not to use all the mechanisms 
under the law but some officials speculated that the 
administration wants to wait until events become more stable in 
panama panamas president eric arturo delvalle was ousted on 
friday by the countrys assembly which noriega controls

hanged in public in the iranian capital during the weekend for 
bombings irna monitored in nicosia said five men were hanged 
saturday 
a senior commander of tehrans revolutionary committees which 
have largely taken over security from civilian police announced 
saturday that 30 people responsible for recent bombings in tehran 
and western iran had been arrested 
he said the suspects described as paid iraqi agents would 
be handed over to the revolutionary courts for trial 
irna did not specify whether the seven men executed were part of 
the group of 30 reported arrested 
irna identified the two men hanged sunday as mohammed kazimzadeh 
and rasoul rahmani it said the islamic revolutionary court 
convicted them of planting bombs spying for iraq and transporting 
explosives to tehran from iraq 
they received a large amount of money from iraq for the 
bombings the agency said 
the two men were sentenced to death for bombings last year in a 
tehran square and were hanged at the scene of their crime irna 
said 
the latest reported bombing in tehran was feb 18 when a car 
bomb exploded on a tehran expressway wounding two people

north tehrans martyr bahonar avenue only a few hundred yards from 
the residence of iranian revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
letting the federal government apply retroactively a formula that 
limits reimbursement paid to hospitals treating medicare patients 
the court said it will hear reagan administration arguments that 
some hospitals could reap a windfall from the ban on retroactive 
application of the formula 
the government in 1981 adopted a rule that excluded from the 
medicare reimbursement formula wages paid by hospitals owned by the 
federal government 
the idea was to save money by not applying national pay scales 
to private hospitals in areas with lower wage levels 
but the department of health and human services adopted the new 
rule without allowing a time for the public to comment on the 
proposal the formula was challenged by private hospitals and 
thrown out by a federal judge as a violation of proper rulemaking 
procedures 
the federal agency adopted the rule again in 1984 using the 
correct procedure but this time the department applied the rule 
retroactively to reimbursement sought by the hospitals beginning 
july 1 1981 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last june that the 
formula may not be applied retroactively and awarded more than 2 
million in reimbursement money to seven hospitals 
the appeals court said that if the government believes any 
hospital has received excess reimbursement each case must be 
proved 
the justice department in its appeal to the supreme court said 
the appeals court ruling would effectively eliminate the only 
realistic method available to make retroactive corrections to 
reimbursement decisions 
the hospitals involved in the case are georgetown university 
hospital howard university hospital and greater southeast 
community hospital all in the district of columbia tucson general 
and tucson medical center in arizona st cloud hospital in 
minnesota and community hospital of battle creek mich 
the case is bowen vs georgetown university hospital 871097

a reporters attempt to force the state 
department to release documents from us embassies around the 
world failed in the supreme court today 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that threw out 
donald f goldbergs lawsuit which had been filed under the 
freedom of information act 
goldberg a reporter on the staff of syndicated columnist jack 
anderson filed an foia request in 1984 seeking from the state 
department responses to an unclassified 1982 questionnaire on 
foreign governments diplomatic practices 
the foia was passed by congress in 1966 to help curtail 
government secrecy 
state department officials told goldberg in 1985 that only four 
of 161 relevant documents could be released fully 
of the remaining 157 documents nine were not to be released at 
all and 148 were to be released with certain portions omitted 
the government invoked an foia exemption that protects secrets 
of national defense or foreign policy 
goldberg then sued contending that the responses improperly 
were given a classified designation in washington by john 
eaves director of the office of mandatory review in the state 
departments classification and declassification center 
goldberg noted that most of the responses originally had been 
designated unclassified by responding ambassadors 
a federal trial judge dismissed goldbergs suit before trial 
and the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
upheld that ruling 
the appeals court said it rejected goldbergs argument that 
the affixing of conclusory unclassified labels on responses to 
an unclassified questionnaire by itself controverts a detailed 
review and explanation that some parts of those documents are 
properly classified 
the case is goldberg vs state department 87655

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
decision halving the fines and prison terms given to a dodge city 
kan business and its president for rigging highwayconstruction 
bids 
the justices said they will hear federal prosecutors arguments 
aimed at reinstating the original sentences received by broce 
construction co inc and ray c broce 
broce and the business pleaded guilty in 1982 to charges 
contained in two indictments respectively alleging bidrigging in 
highwayconstruction projects in meade and barton counties 
broce was sentenced on march 15 1982 to concurrent twoyear 
prison terms and fined 101000 the corporation he headed was 
fined 15 million 
more than a year after the sentencing broce and the corporation 
sought to set aside the judgment and sentence from the second 
indictment they contended that the separate sentences meted out 
under the second indictment amounted to multiple punishment for the 
same crime 
a federal trial judge threw out the appeal but the 10th us 
circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling 
the appeals court said that the constitutions protection 
against double jeopardy had been violated by the sentencing and 
that broce and the corporation had not waived their doublejeopardy 
protections when agreeing to plead guilty 
the appeals court set aside the sentences issued under the 
second indictment 750000 in fines for the corporation and 
50000 in fines and a twoyear prison term for broce 
in seeking supreme court review government lawyers noted that 
the two defendants pleaded guilty to two indictments alleging two 
different criminal conspiracies under a plea bargain in which the 
government agreed not to prosecute on other charges 
under such circumstances the governments appeal said 
defendants should not be able later to attack the sentences on 
grounds that the two alleged conspiracies were actually a single 
conspiracy 
the case is us vs broce 871190

police today arrested anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu and other church leaders as they marched 
toward parliament with a petition protesting the governments 
crackdown on antiapartheid groups 
the clergymen wearing robes and crosses around their necks 
stood with arms linked and bibles clutched in their hands as a 
policeman announced through a bullhorn that the gathering was 
illegal police had been lining the street outside st georges 
anglican cathedral waiting for the marchers to emerge 
after tutu a nobel peace prize laureate and other clergymen 
were placed in police vehicles police fired water cannons at more 
than 100 demonstrators sitting on the sidewalk singing a hymn 
local journalists said 
the clergymen and demonstrators were taken to a police station 
and released with a warning that charges would be brought against 
them if they staged a similar protest said the rev allan boesak 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches he said they 
were told summonses might be issued against them for demonstrating 
near parliament and they might be called to court 
police also took some journalists into custody 
upon their release the white black mixedrace and indian 
clergymen held a news conference in the cathedral which was still 
surrounded by policemen with a water cannon nearby 
we are not defying the law tutu said we are obeying god 
we also obey god every day 
in the past tutu continued it was possible for people to 
say it was the usual rabble rousers demonstrating they cant say 
it any more its the church 
boesak described todays protest as an act of subversion 
we told the south african government that we had decided we 
would be obedient to god that is a higher law to us he said 
the clergymen carried a petition addressed to president pw 
botha and parliament saying we leaders of a number of south 
african churches have come to parliament today to witness and pray 
in a time of crisis outside the buildings in which you make 
important decisions affecting the lives of millions of south 
africans who belong to our churches 
the protesters marching five abreast walked a few yards toward 
parliament from st georges cathedral the main anglican church in 
downtown cape town 
in a service in the cathedral before the march tutu and other 
ministers declared the churches would lead protests against the 
governments antiapartheid policies because 18 major black 
opposition groups had been banned last week from all political 
activity 
tutu marched in front of the procession along with boesak and 
other prominent ministers 
tutu warned those at the service that they might be teargassed 
sprayed with water cannons or arrested the church leaders said 
they had informed the government about the proposed march 
the march proceeded with clergymen at the end of each row and 
lay people in the middle as they reached government avenue near 
the parliament buildings they were met by about 50 policemen who 
linked arms to block the road 
the police told the crowd they were gathering illegally then 
began leading away the church leaders starting with boesak 
the rev sid luckett head of the anglican board of social 
responsibility led the rest of the crowd to the police vehicles 
and they sat down on the sidewalk 
police sprayed the seated protesters with water cannons but 
they stayed in place and were then put into police vans as they 
recited the lords prayer 
last wednesday the government banned the united democratic 
front the nations largest antiapartheid organization and 17 
other major black opposition groups from conducting any political 
activity 
banning orders were also issued against 18 prominent black 
leaders prohibiting them from taking part in antigovernment 
activities confining them to their hometowns and ordering them 
not to speak to the press 
church groups werent included in the crackdown and 
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns 
but most forms of peaceful protest are banned under existing 
regulations 
tutu had called the new regulations a declaration of war 
against the people he and other church leaders had pledged the 
churches would begin to conduct some of the protest campaigns that 
had been organized by the banned groups 
in may 1980 tutu was one of 54 people mostly priests who were 
arrested in johannesburg under the riotous assemblies act for 
marching in protest against the detention of a congregational 
church minister all were convicted and sentenced to pay a 45 fine 
or spend 50 days in jail tutus fine was paid 
boesak was last arrested in august 1985 when he was charged 
with subversion for among other things organizing a march to 
pollsmoor prison where african national congress leader nelson 
mandela is serving a life term fourteen months later the charges 
were dropped 
under south africas apartheid policies of racial segregation 
the nations 5 million whites maintain political and economic 
control over 26 million blacks who have no vote in national 
affairs

illinois officials wanting to conduct 
warrantless searches of racetrack employees ongrounds living 
quarters as one way of protecting the sports integrity lost a 
supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that such 
searches violate constitutionally protected privacy rights if 
conducted without first obtaining a court warrant 
the illinois racing board for years had authorized state law 
enforcement officers to search without warrants the rooms of 
backstretchers those employees who feed groom exercise and 
generally take care of racehorses 
the searches were aimed at discovering drugs or mechanical 
devices that could affect a races outcome 
while employed by horse trainers many backstretchers live in 
small rooms located in the area where horses are stabled the 
backstretch 
the board also authorized warrantless searches of the employees 
themselves 
at one time backstretchers were required to consent to such 
searches as a condition to receiving their licenses 
three backstretchers working at arlington park racetrack 
challenged the state boards policy and rules in 1982 
don serpas raymond johnson and carl waters sued the racing 
board in behalf of all backstretchers working at illinois tracks 
the three had been subjected to searches that turned up no evidence 
of any crime 
us district judge charles p kocoras ordered that the 
warrantless searches be halted temporarily in 1983 and then banned 
them permanently in 1985 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld the ban last july 
17 after finding no explicit authority for the searches in illinois 
law 
the appeals court said the backstretchers living quarters 
though temporary and humble must be treated as their homes 
the constitutions fourth amendment generally prohibits searches 
of someones home unless a court warrant is obtained courts 
generally will not issue a search warrant unless authorities show a 
likelihood that evidence of criminal conduct will be found as a 
result 
there is no reason to doubt that drugs and mechanical devices 
pose major threats to the integrity of the horseracing industry 
the appeals court said but it added that the illinois racetrack 
searches without the safeguard of a warrant are unreasonable and 
violate the fourth amendment 
in seeking supreme court review illinois attorney general neil 
f hartigan relied on past rulings by the justices that have 
allowed warrantless searches of heavily regulated industries 
the case is schmidt vs serpas 87644

the supreme court today refused to revive 
lawsuits charging the government and federal contractors with 
negligently causing deaths and disease among people exposed to 
openair atomic tests 
the court without comment let stand a federal law that 
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself 
against claims seeking billions of dollars 
the atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the case took 
place between the closing days of world war ii and the adoption of 
a treaty between the united states and the soviet union in 1963 
banning openair testing 
suits were filed on behalf of 29 people civilians and members 
of the military including 26 who died from cancer or 
cancerrelated causes the suits alleged that the health problems 
were caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions 
charged with negligence were the university of california which 
operated the los alamos nm project lawrence livermore 
laboratories which helped develop the atomic bomb sandia corp 
which provided engineering for the weapons program and reynolds 
electric engineering co which helped build and operate a test 
site in nevada 
the suits accused the private contractors of failing to take 
adequate safety precautions at the test sites and also said the 
government was responsible for failing to enforce its own safety 
standards 
if the suits were successful the government ultimately would 
pay the claims because it had insured the private contractors for 
any losses 
but in 1984 congress passed a law supported by the reagan 
administration that says only the us government may be sued for 
negligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomic 
weapons testing program 
the result was to bar the claims since the government is immune 
from such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existing 
federal tort claims act 
those who sued the companies said the 1984 law 
unconstitutionally deprived them of a remedy for the deaths and 
disease caused by the atomic explosions 
the petitioners had a remedy against the original defendants 
they have none against the united states they said 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the law last june 
it rejected arguments that the law violates the constitutions 
required separation of powers by retroactively preventing the 
courts from considering pending claims 
the administration in urging the supreme court not to disturb 
the appeals court decision said more than 3000 people are seeking 
damages totalling more than 49 billion in all cases stemming from 
the weapons tests 
the high court on jan 11 refused to hear a related appeal by 
some 1200 people in nevada arizona and utah who sought to hold 
the government financially responsible for deaths and diseases 
allegedly caused by the tests in nevada 
the case acted on today is konizeski vs livermore labs 87953

the supreme court asked the reagan 
administration today whether it thinks highstakes bingo games run 
by indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before it says whether it will review an attempt by oklahoma 
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in tulsa run by the 
muscogee creek nation 
the justice departments brief may not be filed for months 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled in september that 
the state could not force the tribe to collect and remit the 
states 25 percent sales tax on the bingo operations 
the appeals court said the states interest in collecting the 
tax is minimal in this case 
patrons do not travel onto creek lands to play bingo in order 
to avoid sales taxes the appeals court said creek nation 
bingo does not undermine the state economy or tax base the state 
is not losing tax revenues it would otherwise obtain from sales 
made outside of tribal boundaries 
the appeals court also based its ruling in part on a supreme 
court decision last year that said state and local governments may 
not regulate indianrun gambling unless congress gives them 
permission 
the muscogee creek bingo game is conducted in tulsa on a 
100acre area known as the mackey site along the arkansas river 
the 10th circuit court said the land is indian territory in the 
same way any reservation belongs to native americans 
the appeals court also said the fact that the bingo game is 
managed by a nontribal entity indian country usa inc hired 
by the tribe does not alter the exempt status of the gambling 
operation 
forcing the tribe to collect and remit the sales tax would place 
a heavy burden on the indians even if the tax did not affect 
revenue for the creeks the appeals court added 
it said the tribe would be subject to fines and liens on its 
property if it were held responsible for collecting the tax and 
then failed to do so 
the case is oklahoma tax commission vs muscogee creek nation

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
little rock ark mans criminal conviction thrown out because 
police did not tell him specifically about his right to free legal 
help 
the justices without comment let stand a state supreme court 
ruling that socalled miranda warnings given before police question 
criminal suspects must mention that right 
michael e mayfield was convicted in 1985 of robbing a little 
rock store when arrested and read his rights mayfield had 
confessed 
the standard warning then used by little rock police said a 
suspect has the right to remain silent or to talk with a lawyer 
either retained by me or appointed by the court before giving a 
statement 
such police warnings have been given since 1966 when the supreme 
court ruled in a case called miranda vs arizona that the fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination requires them 
the arkansas supreme court ruling last sept 28 that mayfield 
is entitled to a new trial said his confession should not have 
been used as evidence against him 
the state court said an indigent criminal suspect must be 
informed that he has just as much right to representation by an 
attorney as a person who can afford one 
earlier last year the arkansas court upheld a police warning 
that stated if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed 
for you before any questioning if you wish 
in the appeal acted on today arkansas attorney general steve 
clark told the justices the state court ruling is inconsistent with 
their 1981 decision that the warnings given by police do not have 
to follow the miranda decision verbatim 
the 1981 decision however involved a case in which a criminal 
suspect was told about his right to have a lawyer appointed to 
represent you at no cost to yourself 
the case acted on today is arkansas vs mayfield 871105

is a new thing you are wrong he said we are concerned we 
should not be excited

this is war

as george bush pointed out last week during one of many days 
spent in the state 
this state is going to be on the leading edge of the most 
significant political event in terms of selecting a president that 
weve had in this country in modern times he said in only a 
slight overstatement of the importance of the super tuesday 
collection of 20 primaries and caucuses three days after south 
carolina votes 
youre going to see the darndest invasion of people who want 
to be president that youve ever seen 
the republican candidates are blanketing the state ahead of 
saturdays balloting with an eye toward the states 37 gop 
delegates yes but more importantly with hopes of a boost going 
into super tuesday 
south carolinas primary falls three days before 20 states 
mostly in the south choose more than onethird of the delegates to 
the national convention in new orleans 
by going ahead of that south carolina has a special place in 
the sun youre going to send a signal you see all across the 
region and that signal will reverberate across the country bush 
said 
heavy stuff for the boys at genes 
but claude crocker said no topic is too big for his crowd 
we talk about international trade policy the panama canal 
the deficit we handle all those highlevel things the vice 
president of clinton mills deadpanned 
crocker thinks bush is the man to beat in his area and in the 
state but charles buddy oakley said former television 
evangelist pat robertson cant be counted out 
i think robertson appeals to a large group of religioustype 
people in south carolina he said 
their observations mirror more objective measurements 
a survey published sunday by the state newspaper said bush was 
the choice of 48 percent of the voters likely to cast gop ballots 
dole 25 percent robertson 19 percent and jack kemp 3 percent the 
poll conducted last monday through wednesday surveyed 319 likely 
gop voters 
but lee atwater a south carolina native and bushs national 
campaign manager said robertsons strength has to be at least 
doubled because of the strong turnout of his supporters and the 
difficulty in measuring them robertson has attracted new voters to 
the rolls and many conservative democrats are expected to vote in 
the gop primary for him 
university of south carolina political professor earl black said 
there is an enormous potential for a heavy crossover vote 
because south carolina voters dont register by party and because 
this being the second primary ever there is no historical gauge 
robertson has said for months that he is seeking a firstplace 
finish in south carolina where he has a large and fervent 
following of fundamentalist christians one robertson stronghold is 
ptls heritage usa where more than 1500 people live 
south carolina is a doordie state for kemp who has yet to 
finish better than third in any contest the new york congressman 
is portraying himself here as the conservative alternative saying 
robertson has no chance of winning the nomination 
south carolina is george bushs to lose said blease graham 
an associate professor in governmental studies at the university of 
south carolina 
one issue that could cost bush votes graham said is his 
opposition to legislation that would restrict the growth of textile 
imports which the industry says is causing job losses 
the industry is running advertisements across the state every 
day urging people indirectly to vote for candidates who back the 
legislation robertson and dole announced last week that they 
support the bill now in the senate 
bushs main strategy in south carolina has been to promote his 
close ties with president reagan who remains popular here 
turnout in 1980 was 145000 and party officials estimate that 
between 175000 and 200000 people will vote saturday

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may block a man from trying to prove he fathered the 
child of a woman married to someone else 
the court said it will study a challenge by a man identified in 
court records only as michael h to a state evidentiary rule 
creating a conclusive presumption of fatherhood to a wifes husband 
michael h contends he is the father of a 6yearold girl 
victoria born to a woman identified as carol d at a time when 
carol d was married to gerald d 
michael h filed in a state court in los angeles a reverse 
paternity lawsuit in 1982 seeking to have himself declared 
victorias father 
his lawsuit was thrown out because california law as do laws in 
many other states creates a conclusive presumption of paternity in 
favor of a womans husband if a child is conceived and born during 
their marriage 
in upholding the dismissal of michael hs lawsuit a state 
appeals court said the conclusive presumption is based upon a 
determination by the legislature as a matter of overriding social 
policy that given a certain relationship between the husband and 
wife the husband is to be held responsible for the child and the 
integrity of the family unit should not be impugned 
the california supreme court had refused to hear michael hs 
appeal last july 30 
the nations highest court two years ago rejected without 
comment a similar appeal from a massachusetts man seeking to prove 
he fathered the child of another mans wife 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for michael h said he 
enjoyed an ongoing fatherchild relationship with victoria and 
that blood tests show a better than 98 percent chance that victoria 
is his biological daughter 
the appeal said victoria was born as a result of an affair 
michael h and carol d had while she was married to gerald d 
the appeal also said that carol d and victoria moved to the 
virgin islands to live with michael h for several months in 1982 
when she and her husband were estranged 
court records indicate that carol and gerald d later resumed 
living together 
the case is michael h vs gerald d 87746

a general strike started today to 
demand the resignation of gen manuel antonio noriega but 
government intimidation censorship and the fact that today is 
payday apparently hurt its effectiveness 
the opposition asked the nations businesses and industries to 
close today and remain shut indefinitely 
deposed president eric arturo delvalle remained in hiding 
defying noreiga who ousted delvalle and ordered him out of the 
country 
buses by far the main mode of public transportation circulated 
this morning like any other morning most were full taking people 
to work 
about twothirds of the stores were open at a commercial center 
of more than 100 enterprises on central avenue in panama city 
many panamanian banks were closed by the strike but 
international banks were open 
several people consulted by the associated press as they stepped 
from buses on their way to work mentioned intimidation as a reason 
for not observing the strike 
theres fear said a middleaged man a bank employee we 
lack unity to confront these people who have all the arms and are 
disposed to use them 
the people dont have means to resist said a woman a 
domestic employee walking with him one has to live as they the 
armed forces say 
the two also noted that today being the last day of the month 
is payday for many panamanians 
police chief col leonidas macias told journalists it would be 
understandale if hungry people looted a closed supermarket and his 
forces would not try to prevent them 
the strike call was supported by the industrial workers union 
of panama and its effectiveness appeared to be greater in industry 
than in commerce most factories in panama citys industrial zone 
were closed 
roberto brenes a leader of the national civic crusade 
predicted sunday that the strike would do well in manufacturing and 
construction but would be less effective in the service industries 
opposition figures also said they expected the strike to pick up 
in several days they said government censorship had slowed word of 
the strike 
indeed la prensa the leading opposition paper has been closed 
by troops and the newspaper building surrounded by city police 
delvalles relatives would not disclose his whereabouts but they 
said he was in a safe and secure place in panama in good 
spirits and determined to regain his job 
i am going to stay here and stick it out delvalle told 
abc television in a telephone interview saturday night im going 
to fight it all the way 
roderick esquivel delvalles vice president also was in 
hiding both men were ousted friday by the national legislative 
assembly in a move orchestrated by noriega chief of panamas 
17000member defense forces 
on thursday delvalle ignited the latest crisis in eight months 
of civil unrest in panama when he tried to fire noriega charged in 
florida with corruption and narcotics trafficking the united 
states also has urged noriega to step down as military chief 
on friday delvalle returned to his home in an upperclass 
neighborhood police surrounded the house friday night and 
delvalles telephones were cut leaving him under an undeclared 
house arrest 
sometime that night he reportedly climbed over a patio wall at 
the rear of the house and escaped through a neighbors yard 
opposition leaders said a prolonged strike could create 
financial chaos in panama and force noriega to resign paving the 
way for delvalles return to office and an end to military 
domination of the government 
the progovernment newspapr critica blared a redink banner 
headline a closed business is a takenover business 
osvaldo velasquez president of the panama committee for human 
rights predicted the government would use state terrorism to 
try to counteract the strike 
he added one of the means they will resort to is to stimulate 
the crowds to get into the stores to break into the businesses 
that dare to close 
he said that tactic had been used by the government in previous 
unsuccessful strikes last summer 
raul diaz delvalles brotherinlaw said sunday that the 
former president was telephoning world leaders from hiding to ask 
their support 
delvalle he said was not with his wife and three children but 
all of them were safe they are in one place and he is alone in 
another he said 
the us state department said on saturday that some of 
delvalles children or grandchildren were at the us embassy or 
the home of us ambassador arthur davis the embassy declined to 
comment sunday on that report 
in an interview on cbs news 60 minutes program noriega was 
asked where delvalle was and the general said hes with the 
north americans with the ambassador of the united states when 
he was asked if delvalle was at the us embassy noriega said 
at this point we dont know 
delvalles hopes of regaining his post were dealt a setback 
saturday when the permanent council of the organization of american 
states meeting in washington declined to impose trade sanctions 
on panama or approve a resolution condemning the presidents ouster 
by the military

nancy reagan today called for a crackdown on 
casual drug users saying they are an accomplice to murder in 
the deaths of judges agents and others who have been killed by 
narcotics traffickers 
i want to make it impossible for casual users to escape 
responsibility for any innocent deaths due to drugs mrs reagan 
said i want to make them fully face the brutality of drug use 
the first lady was joined by her husband president reagan at 
the white house conference for a drug free america a meeting 
intended to showcase the fight against drugs 
she said that when she moves back to california next year im 
not going to give up my interest and concern about this she said 
she will continue her efforts at the nancy reagan house in los 
angeles which is to be run by the phoenix house 
in his remarks the president said that despite all the 
publicity about drugs lets keep in mind the progress weve 
made he said the number of users is leveling off and may even be 
falling 
the tide of the battle has turned and were beginning to win 
the crusade for a drugfree america reagan said 
mrs reagan gave a more somber assessment saying drugs are 
tearing our community apart she said drug traffickers and 
dealers will murder anyone who stands in their way 
in particular she cited the murder of colombias chief 
prosecutor attorney general carlos hoyos and his two bodyguards 
who were abducted last month by a halfdozen gunmen who the 
government accused of working for local cocaine barons 
hoyos bulletriddled body was dumped outside the center of the 
nations drug trade the body had been blindfolded and handcuffed 
the government blamed his abduction and death on the medillin 
cartel which us officials say controls 80 percent of cocaine 
entering the united states 
mrs reagan said that the people who casually use cocaine are 
responsible beause their money bought those bullets 
the casual user may think when he takes a line of cocaine or 
smokes a joint in the privacy of his nice condo listening to his 
expensive stereo that hes somehow not bothering anyone she 
said 
but theres a trail of death and destruction that leads 
directly to his door mrs reagan said the casual user cannot 
morally escape responsibility for the action of drug traffickers 
and dealing 
im saying that if youre a casual drug user youre an 
accomplice to murder the first lady said prompting loud 
applause from the audience of antidrug activists 
the casual users also cannot morally escape association 
with those who use drugs and then endanger the public safety she 
said the message from casual use is that drugs are acceptable 
that they can be handled that somehow its simply a matter of 
dosage 
casual use sets the tone for tolerance and that tolerance can 
kill she said recalling a train crash in maryland last year 
that killed 16 people and injured 175 others she noted that an 
investigation determined that a train engineer and brakeman had 
smoked marijuana

the us naval observatory is looking for help 
in sighting the moon 
while nearly anyone can see the huge full moon the astronomers 
are trying to determine just how soon after a new moon the first 
faint crescent of moonlight becomes visible to observers 
to help determine just how quickly that occurs the observatory 
has scheduled an experiment for july 14 
the new moon will occur at 753 pm edt july 13 and observers 
are being asked to look for the first visibility of the moon on the 
following night 
the observatory wants residents of the united states canada 
the caribbean and central america to begin looking for the new moon 
about 40 minutes after sunset july 14 and to record and report 
their results 
persons willing to take part can get details by writing to 
looking for the moon us naval observatory washington dc 
203925100 
first moon sightings have been reported as early as 18 hours 
after new moon that time each month when the moon is completely 
obscured bu the earth blocking the suns light but such early 
sightings are considered extremely difficult 
being able to pinpoint first visibility of the moon is important 
in several foreign cultures the observatory reports in islam for 
instance the end of one month and the beginning of the next occurs 
when the moon is first visible and being able to predict that 
moment will help in preparing calendars

destruction of crops and pastures a un group reported monday 
about 25 million acres have been infested in northern 
mauritania said the un food and agriculture organization which 
issued an appeal to international donors for two spraying aircraft 
and 39000 gallons of pesticide 
successful control of infestations in northern mauritania 
would greatly reduce the risks of substantial invasion of morocco 
and algeria to the north and of the sahel zone to the south the 
fao said in its appeal 
major control efforts have been under way in morocco and several 
other countries in the past several months the fao said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
opening an emergency session of the general assembly today urged 
the united states not to close the un mission of the palestine 
liberation organization and to respect the united nations 
this question has immediate and profound importance for the 
united nations he said as the 159member assembly reconvened a 
threeday session to condemn the us plan to close the plo mission 
under a new antiterrorist law 
the plo is an invitee of the united nations and the united 
states is obliged by its un headquarters agreement to permit 
accredited plo personnel to enter and remain in the us and carry 
out their official functions the un chief said 
perez de cuellar said he hoped the united states could reconcile 
its domestic legislation with its international obligations 
both the state department and the united nations say the new 
antiterrorism law that would close the mission by march 22 
violates the 1947 headquarters agreement between the united states 
and the united nations it allows all missions to operation 
still the justice department reportedly intends to go ahead and 
order the mission closed although legal maneuvering is expected to 
keep the mission open for as long as a year 
twentytwo speakers including the plo ambassador and the envoys 
of the soviet union jordan egypt and syria were to speak today 
before the assembly 
in the unusual session the united states the largest un 
contributor was expected to be lectured and rebuked by the world 
body which recognizes the plo 
the head of the un arab group said sunday that if the united 
states insists on closing the legal plo mission operating under 
international treaty then the general assembly should vote to 
leave new york and relocate in geneva 
i dont exclude any idea of shifting the general assembly the 
security council and other key bodies dealing with the middle east 
if the us goes ahead with closure said ambassador karim 
ebrahim alshakar of bahrain 
i would hope it will not reach that point he said but 
that depends on the will and good intention of the host country 
the united states 
without the plo recognized as the legitimate un 
representative of the palestinian people the united nations cannot 
hold discussions on the middle east said the bahrain envoy head 
of the 21nation arab group 
most other diplomats and the plo said it was unlikely that the 
united nations would leave new york 
the threeday session is expected to approve resolutions calling 
on the united states to allow the 13yearold plo mission to 
operate as legally required by treaty with the united nations it 
also may seek a ruling against the united states by the 
international court of justice 
the state department and un lawyers both say the plan to shut 
the plo mission under a new antiterrorist law is illegal and 
violates the 1947 headquarters agreement between the united states 
and the united nations 
us prestige and influence at the united nations are at an 
alltime low over the reagan administrations withholding of more 
than 250 million in un budget dues the united states has also 
sided with israel and south africa on key issues 
the united states is the largest un contributor paying about 
onequarter of the annual budget of 800 million but the united 
states has failed to pay its dues because congress has not 
appropriated full funding american critics say the organization is 
inefficient and biased against the united states

matt and ben kearney did more homework read 
more books and spent more time with their parents while facing the 
ultimate challenge an entire year without television 
it came to a festive end at a family party when their father 
lawyer mike kearney handed each boy a packet of 10 50 bills tied 
up in a red ribbon and then turned the television set back on at 
730 pm thursday 
it feels real weird said 9yearold matt flipping channels 
quickly between the olympics jeopardy and magnum pi it 
feels like im not supposed to be doing it 
kearney got the idea about the year without television when he 
read about a new jersey boy whose mother offered him 500 to turn 
off the set for a year

pain and punishment are more than mere agenda 
items to armando valladares a human rights ambassador with a 
resume written by two decades of imprisonment 
valladares is the chief us delegate to the un human rights 
commission he is among the delegates from 43 nations who are 
meeting here to discuss human rights violations 
but as a political prisoner in cuba for 22 years he is far from 
a typical ambassador 
when he talks about torture he points to broken bones that 
never healed quite right when he talks about prison life he 
displays scars left on his hands by hungry rats 
when he discusses desperation he can recall being denied pens 
and pencils in prison and writing a poem in his blood 
when the topic is cruelty he talks about forgiveness 
i do not hate anyone he said not even those who tortured 
me because i think that hatred kills the person who feels it i 
would say ultimately that those years were a struggle between love 
and hatred and love always triumphs 
valladares 50 a us citizen for slightly more than a year is 
his countrys latest weapon in a struggle to get the commission to 
discuss alleged human rights violations in cuba 
in an interview with the associated press valladares said the 
effort is a struggle against a selective sensitivity in the 
commission which routinely condemns human rights violations in 
israelioccupied territories south africa and chile 
but his appointment as chief us delegate session has angered 
the cuban government which denounces valladares as an impostor who 
never was tortured or paralyzed during his prison tenure 
valladares is a slightly built man with intense eyes under a 
shock of dark hair just beginning to turn gray he is the father of 
two boys one 3 and one nearly 2 and the husband of a woman he met 
in prison when she came to visit her father they were married 
behind bars 
he was just 23 when he was sentenced to a 30year term for what 
he says were anticommunist remarks in a book about his 
experiences against all hope he said prisoners were 
systematically tortured and denied proper medical care 
he said at one point following a 46day hunger strike in 1974 
he developed polyneuropathy a nervous system deterioration that 
confined him to a wheelchair for five years 
at that time he began writing poetry and smuggling it out of 
prison to his wife martha then living in the united states he 
said 
he won his freedom in october 1982 after french president 
francois mitterrand intervened in his case just a month after 
obtaining us citizenship he was added to the us human rights 
delegation 
the chief cuban delegate raul roa kouri told a news conference 
that valladares book was full of lies 
the cuban government held similar news conferences in washington 
and mexico city and distributed pamphlets rejecting what it said 
were lies by the state department about valladares past 
it is an attack against me a man because they cannot refute 
the violations of human rights that are happening in their 
country responds valladares 
although his mother and sister live in miami his 77yearold 
father remains in cuba 
he lives in the center of the island and often the authorities 
tell him to pack all his things because he is leaving cuba then he 
travels all the way to havana and they tell him it was an error 
said valladares 
he said his father also is denied treatment for an eye ailment 
that has left him nearly blind 
i think that the cuban government is moving this way against 
him thinking perhaps that i will change my attitude i will not do 
that he said 
what he does do is bring a dramatic air of realism to the 
commission 
speaking recently on torture valladares said i remember when 
they had me in a punishment cell naked my leg fractured in 
several places fractures that were never treated and eventually 
fused into a mass of deformed bones 
through the wire mesh that covered the cell the guards would 
pour over me buckets of urine and excrement that they had collected 
earlier 
international condemnation of such acts he said is the only 
thing capable of pressuring the torturers

boats to make the dangerous crossing to puerto rico where they 
hope to find jobs and a better life

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether employees of a pentagon intelligence agency are entitled to 
administrative hearings when they are fired as security risks 
the justices said they will hear reagan administration arguments 
that those who work for the national security agency are not 
entitled to such procedural protection 
the case raises issues similar to those in a case decided 
tuesday by the high court 
in that ruling the court said the merit systems protection 
board which provides job protection to federal workers lacks 
authority to reinstate an employee fired for lacking a security 
clearance the court upheld the firing of a laborer at a navy 
installation 
in the case acted on today the justices will review a ruling 
that granted an administrative hearing to an unidentified nsa 
employee who said he was fired because he engaged in homosexual 
activities 
the employee identified only as john doe works with secret 
codes for the spy agency 
he told his superiors in 1982 that he had homosexual relations 
with several foreigners during vacation travels abroad 
after a psychiatric evaluation the nsa in a decision upheld by 
the defense secretary ordered him fired on grounds his 
indiscriminate sexual activities posed a security risk since he 
had access in his job to the most secret type of classified 
information the agency said the fact the acts were homosexual was 
not the determining factor 
doe then filed a federal court suit claiming the department of 
defense violated a federal civil service law entitling him to an 
administrative hearing 
the us circuit court of appeals agreed with him in a ruling 
last june 
the appeals court said as the government acknowledges in 
this case the defense secretary has not found that a hearing 
would itself contravene national security accordingly doe is 
entitled by law to that hearing 
caspar weinberger was secretary of defense at the time of does 
firing since then he has been succeeded by frank carlucci 
the case is carlucci vs doe 87751

president pw botha suggested 
monday that his government might comply with a demand by some 
british lawmakers that the union jack be removed from the south 
african flag 
members of all three main parties in britains parliament 
citing bothas latest crackdown on black oppositon urged their 
government on saturday to request that a replica of the british 
flag be removed from the south african flag 
the union jack and the flags of two south african provinces are 
displayed in the center of south africas flag as symbols of the 
countrys past 
the flag of south africa not only relates to our history but 
is indeed a symbol of national unity and nationhood botha said 
it is surprising that the agitation against the south african 
flag from britain is not taking into consideration the feelings of 
the englishspeaking south africans 
but if the british government wishes to interfere with the 
composition of a south africa symbol on this basis the question 
may be asked whether the south african parliament should not give 
this matter its serious attention 
designed 60 years ago the south african flag was intended to 
show how the country was formed by a merger of britishcontrolled 
territory and the former afrikaner republics of transvaal and the 
orange free state the mainly dutchdescended afrikaners make up 
about 60 percent of the 5 million whites while most of the others 
have british ancestry 
the british and afrikaners battled each in the boer war that 
ended in 1902 and strains between the two still surface

sharansky reported sunday to a military base near tel aviv for 
three weeks of training said yuri stern a spokesman for the 
soviet jewry information center a private lobbying group 
sharansky 40 will join israels civil guard rather than the

western wall the last remnant of the second jewish temple 
destroyed by the romans in 70 ad 
like all israeli men sharansky will be called up for several 
weeks of reserve duty once a year stern said 
stern said sharansky was proud to fulfill his duty of 
defending the country

in the army while his true battlefield is the campaign for the 
release of soviet jews thats where he is a general 
since coming to israel sharansky spent most of his time 
studying hebrew lecturing on the plight of soviet jews and writing 
his memoirs stern said 
sharansky one of the soviet unions most prominent dissidents

two nuns are suing the nephew of 
their mother superior claiming he embezzled their community 
property and holy relics 
the lawsuit was filed in el paso county district court on behalf 
of the carmelite monastery of the sacred hearts an independent 
community no longer recognized by the roman catholic church named 
as defendant was jose de la luz sanchez of albuquerque nm who 
once was the nuns legal conservator 
im not worried because none of that is true said sanchez 
65 every time they ran out of money they sure knew who to call 
i never refused them because frankly my wife and i have no kids 
and theyre all we have 
the lawsuit filed last week accuses sanchez who is retired from 
new mexicos highway department of theft fraud and breach of 
fiduciary duty 
it says he transferred the sisters community assets including 
a 150000 promissory note to his own name that he took items 
such as the nuns car wheelbarrow and organ and that he told the 
nuns he was looking after them for free but billed the community 
thousands of dollars for his time 
mr sanchez has gone so far as to deprive the nuns of their 
chalices monstrance and holy relics according to the complaint 
filed by two denver lawyers roger p thomasch and mark wielga who 
have never met the sisters in person 
the nuns who follow religious vows that permit little contact 
with outsiders declined comment 
sanchez is the nephew of mother helen chavez 79 the leader of 
the community and mother agnes chavez 86 who live in albuquerque 
the suit was filed by mother josephine florence 76 and sister 
theresa schull 79 who apparently have separated from sanchezs 
aunts and are struggling to establish themselves in colorado 
springs 
since the late 1970s the suit says the nuns have lived in 
three states while searching for a permanent home they left 
burnet texas in 1978 for bryan texas later they moved to 
gallup nm and to albuquerque then they moved to colorado 
springs 
the two nuns living in albuquerque are in nursing homes and 
receive some social security 
the nuns follow the rules of the larger discalced nuns of the 
order of our blessed lady of mount carmel but their group is no 
longer affiliated with the larger order said bishop jerome 
hastrich of gallup nm 
he said they were ordered by the vatican to disband several 
years ago 
they didnt have unity said hastrich the mother was 
about 80 and she was unable to control the group about half were 
in their 70s and 80s and half were quite young 
he found other homes for about 16 nuns but said the four elders 
refused to separate from the community

israeli troops shot a palestinian dead monday 
and another died of earlier wounds jewish settlers urged even 
tougher polices in the occupied lands where 12 weeks of violence 
have cost at least 76 arab lives 
the peace mission of secretary of state george p shultz ran 
into trouble sources said jordanian leaders who believe 
palestinians are entitled to their own negotiating team rejected 
talking with israel as part of a jordanianpalestinian delegation 
maj gen amram mitzna military commander of the west bank 
said israel has four times as many soldiers there as it did before 
riots began dec 8 in keeping with army policy he gave no figures 
the latest deaths brought to 76 the number of palestinians 
killed according to un figures most of them shot by israeli 
soldiers hundreds have been wounded 
israeli measures to quell what palestinians now call the 
uprising have been criticized abroad prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said monday those who censure israel from outside like to 
see us beaten and hate to see us defending ourselves with force and 
remaining alive 
nations which said nothing when we were brought to the 
slaughterhouses are now going wild when they see rioters receiving 
their due punishment he told reporters in northern israel 
its hard to understand the injustice in these reactions 
some cabinet members have said journalists should be banned from 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and shamir did not reject 
the idea if it becomes clear that indeed it may limit the 
damage i would be willing to consider it he said 
jewish settlers distributed 3000 leaflets in palestinian towns 
working overnight to avoid clashes with arabs that warned of tough 
israeli action against arab agitators 
dont be mistaken enough to think we are turning the other 
cheek said the leaflets from the nationalist group gush emunin 
the days when jewish blood was cheap are long gone as is the day 
of the slogan slaughter the jews dont mistake our intention we 
are staying here forever 
gush emunim urged israel to impose emergency laws in the west 
bank and gaza which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war about 15 million palestinians live in the 
territories 
noam arnon spokesman for gush emunim said anyone who lifts 
a rock puts his life on the line the arabs have to be told 
this we dont have to wait until god forbid jews will be burned 
in a bus we must do this now 
hospital officials said two palestinians were wounded by gunfire 
in the gaza strip and 50 arab women and children threw stones at 
soldiers in the west bank city of ramallah taunting them with 
chants of we are the plo 
troops used tear gas and fired shots into the air in ramallah 
and arrested two young arabs associated press photographer martin 
cleaver said 
in burin a west bank village of about 1400 three miles south 
of nablus 50 palestinians attacked an army jeep with stones and 
iron bars the army said the report said soldiers fired tear gas 
and rubber bullets to no effect then used live ammunition and 
yasser daoud eid 18 was fatally shot in the neck 
the second death monday was of mahmoud batwi 30 who died of a 
gunshot wound to the head suffered four days earlier during a 
protest in jenin a west bank town 
two jewish settlers suspected of killing two arabs on saturday 
were freed on bail also released were four soldiers who were shown 
in a cbs news videotape to be beating two palestinians for more 
than half an hour near nablus last week authorities said 
investigations would continue in both cases 
hananiya schneider 45 and moshe bahagon 37 both of the neve 
tzuf settlement were released on bail of 2500 shekels each about 
1500

a salvage crew continued pumping oil 
today from an upsidedown barge that was raised one month after it 
sank in guemes channel and spilled about 70000 gallons of heavy 
bunker oil into inland waters 
after the delicate lifting procedure sunday the inverted barge 
was held at the surface by cables strung from two cranes as crews 
began pumping the remaining 344000 gallons of oil aboard into a 
second barge 
coast guard officials said this morning that one compartment of 
the oil barge contained mostly water raising the possibility that 
more oil leaked than previously thought 
it appears the structural integrity of the tank may be 
breached said coast guard lt eldo delong 
coast guard guard chief petty officer roy compton said that as 
oil was pumped out of the barges six tanks air would be pumped in 
until the barge floated on its own 
as of 840 am an estimated 68976 gallons had been pumped out 
of the damaged barge 
a small oil sheen marked the spot where the barge surfaced 
sunday morning mark stewart of the state division of emergency 
management said roughly 500 to 1000 gallons of lightweight oil had 
spilled 
surface skimmer boats had cleaned up about 160 gallons while 
absorbent pads collected more of the spill he said 
most of the barges cargo is heavierthanwater bunker oil 
state ecology department spokesman ats kiuchi said it appeared 
the fragile inner coastal environment had avoided a disaster 
were dealing with a lot of unknowns here its like mount st 
helens erupting you use the best estimate you can get but it the 
lift was smooth he said 
the barge operated by olympic tug and barge of seattle sank 
jan 31 in about 130 feet of water four miles west of anacortes and 
about 100 yards off shannon point it had been loaded at an oil 
refinery at anacortes and was being towed by to seattle when it 
began listing and capsized 
after resting with its stern on the bottom and the bow breaking 
the surface for about a week the vessel dropped all the way to the 
bottom 
on thursday the coast guard assumed financial responsibility 
for the salvage because olympic was unable to obtain pollution 
liability coverage compton said harley franco olympic president 
would be billed for the salvage costs

michael dukakis walked aboard his chartered 
jet with a smile on his face they dont know what a frappe is 
here in texas he said but i got one 
dukakis didnt come all the way from the golddomed statehouse 
in boston to the heart of texas for the thick milkshake that every 
soda jerk in new england knows how to make 
but if he can find one in the land where lyndon johnson once 
reigned can the massachusetts liberal also find enough votes to 
establish himself as a democratic presidential candidate of 
nationwide appeal 
with 1307 democratic national convention delegates at stake on 
march 8 a festival of 20 primaries and caucuses with a southern 
flavor known as super tuesday his aides concede its a challenge 
outside south florida i wouldnt call it hostility but 
theres a skepticism about mike dukakis says s stephen 
rosenfeld who left his statehouse job in massachusetts to organize 
in florida for the governor 
while dukakis periodically insists that hes competing in 
every state on super tuesday he is targeting his appeal to 
liberals labor workers and retirees and reminding voters 
everywhere that he is the son of greek immigrants 
dukakis and his aides carefully avoid saying that he must carry 
even a single southern state to succeed on march 8 and say they 
are concentrating on winning as many delegates as possible 
much of his time and campaign budget is focused in areas of 
texas florida north carolina and georgia like other democratic 
rivals he is virtually conceding the regions large black vote to 
jesse jackson 
dukakis has made subtle changes in the campaign message that 
earned him a respectable third place in iowa and victories in new 
hampshire and minnesota he no longer emphasizes his opposition to 
president reagans support for the contras in nicaragua and to 
demonstrate toughness in an area that likes it he is suggesting he 
might authorize strikes against terrorist base camps in an effort 
to deal with hostage problems in the middle east 
he also showed a combative side in last saturdays debate 
repeatedly challenging rep richard gephardt to say whether he was 
proud of his vote in favor of the 1981 reaganomics tax bill and 
questioning sen albert gore jrs credentials for the white house 
he still trumpets his record of nine balanced budgets as 
governor of massachusetts as the centerpiece of his campaign and 
calls for real jobs at real wages 
dukakis is ready to run commercials attacking gephardt if 
campaign officials decide it is necessary one of the things that 
you cant do is to try to make yourself into something youre 
not dukakis said in an interview hes got a record and the 
record is there for all to see 
for the next week dukakis is targeting his time money and 
resources in a hectic southern effort to prove his appeal outside 
his northern liberal base hundreds of delegates are at stake 
the governor and his aides also hope he can win the maryland 
primary 67 delegates at stake and the washington caucuses 65 on 
the same day to go with a rousing victory at home in massachusetts 
98 and rhode island 22 
dukakis aides say they hope he can win delegates in 110 of the 
171 congressional districts voting on march 8 and hope for 350 or 
so delegates overall 
they believe that would put dukakis in the lead for nominating 
delegates just as the campaign heads for the industrial states 
where he should feel more at home 
if we can move out of super tuesday with a good total of 
delegates i think we will be clearly established he said in an 
interview as his jet carried him from austin to atlanta ga 
largely bypassing the conservative vote in deepest dixie 
dukakis is concentrating on south florida where the population has 
been swelled in recent years by droves of coldweather refugees he 
also will make an effort in central florida and campaign 
extensively in texas whose 183 delegates make it the biggest 
single prize on march 8 
this emphasis is seen by the decision of where to have dukakis 
campaign personally and where to advertise on television the first 
wave of ads were aired in south florida and parts of texas as well 
as baltimore 
barring changes in the schedule dukakis will campaign in areas 
around atlanta competing for a fraction of georgias 77 delegates 
and in targeted areas of north carolina 82 delegates 
dont look for the man with the new england accent and the 
wingtipped shoes to spend much time if any in alabama 
mississippi louisiana oklahoma virginia and kentucky hell 
leave tennessee and missouri to favorite sons gore and gephardt 
well do well by winning delegates in a lot of congressional 
districts says senior campaign aide leslie dach since most 
delegates are awarded on the basis of the vote within congressional 
districts a candidate can score by campaigning in one region of a 
state and ignoring another 
thus in a state like florida or texas he might not pull enough 
votes statewide to be a winner but he could leave with plenty of 
delegates

an eightdayold baby girl born with 
almost no brain died one day after she was taken off a respirator 
used to preserve her organs for transplant hospital officials said 
today 
evelyn keys died peacefully sunday night said dr joyce 
peabody chief of neonatology at loma linda university medical 
center 
her heart valves eyes and corneas have been donated the 
parents are saddened but still very pleased their daughter could 
give some gift of life ms peabody said in a statement 
a previous statement released by the hospital during the early 
morning hours today had said the baby was still alive but ms 
peabody said the baby had died at 1035 pm sunday 
the infant with the usually fatal birth defect called 
anencephaly was part of a novel organ donor program at loma linda 
university medical center to use the hearts and livers of such 
babies once they are legally declared braindead 
loma linda has developed the nations first guidelines for using 
such infants as organ donors 
the hospital 65 miles east of los angeles is known for its 
frequent infant heart transplants thirteen babies have received 
new hearts at the center with nine surviving 
baby evelyn never met the hospitals critieria for brain death 
however and was taken off lifesupport systems with parental 
approval saturday ms peabody said 
the infant continued to breath on her own and received feedings 
by mouth until she died said hospital spokeswoman anita rockwell 
on saturday ms peabody said the baby girl was breathing but 
was already showing signs of gradual deterioration 
the hospital uses life support systems on until babies are brain 
dead in order to maintain organs until they can be used 
anencephalic babies are connected to respirators soon after birth 
and doctors then monitor their abilities to breathe on their own 
if they cant breathe by themselves they are declared brain dead 
before any organ deterioration caused by oxygen loss occurs 
if they continue to breathe on their own slow deterioration 
eventually makes their organs unsuitable for transplants ms 
rockwell said 
evelyn was born feb 20 in san antonio texas to judy keys 22 
and airman todd keys 21 of the 6993rd electronic security squad 
at lackland air force base the infant was flown to loma linda that 
same day to be used in the donor program

colorados first experiment with highoxygen fuels 
ended monday without the epidemic of clogged fuel injectors and 
stalled cars predicted by opponents of the smogcontrol program 
we were very surprised we thought thered be more consumer 
backlash said jerry levine of amoco corp in chicago levine had 
opposed the mandatory program in hearings last year before 
colorados air quality commission 
it will be another month however before state officials know 
whether the experiment reduced levels of carbon monoxide along the 
eastern slope of the rockies 
at the citys milehigh altitude ordinary gasoline burns 
incompletely and the unexpended fuel emitted into the air adds to 
the pollution which frequently robs denverites of their mountain 
views 
gasoline suppliers plan to switch back to traditional gasoline 
without oxygenated additives sometime in march but oxygenated 
fuels will be back in the service stations nov 1 when next 
seasons fourmonth program begins 
since jan 1 colorado motorists have been able to buy only 
highoxygen blended fuels either etherbased mtbe or cornbased 
ethanol state officials predicted the program would reduce carbon 
monoxide levels by at least 8 percent this year 
oil company executives and car mechanics predicted highways 
would be littered with stalled cars and repair shops overflowing 
with clogged fuel injectors and other mechanical ailments 
there have been no major problems said state air pollution 
control specialist kim livo the actual program probably has 
relieved a lot of concerns people might have had before it 
started 
the more skeptical agree 
the negative effects on our cars have been fairly minimal 
said bmw service manager mike palmieri at ralph schomp oldsmobile 
honda and bmw in littleton mechanics at the dealership had 
predicted they would be flooded with complaints of vapor lock and 
drying and cracking fuel lines and injector seals 
i think everybody including us guys here are willing to put up 
with some minor inconveniences to clean up denvers air we live 
here too palmieri said 
he said he thought the fuels reduced mileage by about 5 percent 
livo denied the fuels had any effect on mileage 
oil companies also had predicted consumers would be stuck with 
the blended fuels all year because it would be too expensive for 
suppliers to switch fuels twice a year 
now total petroleum amoco and conoco say they plan to stop 
selling the oxyfuels when the program ends and current supplies 
run out 
levine said the blended fuels cost amoco about three cents extra 
per gallon though the additional price was offset this year by a 
drop in gasoline prices overall 
both levine and palmieri remained skeptical about next years 
program they said colorados transition to oxygenated fuels was 
smooth only because mtbe still accounted for 95 percent to 98 
percent of the market 
that balance probably will change next year when the oxyfuels 
program is expanded to four months and the required oxygen level 
rises from 15 percent to 2 percent 
oil companies favor mtbe because it has been used as an octane 
enhancer since the early 1980s said levine 
oil companies and many dealers have recommended mtbe as being 
safer than ethanol although the big three us auto makers and 
many import manufacturers have said their cars can be adjusted 
either to mtbe or ethanol blends at the 2 percent oxygen level 
ethanol producers and state officials say the cornbased product 
got a bad rap in denver three summers ago when a batch of 
lowquality gasohol hit the area since then they say state 
regulations have ensured a higherquality blend 
state officials have been adamant about securing ethanol a place 
in the air quality program and giving consumers a choice of 
oxyfuels livo said the air quality control commission will review 
the program this spring and make its final recommendations for next 
year 
whatever the commission decides levine said well accept it 
well live with it 
the oxy fuels program targeted the 16 million people living in 
the front range from colorado springs north to fort collins 
because oil companies could not deliver oxygenated fuels through 
their pipelines just to this area however nearly all of colorado 
and part of wyoming more than 2 million people wound up 
switching fuels

israelis in this communal farm 
expressed shock monday over the arrest of one young member in the 
beating of two arabs but they said government policy in the 
occupied territories placed soldiers in an untenable position 
sgt saguy harpaz a gesher resident was detained in the 
communal dining hall friday night after a cbs news videotape showed 
that he and three other soldiers beat two bound arab protesters 
with rocks for more than half an hour in nablus 
people who saw the film were shocked said catherine gur 
38 who taught harpaz in elementary school it was very brutal 
he did not act according to the values we impart on our children 
ms gur and other kibbutz residents held defense minister 
yitzhak rabin responsible saying his announced policy of beating 
arab rioters instead of shooting them has confused troops 
ms gur said harpaz 20 joined the army because of an ideal 
to serve the country and to defend the country but she said 
rabins policy had taught him to beat up women and children 
harpaz and the other three soldiers were arrested and their 
deputy unit commander a captain was suspended the four will be 
tried by a military court the two arabs were ordered released 
on monday harpaz was released into the custody of his parents 
wearing his uniform he sat in the small living room of his 
parents garden apartment drinking coffee he was surrounded by a 
dozen relatives and friends 
im happy hes out said his mother amalia but im angry 
about what happened to him he seems to have changed over the past 
few weeks it was an unfair responsibility to have been placed on 
such young shoulders 
they make my son into a murderer his father yossi told 
the yediot ahronot newspaper saguy isnt violent by nature he 
grew up in this kibbutz and was educated with values 
harpazs arrest prompted intense soulsearching in gesher where 
600 israelis live within view of jordan 80 miles north of 
jerusalem and in other kibbutzim which are traditional bastions 
of liberalism and patriotism 
kibbutzniks are considered the backbone of the army with 
disproportionately large numbers volunteering for combat units and 
serving as officers 
kibbutzim were founded on the ideas of equality selfsacrifice 
and socialist principles they have produced many of the countrys 
leftwing leaders 
how israel quells unrest in the occupied territories has 
become a question for the whole kibbutz society absorption 
minister yacov tzur himself a kibbutznik said monday during a 
meeting of the united kibbutz movement 
we know we are sending our children to do a very difficult 
task that cannot be compared to anything we did in the past he 
said 
former defense minister ariel sharon accused army leaders of 
responding to the case with hysteria he criticized officers who 
arrested a soldier a fighter in his kibbutz in the dinning 
hall and took him from the bosom of his family 
ms gur said six gesher members serve in the army in the west 
bank and gaza strip its hard to speak to them about what they 
do because they are ashamed just ashamed she said 
unlike in the past many of geshers young people are no longer 
eager to serve she said 
added harpazs 19yearold brother chen who will join the army 
thursday i have zero motivation if thats the way the country 
treats its soldiers i dont want to be a part of it 
ms gur said kibbutz education stresses the values of tolerance 
and acceptance of other ethnic groups however she said the only 
arabs most kibbutz children come in contact with are laborers 
building homes or picking up garbage 
she described harpaz as an intelligent youth with a rough 
exterior but underneath hes still quite sensitive a child she 
noted that he wrote his final essay in high school on democracy 
gesher is nestled in rolling hills south of the sea of galilee 
its members grow cotton mine gypsum and produce magnets and 
ceramic wares

it has happened so many times over the 
past 25 years that ron burrows long ago lost count 
a car drives toward burrows house the heads inside turning 
about until it comes to a stop in his driveway at the end of the 
short road leading to craigville beach the befuddled motorist 
either turns the car around or asks burrows for directions 
the problem the kennedy family compound is accessible only from 
irving avenue in hyannisport a half mile from irving street where 
burrows lives 
im so used to directing cars to the kennedy compound that 
ive even thought of setting up an information booth and charging 
them 10 cents a piece burrows joked monday 
now his days as an informal tour guide are coming to an end 
he and the other residents of irving street last week persuaded 
town officials to change the name of the deadend street to inwood 
lane the name change became official thursday burrows is just 
waiting for a public works crew to change the street sign 
that might take a couple of months he said 
burrows 80 doesnt blame tourists for seeking a peek at the 
kennedy compound 
but it was a nuisance with all the cars coming up such a small 
street and sometimes it was a problem because big trucks trying to 
deliver merchandise to the compound would end up here

protestant fundamentalism is 
growing rapidly in this predominantly roman catholic nation and 
american missionary don exleys yellow and white revival tent 
symbolizes the movement 
one night last week 63 people crossed a muddy field in a hard 
rain to hear exley who represents the assemblies of god preach a 
spirited sermon in spanish he told them god would save their souls 
if they prayed hard enough and sang loud enough 
before the twohour revival ended in the tent in suburban 
martinez many of the men women and children had spoken in 
tongues and eight bowed before exley to be saved exley said his 
revival attract crowds of up to 200 people 
the assemblies of god is trying to minister to felt needs 
exley said in an interview people come and theyre coming more 
and more because theyre hurting financially physically or in 
their relations with family 
sidney rooy of buenos aires a historian of religion said 
pentecostal churches are the fastestgrowing religious movements 
among argentinas 31 million people the assemblies of god arrived 
here 40 years ago but its rapid growth began just five years ago 
another historian the rev timothy hamilton of buenos aires 
said the popularity of protestant evangelism has been growing for a 
decade exley claims argentina now has about 28 million 
evangelical christians in a population that is 90 percent catholic 
jimmy swaggart the disgraced assemblies of god television 
evangelist visited argentina in 1986 on a fournation crusade that 
included brazil chile and paraguay a packed house of 60000 heard 
him preach at the river plate stadium in buenos aires 
carlos annacondia a former salesman probably is the most 
popular argentine evangelist he preaches in quilmes just outside 
the capital 
in his magazine abundant life he published pictures of a recent 
crusade in paraguay during which he met president alfredo 
stroessner the general who has ruled that neighboring country 
since a coup in 1954 he features the meeting with stroessner in 
promotional material 
exley attributes the popularity of his religious movement in 
part to years of high inflation and disillusionment with 
military government and democratic government 
he holds revivals four to six nights a week in the tent exley 
38 has been an assemblies of god missionary since 1976 in 
argentina and argentina 
as an example of his denominations growth he cites cordoba 
the northwestern industrial center and secondlargest city of 
argentina exley said he began the assemblies of god ministry there 
12 years ago with 75 people in a small church and cordoba now has 
20 churches serving 30004000 members 
the church claims up to 14 million members in brazil onetenth 
of the population and 12000 in paraguay 
when asked how the movement will be affected by the swaggart sex 
scandal exley said for sure it affects his credibility it 
affects his credibility a lot im sure itll affect his finances 
but its very early to know how farreaching 
swaggarts tearful confession of sin was was frontpage news in 
argentina 
exley said swaggart and the assemblies of god provided most of 
the money for the blocklong lot where the tent stands provide the 
swaggart television program dubbed in spanish and were expected to 
help build a church complex 
other financial help from the swaggart group included financing 
an elementary school in the lowerclass lomas de zamora section of

mayor federico pena has ordered an investigation 
into reports that street crews spend more time eating and reading 
than working 
i am outraged by the information that a handful of city 
employees has been wasting taxpayers dollars by intentionally 
neglecting their assigned responsibilities as members of the citys 
work crews pena said in a statement 
he commented after seeing a news series that kusatv of denver 
began broadcasting sunday the stations news crews followed city 
crews for eight hours and videotaped them with a hidden camera 
complaints about the citys public works department including 
slow cleanup following a december blizzard have fueled a recall 
effort against pena 
the station taped several street crews leaving public works 
yards in the morning then spending time at stores restaurants and 
talking with other crews 
in one case kusa said a crew drove 64 miles but did no work in 
its eighthour shift while visiting five food stores 
pena said disciplinary action would be taken against city 
workers who could be identified from the videotape 
while the evidence appears to implicate less than 10 of the 
citys 11000 employees the type of intolerable and inexcusable 
behavior allegedly involved unjustly damages the reputation of the 
overwhelming number of city employees who have worked long and hard 
on behalf of the people of denver pena said 
pena also said earlier evidence had led him to begin a 
management review to improve supervision in the citys pothole 
repair operation 
chuck mills president of the city employees union and a public 
works employee said if there were problems with workers taking 
excessive time off they were isolated

the reagan administration on monday urged a 
federal appeals court to stay out of a dispute over whether the war 
powers resolution should have been invoked when the navy began 
escorting oil tankers in the persian gulf 
justice department attorney james spears urged a threejudge 
panel to uphold a lower courts dismissal of a lawsuit brought by 
110 members of congress to force president reagan to report to 
congress that us forces were sent into hostilities last summer in 
the persian gulf 
our policy has begun to bear fruit spears said of the 
navys operation to protect reflagged kuwaiti oil tankers from 
attack by warring iraqi or iranian forces in the persian gulf 
for a court to recharacterize the us role threatens to undercut 
this progress 
spears called the issue quintessentially a nonjusticiable 
political question that courts cannot decide 
this is a situation where a political decision has been made 
by the political branches it is not one for the judicial branch to 
come in and second guess spears said 
the 1973 war powers resolution requires that in the absence of a 
declared war the president must notify congress within 48 hours of 
placing us forces in hostilities 
the lawsuit was filed by rep michael lowery dwash and other 
members of congress after president reagan refused to file a 
report notifying congress that the navy ships escorting reflagged 
kuwaiti oil tankers had been sent into hosilities 
the case was dismissed late last year by us district judge 
george revercomb who ruled that courts did not have jurisdiction 
to consider the claim 
alan morrison an attorney representing the lawmakers argued 
that unless we are to say the statute is unenforceable it 
seems to me the court has the power to at least require that the 
president file the report with congress 
chief judge patricia wald questioned spears assertion that 
courts are not qualified to decide what situation amounts to 
hostilities which is essentially a military and diplomatic 
question 
recalling vietnam wald said that if people are in jungles 
fighting and dying you would say that is still a political 
question if the president did not want to submit the report to 
congress 
no matter whats going on overseas thats a political 
question spears said he said congress has the power under the 
constitution to declare war congress cant take the power that 
the constitution assigned it and assign it to a court to decide 
the question 
judge stephen williams questioned why congress had not passed 
resolutions declaring that the persian gulf operation was covered 
by the war powers resolution 
the fact that congress hasnt acted is not relevant to 
whether the president must obey the resolutions requirment that he 
notify congress that a military operation has begun morrison said 
the war powers resolution was enacted because congress was 
concerned that its role in deciding whether to send us troops 
into armed conflict had been greatly diminished morrison said 
the whole purpose of the war powers resolution is not to have 
to pass a new law every time we have a vietnam or a cambodia 
morrison said 
but williams said the lawmakers who filed the suit were 
inviting courts to add a third voice to us foreign policy where 
events found by a court fitted into the meaning of the resolution 
the resolution provides that once he has reported that us 
forces have entered hostilities the president must withdraw troops 
in 60 days if congress doesnt formally declare war or the 
lawmakers take action to extend the deadline

for european leaders this weeks nato 
summit is a welcome chance to join president reagan in trumpeting 
alliance unity and highlighting its recent successes 
privately though the europeans may add some words of worry 
the most immediate concern to europeans is a lack of western 
consensus on how to balance the need to guard against a possible 
soviet attack with the hope for further reductions in eastwest 
tensions 
a more deeply rooted worry is that budgetary pressures may soon 
compel washington to pull some of its 326000 troops out of western 
europe 
the summit meeting wednesday and thursday is likely to declare 
the north atlantic treaty organization united on the need to keep 
some nuclear weapons in europe the problem is deciding how many 
and which kinds 
it also is expected to demand that the sovietled warsaw pact 
alliance accept proportionally bigger conventional arms and troop 
cuts than the west according to nato sources familiar with 
preparations for the summit 
but the summit will sidestep at least in public the questions 
of whether and when to improve natos very shortrange atomic arms 
most of which are deployed by the united states on west german 
soil smaller numbers are in belgium britain the netherlands 
italy and turkey 
attention has been drawn to these weapons which include 
ballistic nuclear missiles and artillery since reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev signed a treaty in december eliminating 
more than 2000 us and soviet nuclear missiles which have ranges 
from 300 to 3000 miles 
moscow has suggested scrapping all shortrange nuclear arms of 
which the east bloc has more than a 101 numerical edge in europe 
according to nato figures 
but lord carrington the nato secretary general said in a 
recent interview that all 16 alliance members are steadfastly 
opposed to such a complete elimination alliance members see the 
shortrange weapons as vital to natos strategy of responding to an 
attack with a full range of military options 
the one thing that everybody is agreed on is that you cant 
have a third zero carrington said refering to the inf treaty 
which eliminates two categories of nuclear missile 
west germany however wants nato to begin negotiations to bring 
the soviet total of shortrange nuclear arms down to natos level 
but most of the other allies worry that such talks would eventually 
lead to a total ban on these weapons they want to hold off until 
progress is made in reducing soviet advantages in conventional and 
chemical arms 
a further complication is washingtons desire backed most 
strongly by britain to upgrade natos shortrange nuclear arsenal 
in part by deploying a new longerrange version of the lance 
ballistic missile key factions of the bonn government strongly 
oppose this saying it would force west germany to bear too much of 
the nuclear risk 
although bonn and washington appear to have agreed to play down 
the shortrange nuclear issue british prime minister margaret 
thatcher is expected to tell the brussels summit that nato must 
carry through with a commitment first made in 1983 to upgrade 
these weapons 
french president franoics mitterrand however has indicated 
that he is unhappy with the public focus on improving natos 
remaining nuclear arsenal 
it would be paradoxical and inopportune to overarm just now 
as washington and moscow are striving to further improve eastwest 
relations mitterrand said in an interview published monday by 
frances largest circulation newspaper oeustfrance 
the presence of mitterrand at the nato meeting is significant 
it demonstrates a growing desire by france to tighten its political 
links to the alliance 
no french president has attended a nato summit since president 
charles de gaulle pulled french forces out of natos joint command 
in 1966 
beyond the immediate concerns about how to organize western arms 
control priorities the european leaders view the brussels meeting 
as an opportunity to underscore their support for the ussoviet 
missile treaty which must receive a twothirds vote of approval in 
the us senate 
the europeans also are eager to publicize their support for 
reagan in advance of his expected meeting with gorbachev in moscow 
in may or june

inflation has pulled the enforcement teeth 
from many government safety laws by reducing the impact of fines a 
coalition of consumer groups said monday 
penalties for violating various health and safety laws have 
remained essentially unchanged over the years while inflation has 
reduced the value of the amounts involved the consumer federation 
of america and the us public interest research group said in a 
report 
letting civil penalties be eroded by inflation operates as if 
there were a builtin depreciation schedule in our key health and 
safety statutes said michael waldman of the group public 
citizens congress watch in a statement released with the study 
examples cited in the study included 
the occupational safety and health act of 1970 retains its 
original penalties of 1000 per violation and 10000 for failure 
to provide a safe workplace to keep place with inflation these 
would have to increase to 2970 and 29700 
the federal aviation act has retained the same 1000 fine for 
violations of safety rules since 1958 inflation has reduced its 
value to onequarter of the original worth 
the consumer product safety commission act civil penalties of 
2000 per violation up to a maximum of 500000 have not changed 
since 1972 with inflation reducing them to 36 percent of their 
original impact 
the consumer groups submitted copies of the study to congress in 
support of a bill to adjust the civil penalties in federal laws to 
keep them up to date with inflation

the ability of the soviet union to 
wage an offensive land war is the most destabilizing factor in 
european security and is likely to be a key topic at this weeks 
nato summit the us ambassador to west germany said monday 
ambassador richard burt in an interview with the associated 
press also termed a publicity stunt last weeks removal of 
some soviet missiles from east germany and czechoslovakia 
he predicted that differences of opinion over modernizing 
shortrange nuclear missiles and other points of dispute would not 
disrupt the atlantic alliance meeting in brussels wednesday and 
thursday 
there is a growing consensus emerging within the alliance 
which i believe will be reflected in the summit on the importance 
now of negotiations on enhancing conventional arms stability 
burt said 
there has been a focus on the nuclear dimension of security in 
europe he said but there is a growing view that the time has 
come now to focus on the most destabilizing factor in european 
security which is the soviet capability to wage an offensive war 
against western europe 
their forces are deployed structured and trained to fight an 
offensive war in europe burt said adding later that he meant an 
offensive land war 
burt said it was mandatory to address this problem in arms 
control negotiations 
military power casts a political shadow the threat is not 
just one of outright invasion 
there are about 990000 active duty nato troops in central 
europe most of them in west germany western sources say they face 
about 12 million sovietled warsaw pact troops in eastern europe 
west german leaders already have begun calling on the soviet to 
reduce their superiority in conventional weapons and undertake 
other arms control measures 
during the presummit preparations washington officials had a 
highly publicized dispute with west german officials over us 
insistence on the need to modernize shortrange nuclear weapons in 
western europe 
the reagan administration later promised not to insist on the 
modernization issue as a topic at this weeks summit 
there are no serious differences between bonn and washington 
on these subjects added the 41yearold ambassador an expert on 
arms control and european security issues 
burt has been speaking out against claims by some politicians in 
bonn that the intermediaterange missile treaty signed in december 
leaves west germany vulnerable to soviet nuclear attack 
we will continue to be able to deter an attack in europe with 
us nuclear weapons deployed in europe and at sea he said 
there is a sense that this agreement leads to the 
denuclearization of europe that is not the case 
in fact we should resist a trend towards the 
denuclearization of europe he added 
asked about the highly publicized removal of some soviet ss12 
rockets from warsaw pact members east germany and czechoslovakia 
last week burt said i tend to think this was basically a 
publicity stunt 
i think they were mainly aiming to win points with western 
public opinion burt said 
the ambassador added that only when the soviets comply with the 
verification provisions of the treaty will there be certainty that 
the missiles have been destroyed the treaty is awaiting 
ratification by the us senate

a psychiatrist who failed to commit a 
mentally ill man can not be held negligent in the mans commission 
of murder three days later the maine supreme court ruled monday 
laurence d herst was acting in an official capacity on behalf 
of the state and therefore immune from civil liability when he 
examined henry a taylor and determined he did not need to be 
involuntarily committed to a mental institution the high court 
ruled in a 60 decision 
herst was employed by the maine medical center at the time 
while that is not a stateowned facility herst examined taylor at 
the request of the cumberland county sheriffs department 
even though dr herst is not employed by a state mental 
hospital he is acting in an official capacity on behalf of the 
state when performing the task of determining for involuntary 
commitment purposes whether a person is a mentally ill individual 
and because of his illness poses a likelihood of serious harm 
the court said 
taylor was arrested nov 14 1978 after he drove through toll 
booths and onto a restricted area at the portland international 
jetport he was taken to the cumberland county jail where he began 
to show erratic and violent behavior the court said 
herst examined taylor and found that he did not exhibit 
tendencies that indicated he was a danger to himself or others 
after taylor refused to voluntarily commit himself he left the 
hospital 
three days later taylor killed louise michaud 84 during a 
shooting spree he barricaded himself in his house but surrendered 
four hours later when tear gas was used to force him outside 
in 1979 he was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity and 
sentenced to the augusta mental health institute he was released 
shortly after a 1984 supreme court ruling that set aside a lower 
courts denial of taylors petition that he be released from the 
institute as an outpatient 
no suit had been filed the supreme court issued its opinion at 
the request of a lower court with the consent of taylor and herst 
taylors attorney eugene c coughlin of bangor said he had not 
received a copy of fridays decision and declined to comment 
steven j mogul an attorney for herst was in court and could not 
be immediately reached his secretary said

evan mecham today became the first 
governor in almost 60 years to face an impeachment trial as the 
states chief justice convened a jury of 30 state senators to 
decide whether to remove him from office 
first on the agenda was a series of motions including one to 
throw out the charges against mecham a republican whose 13 months 
in office have also been scarred by a recall effort and a criminal 
indictment 
the senate trial of evan mecham does not concern merely this 
one officeholder but instead addresses the very essence of 
democracy in our state constitution senate minority leader alan 
stephens a democrat said in a floor speech shortly before the 
court convened 
we are really testing our form of government will we stand up 
and do our duty amid calls from the public to intimidate us 
senate leaders say theyll take up to two months to hear 
testimony and arguments before deciding whether the governor should 
be removed and possibly barred from holding elective office 
mecham 63 also faces a march 22 criminal trial on six felony 
charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan and a may 17 recall 
election 
twentynine of the states 30 senators were at desks in the 
brownwalled chamber as the presiding officer arizona supreme 
court frank x gordon jr convened the senate as an impeachment 
court a small gallery was packed with reporters and visitors and 
the trial was being broadcast on radio and television 
the state house was represented by a five member impeachment 
board of managers or prosecutors while mecham himself stayed at 
his temporary office in suburban glendale and was represented by 
several lawyers 
after the trial began the senate agreed on a voice vote to let 
the governors original lawyer murray miller withdraw from the 
case miller was replaced by washington attorney jerris leonard 
last week in a surprise move 
a clerk read the impeachment articles and the senate then 
considered and denied a defense motion seeking to have 
consideration of an article referring to the campaign loan delayed 
until after his criminal trial 
the senate broke for lunch at noon while considering a motion to 
throw out all charges 
mecham maintains hell be acquitted in both trials win the 
recall election and return to the office he gave up to democratic 
secretary of state rose mofford after he was impeached feb 5 on a 
4614 house vote 
the senator absent this morning was republican hal runyan a 
republican who suffered a stroke in november 
at a news conference saturday mecham said winning acquittal in 
criminal court is more important than persuading the senate to keep 
him in office 
i could have my freedom taken away and be sent to jail if i 
were guilty in criminal court doesnt that somehow seem to you 
a little more important than the job as governor it does to 
me mecham said 
the state supreme court on friday refused an emergency request 
by mecham to intervene and delay the senate trial until after the 
criminal trial the court planned to discuss tuesday whether to 
grant an injunction although several justices already have said 
they believe the court lacks jurisdiction 
mecham said he planned to take the issue to federal court a new 
attorney hired by mecham last week thomas crowe said he would 
decide by wednesday where the appeal would be filed 
the governor claims the impeachment trial threatens his right to 
a fair criminal trial because the senate proceedings will not be 
bound by the same rules of evidence as a criminal court but will be 
widely publicized to prospective jurors 
as governor of this state i ask nothing more than is accorded 
to every gardenvariety criminal he said is this a star 
chamber or will we proceed under the timetested constitutional 
mandate that i be afforded all of my basic constitutional rights 
the house has leveled 23 charges against mecham accusing him of 
concealing the 350000 loan misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and trying to 
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state 
official against a witness before the grand jury that investigated 
mecham 
senate majority leader bob usdane said the senate has decided to 
hear testimony on all charges even if it appears there could be a 
vote to convict him on the first charges heard 
prosecutor paul eckstein said he and cocounsel william french 
planned to begin with testimony on the allegation that mecham 
ordered department of public safety director ralph milstead not to 
cooperate with a probe of the alleged death threat against former 
mecham aide donna carlson who testified before the state grand 
jury investigating mecham 
state official lee watkins who has since resigned has denied 
making the threat 
twothirds of the 30 senate votes are required to convict 
mecham who is the first us governor to be impeached since 1929 
when huey long of louisiana and henry s johnston of oklahoma were 
impeached long was never tried while johnston was removed 
of the 16 governors in the nations history to be impeached six 
were convicted and removed from office 
mecham who never was considered part of the states republican 
establishment won the governorship in a threeway race 1986 on his 
fifth try 
he immediately became embroiled in controversy when he canceled 
a martin luther king holiday for state workers saying it was 
illegally declared by his predecessor democratic gov bruce 
babbitt 
mecham has been criticized for defending the use of the word 
pickaninny in a book and for making remarks that angered women 
jews homosexuals and the japanese

town meeting day is as much a symbol of 
vermont as the maple sap that flows soon after but this years 
town meetings find vermonters fearful of their states future 
because farms are going out of business and open land is sprouting 
vacation homes 
we are losing our farms and we are losing rural vermont at an 
unbelievable rate says jack starr a dairy farmer from troy 
the changing vermont is evident everywhere 
vermont has lost more than 300 dairy farms 10 percent of its 
total in just the last two years 
average housing values fueled by competition from affluent 
outofstaters have increased 48 percent in two years 
the annual number of applications for development permits has 
almost doubled in the past six years 
the number of houses being bought by and built for 
outofstaters seeking a vacation retreat is skyrocketing in 1986 
52 percent of all new housing constructed in windham county alone 
was second homes 
the reasons for the development pressure are simple improved 
transportation networks have brought vermont closer to boston and 
new york a booming economy has provided people with the cash and 
vermonts ski resorts are expanding to become more attractive 
yearround 
to help preserve farms some towns are using the limited clout 
of their annual town meetings a new england fixture in which 
residents vote directly on town expenditures and policy in pawlet 
voters are being asked to exempt farm silos from property taxes a 
move that would mean a savings of 200 a year for each of the 
towns 17 farms 
its going to be a combination of these little things that 
keep the farmers going said state rep perry waite of pawlet 
do you want new jersey or do you want a few farms left i dont 
feel we can afford to lose one farm in pawlet 
and the legislature is considering a controversial 40 million 
package that includes the firstinthenation state subsidy for 
dairy farmers to offset cuts in federal milk price supports 
its a radical proposal but these times demand it said 
rep paul poirier the house democratic leader and chairman of a 
special house committee on growth 
this has become the year of the farmer said rep michael 
bernhardt the house republican leader saving farms seems to be 
something people can identify with as a way to save vermont 
the concerns over growth reached a boiling point last fall 
prompting gov madeleine kunin to appoint a special governors 
commission on vermonts future 
more than 2000 people attended the commissions 11 public 
hearings with several hundred voicing their fears 
i dont see a lot of rural going on anymore said peter 
saman of woodstock if vermont is going to be here i think rural 
has to exist or were going to live in disneyland 
victoria fraser of williston told the commission i am afraid 
we will obscure the soul of vermont by covering her with parking 
lots highways and condominiums 
too many vermonters in towns near major ski areas and tourist 
centers are feeling like strangers in their own communities 
hesitating to go to the grocery store or post office for fear of 
sitting in traffic or waiting in line said mary mccallum of 
proctorsville 
kunin armed with the commissions report devoted her entire 
stateofthestate address in january to detailing todays 
unprecedented growth and describing her own fears about the 
changes 
kunin said the only way to regain control is to inaugurate a 
new and tough planning process which will guide vermont into a 
future that we envision for ourselves 
the special house growth committee has endorsed a farreaching 
proposal that calls for 20 million to go into a special fund to 
buy up open land and help provide affordable housing it also calls 
for stronger planning and would provide for regional tax sharing 
under which propertyrich resort towns would share some of their 
tax wealth with outlying communities 
but the cornerstone of the legislative proposal is the dairy 
assistance prompted by reports that between 10 percent and 40 
percent of the states farmers will be forced out of business in 
the next two years 
the federal price support for 100 pounds of milk paid to farmers 
now stands at 1060 almost 3 below what it was in 1980 and the 
decline has meant the difference to some farms under the proposal 
the state would pay farmers an extra 50 cents per 100 pounds

the october stock market crash will contribute 
to a significant slowdown in economic growth this year but the 
country should be able to avoid a recession economists for top 
us corporations predicted monday 
the national association of business economists said its latest 
member survey found economists in a more upbeat mood than three 
months ago when more than half of them said the record fall in 
stock prices on oct 19 would lead to a recession in 1988 
in the latest survey the number forecasting a recession this 
year had dropped to onefourth good news for republicans hoping to 
hold onto the white house but an overwhelming 83 percent of the 
anlysts said a downturn was very likely before the end of the next 
presidents first year in office 
back in november there was a great deal of nervousness about 
what oct 19 meant to the economy said kathleen cooper who 
briefed reporters on the new forecast since that time we have 
had good christmas sales good employment growth and consumer 
confidence surveys have improved these things make economists feel 
better about the future 
while the next president will likely have to deal with a 
recession early in his first term the economists said they 
expected the economy this year to expand at a modest pace of 2 
percent as measured by the gross national product 
this would be about half of the 39 percent gnp growth turned in 
during 1987 the reagan administration by contrast is more 
optimistically forecasting 24 percent gnp growth this year when 
measured from the fourth quarter of 1987 
even though most of us dont expect a recession we will have 
much slower growth than in 1987 said ms cooper who is chief 
economist for security pacific national bank of los angeles she 
said the stock market decline had caused many economists to slash 
their gnp forecasts by between 05 percent and 1 percent 
in other predictions the survey results from 200 economists 
found 
unemployment will creep up this year because of the sluggish 
growth forecasts rising from the current 58 percent level to 61 
percent by the end of the year 
inflation will remain under control with consumer prices 
rising 42 percent this year a bit slower than the 44 percent 
consumer inflation recorded in 1987 
the federal budget deficit will rise to 157 billion in the 
current fiscal year but then resume falling droping to 140 
billion by 1990 this is more pessimistic than the reagan 
administration which puts this years deficit at 1467 billion a 
further improvement from the 1504 billion 1987 deficit 
the foreign trade deficit which hit a record 171 billion 
last year will finally start coming down dipping to 150 billion 
this year and 130 billion in 1989 half of this years overall 
growth will come from improvements in the trade deficit the 
economists said 
interest rates will hold steady ending up the year about 
where they are currently banks cut their prime rate used to set 
interest rates on a variety of corporate and consumer loans to 85 
percent in early february and analysts forecast this would be the 
rate in effect at years end 
ms cooper said that the optimistic outlook for interest rates 
stemmed in part from a belief that the federal reserve would be 
easing its grip on the money supply in the first half of the year 
in an effort to keep the recovery alive 
she said over twothirds of the economists believed the fed 
would be easing credit conditions in the coming six months with 
onefourth of the analysts looking for a cut in the discount rate 
the interest the fed charges to make bank loans 
ms cooper said that the economists believe that the dollar 
which has at time fallen sharply on foreign currency exchanges 
will stabilize this year with only onefifth of the analysts 
expecting a decline of 10 percent or more just three months ago 
more than 40 percent of the economists were forecasting a decline 
in the dollar that was at least that large

southern democratic leaders are 
discussing the possibility of acting together on a presuper 
tuesday endorsement of one of the six candidates pursuing their 
partys presidential nomination 
former gov charles robb of virginia and sen sam nunn of 
georgia confirmed on monday such discussions have taken place but 
both cautioned against assuming that an endorsement would be 
forthcoming 
its only a possibility said robb 
nunn described it as a question that is in considerable 
doubt 
robb and nunn discussed the endorsement in separate interviews 
during a meeting of the democratic leadership council a group of 
elected officials who banded together in 1985 to halt what they 
considered the leftward drift of the national party 
robb was chairman of the dlc the past two years and nunn 
succeeded him at this meeting 
the agenda for the twoday meeting included discussions of the 
economy but politics was the topic that dominated most 
conversation particularly the impact of super tuesday march 8 when 
20 states most of them south of the masondixon line and american 
samoa will hold democratic presidential primaries or caucuses 
in a luncheon speech nunn who considered entering the 
democratic presidential race and decided against it warned that 
political marketing seems to be replacing political leadership 
the georgia senator said first campaign consultants tell the 
candidates what they think the public wants to hear usually more 
services and less taxes then the candidates deliver the message 
usually avoiding any implication of shortterm individual sacrifice 
for longterm national gain 
the art of campaigning he went on is in danger of 
becoming divorced from the art of governing the real question of 
the 1988 election is not who wins but whether the winner can 
effectively govern america 
members of the dlc took the lead in convincing southern 
legislatures to schedule their presidential primaries on the same 
day in an effort to give the region a stronger voice in selection 
of the democratic presidential nominee 
robb told the group that super tuesday was important because 
democrats cant win the white house without winning the south 
its that simple 
robb noted that onethird of the delegates to the democratic 
national convention in atlanta in july would be selected on that 
day and that the 20 states also represented 207 electoral college 
votes 76 percent of those needed to be elected president 
the general election chances of the democratic party rest with 
these 20 states the preliminaries are over and super tuesday is 
indisputably the main event of the primary season 
four democratic presidential candidates are in a furious battle 
for support in the super tuesday states gov michael dukakis of 
massachusetts rep richard gephardt of missouri sen albert gore 
jr of tennessee and jesse jackson dukakis gephardt and gore are 
from super tuesday states while jackson a native of south 
carolina has a powerful base in the regions black community 
sen bob graham of florida said that 30 days after super tuesday 
there are going to be three candidates left therell be dukakis 
therell be jackson and there will be either gephardt or gore 
the former florida governor described gephardt who has made 
trade the central issue of his campaign as the only candidate 
who is running a message campaign so he has the benefit of 
operating almost in a vacuum 
graham said gore who has been counting on his southern 
background to attract votes on super tuesday has got to find 
some reason beyond geography to get people to vote for him 
gov bill clinton of arkansas summed up the debate between gore 
and gephardt this way 
gores major argument was vote for me and i wont lose the 
general election for you because im tough on foreign policy 
democrats get beat by being weak on foreign policy 
gephardts argument is ill win the general election for you 
by having a good economic policy democrats win on economic policy 
both of them are telling the truth both of them are right 
clinton said he had not been involved in discussions of an 
endorsement and said i doubt if we could all agree

a recent star wars space experiment has 
increased the confidence of pentagon scientists that they can 
defeat attempts to fool a missile defense by using decoy warheads 
the head of the program said monday 
lt gen james a abrahamson the air force general in charge of 
the strategic defense initiative organization said the socalled 
delta 181 space experiment conducted three weeks ago had provided a 
tremendous amount of data that already was expanding scientific 
understanding of how objects look as they travel through space 
that in turn will be crucial to devising infrared radar 
laser radar and other types of sensors that can tell the difference 
between a real nuclear warhead and a fake one traveling through 
space abrahamson said at a pentagon briefing 
while months if not years of research are still ahead i think 
all of our evidence so far is that yes we should be able to 
find effective ways to discriminate between decoy and real 
warheads he said 
the threestar general also acknowledged however that budget 
cuts imposed by congress this year have slowed the star wars 
program by at least a year and possibly more the reagan 
administration had wanted to spend 52 billion on research this 
year but received 35 billion 
a future president probably will not be in a position to make a 
decision on deploying a rudimentary missile defense system until 
1993 or 1994 abrahamson said and actual deployment then could not 
begin until sometime after 1995 
star wars known formally as the strategic defense initiative 
is a research program aimed at developing lasers and other types of 
exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to 
automatically shoot down incoming nuclear missiles 
abrahamson and a top program official maj andrew j green 
appeared at the pentagon on monday to discuss delta 181 which has 
been described as the most ambitious star wars experiment ever 
conducted in space 
delta 181 was launched feb 8 from the kennedy space center in 
florida it boosted a special satellite into space that was used 
for 12 hours to conduct a series of tests 
sensors on the 6000pound satellite were used to track how a 
variety of differentshaped objects appeared in space and against 
various backgrounds such as the earths surface and the portion of 
the atmosphere just above the ground called earths limb 
data from the tests are still being transmitted back to the 
ground but that process should be completed by the end of the week 
green said 
the data already in hand however show a laser radar sensor on 
board the satellite succeeded in highlighting vast differences 
in the way various objects looked in space including contrasts 
based on the weight of the object green said 
sdi officials consistently have termed the mission a success 
but the magazine aviation week and space technology reported on 
feb 15 that the satellite had been unable to complete battle 
management fire control computations 
the magazine blamed the problem on computers but air force col 
john otten assistant director of the sdi kinetic energy office 
said at the time that the problem was caused by an optical sensor 
trying to lock onto an object beyond its range 
some test data were lost when the sensor gave false information 
to onboard computers but otten said the losses were minor because 
the tracking exercise in which the sensor was to look away from a 
target and then back to the target was a secondary objective of 
the mission

the grass was being cut the windows 
washed and the cactus garden weeded as employees hurried to work 
just another monday morning at the arizona capitol 
except for the governor who went on trial 
only a few of gov evan mechams supporters showed up as his 
trial began in the senate seats were open in the gallery three 
bus loads of schoolchildren made their annual field trip to learn 
about government and the plaza in front of the senate was quiet 
most of the people are working i had to take a chance of 
losing my job to be here said andy cosentino a supporter of the 
governor who was carrying a bible and a placard people are going 
to have to make a sacrifice to make sure justice prevails 
while mechams woes have drawn some large and loud rallies the 
embattled republicans trial opened with little fanfare mecham did 
not attend the opening sesion 
by the 9 am scheduled start of his trial only a halfdozen 
protesters patrolled the plaza more are due anytime now said 
cosentino 
by 10 am their ranks had swelled to about 20 
one woman placed a large radio by her signs so she could hear 
the proceedings in the senate which must deliberate 23 charges 
made by the house 
a few retirees milled about one group laid a paper railroad 
across the courtyard with a drawing of the governor gagged and 
bound on the tracks 
hes being railroaded said wilma harm of phoenix the man 
has done nothing to be called upon like this 
when the doors were opened to public seating in the gallery 
only 15 people were in line june reynolds a retired government 
teacher who lives in scottsdale arrived two hours early and was 
first 
im concerned about whats happening to the state she said 
the loudest noises in the plaza came from the lawnmowers even 
the air was calm and the scent of orange blossom suffused the 
still air 
the house impeached mecham on feb 5 accusing him of concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and trying to 
thwart an investigation of an allegation that a state official 
threatened the life of a grand jury witness twothirds of the 30 
senate votes are required to convict

the federal government is expanding a program 
to allow more government services and nontax debts to be paid for 
with credit cards budget officials said monday 
under the program the government is expected to process 130 
million creditcard transactions annually by next year or 65 
billion worth said joseph wright deputy director of the office of 
management and budget 
it will make us the largest credit card user in the world 
wright said 
the government now accepts credit cards for some items 
including publications of the government printing office 
but wright and budget director james c miller iii told a news 
conference this program would be expanded to include a wide array 
of new items from purchasing passports to paying some fines 
credit cards will also be more widely used by the government 
itself both to pay expenses of officials who are travelling and 
for some federal procurement the officials said 
everybody uses credit cards except for the federal 
government miller said 
the comments came as the white house released president reagans 
report to congress on management of the united states 
government 
the report noted that over half of us households own one or 
more credit cards and that the administration planned to begin 
making more use of them 
for the government credit cards make collections easier in an 
electronic environment reduce delinquencies cut down on bad 
checks eliminate paperwork and improve information received on 
collections the report said 
the report said that agencies that would start accepting credit 
cards by this april included 
the interstate commerce commission for duties fees and fines 
the national archives for sales of documents and publications 
the us courts for filing fees fines opinions and 
videotapes of proceedings 
the federal trade commission for fines and fees 
the army corps of engineeers for permits fees and map sales 
the federal emergency management agency for sale of flood 
maps 
wright said that omb is also working with the irs to develop 
guidelines that might be used later on to enable taxpayers pay 
their taxes with credit cards however he said to do so would 
require legislation from congress legislation the administration 
is not currently seeking 
the management report also said the government is studying for 
possible future use a system under which smart cards would be 
issued by the government to those who receive federal payments and 
benefits including social security recipients 
these cards would have embedded on them information about 
the cardholder that can be accessed electronically potentially 
the cards could make available funds for food stamps social 
security payments or grants and control their use electronically 
through central computers

jesse jacksons strong secondplace finish in 
maine following respectable showings elsewhere proves he is 
attaining what he lacked throughout 1984 expansion beyond his 
black base of support 
in a state with a 1 percent black population jackson got 28 
percent of the vote on sunday after campaigning for only two days 
in maine winner michael dukakis well known to maine voters as 
governor of nearby massachusetts garnered 42 percent 
on monday addressing cheering students at pembroke state 
university in north carolina jackson shouted talk about 
mainstream try the state of maine 
political consultant ann lewis who has informally advised the 
jackson campaign called maine the most significant breakthrough 
state for him so far 
in iowa and new hampshire he finished fourth out of seven 
contenders she noted after devoting considerable time and 
resources in minnesota he was second with 20 percent in last 
weeks caucuses thanks to the states liberal activists she said 
but in maine where jacksons 28 percent contrasted to the 1 
percent that he got when he ran in 1984 she said the force of 
his message produced votes for him in a state in which he has been 
unable to make a major commitment of resources 
in maine jackson did buy 10000 worth of tv ads in the days 
before the caucuses 
bob beckel a top political adviser to walter mondales 1984 
camapign called jackson one of the best hidden political stories 
of the year 
i would say its a sign of a growing movement among nonblack 
supporters of jackson and for people to try to ignore it theyre 
making a great mistake he said 
people dont want to buy the notion that jesse jackson has got 
a message that people listen to and that has begun to rise above 
his blackness he added somebody in this party has to to 
recognize that this is a significant guy in the party 
jackson carried two of maines largest cities portland and 
bangor and won considerable support among the gay community and 
students in his bid to expand his base he has targeted those 
groups as well as poor people bluecollar workers and farmers 
he beat rep richard gephardt dmo handily in the mill town 
of jay both candidates went to jay last fall to show solidarity 
with workers of international paper co who have been on strike 
since last june the company has hired replacements in the meantime 
gary mcgrane jay democratic chairman commented that jackson 
said a scab is a scab he didnt call them replacement workers 
people understand plain talk 
political analyst william schneider said that while jackson has 
gotten white votes there is evidence the votes come not so much 
from the economically oppressed as from the radical chic 
it could be the village voice crowd instead of the 
downtrodden he said citing exit polls from iowa and new 
hampshire that showed a good portion of jacksons white supporters 
were upscale welleducated liberals 
but he and other analysts also said that besides being better 
known nationwide than the other candidates excepting former 
colorado sen gary hart jackson has a clear strong message that 
does not change from state to state 
there is no other candidate in the race who really stands for 
the old politics what i would call democratic fundamentalism 
as espoused by the late sen hubert humphrey sen edward kennedy 
dmass and new york gov mario cuomo said schneider 
beckel added i think people consistently underestimate him 
they forget one important thing in politics that is that message 
matters he has got a message and it appeals to a lot of 
people 
rick barton democratic state chairman who had predicted 
jackson would do as well in maine as he had a week earlier in 
minnesotas caucuses contended that timing was a key to jacksons 
success 
jacksons successful appearance at the university of maine in 
orono on feb 11 just after iowas caucuses and just before the 
new hampshire primary was just the right time when maine 
democrats were starting to lock in he said 
barton said the scaling back of the paul simon and hart 
campaigns also helped jackson he suggested that defections from 
those candidates inflated jacksons support by 5 percentage points

hooligans went on a rampage in a city in 
azerbaidzhan tass reported monday an armenian dissident said 
thugs beat and knifed armenians as the ethnic hatred kindled by 
a territorial dispute spread in the caucasus republics 
a soviet deputy prosecutor general said over the weekend that 
two people in another region of azerbaidzhan had been killed in 
disorders sparked by armenian demands that a part of 
azerbaidzhan be reattached to their republic 
street demonstrations in which some witnesses said more than 1 
million people participated took place in the armenian capital of 
yerevan last week to call for the annexation of the 
nagornokarabakh region in azerbaidzhan whose 157000 inhabitants 
are mostly armenian 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev appealed friday to the people 
of armenia and azerbaidzhan for civic maturity but staterun 
media reports and accounts reaching dissident circles in moscow on 
monday indicated he had failed to quell the dispute 
the official tass news agency said a group of hooligans 
provoked disturbances sunday in the industrial city of sumgait 
1150 miles south of moscow on the caspian sea rampage and 
violence followed it said 
the tass dispatch on the unrest in sumgait was the first 
official report of civil disturbances in the soviet union since it 
reported that 3000 people rioted in alma ata capital of the 
central asian republic of kazakhstan in december 1986 two people 
died and hundreds were injured in those riots 
tass gave no indication what led to the violence in sumgait a 
chemical and steelmaking center that is azerbaidzhans most 
important industrial city after its capital baku 
a moscowbased dissident said the disturbance was sparked by 
tensions between azerbaidzhans dominant ethnic group the azeris 
and armenians azeris are predominantly moslem while armenians are

an unsuspecting pilot wound up with his face in the 
dirt m16s pointed at his head and his ruined plane upside down on 
the runway after drug agents mistook him for a cocaine smuggler 
gustavo viera a miami accountant has received an apology from 
vice president george bushs antidrug task force the drug 
enforcement admimistration and the us customs service 
however he said monday he had received no compensation and 
plans to file a claim against the government 
viera said he did not see or hear the customs service helicopter 
that followed him to the airport and worries what would happen if 
the services controversial proposal to shoot down suspected 
traffickers is adopted 
had that been in effect i wouldnt be here talking to you 
today said viera when youre in one of these airplanes and 
the engine is loud and they shoot a warning youre not going to 
hear it 
the incident occurred july 9 when viera flew his piper cherokee 
bought only three weeks before over biscayne bay he then 
headed for a small airport south of miami 
a subsequent letter from william rosenblatt an assistant 
commissioner in the customs service enforcement office explained 
what happened next 
rosenblatt said customs service radar had lost a suspected 
trafficker in flight then picked up vieras plane 
it was incorrectly assumed that your aircraft was in fact the 
suspect rosenblatt wrote 
according to friends of viera who witnessed the incident a 
customs service blackhawk helicopter followed vieras plane as it 
touched down at the kendall glider port but stayed behind him 
viera said it was impossible to see or hear the helicopter in that 
position 
when viera was turning left to get out of the runway 
presumably the pilot of the helicopter thought gus was trying to 
run away said rene betancourt he made a maneuver with a blast 
of the prop and turned guss plane upside down 
viera first thought his nose gear had collapsed then he 
realized the danger he was in 
im upside down on my runway fuel was pouring out and the 
thing was about to blow said viera then he saw the helicopter 
land beside him and several men rush toward his plane 
i thought they were going to rescue me he said instead as 
he pleaded with them to pull him out of the plane someone smashed 
in his window and hit him in the back of the head he said 
the next thing he knew he was lying face down with a foot on his 
back two bahamian agents who accompanied the customs team were 
pointing their m16s at his head said viera 
they never identified themselves as customs agents they never 
read me my rights and they illegally searched my plane said 
viera 
he was held for about 45 minutes until computer checks 
established the error 
the viera wrote to customs and the dea but only began to 
receive apologies when he finally wrote bushs task force 
a letter from howard gehring director of the task forces 
national narcotics borderinterdiction system said any 
inconvenience that this incident has caused is unfortunate 
rosenblatt also apologized in a letter 
as a resident of dade county fla you are in a position to 
view firsthand the drugrelated violence that occurs almost on a 
daily basis said rosenblatt adding that the danger results in 
actions which might seem excessive 
viera said the company which insured his plane paid off quickly 
and he has bought a new plane 
roger garland chief of the customs air branch at homestead 
said as far as he knew the viera incident was the first of its 
kind 
normally we wouldnt even do that to a bad guy said 
garland

republican presidential candidate bob dole 
said monday that the reagan administration was sending mixed 
signals about panamas strong man manuel antonio noriega and he 
suggested the united states may want to go back and take another 
look at treaties turning over the panama canal to panama 
say no to drugs say no to noriega and no maybe to giving 
them the canal dole said at a news conference 
dole the senates gop leader said that when he voted against 
the panama canal treaties 10 years ago in the senate we knew 
about drug trafficking by members of the panamanian military 
he said that while the reagan administration has accused noriega 
of dealing in drugs it has also been sending a different signal to 
the panamanian leader it seems to me we have one signal saying 
noriega ought to stay noriega isnt such a bad guy dole said 
referring to the panama canal treaties dole said we may want 
to go back and take another look at that 
sen thad cochran rmiss appeared with dole at a news 
conference and offered his endorsement the reason can be 
described in two words effective leadership cochran said 
earlier in atlanta dole jabbed at george bush and the other 
republican presidential contenders declaring himself the tough 
candidate for president and calling toughness a quality that some 
may be lacking 
trying to beat bush in the big southern presidential primaries 
which are one week away dole went before the predominantly 
democratic georgia state house and senate for separate addresses 
dole the republican leader in the us senate proclaimed an 
affinity with the georgia democrats through his rural kansas 
background his start in rural politics and his legislative career 
by comparison that underscored the point he has often made that 
the vice president has had a more privileged background though he 
didnt mention bush by name 
i got here just like you did i got here the old fashioned way 
i earned it dole said nobody gave it to me 
it was unmistakable who his target was as he stressed his 
ability to work with congress and said candidates shouldnt be 
judged on who has the longest resume and most impressive 
resume bush often notes the highlevel government posts he has 
held 
theres one candidate and only one candidate with experience 
in dealing with congress and making tough decisions dole told 
the georgia senate 
i believe that i have a certain quality that some may be 
lacking he told the house i am tough i understand you have 
to be tough to make tough choices 
you have to be tough to deal with the legislature or to deal 
with congress or to deal with mikhail gorbachev or to deal with 
daniel ortega he said referring to the soviet and nicaraguan 
leaders 
dole strongly criticized noriega saying the united states 
should impose a fullscale embargo on panama if noriega doesnt 
give up power in 30 days he said the united states should use 
whatever force is necessary to protect the panama canal and 
other us interests there 
we dont need noriega peddling drugs to our children dole 
said hes a bad influence and he has been a bad influence for 10 
years 
dole was making a series of campaign stops across the southeast 
on monday as he campaigned toward the southern primaries on super 
tuesday march 8 from atlanta he flew to jackson and was going on 
to florida and to north carolina 
more than onethird of the gop nominating delegates are at stake 
in the contests on tuesday including races in most of the south 
bush leads dole in most of the super tuesday states according 
to most polls dole aides said they were planning to begin airing 
new television ads contrasting dole and bushs records in selected 
southern states 
dole repeated his call for a oneyear budget freeze to reduce 
the federal deficit a proposal that he and bush tangled over in 
the republicans debate on sunday dole said there is a 
bipartisan majority for that kind of action 
he was accompanied to the georgia legislature by his wife 
elizabeth

that he made six cocaine flights for reputed colombian drug lord 
carlos lehder rivas in 1979 
lehder 38 reputed to be one of the leaders of colombias 
violent medellin cartel is on trial on charges he and others 
conspired to smuggle 33 tons of cocaine into the united states 
from colombia via normans cay in the bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
leverett francis whose testimony opened the 14th week of the 
trial is described in the indictment against lehder and 
codefendant jack carlton reed as working with ed ward in flying 
cocaine for lehder 
francis 66 said he began working for ward an admitted 
marijuana smuggler and then switched to flying cocaine making 
three trips from normans cay in the bahamas to colombia and three 
flights from the island to astor park fla 
as a marijuana smuggler francis said he was paid 30000 a 
flight on his cocaine runs from colombia to normans cay he 
received 100000 a flight then 30000 more to fly cocaine into 
the united states he said 
us attorney robert w merkle questioned francis about his 
contacts with defense attorneys and asked if he had wanted to 
testify against lehder 
nobody does its distasteful said francis 
merkle asked francis if he had concealed illegal drug earnings 
from the government because he wanted to avoid paying taxes the 
witness replied he had 
did you say that if you didnt get a promise you would take 
contempt instead of testifying asked merkle 
francis replied that his cooperation in the ed ward case had 
earned the government a lot of money and he felt that had 
discharged his obligation 
when asked why he became a smuggler francis replied i was 
kind of wondering the same thing it was the thrill of doing 
something in addition to the money 
francis was shown a photograph of a stack of money and replied 
that it was 88000 given to him by ward 
he had allowed federal agents to take a picture in 1980 
i understood that mr lehder was the gentleman for whom mr 
ward was flying he said 
when asked to identify lehder in court francis said he had 
developed vision problems over the past few months he was allowed 
to leave the witness stand to get closer to the defendant 
he walked up to attorney stephen weinbaum who represents reed

he also said he couldnt recognize reed 
reed 57 is charged only with being part of the alleged 
conspiracy 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise

the chairman of president reagans aids 
commission said monday he expects the panel to adopt his interim 
recommendations including a 1 billion boost in federal spending 
on the disease without substantive change 
retired adm james d watkins outlined the commissions 
activities in an appearance at the national press club a day before 
the panel embarks on three days of hearings on some of the most 
controversial aspects of dealing with the disease 
surgeon general c everett koop is scheduled as the leadoff 
witness at tuesdays session and education secretary william 
bennett will testify thursday morning 
the two have differed on the best ways to combat the spread of 
the fatal disease most notably in what emphasis to place on 
recommending use of condoms to prevent its transmission sexually 
watkins a former chief of naval operations said he does not 
believe koop and bennett or their followers are as far apart as 
often perceived 
my feeling is our job is to try to bring things 
together watkins said during a questionandanswer session i 
dont see that we have such obstacles we cant reach consensus 
i wasnt so sure four months ago but now i am 
still he said the commission is not going to shy away from 
anything such as touchy legal issues regarding confidentially of 
aids test results and discrimination protection for people with the 
virus 
i think its going to be a donnybrook in there but i think 
something useful will come he said 
watkins remarks about the commissions willingness to adopt his 
interim recommendations were limited to his call last week for 
spending an additional 1 billion a year in federal funds to fight 
the spread of aids among intravenous drug abusers and several other 
suggestions on developing drugs to treat the disease and revamping 
the system of caring for aids patients 
the commission began considering those recommendations earlier 
monday with no hint of substantive differences and will meet 
thursday night to adopt the version that will go to the white house 
the following week 
the panels final report which watkins said will address the 
more controversial issues is due june 24 
responding to a wide range of questions about aids in general 
watkins said he agrees with those who do not foresee a dramatic 
spread of the disease into the general population in the immediate 
future 
but he cautioned against complacency particularly concerning 
the possibility that the virus could be spreading undetected among 
sexually active adolescents 
we dont know what it is in adolescents he said there 
may be lurking on the horizon a real problem that has yet to 
unfold 
he also renewed his call for those physicians who do not 
specialize in aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome to 
become more familiar with it 
the medical education horse has got to get in front of the 
general education cart he said

a dying boy who needs a bone marrow transplant 
will go to seattle for the treatment next week even though a court 
battle still is being waged over his fathers health insurance 
coverage officials said monday 
jim lacina sued nationwide life insurance co of columbus 
contending the company mistakenly canceled his health insurance 
policy without notifying him 
attorneys had rushed to bring the lawsuit to trial monday 
because doctors said lacinas 11yearold son jamie needed a bone 
marrow transplant by march 15 to survive more than a few months 
the boy has leukemia 
but the trial was postponed until june 27 visiting cuyahoga 
county common pleas judge george g mcmonagle said adding that 
lacina of geneva had found a way to pay for the treatment at the 
fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle 
i understand medicaid is taking care of the arrangements 
the judge said 
officials of the cuyahoga county department of health and human 
services declined comment saying medicaid applications are 
confidential 
there was no answer at lacinas home monday in geneva and 
lacinas attorney gerald jeppe didnt return phone calls but 
jeppe said last week that his client was applying for medicaid 
edward e duncan attorney for nationwide life also declined to 
comment 
lacina was an agent for nationwide life until five years ago 
when his job was terminated because of company cutbacks because of 
his sons health he paid to continue his health insurance after he 
left the firm attorneys for both sides agree 
however the policy lapsed in late 1983 lacina said he never 
got a copy of his policy a notice that his premium was due or a 
termination notice jeppe said in court last week 
lacina sued nationwide life on april 24 1986 while the case 
has been pending his son has received chemotherapy treatments at 
rainbow babies and childrens hospital in cleveland court 
documents show lacina who is unemployed owes the hospital more 
than 24000 
the lawsuit became more urgent when doctors advised lacina to 
take his son to the fred hutchinson cancer research center by march 
15 for a bone marrow transplant the center requires patients to 
have 100000 or proof of insurance coverage before it will treat 
them 
susan edmonds hutchinson spokeswoman said jamie lacina is 
scheduled to arrive at the center on march 7 she said she hasnt 
received word from the boys father that he has made arrangements 
to pay for the procedure

george bush and pat robertson will skip next sundays debate in 
tennessee putting that presuper tuesday confrontation in 
jeopardy and richard gephardt has backed out of the democratic 
version the same day in rival albert gore jrs home state aides 
said today 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis staff debated the debate 
with one aide saying he would not go and another saying the 
decision on the league of women voters forum in nashville was 
still under consideration 
word of candidates nodebate decisions tumbled out as the 
presidential contenders themselves plunged into their final week of 
campaigning before the biggest delegate day of the primary season 
meanwhile dukakis was celebrating another new england victory 
in maine saying he will surprise some people in the south next 
week on super tuesday vice president bush claimed victory in maine 
on the gop side 
the gop presidential hopefuls split up today after criticizing 
each other on taxes and trade in a debate sunday in atlanta 
robertson in jacksonville fla told about 500 people today 
ive got a feeling were going to win in florida and were going 
to win in the south weve got one week to the most crucial 
election i believe in the history of america certainly this 
century and maybe since its beginning 
dukakis and gephardt the winners of the major democratic 
contests so far skipped a democratic debate in houston on sunday 
gephardt aides said today that he wouldnt show up for a debate in 
opponent albert gore jrs home state 
gephardt who had said last october he would participate in the 
debate sent word last week that he would not noting that it was 
to be in gores home state said janice kaplan a spokeswoman for 
the league of women voters presidential debates 
dukakis aides passed out conflicting word on his intentions 
political director paul jensen said he would not attend the debate 
communications director leslie dach said no official decision had 
been made on whether or not to attend the sunday debate 
league officials said dukakis had told them last fall he would 
participate and they have heard of no change in that stance 
she said robertson as well as bush who announced his plans 
earlier would not take part in the gop debate the same day bob 
dole has not formally agreed to attend and the republican debate 
will be called off if he decides against debating she said 
it was a son of the south jesse jackson who pulled the 
weekends surprise finishing a strong second to dukakis in the 
maine democratic caucuses on sunday 
with super tuesday looming barely a week away republican jack 
kemp sought to pump up his fading campaign with direct attacks on 
bush and senate gop leader dole saying they will not be true to 
ronald reagans legacy 
they sound alike they talk alike theyve supported every 
single tax increase over the last eight years kemp said in a 
testy gop debate sunday in atlanta if theyre nominated the 
reagan revolution is over gone dead 
harsh rhetoric did not dim the good news from maine for bush and 
dukakis 
bushs campaign claimed victory in the gop caucuses on sunday 
with no official count available his campaign gave out figures 
saying he more than doubled his rivals totals in the city and town 
meetings 
on the democratic side dukakis won the maine caucuses easily 
relying on a strong organization and his neighborly ties he took 
better than 40 percent of the delegates to the state convention and 
at least 10 national convention delegates 
todays victory gives our national campaign another push 
towards success on super tuesday dukakis said 
earlier he told a crowd in maryland where he hopes to do well 
on march 8 youre an important super tuesday state i think 
were going to surprise some people in the south 
dukakis win was expected jacksons strong secondplace showing 
was not 
the black civil rights leader campaigned relatively little in 
the state but showed strength in many parts of the new england 
countryside to win nearly a third of the vote a block of 
uncommitted delegates was in third place with the rest of the 
democratic field trailing 
both dukakis and bush hoped to put another victory in their 
column on tuesday when the nonbinding vermont primaries are 
scheduled 
the democratic candidates gather for another premarch 8 debate 
tonight in williamsburg va before the members of the democratic 
leadership council it was dlc members who put together the idea of 
a southern regional primary and then pushed state legislatures 
across the region to move their primaries to the early march date 
the republicans debate sunday in atlanta may be their last 
fullscale confrontation before super tuesday 
bush who is skipping the league of women voters debate next 
sunday in nashville told his three rivals that intraparty sniping 
is not useful 
theres no point in republicans going around criticizing each 
other or certainly criticizing the president of the united states 
what we want to do is go after the people you had here yesterday 
bush said referring to the democratic candidates who debated in 
the same hall on saturday thats easy thats slowmotion slow 
targets to go for 
kemp attacked hardest during the debate sponsored by the atlanta 
newspapers accusing his opponents of sounding like democratic 
hopeful gephardt on trade 
pat robertson and bob dole sound like dick gephardt to me on 
trade and george bush and bob dole say the budget deficit is 
public enemy no 1 i want to say i believe the soviet union is 
public enemy no 1 kemp said 
for his part dole attacked bush for the reagan administrations 
decision to trade arms for hostages in the irancontra affair 
we never should trade arms for hostages we shouldnt issue 
these reports and say we shouldnt trade arms for hostages the 
vice presidents report and then later go to a meeting and say 
its all right we shouldnt do those things dole said holding 
up a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed by 
bush 
bush did not respond directly but did say mistakes were 
made in the irancontra affair he has maintained throughout the 
affair that he did not know the arrangement was an armsforhostage 
deal

corn prices at the farm were the highest since july 1986 while 
soybean were the highest in more than three years

record in 1987 of about 57 billion this years net the 
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses may be in the 
range of 50 billion to 55 billion

the streets were awash with dress blues and 
angry tears monday as 10000 police officers attended last rites 
for edward byrne a 22yearold policeman killed while protecting a 
witness in a drug case 
it was the largest police turnout for a fallen colleague in the 
history of the new york city police authorities said they came 
from texas and ohio maryland and rhode island and they lined the 
eight blocks approaching st james church 
eddies murderers need to be pitied and also prayed for the 
rev thomas devita said in his homily during mass they do not 
know about the sanctity of life they cannot really know or 
understand what they have done even though this is such a terrible 
sin 
byrne was slain early friday as he guarded a witness who had 
complained to police about crack dealers working in the south 
jamaica section of the borough of queens there have been no 
arrests byrne eight months on the force was struck by three 
shotgun blasts 
eight officers carried the coffin draped in the greenandwhite 
flag of the department into the church as a police bagpiper played 
when the battle is over the family followed his father a 
former city police lieutenant carried a color photograph of his 
son 
today we commit eddie back to our god and father to god who 
gave us ed 22 years ago if only it could have been longer 
the priest said 
he remembered byrne as a smiling storyteller an enthusiastic 
friend relative and police officer byrne turned 22 nine days ago

of franklin d roosevelt john f kennedy and martin luther king jr 
in a strange way edward byrnes death has the same 
importance koch said if drug trafficking has become so bold 
that they can engage in the assassination of a police officer then 
our whole society is at risk that is why his death is so 
important

as a general rule the agriculture department 
is making progress but still lags in expanding jobs and services to 
black americans a special review panel said monday 
in 1986 agriculture secretary richard e lyng directed all 
agencies in the department to carry out new guidelines to improve 
usda compliance with civil rights and equal opportunity standards 
as part of the departments february observance of black history 
month five study groups looked at how usda has performed since 
then 
black employees continue a modest but upward movement in all 
occupational categories the report said some increases have 
been realized both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total 
usda employment this is especially important because the increases 
have occurred at a time when overall employment in usda was 
declining 
the usda employs the equivalent of approximately 102000 full 
time employees according to recent budget documents the task 
force report said blacks comprise 84 percent of the departments 
employees up from 81 percent in 1986 but that is low compared 
with other federal agencies it added 
to continue to improve its equal opportunity posture usda 
must realize larger increases in the number of blacks hired 
promoted and trained the report said and such increases mus 
be realized at a faster pace additionally the department must 
place emphasis on retention strategies once black employees are 
recruited at hired 
the task force report said there are encouraging signs that 
usda agencies are beginning to address the complex problems of 
black farmers and their declining numbers 
coordinated efforts between the soil conservation service 
farmers home administration and extension service are just 
beginning to show limited success at eliminating the historical 
factors militating against small and economically disadvantaged 
farmers the report said

the mediator of peace talks between 
the government and the contra rebels said the sandinistas 
insistence on a limited agenda for the discussions is a step 
backward 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the mediator broke off the last 
round of meetings in guatemala on feb 19 saying the two sides 
remained far apart on ways to end the 7yearold war 
since then the roman catholic prelate has charged the leftist 
sandinista government with failing to compromise and president 
daniel ortega has criticized the abrupt end to the second set 
of direct talks 
ortega in a speech sunday reiterated that the discussions 
should be limited to how to arrange a truce the usbacked 
contras and obando y bravo are seeking to discuss political reforms 
as well as a ceasefire 
earlier sunday the cardinal said the governments position 
represented a step backward for his plan the cardinal declined 
to say whether further talks would be held saying well have to 
reflect on that 
agreement on details of a ceasefire could deter congress from 
voting for nonlethal aid for the rebels 
the democratcontrolled house on feb 3 narrowly voted down 
president reagans proposal for 362 million in funding including 
36 million in military financing 
in the recent talks obando y bravo expanded his role by 
offering his own peace plan in addition to ceasefire proposals 
it calls for complete press freedom renewed talks with internal 
opposition parties a revision of the military draft law and a 
total amnesty reforms long sought by the contras 
the sandinistas agreed to discuss the sections of the cardinals 
proposal that had to do with a ceasefire but they have refused to 
enter into what they call a political dialogue with the rebels 
in a peace plan signed aug 7 the presidents of nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala costa rica and honduras committed themselves 
to implementing ceasefires amnesties and greater democracy and 
called for an end to outside aid to insurgencies 
nicaragua has permitted the reopening of some newspapers and 
radio stations it had closed the government maintains that a full 
amnesty will be granted when there is a ceasefire 
talks with the internal political opposition parties also 
mandated by the peace plan broke down in december when the 
government refused to discuss a new constitution 
the sandinistas accuse the cardinal often harshly critical of 
the government of siding with the contras 
the cardinal called on those attending his sunday mass to pray 
for peace he estimates that 15 nicaraguans die each day because of 
the war 
nicaraguas internal problems have been increasing opposition 
parties taking advantage of new freedoms since the state of 
emergency was lifted in january have staged several demonstrations 
against the sandinistas 
the sandinistas have held their own marches to show their 
strength and at times have quelled opposition demonstrations 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that ousted 
proamerican dictator anastasio somoza

only three applicants for concealed 
weapon permits under floridas new gun law have been turned down 
because of previous crimes but officials said monday many 
convictions dont show up because of loopholes 
as of thursday 20393 floridians had received concealed weapons 
permits under the law effective oct 1 state records show a total 
of 26086 applications have been received and of those only 20 
have been denied said marilyn thompson chief of the bureau of 
concealed weapons 
thirteen were rejected because of documentation problems four 
for other reasons and three because of a criminal history ms 
thompson said 
under certain circumstances the state cannot deny permits to 
admitted felons people with a history of violent crimes and those 
with drinking and psychological problems said ms thompson 
unless a judge formally hands down a guilty verdict a defendant 
who pleads guilty or no contest to either a felony or a misdemeanor 
has not been formally convicted she said such withholding of 
adjudication which does not create a criminal record is usually 
part of a plea bargain on first offenses or lesser offenses and 
often is accompanied by probation 
i can only deny a permit under the law if they have been 
formally convicted of a felony by a judge ms thompson said 
unadjudicated cases are not entered into the florida department 
of law enforcement computer system which the bureau uses to check 
criminal backgrounds 
no adjudication means there is no guilt marion hammer a 
lobbyist for unified sportsmen of florida a group backed by the 
national rifle association and if there is no guilt you cant 
take a persons rights away whether thats the right to vote or 
the right to bear arms 
stewart schurr of the fdle said he doubted that unadjudicated 
defendants receiving concealed weapon permits would lead to a 
murder increase 
the sort of people who do these crimes dont go get a permit 
so that they can conceal the gun and sneak up on someone he 
said in other words i wouldnt be comfortable saying the law 
has had any kind of effect 
but some people including tourism officials fear florida could 
develop a wild west image 
here in canada anything to do with florida makes front page 
especially bad news said ellis webber the florida tourism 
departments marketing director for canada which ships the 
sunshine state 15 million tourists yearly 
before lawmakers closed a legal loophole allowing open carrying 
of firearms we got telephone calls from people concerned about 
going to florida and seeing people strolling down the shopping mall 
with guns on their hips he said

gov evan mecham faces charges detailed in 
23 counts in his impeachment trial before the arizona senate 
the articles of impeachment brought against him by the house are 
the equivalent of an indictment in criminal court the specifics 
center on three alleged violations of law misuse of 80000 in 
state funds concealment of a campaign loan and obstruction of 
justice in trying to thwart investigation of an alleged death 
threat 
briefly these are the accusations 
misuse of state funds 
in may 1987 a governors protocol fund was created from funds 
raised by the governors inaugural ball the funds had been 
earmarked to pay off mechams campaign debts but a state law 
limiting campaign contributions precluded that use two months 
after the protocol fund was established to promote interests of the 
state 80000 from it was loaned to mechams automobile agency 
the loan has been repaid but prosecutors contend mecham with his 
son dennis tried to conceal an illegal loan of state funds 
mecham says the protocol fund was private not state money and 
that he broke no law by loaning it to his dealership 
concealment of a 350000 campaign loan 
in october 1986 tempe developer barry wolfson loaned 350000 
to the mecham for governor campaign the loan which has been 
repaid was not reported properly on required disclosure statements 
mecham says he didnt try to conceal the loan but contends his 
brother willard who was his campaign treasurer tried to save 
time by lumping it in with other funds on the financial statements 
without including wolfsons name 
obstruction of justice by thwarting investigation of a death 
threat 
on nov 12 1987 lee watkins an assistant director of the 
department of administation allegedly threatened to harm donna 
carlson the governors former legislative liaison who then was 
expected to testify in a grand jury investigation of mechams 
reporting of the 350000 campaign loan 
watkins is alleged to have said if ms carlson did not keep her 
mouth shut she would take a long boat ride from which she 
wouldnt return ralph milstead director of the department of 
public safety says mecham ordered him not to cooperate with the 
arizona attorney generals office in its investigation of the death 
threat allegation 
mecham says he had already checked out the alleged death threat 
and considered it a lot of hot air

georgias law banning exit polls within 250 feet 
of voting places violates the constitutions freespeech guarantee 
an attorney representing three major television networks argued in 
court monday 
the 1985 law does not define exit poll and therefore allows 
certain types of speech but not others said floyd abrams 
reporters can ask questions and take notes as long as they 
dont do it in a systematic way abrams told us district judge 
robert hall in a hearing on a lawsuit filed by abc nbc and cbs 
against georgia and fulton county election officials 
but patrick mckee an assistant attorney general representing 
state elections officials said poll workers have interpreted the 
law as disallowing anyone from questioning voters about their vote 
within 250 feet of the polling place 
former state rep claude bray dmanchester who headed the 
house state governmental affairs committee when it considered the 
exit poll bill said election officials mostly in metropolitan 
atlanta complained that voters were being intimidated by exit poll 
takers 
this was a bill to help the voters keep their privacy so they 
could vote and leave without being harassed he said

iraq said it retaliated for predawn 
missile attacks on baghdad by firing longrange rockets into the 
heart of tehran monday iran reported 16 people killed in the 
bombing of a hospital 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said its 
gunners fired five surfacetosurface missiles into tehran after 
two similar projectiles had exploded in baghdad killing and 
wounding many civilians 
irans islamic republic news agency irna also monitored in 
nicosia said in urgent dispatches that two loud explosions 
were heard after nightfall in tehran and there may have been 
casualties and damage 
it said the blasts 10 minutes apart were from fresh iraqi 
attacks but gave no other details 
earlier irna said tehran was bombed twice in iraqi air raids 
but made no mention of missile attacks on the city 
it said in one of the raids 16 people were killed and dozens 
wounded including newborn babies at a tehran hospital 
irna did not identify the hospital but said several people were 
buried under the debris tehran radio urged iranians to take refuge 
in bomb shelters 
the later communique carried by irna indicated there was 
confusion over the iraqi attacks possibly because iraq had not 
previously used surfacetosurface missiles against tehran in the 
war that began in september 1980 instead it had relied on its 
warplanes to strike deep inside iranian territory 
the iraqi rockets will reduce the iranian capital to rubble 
the iraqi news agency said quoting an unidentified military 
spokesman the iraqi rockets will fall on tehran all night until 
the city is demolished on the heads of its rulers 
it said three missiles were fired at 545 pm 555 pm and 
608 pm followed by two more at 1110 pm and 1120 pm 
iraq was not known to have any surfacetosurface missiles 
capable of reaching the iranian capital about 200 miles east of the 
iraqi border 
the iraqi news agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the 
missiles fired monday had been designed by iraqi minds and put 
together by iraqi hands as a gift to the leader of iraq president 
saddam hussein and the people of iraq 
iraqs attacks began about 12 hours after iranian missiles hit 
baghdad 
irna quoted a revolutionary guards communique as saying the 
iranian missiles were aimed at the headquarters of iraqs staterun 
television and radio network and two military targets in baghdad 
staterun baghdad radio said two missiles exploded in the city 
of 5 million people it reported a military communique said many 
iraqis were killed among them women children and old people many 
more were wounded and many houses were destroyed no casualty 
figures were given 
the iraqi news agency also reported that iranian artillery 
shelled residential areas in the southern port of basra the border 
town of khanaqin and sirwan in northeast iraq throughout the night 
it made no mention of casualties 
it was the third day of attacks on population and industrial 
centers the attacks began saturday when iraqi warplanes bombed 
tehran for the first time since january 1987 
on sunday iran said its forces fired three surfacetosurface 
missiles in 40 minutes in retaliation for the iraqi air raids on 
nonmilitary areas it said 28 civilians were killed and scores 
were wounded in the iraqi raids 
the exchange of attacks and reported use by iraq of longrange 
missiles heightened fears that the persian gulf foes are locked in 
a fresh round of the war of the cities 
iran has fired 37 missiles into baghdad since that phase of the 
war began in march 1985 but had not targeted baghdad since nov 8 
meanwhile president ali khamenei of iran warned the un 
security council not to approve any resolution imposing an arms 
embargo on iran for failing to agree to ceasefire calls

about one nonschool building in seven 
contains potentially dangerous asbestos thats been damaged and one 
in 11 has significant damage the environmental protection agency 
told congress on monday 
however administrator lee m thomas said it might do more harm 
than good to begin a major regulatory program affecting such 
buildings while epa states and communities are trying to deal with 
asbestos in schools 
the asbestos in question is friable it can be crumbled by 
slight pressure such as a hand squeeze and release fibers to the 
air though asbestos has not been permitted in new buildings since 
1978 it was used in millions of structures from the 1920s on 
the fibers if breathed can cause lung cancer and other 
illness the cancer may not show up for 40 years and the danger 
increases the earlier the exposure which is why school children 
are such a concern 
thomas did call for increased grants to states to improve 
enforcement of existing regulations and funds to advise building 
owners to increase the supply of inspectors and to develop 
guidance for dealing with pipe and boiler insulation his estimates 
totalled 66 million a year for the next three years 
rep james florio dnj whose pressure has helped win passage 
of existing asbestosinschools programs said in a statement 
everything in this report points toward aggressive federal 
intervention except epas recommendations which amount to nothing 
more than sweeping this alarming problem under the rug 
congress required the report on the status of asbestos in 
nonschool buildings in 1986 in partial response epa subjected a 
1984 building survey to more detailed analysis reporting for the 
first time the condition of asbestos it found 
the agency had reported that about 20 percent of the buildings 
contained friable asbestos about 35 percent of schools however 
already were known to have such asbestos and congress has required 
tighter school regulations 
by october 1988 all schools must adopt asbestos management 
plans to take effect in july 1989 the successulf implementation 
of this school program should remain our first concern and we all 
have much to learn from it wrote thomas i fear a major 
initiative in other buildings could do more harm that good 
john a moore assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic 
substances weve got finite resources a finite number of 
people who are experts 
the report said carrying out the school regulations will cost 
about 3 billion and a similar program for other buildings could 
cost 51 billion 
epas 1984 survey did not cover elementary and secondary 
schools state and local government buildings or apartment 
buildings of fewer than 10 units leaving 36 million buildings to 
be sampled an estimated 14 percent of the buildings 501000 
contained damaged friable asbestos and 9 percent or 317000 
contained significantly damaged friable asbestos 
since only 231 buildings were tested the range of uncertainty 
in the results was wide epa said there was a 95 percent chance the 
figure reported as 20 percent was somewhere between 14 percent and 
27 percent the 14 percent damage figure was between 6 percent and 
22 percent and the 9 percent significant damage could be anywhere 
from zero percent to 19 percent 
this and other statistical points were criticized by the safe 
buildings alliance a trade association of former asbestos product 
manufacturers which said for example that epas surveyors 
disagreed with each other 95 percent of the time on the condition 
of the asbestos they were looking at 
moore however said the agencys methods had been approved by 
outside experts 
bill borwegen health and safety director of the service 
employees international union said the gut level issue here is 
the right to know its federal policy that workers have the right 
to know what dangerous chemicals theyre dealing with we want 
to inform building occupants if theres a hazard

jeanbedel bokassa a 
village chiefs son who made himself president for life and then 
emperor was spared the death penalty monday for murders committed 
during his 14year reign 
president andre kolingba commuted bokassas sentence in an order 
announced on the national radio 
bokassa was convicted june 12 1987 of ordering the murders of 
at least 20 political opponents he also was convicted of diverting 
huge sums from the state treasury 
the former leader who had changed the name of his country to 
the central african empire and proclaimed himself bokassa i 
unsuccessfully appealed the verdict to the supreme court 
during the course of this trial i discovered crimes of which i 
know nothing he said i assume the moral responsibility i 
affirm my innocence of the facts against me i was motivated only 
by the desire to serve my country today i only want to live in 
peace as a simple citizen 
western governments and some african leaders had asked gen 
kolingba to spare bokassa kolingba previously commuted other death 
sentences imposed in this former french colony and is said to 
oppose capital punishment 
bokassa went into exile after he was overthrown in september 
1979 in a frenchbacked coup after the deaths in custody of 100 
schoolchildren who protested a government order to wear expensive 
uniforms produced at a factory run by the emperors wife bokassa 
was alleged to have personally beaten 17 of them to death 
a court in this nation of 3 million people which he had ruled 
since 1966 convicted him in absentia and sentenced him to death in 
1980 
in late 1986 he returned from france unexpectedly to be 
judged by his countrymen he was tried for offenses ranging from 
corruption to murder and cannibalism 
during the sixmonth trial prosecutor gabriel mbodou said 
there were no extenuating circumstances whatever in the odious 
acts committed by the accused his atrocities and his greed which 
plunged the entire country into a nightmare throughout the 14 years 
of his bloody reign 
the french legal system used in the central african republic 
obliged the government to try bokassa again 
officials and western diplomats said privately last year that 
kolingba probably would commute a death sentence for fear execution 
would stir unrest among bokassas minority mbaka tribe in the 
southwest corner of the landlocked nation 
bokassa 67 was educated in roman catholic mission schools he 
joined the french army won a dozen combat medals in indochina and 
achieved the rank of captain 
when the country became independent in 1960 president david 
dacko asked bokassa to form an army he led a coup against dacko in 
december 1965 
after bokassa proclaimed himself emperor he was crowned in a 
1977 ceremony that cost more than 200 million onequarter of the 
nations annual revenue

president reagan says he hopes the summer 
olympics in seoul south korea will be incidentfree and that he 
has confidence in newly inaugurated president roh tae woo 
in responses to questions submitted by the south korean 
newspaper donga ilbo reagan said a smoothly run olympics 
competition in september is in everyones interests 
the prospect of north korea or anyone elses attempts to 
disrupt the games through violence is a danger that we and the 
soviets can agree to work against 
the key problem in korea is north koreas proclivity to use 
violence reagan said noting the bombing last november of a 
south korean airliner off the coast of burma the world was 
shocked again by the recent murder of 115 innocent people aboard 
kal858 by north korea 
we hope that moscow will use its close relations with 
pyongyang to urge moderation and to encourage the resumption of 
direct northsouth contacts on practical ways to reduce tension 
the president said it is time for the north to eschew violence 
and get down to the serious business of resuming dialogue with 
seoul 
reagan in response to a question about whether he will meet 
soon with roh replied that talk now of the details of summits 
and such seems a bit premature 
as you know i met presidentelect roh in washington last 
year he said he impressed me as a man committed to the 
democratization of your country because he knew that was what 
koreans including himself wanted 
north korea has been demanding to be a cohost of the olympics 
but the international olympic committee and south korea have 
rejected the demand 
a woman who claimed she was a north korean agent kim hyon hui 
made a televised confession in seoul last month in which she said 
she destroyed the kal flight to disrupt the olympics 
north korea has denied it had anything to do with the bombing

a small boat said to be carrying 
about 40 illegal aliens from the dominican republic sank in rough 
seas just off the west coast but a survivor said monday he 
believed most made it to shore 
one person was in custody another hospitalized two bodies were 
recovered and a third was spotted but washed away before it could 
be retrieved said luis garcia an agent of the us immigration 
and naturalization service 
garcia spoke in a telephone interview from aguadilla about five 
miles from aguada 
hundreds of dominicans leave in wooden boats each year on the 
dangerous 90mile journey to puerto rico in search of a better 
life estimates by us officials of the number of dominicans 
living illegally in puerto rico range from 40000 to 160000 
the bodies were of two girls one 14 and the other 16 police in 
aguada said the boat estimated at 2030 feet long sank sunday 
evening off aguada about 85 miles west of san juan 
garcia said miguel bigay a survivor who was with him during the 
interview reported seeing most of the passengers scramble ashore 
and flee 
he said most were able to get to shore with him garcia 
said the people who got to shore ran off and hid in the brush 
bigay who gave his age as about 30 and said he was a parttime 
truck driver said the boat left a beach saturday night in the 
southeastern dominican province of higuey with 4045 passengers 
including eight women 
it crossed the 90mile mona passage between the dominican 
republic and puerto rico in good weather but then the see became 
rough and a big wave overturned the boat about oneeighth of a mile 
from aguada bigay said 
garcia quoted him as saying people were screaming and calling 
for help 
bigay said he managed to swim ashore but thought he was going 
to drown because the waves pushed him down every time they passed 
over him garcia said 
those in the boat were from different towns and did not appear 
to know each other bigay said police caught him on shore and 
garcia said he would be returned to the dominican republic 
officials continued searching but garcia said he doubted more 
survivors would be found because they managed to get somewhere 
else and escaped detention 
pieces of boards believed to be from the boat were on the beach 
along with articles of clothing and a plastic bag labeled 
dominican republic 
at least 16 dominicans drowned in december 1986 off rincon a 
few miles away when their boat capsized near shore last october 
50 or more dominicans are believed to have died when their boat 
sank about three miles off the northeast coast of the dominican 
republic

sen albert gore jrs presidential campaign 
on monday took out a loan to pay for media saturation going into 
next weeks super tuesday primaries a campaign spokesman said 
we have borrowed some money said press spokesman mike kopp 
but he declined to say how much saying that was confidential 
campaign strategy information 
were gong to saturate super tuesday we want to pour it 
on before the march 8 series of 20 primaries and caucuses on 
which gore has staked his democratic campaign kopp said 
he insisted however that the campaign is not in financial 
trouble and only borrowed the money as icing on the cake for 
the extensive media buy the tennessee senator already has in place 
in tennessee his state campaign treasurer johnny hayes said 
monday that gore has taken a 1 million line of credit against 
which money will be borrowed for a tv blitz in 20 states 
he said part of the credit line was established with tennessee 
banks 
kopp reiterated gores pledge to spend more money on the super 
tuesday contests than any other candidate 
gores public financial statement through jan 31 showed that he 
had just over 2 million in the bank at that point considerably 
less than the 4 million that money leader michael dukakis had on 
hand kopp said gore has raised about 12 million in february 
the campaign has declined to give any specifics on its spending 
saying it does not want to tip off its rivals 
kopp said new commercials will go on the air tuesday following 
on the biographical spots that have been running on cable tv 
nationwide and on local markets in 14 southern and border states 
for the past three weeks 
the ads are produced both by the campaign group gores initial 
media consultants and by raymond strother a media consultant 
hired last week 
kopp said the new ads will be messageoriented touting gores 
record he said they do not include attacks on other candidates 
strother traveled with gore last tuesday and the candidate has 
been giving a new emphasis in recent days to his congressional 
record being one of championing the average working man and 
woman 
kopp would not rule out the possibility of such ads which was 
essentially the same stance he took last week when asked to comment 
on the 1 million loan 
television advertising is seen as a major factor to reach the 
voters across the vast super tuesday spread of states 
dukakis the massachussetts governor was advertising on prime 
time television during the olympics in miami last week it was also 
a biographical commercial 
dukakis aides said commercials were also running in texas and 
maryland 
aides for us rep richard gephardt of missouri said his 
commercial promising trade retaliation to open up foreign markets 
was going on the air in the south over the weekend

help feed the poor cerullo said he estimated donations would 
total about 40000

strike was called to protest plans to change the vatican 
workers pay schedule and to demand creation of a special office to 
resolve labor disputes in the worlds smallest citystate

do something to show our unhappiness i hope this is the first and 
last time

to 1370 the workers are exempt from italian taxes work a

people in other countries are becoming less 
willing to lend money to the united states the head of the 
international monetary fund said monday 
the congressional joint economic committee has predicted that 
us debt would reach about 400 billion at the end of last year 
it is growing at about 150 billion annually 
i have looked at a very long historical set of figures said 
michel camdessus the funds managing director and i have to 
tell you that there are no precedents each time similar imbalances 
have been reduced it was through recession 
our latest projections suggest that on present policies and 
exchange rates the imbalances would still continue to be very 
large over the medium term he told a conference sponsored by the 
overseas development council a private study group concerned with 
problems of the third world 
for some time the growth of us debt has not been matched by 
the willingness of business people in other countries to lend more 
he said 
the risks that this portends for renewed disturbances in 
financial markets for increased protectionist pressures and for a 
weakening in global economic activity need no elaboration here 
said camdessus who is french 
he said the job of the fund is to help all 152 member countries 
in setting strategy that will make them grow 
he suggested that for a long time us output must grow faster 
than spending and that countries with surpluses have to do the 
reverse the process camdessus said should take place without 
either a slowdown in business or increased inflation 
he did not name the surplus countries but japan and west 
germany are the major nations which in recent years have been 
selling more goods than they buy surpluses have also been mounting 
in taiwan south korea and other newly industrializing areas 
camdessus went on to say that nothing can be done without 
reducing the us budget deficit 
no reasonable policy instrument that can contribute to this 
end should be ignored he said 
the us treasury must borrow to meet the deficit and much of 
the money it borrows comes from abroad for the year ending last 
sept 30 the deficit was about 149 billion 
camdessus called for new proposals that would help cut the debt 
of third world countries 
any proposal that would be marketbased and would share in 
a mutually agreed fashion between debtors and creditors the 
discount on debt and the benefits of adjustment could only be 
welcome he said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
also addressing the conference was american express chairman 
james d robinson iii who suggested creation of a new 
international financial organization to help ease the debt crisis 
of developing nations by buying their loans 
robinson said the organization which he named the institute 
of international debt and development would buy outstanding 
third world loans at a discount 
one possibility he suggested would be for the loans to be 
acquired at about 60 percent of face value 
the organization would then offer the banks which had held the 
loans new longterm highquality obligations including bonds 
and certain forms of stock robinson said

panamas ambassador the united states 
proclaiming his loyalty to president eric arturo delvalle refused 
to relinquish the embassy on monday to an envoy designated by the 
military controlled government to replace him 
the secondranking panamanian official at the countrys united 
nations mission leonardo kam showed up at the embassy to assume 
his duties but ambassador juan b sosa refused to turn the mission 
over to him 
kam was appointed last friday by the new government that was 
formed after delvalle was ousted by the national assembly which is 
dominated by supporters of military strong man gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
after what kam described as a frank discussion monday he 
departed the embassy since friday sosa has maintained that the 
vote to oust delvalle was unconstitutional and he has refused to 
step down 
delvalles dismissal was touched off by his bid thursday to fire 
noriega who ignored the order and then rallied his followers in 
the assembly to replace delvalle with the former education 
minister manuel solis palma 
before his encounter with kam sosa was asked by a reporter 
about the position of other embassy diplomats the panamanian 
embassy is loyal to its ambassador and the ambassador is loyal to 
president delvalle he said 
reagan administration officials meanwhile said delvalles 
attempt to reinstate himself as president has been strengthened by 
going into hiding and refusing to flee the country he has been at 
an undisclosed location in panama since the weekend 
delvalle is viewed in washington as a more effective symbol for 
opposition forces by being inside panama than he would if he had 
left the country 
the administration has been pursuing other means to restore 
delvalle to office and to end noriegas fiveyear domination of the 
countrys political life a number of economic sanctions including 
a trade embargo are under consideration and highlevel meetings 
on that subject were held monday 
a us official said monday that president reagan planned no new 
economic sanctions against panama even though he has determined 
that panama has not been cooperating in curbing drug trafficking to 
the united states 
the official speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
penalties to be announced tuesday already have been applied against 
panama and thus will have no material impact on that country 
under a 1986 law countries which do not take steps to halt drug 
trafficking to the united states are no longer eligible for us 
aid and are not entitled to us support for their assistance 
requests to international lending institutions 
noriega was indicted by two us grand juries on feb 5 on 
charges that he is a major figure in an international drug 
smuggling conspiracy 
over the weekend noriega won a credentials skirmish at the 
organization of american states when his oas ambassador ricardo 
leyton was permitted to occupy panamas seat for a meeting on the 
panamanian crisis 
the united states had supported the seating of lawrence chewing 
fabrega a panamanian diplomat who broke with noriega two weeks ago 
although the oas refused to take a stand on the panamanian 
situation a number of latin american governments have backed 
delvalle they include el salvador argentina venezuela uruguay 
the dominican republic bolivia and ecuador 
some officials have been anxious about the safety of the 10000 
us military personnel in panama and the thousands of other 
americans there in civilian capacities but noriega has said all 
americans in panama will be safe 
meanwhile panamanian opposition leaders in washington have been 
stepping up their activities against noriega they have been 
telephoning panamanian diplomatic missions around the world asking 
them to withhold the fees they receive for consular services and 
other activities instead of sending the money back to panama for 
use by the new government 
embassy officials said that on tuesday they would reveal legal 
steps that have been taken against the dictatorship of noriega

nancy reagan said monday that casual users of 
drugs are an accomplice to murder because they help finance 
traffickers willing to commit brutal crimes to keep supply lines 
open 
kicking off a white house conference for a drugfree america at 
which the federal governments antidrug efforts were criticized 
mrs reagan dramatized her justsayno campaign with a speech 
focusing on those whose lives have been ruined by drugs 
with president reagan serving in the unusual role of warmup 
speaker the first couple talked about the drug problem from both 
the supply and demand vantage points 
with all the headlines about how were losing the drug war 
lets keep in mind the progress weve made the president told 
conference participants at a local hotel he ticked off statistics 
he said show the united states is making headway saying drug 
seizures are at an alltime high 
but as significant as stopping smugglers and pushers is 
ending the demand for drugs is how in the end well win the 
president said 
mrs reagan picked up the subject there saying that while 
progress has been made many ignorant ideas persist and one of 
the worst is the casual users justification that drug use is a 
victimless crime that drugs dont hurt anyone except the person 
whos using them 
she called attention to several people in the audience who lost 
loved ones because of drug abuse and cited the murder of colombias 
chief prosecutor attorney general carlos hoyos who was abducted 
by a halfdozen gunmen whom the government accused of working for 
local cocaine barons 
hoyos bulletriddled body was was found blindfolded and 
handcuffed 
the government blamed his abduction and death on the medillin 
cartel which us officials say controls 80 percent of cocaine 
entering the united states 
the people who casually use cocaine are responsible mrs 
reagan said because their money bought those bullets they 
provided the high stakes that murdered those men plus hundreds of 
others in colombia 
she dismissed the notion that the mellow marijuana user 
doesnt hurt anyone pointing to the murder of american drug 
agent enrique camarena salazar in the aftermath of the eradication 
of a 10000acre plantation in mexico 
the casual user may think when he takes a line of cocaine or 
smokes a joint in the privacy of his nice condo listening to his 
expensive stereo that hes somehow not bothering anyone she 
said but there is a trail of death and destruction that leads 
directly to his door 
the casual drug user cannot morally escape responsibility for 
the action of drug traffickers and dealings she said im 
saying that if youre a casual drug user youre an accomplice to 
murder 
while the reagans helped kick off the drug conference the 
administration came in for some criticism on its antidrug abuse 
efforts with marion barry the mayor of the district of columbia 
complaining that not enough was being done 
barry facing a record murder rate in nations capital fueled by 
warring drug dealers said the problem in cities has reached 
catastrophic dimensions 
were beginning to lose the war on drug and alcohol abuse 
barry said in his welcoming remarks telling the conference his was 
the view from the cities the united states government has not 
done enough to stop drugs from coming into this country 
we must say to colombia peru and mexico were not going to 
take it anymore heroin and cocaine does not grow here its 
brought here we must stop it stop it stop it from coming here 
barry said 
a private study released last week said the washington areas 
drug problem is almost unrivaled among large cities and that drug 
abuse has grown in the areas suburbs more than in any other 
suburban area in the nation 
in her address mrs reagan alluded to this problem saying that 
in saturdays washington post there was one page in which every 
article was a local drug story and there was another local drug 
story on the front page 
we must face the fact that drugs are tearing our communities 
apart 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and drug control said in advance of 
mondays conference advances in stopping drugs we havent made 
any 
if we didnt have nancy reagan we wouldnt have anything 
he said in an interview with the post 
attorney general edwin meese iii during an appearance at 
samford university in birmingham ala said drugs are the nations 
no 1 social problem but said some progress is being made 
particularly in high schools 
but he acknowleged we still have a long way to go 
cocaine seizures by us authorities have risen by 1822 percent 
in the past seven years according to the drug enforcement 
administration 
in fiscal 1981 1872 kilograms was seized compared with 35970 
kilograms in fiscal 1987 the dea said on feb 4 a kilogram is 
equal to 22 pounds 
during the same period marijuana seizures went down 42 percent 
from about 1 million kilograms in fiscal 1981 to 632000 kilograms 
last year it peaked at 14 million kilograms seized in fiscal 
1984 the dea said 
the dea increased the number of its agents 34 percent from less 
than 1500 to about 2000 from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1987 the 
agency said

the third world announced monday that it made a profit of 679 
million for the last six months of 1987 up from 655 million for

gov evan mecham absent from the opening 
day of his impeachment trial in the state senate blasted his 
former attorney for remarks to lawmakers on monday and vowed he 
will be found innocent 
the governor said he had a fallingout with murray miller his 
lead attorney until last week when washington attorney jerris 
leonard was brought in to lead the defense 
miller who appeared at mechams senate trial to formally 
withdraw from the case monday told senators that he was pushed 
aside by leonard calling his arrival in phoenix last week a 
oneman coup 
responding to question by sen tony west rphoenix miller 
hinted that the sudden change in legal counsel could weaken 
mechams defense 
responding to millers comments from his suburban headquarters 
mecham said id both disappointed and disgusted by the 
prejudicial and unnecessary grandstanding by murray miller before 
the arizona state senate today 
i deeply resent the possible prejudice to me by mr millers 
remarks to the state senate and do not believe his actions were in 
my best interest i dont feel too good about what he did 
the governor said he began a search for more attorneys when it 
appeared trials in the senate and state court might overlap when 
leonard was hired as chief counsel because i felt we have to have 
a lot more horsepower miller decided to leave mecham said 
i suggested if he did not want to work in a cohesive group 
then lets part as friends mecham said 
mecham said he will not attend the impeachment trial until his 
attorneys tell him to he said he hasnt spent much time tracking 
the proceedings 
he did say he expects to be acquitted 
i remain convinced that if i receive a fair trial the truth 
will prevail and i will be acquitted the governor said 
mecham said miller has been paid in full but he declined to say 
how much the attorney received 
the governor also denied a published report that top 
fundraisers were promised jobs 
one of the things we can prove was that at every finance 
meeting everyone was told you get nothing but better

antiship missiles he said he did not know if the missiles had 
nuclear warheads rodriguez left cuba three years ago

an official monthly acknowledged about 
500000 poles were deported to the soviet union from territories 
occupied by the red army at the outbreak of world war ii and said 
many died as a result of harsh conditions 
the unusual account of the fate of the poles came in an article 
in the february issue of konfrontacje confrontation it is 
published by the patriotic movement for national rebirth a 
national front organization 
the article said much was written about the wartime deportations 
of poles to nazi germany 
but it said the fate of polish people in the east has been 
unnecessarily covered in a mist of secrecy although it was known 
that there were hundreds of thousands of witnesses of those events 
living who probably havent concealed them from relatives 
it was the first time a widely circulated official publication 
offered a detailed breakdown of the number of poles deported to the 
soviet union in world war ii although polish underground and 
western publications have described the largescale suffering of 
poles at soviet hands 
last year polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski criticized 
abuses against poles committed by soviet dictator josef stalin in 
an article in the soviet communist party journal kommunist he said 
thousands of poles suffered deportation and repression in 
territories occupied by the soviets 
after the germans attacked poland in september 1939 soviet 
troops invaded from the east and occupied eastern polish 
territories under provisions of the nazisoviet nonaggression pact 
konfrontacje said poles in the sovietoccupied territories 
found themselves in a difficult situation suffering from police 
harassment and restrictions on civic rights 
about 4 million poles lived in the eastern territories before 
the war along with millions of ukrainians byelorussians and jews 
the article said a safe estimate indicates the soviets 
deported 500000 poles from the eastern territories in four mass 
transports from february 1940 to june 1941 when the nazis launched 
a surprise attack on the soviet union 
those deported included state clerks farmers and their 
families refugees who fled nazioccupied poland intellectuals and 
workers both leftists and rightwingers the monthly said 
it said an additional 200000 poles were recruited into the 
soviet army and later evacuated to the soviet union 
about 270000 of the poles deported or evacuated died in 
different circumstances in fighting with the red army during 
long and exhausting transports as the result of difficult 
conditions in siberia and in other areas or else did not come 
back to poland after the war it said 
the monthly said that overall about 600000 to 800000 poles 
from the eastern territories died during the war almost half of 
them killed in a terror campaign launched by nazicollaborating 
ukrainian nationalists in 1943 
polish and soviet historians began a weeklong meeting in warsaw 
on monday a followup to a moscow session last year devoted to 
blank spots in polishsoviet relations referring to topics so 
controversial they are unmentioned or distorted in official 
histories 
participants told polish television they would discuss the fate 
of poles in the soviet union during the war including the 
deportations and would have at their disposal valuable and 
important documents previously kept secret 
the meeting is an outgrowth of an agreement signed last year by 
jaruzelski and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on ideological 
and cultural cooperation which discussed the necessity for a more 
truthful history of polishsoviet relations 
gorbachev has encouraged greater examination of history through 
his policy of glasnost or openness

spokesmen for solidarity said management 
promised to consider pay increases for employees of a railroad car 
repair plant who stopped work to protest price increases 
solidaritys national executive commission accused the communist 
government of alarming ineptness in the economic realm 
spokesmen for the outlawed independent labor federation in 
wroclaw a southwestern industrial city said about 1500 people 
joined the job action at the railway rolling stock repair plant 
about half the work force plant officials declined comment 
a government spokesman denied such a large number of people 
participated and said the stoppage ended when managers dispelled a 
misunderstanding about how the annual profit bonus would be paid 
it appeared to be the biggest work stoppage in poland since the 
government imposed major price increases earlier in february 
government spokesman zbigniew augustynowicz said plant workers 
were disturbed over profitsharing he said distribution of the 
annual bonus based on profits began last week but many workers 
found it too small 
about a third of the staff stopped work at various times monday 
morning but resumed after plant officials explained how the bonus 
was calculated he said 
jozef pinior a wroclaw leader of solidarity said about half 
the plants 3000 workers downed tools at 9 am in response to a 
solidarity call 
pinior said plant director wojciech zmyslony pleaded with 
workers to return to their jobs and said management would consider 
increasing monthly pay by the equivalent of 8 to 11 
union members said sunday plant workers were in a combative 
mood because of price increases imposed feb 1 
besides claiming too much bonus money was going to managers 
they said raises given to offset price increases were inadequate 
prices of staple goods were increased 40 percent with increases 
in school tuitions and energy prices set for march 1 and april 1 
as part of an economic reform program aimed at reviving the economy 
in its statement monday the solidarity national executive 
commission said drastic price increases have lowered the living 
standards of all society pushing lowincome groups to the level of 
subsistence 
union adviser jacek kuron read the statement which accused 
police of tightening surveillance of commission members and said 
the number of activists jailed often under criminal pretext 
is growing

the blast destroyed a van and a barn about two miles outside 
crossmaglen village badly damaged two cars and left a crater 
police said four armed and masked men hijacked the van and a car 
shortly before the blast authorities speculated that ira 
guerrillas were installing explosives in the van when the 
explosives accidentally detonated 
a police officer speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
practice said it was believed the iras intended target was an 
army observation post near the border with irish republic 
the ira later issued a statement saying two of its men died in 
the blast which it described as an unfortunate accident the 
group gave no details and said names and ira ranks of the dead men 
would be released after families are notified

walkietalkies and a notebook were among the debris 
helicopters brought security forces into the surrounding fields 
to seal off the area overnight police said they would not move in 
until tuesday after army bomb disposal experts made sure no 
boobytrap bombs were around 
the mostly roman catholic ira often uses explosives in its 
violent campaign to drive the british out of the predominantly 
protestant province and unite it with the overwhelmingly catholic 
irish republic

democratic presidential contender 
richard gephardt came under attack from rivals in a debate monday 
night for taking contributions from special interest groups with 
michael dukakis saying gephardt had accepted the money and raced 
around the country beating up on the establishment 
when gephardt replied that he had often voted against the 
policies advocated by people who had given him contributions 
dukakis scoffed 
this isnt a fairy tale this isnt kindergarten youre 
talking politics he said 
gephardt fought back to suggest that youre going to take 
direction on how to vote is an affront he said 
he said he was sure that dukakis as governor of massachusetts 
had taken contributions from firms doing business with the state 
does that make you less of a public servant 
yes said dukakis but i am not running around the country 
beating up on the establishment 
gephardt accepted 341000 in contributions from political 
action committees last year 
the exchange during the debate at the college of william and 
mary came eight days before voters in 20 states most of them in 
the south make their decisions in primaries and caucuses on super 
tuesday the debate the democrats third in three days was by 
the count of moderator judy woodruff the 24th time the democrats 
had met in debate 
the candidates at jesse jacksons suggestion wore yellow 
ribbons on their jackets in protest of the arrest of anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu in capetown south africa on monday 
to gary hart who joined in the criticism of gephardt for taking 
money from political action committees the missourian retorted 
you took contributions for your senate campaign 
nonetheless hart said reform is needed the system is out of 
control 
gephardt on the defensive said we all understand the need 
for reform but to suggest that people have voted according to the 
wishes of people who have given them money i just think is out of 
touch with reality i havent done that and i know you havent done 
that 
hart said he hadnt and hoped gephardt hadnt 
but jackson said gephardts contention that he ignored the 
wishes of his contributors was unrealistic 
lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money 
continuously against the interests of who they were working for 
jackson said 
at another point jackson seized an opportunity to say he was 
being treated differently than the other candidates because he is a 
black 
he cited a poll which he said nbc took after the new hampshire 
primary in it potential voters were asked if they could support a 
black for president 
i said did you ask how many would vote for a greek said 
jackson a reference to dukakis whose parents were greek 
immigrants 
they said no i said why even bring race into it my race is 
selfevident and my leadership is obvious lets take the issues to 
the people 
for the most part the candidates wrangled over familiar issues 
with gephardt belittling dukakis plans for increasing government 
revenues without a tax increase and dukakis saying gephardt has 
changed his positions 
in iowa dick was telling us im sorry for that vote 
dukakis said of gephardts vote for the 1981 tax cut proposed by 
president reagan a bill that other democrats say led to the huge 
deficits that followed that was the iowa gephardt now we have 
another one here dukakis added 
im trying to figure out which one im debating 
gephardt defended his vote for reagans tax cuts saying they 
had reduced taxes for the average american 
and he said the dukakis plan to collect taxes now evaded by many 
americans the new englander says billions of dollars are involved 
wont do much to combat deficits 
sure we want revenue agents but that is not going to solve the 
problem gephardt said 
dukakis attacked gephardt on another front saying the oil 
import fee that gephardt advocates would damage mexico 
youre going to kill mexico dukakis said 
asked gephardt are you running for president of mexico or 
president of america 
that drew a gasp from the audience and then applause but more 
applause came when dukakis replied if im president of the 
united states im going to pay attention to that country 
gore stressing the harder line he takes on defense issues in 
comparison with his rivals defended the decision by the reagan 
administration to send american ships to protect kuwaiti tankers 
when the ayatollah said he was going to shut down our access 
to 70 percent of the oil available to the free world no one else 
among the candidates was willing to say we had a right to keep 
the sea lanes open he said 
the only democratic candidate who didnt take part in the debate 
was sen paul simon of illinois 
the affairs sponsor was the democratic leadership council an 
organization of moderate democrats who decided after walter 
mondales 49state loss in 1984 to seek to move the party somewhat 
toward the right

the arizona senate on monday opened the 
first impeachment trial of a us governor in six decades and 
within hours an attorney for gov evan mecham lost a plea for 
dismissal of the charges against the firstterm republican 
this man hasnt dipped his hands into public funds attorney 
jerris leonard said he hasnt ripped off the treasury he hasnt 
committed high crimes in office and i urge you to dismiss these 
articles of impeachment 
but the 29 voting senators gave mecham an overwhelming 
rejection on 11 different motions to dismiss portions of the 
charges the largest number voting for mecham was seven and the 
smallest was two 
the rest answered firmly no when asked if they would drop 
the challenged articles of impeachment they also refused to recess 
early at leonards request and continued to address motions brought 
by the governors laywer 
attorney paul eckstein one of the prosecutors had responded to 
leonard that even if it turned out that mecham didnt violate state 
laws his conduct would be grossly offensive to the people of 
this state 
the articles of impeachment cry out for conviction 
eckstein said he urged speedy resolution of a raft of pending 
motions to allow testimony to begin 
at the conclusion of mondays session senators said they 
expected opening statements and testimony to begin tuesday 
mecham who was not required to be present when the senators 
convened stayed at the suburban glendale offices of his 
government in exile and said he was too busy to watch the 
proceedings on television he told reporters that he remained 
optimistic 
i remain convinced that if i receive a fair trial the truth 
will prevail and i will be acquitted mecham said 
of his absence from the trial he said when my attorneys tell 
me to be there ill be there 
his absence was not mentioned during the proceedings on the 
senate floor 
following mondays session sen jeff hill a republican who 
once strongly backed mecham said that judging from the heavy vote 
against him on dismissal things looked bad for the governor 
i think its not likely hes going to prevail he said 
mecham a 63yearold auto dealer who won election after five 
tries is accused of high crimes misdemeanors and malfeasance in 
office 
twentythree articles of impeachment approved by the state house 
alleged three broad areas of misdeeds the articles said mecham 
concealed a 350000 campaign loan wrongly loaned 80000 from his 
protocol fund to his car dealership and obstructed justice by 
discouraging a public official not to cooperate in the 
investigation of an alleged death threat to a grand jury witness 
if convicted by the senate mecham would be removed from office 
and could be permanently barred from holding elective office he is 
the first us governor to be impeached since 1929 when huey long 
of louisiana and henry s johnston of oklahoma were impeached long 
was never tried johnston was removed 
mecham also faces a march 22 criminal trial on six felony 
charges of concealing the campaign loan and a may 17 recall 
election 
meanwhile the arizona supreme court was expected to rule 
tuesday on a defense claim that the impeachment trial should be 
delayed until after mechams criminal trial 
mecham a political outsider has drawn criticism for comments 
which critics considered slurs against blacks homosexuals jews 
and the japanese he spurred controversy by eliminating the states 
martin luther king holiday on his second day in office and 
defending an authors use of the word pickaninny in a history 
book 
leonard who took over mechams defense only last week 
addressed his major concern to mechams failure to report the 
350000 loan he challenged the senators to recall whether they 
themselves hadnt committed similar acts and accused them of 
putting the governor to a stricter test than other officials 
the rules of the game have been changed overnight leonard 
said he contended mecham should have been given a second chance to 
amend his disclosure forms 
i think youre applying a legal standard here to an act im 
not going to condone but is commonplace leonard said if there 
are members of this senate who havent had to file an amendment 
god love you 
you are applying a standard to one public official that has 
not been applied to others 
eckstein responded that he was in no small amount of shock 
at such an argument 
thats commonplace he said god save us all and if it is 
commonplace that conduct must be offensive to the people as a 
whole 
the impeachment proceeding opened with an air of high solemnity 
after senate democratic minority leader alan stephens told the 29 
other senators who sit as judges and jury we are about to embark 
on an arduous duty 
the senate trial of evan mecham does not concern merely this 
one officeholder stephens said but instead addresses the very 
essence of democracy in our state constitution 
we are really testing our form of government he said 
will we stand up and do our duty amid calls from the public to 
intimidate us 
the first action taken by the senate as the impeachment court 
convened was to accept the substitution of leonard for murray 
miller mechams original attorney miller who left the case last 
week made a brief speech saying he had not willingly abandoned it 
mecham criticized miller for making the remarks before the 
senate 
im both disappointed and disgusted by the prejudicial and 
unnecessary grandstanding by murray miller before the arizona state 
senate today mecham said 
during the impeachment proceedings a handful of mecham 
supporters gathered outside the senate building some carried 
placards demanding justice others laid a paper railroad track 
across the courtyard with a drawing of the governor bound and 
gagged on the tracks 
hes being railroaded said mecham supporter wilma harm of 
phoenix the man has done nothing to be called upon like this

the irish republican army is equipped with 
sovietmade sam7 antiaircraft missiles irish and british 
authorities acknowledged in a tv program broadcast monday 
the surfacetoair missiles were contained in more than 100 tons 
of weaponry sent by libya to ireland for the ira in four shiploads 
in 1985 and 1986 according to the british broadcasting corps 
panorama program 
the program said british army helicopters operating along 
northern irelands border with the irish republic would be the most 
likely targets the helicopters are the armys main mode of 
transport in iraplagued border regions 
the irish justice minister gerry collins said some of the 
missiles may very well be in northern ireland already the ira 
outlawed in britain and ireland is fighting to drive the british 
out of the province 
john hermon chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary 
northern irelands police force said he had no reason to doubt 
the sam7s are hidden somewhere in ireland 
as to where they are precisely theres an element of doubt 
he said asked how many there were he replied thats not a 
question id be prepared to answer directly but im satisfied that 
they exist 
collins said he was puzzled over how the ira apparently was able 
to unload in one night in october 1986 an estimated 105 tons of 
libyansupplied arms using an isolated jetty near arklow 40 miles 
south of dublin 
that is something that is causing us concern putting it very 
bluntly collins said at the particular time we did not have 
any intelligence that this was about to happen nor indeed did we 
know that it did happen 
the october shipment contained an unknown number of sam7s the 
program said quoting unidentified british and irish security 
sources a shipment in july 1986 included four sam7s it said 
gen sir james glover british army commander of land forces in 
northern ireland in 197980 said army countermeasures against 
sam7s have been prepared but have not yet had to be tested 
three shipments that reached ireland were loaded off the 
mediterranean island of malta and one 15 miles off libya the 
program said 
last oct 30 authorities seized a ship the eksund and its 
five irish crewmen in french waters the ship was carrying about 
150 tons of weapons including 20 sam7 missiles apparently 
destined for the ira the program said the first of the four 
shipments to reach ireland was delivered in august 1985 and 
contained seven tons of arms including pistols and 70 sovietmade 
ak47 assault rifles the program said

a key nazi document made public monday 
shows that kurt waldheim signed a german letter seeking approval 
for mass deportation of greek civilians in 1943 in a cleansing 
operation 
the document found in us national archives was vital in the 
justice departments decision to place waldheim now austrias 
president and formerly un secretarygeneral on a watchlist 
barring him from the united states 
the document was one of those used in making the watchlist 
decision justice department spokesman john russell told the 
associated press by telephone from washington monday 
that us government decision said in part that waldheim 
assisted or otherwise participated in mass deportation of 
civilians 
the document dated aug 15 1943 was made available to the ap 
by the world jewish congress and its authenticity was confirmed by 
justice department sources 
waldheim says he was innocent of war crimes he was serving as 
deputy operations officer of the german general staff attached to 
the 11th italian army in athens at the time the document was sent 
the document shows waldheim while not authorizing the 
deportations received the communication via radio transcribed it 
and forwarded it the world jewish congress said 
in the message a german army officer in the field was seeking 
authorization from headquarters to deport all the male civilians in 
northern greece where the division was operating the request was 
sent to a gen gyldenfeldt who subsequently approved the 
deportation the world jewish congress said 
however the order was countermanded before it could be used to 
deport any greek civilians the world jewish congress said 
the communication mentions heavy bandit concentrations and 
says bridgehead formations by groups seem particularly 
promising for which reason scheduled cleansing operations in this 
area are deemed necessary 
there is hope of success only if all male civilians are 
seized and deported 
the nazis often used the term cleansing operations to refer 
to destruction of towns and mass execution of inhabitants as a 
warning to others to report partisans to german authorities 
deported greek civilians were generally sent to german labor camps 
the document also says the jewish committee operating in the 
town of joannina greece must be regarded as a center of 
preparations for a resistance movement 
the following march the nazis deported 1860 jews virtually 
the entire jewish population of joannina to auschwitz death camp 
in poland the world jewish congress said the document signed by 
waldheim did not seek authorization to deport the jews 
the austrian government has complained that the justice 
department has not turned over all information on which it based 
its decision to prohibit waldheims entry into the united states 
the us government said it is not up to the united states to do 
austrias investigation it said the documents are available to the 
austrian government and that waldheim can appeal the watchlist 
decision if he wishes 
he has not done so 
a commission of six international historians appointed by the 
austrian government found in february that as a german army 
officer waldheim knew about nazi war crimes and could have done 
more to prevent atrocities it said it did not have evidence he 
actually committed atrocities but left open the question of 
whether he was guilty of any crime 
waldheim said he was vindicated by the commission 
under the nuremberg charter the deportation of civilians is 
both a war crime and a crime against humanity the world jewish 
congress said in a statement 
elan steinberg executive director of the world jewish congress 
said monday his organization provided the document to the justice 
department in 1986 
the translation of sections of the document from german into 
english was done by the world jewish congress it was not 
questioned by the justice department 
in london the british defense ministry appealed to the public 
monday for information about waldheims wartime activities that 
might help its investigation into the nazi executions of six 
british commandos in 1944 
the commandos a raiding party captured in the balkans off 
alimina island in april 1944 were handed over for interrogation to 
the unit in which waldheim served 
they refused to talk and were executed by the nazis a war 
crime under the geneva convention on prisoners of war 
the conservative government ordered an investigation two weeks 
ago to try to pin down whether waldheim interrogated the six men 
ian stewart minister of state for the armed forces announced 
in a written reply in the house of commons that anyone who has 
concrete evidence that might be relevant to the review is 
encouraged to submit it to the ministry of defense for 
examination

the american intention to close the plo 
mission by march 21 jeopardizes un independence arab and western 
diplomats told a special general assembly session monday 
representatives of the 21nation arab group the plo and the 
45nation islamic conference urged the united states to submit the 
dispute to binding arbitration and asked the assembly to request 
an advisory opinion from the world court in the hague 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar also recommended 
arbitration and said the integrity of the world organization was at 
stake 
even close us allies such as canada members of the european 
community and the scandinavian countries urged the united states 
not to close the plo mission and joined in the call for arbitration 
at stake at this point are the effective functioning of the 
united nations and the right of the organization to hear the views 
of those invited to attend as observers canadian ambassador 
stephen lewis said speaking also on behalf of australia and new 
zealand 
later this week the 159nation general assembly is expected to 
approve resolutions echoing all those recommendations a resolution 
passed in december asked the united states not to close the mission 
of the palestine liberation organization which has nonvoting 
observer status 
the confrontation over the plo mission which congress has 
ordered closed by march 21 has become the bitterest argument ever 
between the united nations and the host country 
several speakers said monday the dispute could hurt us peace 
efforts in the middle east where secretary of state george p 
shultz has been on a shuttle mission 
us prestige at the united nations already was waning when the 
plo issue arose primarily because washingtons failure to pay its 
full share of us expenses for the several years has contributed 
to the worst financial crisis in the organizations 42year history 
peter florin of east germany president of the general assembly 
opened the monday session with a reminder by citing a charter 
provision saying a member can lose its vote if arrears grow too 
large 
the united states which is assessed a quarter of the un 
budget now owes more than 535 million in dues and contributions 
to peacekeeping forces at the current rate of funding by congress 
the united states could face losing its vote in 1990 
last week us ambassador vernon walters said we cannot 
continue to neglect our financial commitments to the united nations 
and then expect that our opinions policies and positions will 
carry their former weight in the world body 
arab diplomats said monday the credibility of the united states 
and the independence of the united nations are at issue not just 
the fate of the 13yearold plo mission 
the united nations and us state department both say the 
antiterrorism bill ordering the plo mission closed violates the 
1947 usun headquarters agreement but attorney general edwin 
meese iii is said to be planning to implement the legislation 
walters told a news conference monday he didnt know what meese 
was going to do 
he said a series of discussions is going on within the us 
government as to what is the appropriate action to take under the 
circumstances and i am not aware the various agencies in the us 
government have reached some decision in this matter 
zehdi labib terzi plo representative at the united nations 
said monday will the un headquarters in new york be in a 
position to continue operating in the absence of a respected and 
adheredto headquarters agreement 
karim ebrahim alshakar ambassador of bahrain and chairman of 
the arab group said the decision to close the mission was part 
of a feverish zionist campaign against the palestinian people

hungarys official trade unions on monday 
denounced a proposal by a group of academics to consider 
establishing the countrys first independent union 
in a statement carried by the government news agency mti the 
central council of hungarian trade unions said the group seeks to 
destroy the unity of trade unions and set up organizations outside 
the movement 
on feb 19 some members of the hungarian academy of sciences 
met to discuss the possibility of establishing an independent 
union wellinformed sources in budapest said monday 
several hundred people attended the meeting to consider creating 
the tudosz union of scientific workers said the sources who spoke 
with the condition they not be identified they were contacted by 
telephone from vienna 
the sources said after the meeting academics from several 
universities including the karl marx economics university 
expressed in university newspapers their support and their 
intention to join the new union if it were completely independent 
some academics have criticized the official unions in communist 
hungary for not protesting a government decision to cut the 
nations scientific budget by 15 percent 
according to the sources a committee of about 30 people was set 
up at the feb 19 meeting to determine under what conditions the 
union could operate 
the scientists currently belong to the union of public 
employees which is under the umbrella of the central union council 
the sources said the preparatory committee has sent a report to 
scientific insititutions across the country asking them to 
recommend delegates to the committee to ensure broad representation 
there are no independent trade unions in hungary 
the first independent union in the soviet bloc was solidarity 
formed in poland in august 1980 during nationwide strikes it was 
chartered by the government but then suspended in december 1981 and 
subsequently outlawed 
mti reported the union council statement did not directly 
mention the academics but referred to a limited group that it 
said was motivated by illwilled political considerations 
the agency quoted the statement as saying the council rejects 
the intentions of those who make an attempt to set up 
organizations opposing the trade union movement

officials of the assemblies of god met 
monday to discuss the future of tv evangelist jimmy swaggart who 
stepped down from his pulpit amid allegations of immoral conduct 
a police officer guarded the parking lot of the assemblies 
state headquarters and officials issued a statement saying the 
denomination would have no comment 
decisions made by the louisiana district presbytery today will 
be returned to the executive presbytery there will be no further 
announcement or comment from the louisiana district counsel

ended and that executive officials from springfield mo where the 
church is based had attended at the meeting 
leaders of the pentecostal denomination are considering a 
rehabilitation plan that will suspend swaggart from preaching 
reportedly because he paid a prostitute to pose naked and tried to 
make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it 
last week louisiana church officials recommended barring 
swaggart from preaching for three months but national denomination 
officials asked for reconsideration after receiving hundreds of 
calls protesting the penalty as too lenient 
the state denomination also was criticized for publicizing its 
recommendation before it was reviewed by the national office 
during a brief appearance sunday at the jimmy swaggart world 
ministries center swaggart thanked about 4000 worshipers for 
their backing 
ill never have the words to express to you how much that i 
care my concern for you and my thanksgiving if it hadnt been 
for you we would not have made it its just that plain and 
simple said swaggart 
swaggart again was not specific about his wrongdoing but said 
he had received support and sympathy from members of various 
denominations 
the founder of an evangelical empire worth an estimated 150 
million said his worldwide ministry would continue 
first of all this ministry belongs to god secondly this 
ministry will continue and last but certainly not least this 
ministry will be what he wants it to be swaggart said 
marvin gorman the defrocked assemblies of god minister who 
reportedly confronted swaggart with photographs of him entering and 
leaving a new orleans motel room with a prostitute asked his own 
congregation sunday for prayers for swaggart 
i want you all to pray for jimmy swaggart and his family 
because we know that theyre going through a lot right now and i 
want you to know that i know that a lot of miracles will come out 
of this gorman who now preaches independently said at his 
metropolitan christian centre in new orleans 
in a 90 million lawsuit filed last year gorman alleged that 
swaggart and 13 others had destroyed his ministry by spreading 
false rumors of adulterous affairs

remember the 70s asks one of the three 
rapidly aging young men who dominate the action in boys life 
a brittle boorish and unappealing comedy that stumbled into the 
mitzi newhouse theater at lincoln center on monday night 
all that another member of this troubled trio can recall about 
the decade is watergate and the sex pistols but then hes not 
having such a great time in the 1980s either 
all three guys have women problems and playwright howard korder 
examines their woes in numbing detail phil steven goldstein is a 
goodnatured schmo still trying to score with a girl who already 
has dumped him don jordan lage is equally dimwitted but he 
manages to find a woman who will put up with his jock mentality 
the most interesting and sarcastic character in the play is 
jack clark gregg who already is married but willing to fool 
around his meanspiritedness gets a workout during the evening at 
the expense of the other characters 
some of jacks comments are funny but hes really a nasty 
fellow the playwright finally gives him his due in the last scene 
a wedding reception between sips of champagne jack gets to 
confront the emptiness of his own life by then the audience 
doesnt care they have had to confront the emptiness of korders 
play for some 90 minutes 
the large cast some 13 actors in all works hard and 
undoubtedly will go on to better things so will director wh macy 
who at least keeps the actors in motion on james wolks mobile set 
its the play that never goes anywhere at all

a man accused of killing 16 people 
including 14 members of his own family is competent to stand 
trial a judge ruled monday before setting a may 9 trial date 
circuit judge john patterson accepted a state mental hospital 
finding that r gene simmons was competent to aid in his own 
defense 
the state hospital in little rock also found that simmons 47 
was sane at the time of the slayings but that ultimately will be 
decided by a jury defense attorney john harris noted 
simmons was transferred monday to the pope county jail at 
russellville from the state hospital where he has undergone a 
psychiatric examination since late december 
on dec 28 simmons surrendered to police in russellville after 
a 45minute shooting spree in which two former coworkers were 
killed and four people were wounded 
police then searched simmons rural home near dover where over 
a twoday period they found 14 bodies simmons wife four 
daughters three sons two spouses of his children three 
grandchilden and a child who officials say simmons fathered by his 
oldest daughter 
dr roy ragsdill director of the hospital said the agency 
answered yes to both questions asked by the judge first whether 
simmons was competent to stand trial and second whether he had an 
ability to appreciate his actions and conform his behavior within 
legal limits 
but simmons may still plead innocent by reason of insanity 
harris said simmons could contend either he was unable to tell 
right from wrong at the time of the killings or if he was he was 
nonetheless unable to conform his behavior to the law 
they said he was responsible that means hes not legally 
insane prosecutor john bynum said we thought all along he was 
competent to stand trial were real pleased with the ruling 
harris said he visited simmons monday and that he seemed in good 
spirits harris said more psychiatric tests are needed and that it 
could take a couple of months to get the results back 
psychiatrists are like lawyers harris said you get a 
different one you get a different opinion 
simmons has not been arraigned lt jay winters of the pope 
county sheriffs office said the arraignment may occur tuesday 
bynum said it should be soon but said he didnt know if it would 
be tuesday

an offduty policeman shot during an attempted 
robbery was remembered monday as a hero in the strictest sense 
at a memorial service for the third dallas officer slain in six 
weeks 
hundreds of officers some weeping and others with their badges

service for gary d mccarthy a former missionary who joined the 
force 14 months ago 
at least 2200 people attended police spokesman ed spencer said 
he left the foreign mission field but he found another mission 
field said the rev clyde box pastor of brook hollow baptist 
church in desoto where mccarthy a husband and father of two 
children attended church 
while gary was a policeman the streets became his mission 
field last friday he gave his life on that field 
mccarthys funeral will be tuesday in his hometown of amarillo 
police were holding three men in connection with mccarthys 
death friday but the district attorneys office said none had been 
formally charged by monday afternoon the three were arrested on 
capital murder warrants 
one of them vincent edward cooks 23 was paroled aug 4 from 
the texas department of corrections less than a year after he began 
serving a fiveyear sentence for aggravated assault of a police 
officer 
cooks had originally been charged with attempted capital murder 
after apparently shooting at an offduty police officer outside a 
club in houston 
houston police sgt vw west said cooks pleaded no contest to

vehicle police said 
the third man tracy dewayne stallworth 27 of irving has no 
prior convictions 
police would release few details in the case 
wed rather not get into specifics about what were going to 
allege that any of the participants did because obviously this 
case is coming back to dallas for trial and we want to protect as 
much of the investigation as we can waldrop said 
harvey was held monday on 500000 bond while stallworths bond 
was set at 100000 plus an additional 200 bond for possession of 
a controlled substance cooks was moved from houston to dallas on 
monday but bond was not immediately set a jail spokeswoman said 
mccarthy was escorting a grocery store manager back from a bank 
visit when a man jumped out of a car to rob the manager police 
said 
the offduty officer was shot three times including once in the 
heart but was able to return fire police said he died several 
hours later 
mccarthys death was the seventh in six shootings involving 
police this year in addition to the three dead police officers 
four civilians have been killed by police

two former lebanese students of 
hostage professor thomas sutherland said monday that the us 
government has failed to provide leadership in solving the hostage 
problem and lebanons civil war 
farij elawar and basil hamdan who studied under the colorado 
state university professor when he was agriculture dean at american 
university in beirut spoke at a news conference announcing csu 
activities planned this week to mark sutherlands 1000th day of 
captivity friday 
both elawar and hamdan are graduate students at csu 
hamdan said sutherland believed his role as a professor extended 
beyond the classroom to helping underdeveloped countries 
but hamdan said the us as a government is not providing 
the leadership it needs to solve the problem they have chosen 
to ignore it because of political reasons 
sutherland 56 was abducted in beirut on june 9 1985 he was 
working at the beirut university while on leave from csu 
elawar said sutherland introduced a new spirit to the 
school and obtained a new computer for the university in beirut 
csu has planned a number of activities in honor of sutherland 
this week including the distribution of yellow ribbons wednesday 
thursday and friday a video with statements by former hostages 
friday and a ceremony and reception friday to include appearances 
by two of sutherlands daughters and the rev lawrence martin 
jenco a former beirut hostage held captive with sutherland 
csu president philip austin has proclaimed thursday as tom 
sutherland awareness day on campus 
hamdan said he thinks the reagan administration is too afraid of 
risking small setbacks in the middle east to begin the complex 
strategy required to solve the regions problems 
there is no easy answer to the lebanese problem it would be 
really childish to say the us could solve the problem tomorrow 
but the government has to have some large vision if it built 
one thing at a time it would come to a solution hamdan said

a federal appeals court monday revived a 
lawsuit aimed at creating a blackmajority district for the 
election of louisiana supreme court justices 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the 1965 
federal voting rights act applies to judicial elections as well as 
to elections of legislators and executives the decision reversed a 
lower court ruling in may that had dismissed the suit 
where racial discrimination exists it is not confined to 
elections for legislative and executive officials in such 
instance it extends throughout the entire electoral spectrum 
the appeals court said in its 23page opinion that sent the suit 
back to the district court for trial 
activist ronald chisom filed the suit to make new orleans with 
its majorityblack population and voter registration a separate 
district for the election of justices 
the seven justices on the louisiana supreme court are elected 
from six judicial districts one each from five of the districts 
and two from the first district made up of orleans st bernard 
plaquemines and jefferson parishes 
chisoms suit seeks to have orleans parish split off into one 
district with the other three parishes becoming a separate 
district 
it is particularly significant that no black person has ever 
been elected to the louisiana supreme court either from the first 
supreme court district or from any one of the other five judicial 
districts the appeals court said 
in dismissing the suit in may the us district court judge in 
new orleans had ruled that section 2 of the voting rights act of 
1965 does not apply to judicial elections section 2 makes it 
illegal to set up or maintain voting qualifications that might 
exclude voters on the basis of race creed or color 
the lower court judge had ruled that the section covered elected 
representatives and said judges were not representatives 
but the appeals court rejected that interpretation 
the right to vote the right to an effective voice in our 
society cannot be impaired on the basis of race in any instance 
wherein the will of the majority is expressed by popular vote 
the court said

president reagan plans no new economic 
sanctions against panama even though he has determined that panama 
has not been cooperating in curbing drug trafficking to the united 
states a us official said monday 
the official said that penalties to be announced on tuesday have 
already been applied against panama and thus will have no 
additional impact on that country 
a 1986 us law decreed that countries which do not take steps 
to halt drug trafficking to the united states are no longer 
eligible for us aid and are not entitled to us support for 
their assistance requests to international lending institutions 
tuesday is the deadline for certifying that foreign countries 
have complied in combating drug trafficking countries which are 
decertified are subject to the penalties 
the source who asked not to be identified noted that us 
economic and military aid to panama was cut off last year and that 
the united states has not backed panamas requests in the lending 
institutions because its repayments are in arrears 
the institutions involved are the world bank the interamerican 
development bank and the international monetary fund the official 
said 
under reagans finding mexico was certified as cooperating 
in drug enforcement efforts the official said cbs news and the 
washington post reported that colombia was also likely to be 
certified as cooperating in drug enforcement efforts 
the official said government lawyers are studying the 
possibility of excluding panamanian participation from a system of 
tariff preferences the united states accords to most third world 
countries 
in addition the lawyers are reviewing panamanian membership in 
the caribbean basin initiative under which nations from that 
region are given dutyfree access on most products to us markets 
according to the official panamas record on drug enforcement 
may be such that it cannot legally participate in either program 
based on membership requirements 
on feb 5 panamas military strong man manuel antonio noriega 
was indicted by two federal grand juries on charges that he is a 
major figure in an international drug smuggling conspiracy 
colombian drug traffickers were alleged to have paid noriega 
more than 5 million in return for permission to use panamanian 
airstrips to fly cocaine to the united states 
the sanctions decision comes at a time when the administration 
is seeking to force noriega out as commander of panamas defense 
forces in which he has dominated panamas political life 
late last week noriega ignored an order by president eric 
arturo delvalle that he step down as defense chief and moved 
quickly to depose devalle with the help of allies in the national 
assembly 
delvalle calling his ouster illegal has said he still 
considers himself panamas president a position supported by the 
reagan administration 
meanwhile sen edward m kennedy dmass a leader of the 
antinoriega forces in congress introduced a resolution asking the 
reagan administration to consider imposing economic sanctions 
against panama including a trade embargo an official said the 
administraion is not contemplating any such action 
the resolution also asks that the united states cut off all 
contacts with noriega because he is no longer the lawful 
commander of the defense forces 
in a brief speech on the senate floor kennedy said that noriega 
is a threat to peace and security in the region 
when a drug trafficker gets control over the governmental 
powers of a nation its a threat to other nations kennedy said

major issues were unresolved monday just 
hours before the expiration of a contract between the 9000member 
writers guild of america and movie and television producers 
negotiations between the two sides were expected to continue 
until early tuesday and union officials declined to say what they 
would recommend to members until after the producers final offer 
was on the bargaining table the unions contract was to expire at 
midnight but the earliest a strike could begin is thursday 
officials said 
but it doesnt look optimistic said cheryl rhoden 
spokeswoman for the wga which represents about 6500 writers on 
the west coast and 2500 on the east coast 
herb steinberg spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers agreed saying the situation is not good 
west coast union members are to vote tuesday evening on whether 
to accept what emerges from the latest round of talks or reject it 
and go on strike east coast members vote wednesday and results of 
the votes arent expected to be available until midday wednesday 
the walkout could come as early as thursday ms rhoden said 
a strike by writers would be felt first by daily daytime 
programs and talk shows that go through many scripts ms rhoden 
said it would take longer for a walkout to affect shows that need 
fewer scripts and have a longer lead time 
in what he said would be the final public statement before 
meeting with the membership on both coasts the guilds chief 
negotiator said monday evening that the wga will stay at the 
bargaining table as long as necessary 
perhaps something will break in the next 12 hours or so 
said brian walton also the executive director of writers guild 
west at the moment the companies and the networks have still 
declined to meet us in finding realitybased solutions to our 
concerns in many areas 
he accused the alliance and the networks of continuing to 
promulgate press releases with doomsday statistics about how the 
film and broadcast industries are in disastrous shape 
the writers union which has a reputation as one of hollywoods 
most militant last went on strike three years ago that walkout 
lasted for two weeks before writers voted to accept a package 
offering them essentially the same terms as the one they had 
earlier rejected 
the median annual income for writers is 40000 a year but 
about half of the wgas members are unemployed at any given time 
ms rhoden said 
main issues separating the two sides are disputes over creative 
rights residuals from foreign markets and residuals for onehour 
programs 
on the creativerights issue the union wants original writers 
to have the power to do the first rewrite of any material plus the 
right to be on the set when the program is being produced 
sometimes ms rhoden complained original writers arent 
even notified when rewrites are being done 
however steinberg said such issues are appropriately handled in 
individual negotiations when writers agree to terms on which they 
will sell their work not in a national contract

michael caine has just made his eighth film in 
three years and has a tv miniseries set to roll but the 
oscarwinning star of sherlock and me says he still worries 
about being out of work 
you feel uneasy if you havent got something to do caine 
said in an interview in north londons camden town where the 85 
millionmovie was concluding its nineweek shoot 
people say i work all the time but i dont what they 
distributors do is always put the bloody things out at the same 
time 
the actors onscreen good cheer has been one of the few 
constants in the everchanging hollywood scene 
last year he played sally fields love interest in 
surrender and a british intelligence agent in the fourth 
protocol he starred in films as quintessentially american as 
jaws iv the revenge and as quintessentially english as the 
whistle blower a political thriller 
in 1986 he was a british diplomat romantically linked with call 
girl sigourney weaver in half moon street and had vivid 
supporting roles in sweet liberty and mona lisa 
then too there was his academy award last year for best 
supporting actor for his performance in hannah and her sisters 
the erstwhile cockney who was born maurice joseph micklewhite in 
1933 the son of a porter at billingsgate fish market in london 
had integrated himself into the bittersweet world of woody allens 
manhattan neurotics 
id known woody for years and i knew new york so well said 
caine i dont have a voice which is posh british anyway 
my attitude is that im more like an american coming from a 
workingclass background lots of americans think im australian 
or something like that crocodile dundees father 
caines previous oscar nominations were for alfie in 1966 
sleuth in 1972 and educating rita in 1983 
in his new film he impersonates that celebrated sleuth 
sherlock holmes caine is a boozing downonhisluck actor who is 
hired by dr watson to play the famed fictional detective to prove 
him real 
i get to play two parts and a particular hero of mine which i 
like because ive always been a great fan of holmes he said 
we have the pipe the magnifying glass everything said 
caine referring to the traditional holmes accoutrements its a 
chance to play a hero who im not really right for and to do it in 
an entirely different way as a comedy 
the film due out in the fall from orion pictures costars 
oscar winner ben kingsley gandhi as dr watson who is forced 
by public demand to find a reallife holmes to match the figure he 
has been writing about in a magazine 
caine compared his creation to the part of the inimitable 
inspector clouzot created by the late peter sellers in the popular 
pink panther series peter would have laughed at some of the 
physical humor i do the character is such a putz caine said 
im having fun ill tell you that 
on march 14 caine moves on to his next assignment a cbs 
miniseries jack the ripper which marks his first tv work 
since he played horatio to christopher plummers hamlet in a 1966 
production of shakespeares tragedy 
caine will play the fictitious inspector frederick abberline of 
scotland yard in the 5 million show 
said to be based on confidential police and government files 
the show will be aired in the autumn to coincide with the 100th 
anniversary of the notorious mass murderer who terrorized 
victorian london in the late 1880s 
caine said hes made a conscious effort to vary his parts and 
his performances it gives you cachet as someone who can play 
anything he said 
ive been a leading actor not a movie star who comes on and 
does the michael caine personality performance like a cary grant or 
a john wayne although i admire both of them very much 
his salary he joked reflected this attitude i know a lot of 
actors like dustin hoffman jack nicholson who dont do pictures 
for years but they get 6 million 7 million 15 million a 
picture 
i dont i get 198 and a bollocking a reprimand for being 
late on monday morning he joked caine is one of the few british

assuming johnny can read the question remains 
what should he read 
the times of london and the daily telegraph have tried to answer 
the question with lists of classics recommended for children from 3 
to 18 apart from a few books notably jd salingers the 
catcher in the rye and the basic works for children the lists 
had little in common 
the papers revealed a powerful probritish bias with david 
holloway one of the conservative telegraphs panel of experts 
commenting american universities tend to supply their students 
with reading lists containing thousands of titles this is not only 
daunting but counterproductive 
so the telegraph suggested the 100 books every youngster who has 
gone to school ought to have read by the time he or she finishes 
the times panel of teachers writers and critics came up with 50 
titles 
the times went by age group and stuck to fiction while the 
telegraph cast a wider net modern fiction classics translations 
poetry drama and entertainment 
the two papers found the most agreement on books for young 
children with the times recommending among others the winnie 
the pooh stories rudyard kiplings just so stories 
charlottes web by eb white and maurice sendaks where the 
wild things are 
the telegraph altogether weightier in its approach opened with 
a category called cornerstones that included the bible homers 
iliad horaces odes geoffrey chaucers canterbury 
tales and all of shakespeares plays 
don quixote by miguel de cervantes john miltons 
paradise lost boswells the life of samuel johnson and 
charles darwins the origin of species rounded out the list 
however against such highbrow fare as bertrand russells 
history of western philosophy the telegraph also suggested an 
entertainment list that ranged from arthur conan doyle and edgar 
allan poe to the big sleep by raymond chandler and agatha 
christies the murder of roger ackroyd 
its childrens category included one american work mark twains 
the adventures of tom sawyer many of the others in the 
category were the same as chosen by the times 
in its 1218 category the times ignored shakespeare and the 
ancients but suggested twains huckleberry finn george 
orwells 1984 the diary of anne frank jane eyre by 
charlotte bronte and pride and prejudice by jane austen 
there was robert louis stevensons treasure island alongside 
the lord of the flies william goldings frightening tale of 
powercorrupted children salingers catcher in the rye rubbed 
shoulders with emil and the detectives by erich kastner 
the telegraph recommended 13 translations among them boris 
pasternaks dr zhivago gustave flauberts madame bovary 
the three musketeers by alexandre dumas the plague by 
albert camus franz kafkas metamorphosis and gabriel garcia 
marquezs one hundred years of solitude 
war and peace didnt make the list but anna karenina did 
the telegraphs longer list found more room for american works 
mentioning f scott fitzgeralds the great gatsby margaret 
mitchells gone with the wind ernest hemingways a farewell 
to arms john steinbecks the grapes of wrath and saul 
bellows the adventures of augie march 
vladimir nabokovs erotic masterpiece lolita also was 
recommended 
poets on the telegraph list included john keats william 
wordsworth samuel t coleridge lord byron alfred tennyson ts 
eliot wh auden philip larkin and charles baudelaire plus the 
rubaiyat of omar khayyam 
its recommended plays were molieres tartuffe william 
congreves love for love richard brinsley sheridans the 
school for scandal oscar wildes the importance of being 
earnest henrik ibsens the master builder anton chekhovs 
the cherry orchard george bernard shaws saint joan and 
samuel becketts waiting for godot 
but as the telegraphs holloway acknowledged in his 
introduction it would be an ideal child who had read the lot 
and a pretty remarkable one who could score more than 50 percent 
certainly none could hand on heart say that he or she had 
read the whole list before leaving school

sex is out in swaziland dallas is 
tops in zimbabwe but hill street blues is africas overall 
television favorite 
thats how foreign tv programs rate among the 5 percent of 
africas 550 million people who regularly watch the tube according 
to the people who buy the shows 
program chiefs from across the continent gathered recently in 
zimbabwes capital harare for the first buyers convention for 
africas mostly stateowned tv stations 
we would not want to show anything that ridicules or 
criticizes socialism or allows our people to be influenced by the 
cultural dominance of others said nebiyu eyassu head of 
stateowned ethiopian television 
african stations face wide political censorship and the constant 
dilemma whether imported shows are likely to offend traditional 
customs or propagate western values that african bureaucracies 
publicly disavow 
nebiyu sees television as a powerful propaganda medium when 
examining foreign offerings for viewers of the 70000 television 
sets in his country of 42 million people 
materialism depicted in many western shows was confusing to 
ethiopian viewers he said as program chiefs settled into armchairs 
to watch excerpts from 1000 hours of shows 
the first preview of its kind in africa brought the wests most 
popular programs to a continent where local producers lack money 
and expertise to make their own imported programming costs between 
100 and 200 an hour up to 20 times cheaper than local 
production costs 
before the convention individual buyers flew to such places as 
london and new york to decide what they wanted for their screens at 
home 
market research in zimbabwe shows dallas has the highest 
viewership of any program screened in this southern african nation 
more than 510000 people watch it each sunday after the evening 
news 
wendy layzell program buyer for stateowned zimbabwe 
television attributed the popularity of dallas to escapism 
it shows a lifestyle that no one will ever have it is 
fastmoving and essentially nonpolitical she said 
despite repeated government calls for more local and culturally 
relevant programming foreign shows account for more than 70 
percent of the stations airtime 
ztv is strapped for cash and depends on commercials license 
fees and a hefty government subsidy 
nigerian buyer oluyole fadola said only 5 percent of his west 
african nations 100 million people own television sets although 
public viewing centers are being set up in isolated areas 
when you take tv to the people you have to be particularly 
selective fadola said 
better educated urban dwellers are less likely to come under the 
spell of television than the rural poor he said 
as program coordinator at nigerias federal television 
authority he is concerned by explicit sex and the level of 
violence in western tv 
we have had a wave of armed robberies at home and i believe tv 
stimulates armed robbery and propagates crime fadola said 
in swaziland sex on screen is taboo because of cultural taboos 
common in southern africa 
we dont like nudity at all we shy away from it said 
wellington sukati head of programming at the swaziland television 
and broadcasting corp 
you may breastfeed in public but the exploitation of nudity 
on the screen is out 
but official swazi prudery does not extend to screens in 
nightclubs frequented by tourists many from south africa which 
brazenly feature explicit soft pornography 
sukati said he was buying about 500 hours of programs 
alexandera taylor sales director of the britishbased 
distribution company that staged the harare convention said 
programs popular among african buyers included a british series 
based on jeffrey archers novel first among equals the bob 
newhart show st elsewhere and a dramatization of last 
years superpower summit in reykjavik iceland 
taylor said her company african and caribbean program services 
could not estimate the value of business transacted in harare nor 
rule out surprises in forthcoming bookings 
in 1987 hill street blues was a best seller in africa but 
kenya one of the wests staunchest allies in africa rejected it 
they didnt like the negative way police were portrayed 
taylor said

thais have normally reacted to 
corruption with a fatalistic shrug but a racket involving false 
royal decorations has raised a public outcry and spurred the 
government into action 
some call this a hopeful sign in battling what has been an 
endemic problem 
the racket had allowed hundreds of people to obtain prestigious 
royal decorations by making phony donations to charities the web 
of corruption according to police involves officials of the 
cabinet and the education ministry as well as a now defrocked 
buddhist monk deputy abbot pasuk kaopong 
police say that nearly 20 people have been detained some on 
suspicion of forging the signature of king bhumibol adulyadej 
regarded by many thais as a near divinity one senior civil servant 
in the cabinet secretariat killed himself after being called in for 
questioning 
the result is that even bona fide royal decorations once 
proudly worn at every opportunity are now viewed with some 
cynicism 
so is the governments fortnightly lottery late last year 15 
senior officials were arrested on charges of rigging the lottery 
wheels via radiocontrolled devices 
from forestry department officials who illegally chop down trees 
to police officers smuggling refugees corruption the english 
word is frequently used has become a daily staple of local 
newspapers and private conversation 
amnouy vongvichian who heads the commission of counter 
corruption said in an interview his agency investigated 3418 
civilservice corruption cases last year and found about 10 percent 
of the suspects guilty 
some thais believe corruption stems from greed spawned by the 
rapid destruction of traditional thai values others believe 
corruption may well be on the decline in thailand but is merely 
getting greater exposure through a freer press and the efforts of 
prime minister prem tinsulanonda who took office in 1980 and 
recently stepped up his anticorruption drive 
however surin pitsuwan a member of parliament says prem has 
yet to move against powerful figures including allegedly corrupt 
senior officers in the armed forces 
there is a thai proverb which says you put fear into the 
monkeys by slaughtering the chickens surin said in an 
interview the prime minister may only be able to go so far but 
he is saying we should not be fatalistic about corruption hey 
no ill show you something can be done 
prem is a staunch royalist and it is said he was particularly 
incensed by disclosures that for 150000 baht 6000 an 
application for a royal decoration could be processed complete 
with fake documents citing large donations to charity all the way 
to his own cabinet 
also recently exposed was a massive racket involving officials 
and police in trat province near the cambodian border smuggling in 
vietnamese boat people running guns and engaging in illegal 
trade with what is an enemy nation the trat governor has resigned 
and six police officers have been transferred as the investigation 
continues 
over the last five to 10 years morality has lost its force it 
has been replaced by coveted status symbols says dr chira 
hongladarom vice rector of bangkoks thammasat university what 
reward does an honest person get in this society 
but chira sees some hopeful signs he and other analysts say 
corrupt officials must now move more cautiously and employ more 
subtle techniques than in the past 
arrayed against the socalled influential people are a few 
apparently incorruptible officials politicians and military men 
who have won wide admiration 
one is chamlong srimuang the mayor of bangkok who donates his 
salary to charity sleeps on the floor at home and wears simple 
clothing 
the hero in the trat case is a lowranking official named 
surachet supathit according to newspaper accounts he tried vainly 
to expose illegal activities to his superiors and refused a large 
bribe offered by influential people who wanted him to register 
six vietnamese refugees as thai nationals 
shortly thereafter two men entered his house held his wife at 
gunpoint and shot him to death

with februarys cold and snow past gardeners 
are turning their thoughts to homegrown vegetables while it may 
not be time to plant yet in most areas some projects can be 
started right away 
right now the first thing they ought to do is decide what to 
grow and order the seeds says charles a mcclurg a vegetable 
specialist with the university of maryland 
while family preferences dictate most decisions many people 
like to grow something new theyve never tried he said 
there are always new varieties coming out ones that have 
received the allamerican selection award are those best adapted 
and most commercial seed companies have them in their catalogs 
he said most people have better success with hybrids even 
though they cost more 
besides armchair gardening with catalogs folks anxious to get 
to work can start soil preparation in their gardens as soon as the 
ground is dry enough many still have plant supports and trellises 
in place and this is the time to clean up and get the ground ready 
about six weeks before the last frost is a good time to start 
seedlings indoors mcclurg says and cold weather vegetables like 
broccoli cabbage and cauliflower can be started even sooner 
any prepared starting mix with a combination of perlite and 
vermiculite plus peat moss is better than soil for starting 
seedlings mcclurg said you may need supplemental fertilizer a 
few weeks after plants start to grow 
the biggest problem we have with people is light they tend 
not to have adequate light in the house for transplants he added 
give the transplants full sun from the time that the seeds 
emerge if you dont have a sunny window available provide 
supplemental lighting with a grow lamp 
avoid overwatering by allowing the soil surface to dry out 
between waterings 
a temperature of 70 degrees to 75 degrees is best for 
germination and growth 
a cold frame can be useful mcclurg said but you have to be 
careful not to let it get too hot on a sunny day and make sure the 
plants are not subjected to freezing temperatures 
container gardening is losing its popularity somewhat he noted 
but is still an excellent way to grow a few things for people 
without space we suggest they make the containers as large as 
practical they need adequate drainage and should try to select 
plant types that are fairly small he said 
coolseason crops that can go in quite early include such 
vegetables as asparagus broccoli brussels sprouts cabbage 
cauliflower celery chives endive garlic horseradish rhubarb 
kale leek lettuce onions garlic parsley parsnips peas 
potatoes radishes shallots spinach and turnips 
cabbage and head lettuce are best handled as transplants 
mcclurg says but never try to transplant peas 
peas and radishes are very good short season crops and should 
be seeded in successive groups to help assure a steady crop later 
the same garden space can be used for a late season item

the firstrun situation comedy may have 
peaked in the television syndication market and reality 
programming talk and information shows seems to be the trend 
for the fall 
the national association of television program executives has 
just concluded its 25thanniversary convention in houston and a 
number of the new programs being offered are reality based such as 
usa today a news show designed to be a tv version of the 
newspaper 
an estimated 8000 people attended the fiveday meeting at the 
george r brown convention center the convention is the major 
arena for producers to show off their new programs and for station 
program executives to pick and choose syndicated shows for the next 
television season 
altogether between 300 and 400 shows are being offered to the 
program executives the shows include reruns of network shows and 
packages of motion pictures 
what i see is a movement toward reality programming a 
philip corvo executive director of natpe said in an interview 
before leaving for the convention it seems to be bigger than any 
move in that direction weve had in the past 
other reality shows being offered include group one 
medical from mgm public people private lives from orbis 
communications the howard cosell show from casablanca and 
on trial from republic usa today is from gtg 
entertainment 
i think this trend will pick up speed if any of these shows 
are successful said corvo another trend i see is that some 
shows are leaning toward horror and science fiction 
lorimar has nightmare on elm street and mca has the 
munsters a revival of the horror spoof from the 1960s already o 
the market are paramounts star trek and friday the 13th 
another new show will be paramounts war of the worlds based on 
the novel by hg wells and the awardwinning 1953 movie by george 
pal 
mgm has 30 new episodes of the twilight zone in addition to 
64 vintage shows from the rod serling classic series 
by far the most successful of the distributors is king world 
which has wheel of fortune jeopardy and the oprah 
winfrey show 
there doesnt seem to be a dent in the popularity of those 
shows said corvo stations are buying them three or four years 
in advance in the old days you never bought a game show more than 
a year in advance most didnt last that long 
the popularity of the original situation comedies has leveled 
off and may even be going into a decline the munsters is the 
only new comedy show stations tried a checkerboard arrangement 
with the comedies with a different show each night but they seem 
to be getting away from that i think theyll go back to stripping 
game and reality shows running them each night of the week i 
think thats what grant tinkers looking for with usa today 
that doesnt mean reruns of network comedies arent selling 
however 
bill cosby is going into syndication in 1988 or 89 with the 
highestpriced offnetwork show in the history of television 
said corvo whos the boss is also going into syndication and 
that is getting some very high prices in fact the offnetwork 
stuff is so expensive that its helping the sale of firstrun 
syndicated shows its making them more attractive economically 
corvo said he also sees renewed interest in hourlong 
offnetwork shows which have not done well in syndicated sales in 
recent years 
the usa network has picked up miami vice and murder she 
wrote he said this is a cable network but it programs just 
like an independent station and sells commercial time its just 
like a superstation

wherever it exists rent control is an issue 
that splits public opinion penetrating deep beneath individuals 
mere political instincts into their philosophical marrow 
it is viewed as the most effective protection the poor have 
against greedy landlords it is seen by others as a violation of 
private property rights by governments that should 
constitutionally be protecting them 
the issue attracts as much emotion as reason in every city 
where it exists it is defended as needed to protect the poor and 
simultaenously damned as the cause of inferior housing and too 
little housing for the poor 
never dormant the issue has been heated to a boil again by a 
feb 24 supreme court ruling that seems to reaffirm a 
municipalitys right to consider a tenants finances before 
allowing or disallowing a rent increase 
in the specific case pennel v city of san jose calif the 
court upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance in which a city 
official would deem whether or not a tenant could afford an 
increase of more than 8 percent 
under the ordinance if the city hearing officer so ruled the 
allowable rent increase could be rolled back to 5 percent plus an 
amount needed for improvements maintenance and rehabilitation 
landlords boiled over since most have for years contended that 
their industry has been singled out for exceptional treatment that 
treatment being an unconstitutional taking of private property 
that is theirs 
but as usual even the institution of the surpeme court 
couldnt deal with the issue without splitting sharply chief 
justice william rehnquist wrote the majority opinion but justice 
antonin scalia wrote a scathing critique 
said rehnquist we have long recognized that a legitimate and 
rational goal of price or rate regulation is the protection of 
consumer welfare but in scalias view such regulation permits 
unfair transfers of wealth 
moreover said scalia these wealth transfers have added 
dimensions that make them cause for additional concern 
they are for instance relatively invisible he said they have 
relative immunity from normal democratic processes and as a 
consequence they allow government to subsidize a social group 
off budget 
the national association of realtors filed a brief that added a 
practical dimension rent control it said it inherently 
irrational since it exacerbates rather than relieves a shortage of 
affordable housing 
the nar can support its contentions with independent studies it 
is no secret to anyone familiar with rent control that it scares 
apartment builders away and can cause landlords to abandon 
properties 
those who defend rent control contend that theirs is the best 
way since as they see it those members of society who need 
protection are granted it while landlord interests are secured by 
regular and fair albeit limited increases 
but william north nar executive vice president states that the 
court has created the ultimate oxymoron compulsory charity 
rental hardship cases he argues are a responsibility of the 
community not just of landlords

danny the red leader of student 
revolts in france and west germany in the 1960s jokingly says he 
was never quite as leftist as his nickname implied 
they only meant my hair color said daniel cohnbendit 
referring to his rustcolored hair during an interview in his 
frankfurt office ive always been an anticommunist more of one 
than reagan 
hes now 42 years old and an active member of west germanys 
antiestablishment environmentalist greens party the moderate 
wing and publishes a leftleaning regional magazine in frankfurt 
he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of frankfurt in 1986 in a purely 
symbolic move he said but he is considering seriously running for 
frankfurts city council next year 
cohnbendit has also become an author a collection of 
interviews with other 1960s activists around the world was 
published in west germany in september 
american activists featured in the book include jerry rubin and 
abbie hoffmann leading yippies of the era and the black panther 
activist bobby seale 
the book we loved it so the revolution portrays rubin as 
a yippieturnedyuppie and seale as hoping for commercial success 
as a cookbook author 
his book isnt the only look back west germanys news media 
have carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968 
cohnbendit said that he has basically remained true to many 
views he had 20 years ago 
i believe that i can still legitimize everything i do from my 
standpoint in 1968 cohnbendit said 
as a moderate member of the greens cohnbendit favors forming 
coalitions with west germanys liberal social democratic party 
which the greens radical wing opposes nor does cohnbendit favor 
a west german withdrawal from nato as some of the radicals do 
west german militarization is more dangerous on its own than 
embedded in a larger context he said thats the lesson of 
world war ii 
cohnbendit has always been a figure who defied traditional 
national political and religious labels he was born in 
montauban france on april 4 1945 the son of german jews who 
fled hitlers persecution in the 1930s 
his parents moved to west germany when cohnbendit was 13 in 
1961 cohnbendit became a west german citizen 
i did it only for pragmatical reasons he said i didnt 
want to serve in the military 
jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the nazis 
are by west german law exempted from the countrys mandatory 
military service 
cohnbendit who speaks french and german fluently said he 
doesnt assign his national identify to either country as a french 
citizen he would have been subject to the military draft in france 
im just me im not german or french he added i dont 
need a national definition 
cohnbendits views have led to occasional flaps with 
frankfurts jewish community in a highly publicized dispute in 
1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a play 
by rainer werner fassbinder which many jews wanted banned as 
antisemitic 
in the feb 18 issue of his magazine pflasterstrand 
cohnbendit described himself as a convinced antizionist 
in the interview he said he favored the existence of israel but 
also a separate palestinian state and a limitation of zionism 
tenants housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among other 
issues that have made cohnbendit a household name 
but the era that propelled the activist to world fame the 
1960s is a topic cohnbendit said he no longer wants to talk a lot 
about 
in his book originally published in france he writes that 
people have used him like a machine that turns back time 
cohnbendit captured world attention as a university student in 
france at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe 
he was a spokesman for students whose demands included greater 
social equality and an end to war in vietnam and elsewhere danny 
the red became the leader of paris tumultuous and occasionally 
bloody student revolts 
we had the will to change our lives to participate in history 
right at the moment it happened cohnbendit writes of his 
revolutionary days 
in may 1968 french authorities expelled him from the country on 
grounds of disturbing the peace the ban was not officially lifted 
until 1978 cohnbendit wrote in his book 
cohnbendit lives with his girl friend but he said he doesnt 
intend to get married

it was 4 am and the line of 
brazilians seeking tourist visas had already formed outside the 
us consulate in rio de janeiro it started near the front door 
and before long wound around the corner 
ever since the brazilian government on jan 1 rescinded a 
25percent surtax on overseas airplane tickets and on us dollars 
purchased for foreign travel the consulate has been besieged with 
visa requests 
on this particulary morning one man in the line he refused to 
give his name had no intention of going to disneyworld or looking 
out over new york city from the top of the empire state building 
he was there he said because he can sell his place in line later 
for 10000 cruzados about 100 
the desire of brazilians to travel to the united states is 
growing not only because it is cheaper nowadays but because at 
least some hope to stay there even if illegally 
in 1987 the number of those seeking us visas averaged 300 a 
day now it is 450 sometimes more than 600 
there has been an increased demand for services but our 
resources have not expanded accordingly clyde bishop the head 
of the consular section said in an interview 
the consulate has just one usforeign service officer to handle 
nonimmigrant visas 
me bishop said 
the result is delay and grumbling and dissatisfaction on both 
sides 
our people are working 10 to 12 hours a day processing 
visas bishop said often they go without lunch 
the consulates air conditioning broke down recently and the 
temperature inside reached 100 degrees 
the situation is serious said oscar dalsenter president of 
the brazilian association of travel agencies we have people with 
reserved flights and booked hotels who miss their trips because of 
the visa delay 
most of the visa seekers are legitimate travelers happy about 
the repeal of the tax and hoping to take advantage of cheap charter 
flights to the united states 
a brazilian can fly to disneyworld in florida and back in a 
charter group for 650 the normal roundtrip economy fare from rio 
de janeiro to miami is 1600 
the price drops even more if a tourist ticket and visa in hand 
decides to buy the permitted 1000 for foreign travel at the 
official government exchange rate near the end of february for 
example a traveler could have bought the 1000 for 97000 
brazilian cruzados and immediately sold the dollars back in rios 
loosely controlled black market for 121000 cruzados the profit 
then goes to offset the cost of the plane ticket 
but some in the lines are brazilians hoping to use tourist visas 
to stay in the united states as illegal aliens the us state 
department has reported that the number of illegal brazilians in 
the united states recently has been on the rise 
according to newspaper polls a growing number of brazilians 
want to leave the country for good because of serious economic and 
political problems 
among the measures the us consulate has taken is to require 
potential tourists to show proof of income to pay for an american 
vacation it also has stopped issuing visas assigned just to the 
bearer and requires photographs with each application all this 
has slowed the process 
the prime duty of a consular officer is to make sure 
foreigners do not get into the united states under fraudulent 
pretenses bishop said on the other hand us policy is to 
facilitate matters for legitimate tourists who want to visit our 
country so we have to carefully go over each request 
the travel agents have proposed and the consulate is 
considering separate visa handling en masse two days a week for 
brazilian passports submitted by registered travel agencies 
the travel agents association has promised to police its own 
ranks 
dalsenter the associations president maintained the travel 
agencies proposal would reduce the confusion in the visa lines and 
discourage the selling of places 
bishop said we have heard reports of money changing hands out 
there but we have no concrete proof 
it goes on every day dalsenter said everybody knows it 
on the day an associated press reporter and photographer arrived 
at the consulate at 4 am no one on line would agree to be 
interviewed or give his or her name many turned their backs or 
covered up documents they were holding 
a brazilian policeman then came by and chased away the 
photographer citing reasons of security

aaaahyeeeehaaaaa tarzan cries 
upstage the incessant caw of birds the chatter of monkeys and 
peeping of frogs in the vinetangled rain forest 
in the morning mist on the amazon river dozens of dugout canoes 
dart out from a thatched village hugging the muddy bank where a 
scrawny pig and a few frazzled chickens scurry beneath the banana 
trees 
the cries of the canoeists paddling furiously toward us with 
what seemed to be longhandled gaily painted pingpong paddles 
brought out more boats from houses on stilts farther upstream and 
in the side creeks 
they come to greet us but also to keep their boats from being 
smashed against those little wooden docks by our bow wave says 
capt harry biehl looking down from the bridge wing of the 
10000ton mv berlin a small west german passenger ship 
most of the 270 passengers desert morning bouillon on the lido 
deck to hug the rails with their cameras and shower down chocolate 
bars fruit from the dining room soap from their cabins 
cigarettes and ball point pens in plastic bags on the indian 
families from toothless grandmothers down to the tiniest infants 
bobbing about in the miniarmada that soon slid by in our churning 
wake

rises improbably above the flame and rubber trees the excited

first came the conquistadors dropouts from francisco pizarros 
expedition against the incas then the bandeirantes the slave 
traders followed by the diamond hunters and the garimpeiros the 
gold prospectors next the rubber barons who were crueler and 
greedier than the slavers then the loggers and ranchers soon 
joined by the industrialists and power dam builders chewing up the 
rain forest with their voracious machines at the rate of 80000

razortoothed piranhas that can reduce a brahman steer to raw bones 
in minutes and electric eels delivering 640 volts enough to drive 
a metronorth commuter train this surging swarming stream veined 
by 1000 tributaries that on its majestic march from the andes to 
the atlantic carries onefifth of the fresh water discharged into 
the sea by all rivers of the world now has seen it all 
tourists yet no wonder the crocodiles stared with jaws agape 
from the seclusion of gigantic victoria regia lily pads and the 
pumas and jaguars fled into the forest fastness 
the strange thing is that our miniliner small enough to 
navigate the amazons side channels avoiding the freighter and 
barge traffic in the broad mainstream was as much a novelty to the 
natives unencumbered by cameras as they were to us 
smiling and wideeyed they swarmed about with blowguns 
javelins bows and arrows to sell for only a few dollars or barter 
for the clothes off your back mask makers a declining skill 
offered replicas of the palm fiber yagua headdress framed with 
shoulderlength blonde braids that erroneously gave the amazon its 
name gaspar de caravaj a dominican friar who accompanied the 
conquistadores in 1541 mistook the local tribesmen in their 
shoulderlength headdresses for women warriors in his journal he 
gave the name amazon to the river after the lady legionnaires of 
greek legend writing of battling warrior women who fought as 10 
indian men

international commissions met to protest the brutality then 
henry wickham a british biologist solved the problem by smuggling 
out seeds of the wild rubber tree to the royal botanical gardens at 
kew for cultivation as a plantation crop in the malaysian states 
by 1915 the boom was over cheaper asian rubber dominated the 
market manaus receded to a town on stilts at the waters edge with 
suburbs of flutuantes floating houses as the rain forest 
reclaimed the cobblestone streets leading to the candycolored 
villas on the cliffs 
but now with an oil refinery a 60000ton steel plant huge 
sawmills and governmentdecreed dutyfree shops to bolster its 
economy manaus is making a comeback jumbo jets fly in daily from

left liverpool for manaus 
two or three cruise ships a month call here now but we are 
hoping for many more says godfrey springer from tooting bec 
outside of london who settled in the amazon with his brazilian 
wife he makes his living taking tourists up the side creeks of the 
solimoes in a frail puttputt boat to view crocodiles lurking among 
the victoria regia lily pads broad enough for a small brave child 
to use as a float for sun bathing 
one would think that like joseph conrads hero mr kurtz the 
natives would cry the horror the horror at the first sight 
of tourists invading the heart of their dark rain forest instead 
they smile and offer snakeskin handbags and masks made of turtle 
shells that will certainly be confiscated by us customs agents 
the amazon indeed has seen it all

editors note when it comes to finding homes for orphaned 
pets the north shore animal league is big league indeed a 
combination of operational savvy a gift for fund raising and 
large doses of affection for its charges enable the league to place 
more than 40000 cats and dogs each year including animals 
regularly rescued from the pound 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
mehitabel a calico cat arrived by 
taxi from new york city with a 100 bill around her neck the note 
asked the north shore animal league to find her a good home 
the anonymous owner knew that this nonprofit organization 
totally supported by voluntary contributions never destroys an 
animal 
others do not arrive in such style they are simply tied outside 
in the cold of night no note no donation just a trusting dog 
waiting for an owners return a return that will never happen 
that final pat if there was one was goodbye 
and if thats not enough to handle north shore has five vans 
that daily go to dog pounds to rescue animals on death row the 
league spends 60000 a year in pound fees alone gathering the 
doomed some of them anyway 
what sets the north shore animal league apart from other equally 
noble operations throughout the country is sheer volume its 
directors say it places more animals in homes than any other 
shelter in the world consider these statistics 
it placed more than 43000 animals in 1987 although it can 
only kennel 400 animals at a time with another 100 in its foster 
home system 
an animals average stay at the league is less than three days 
the kennel operation runs a 35 million deficit each year but 
its creative fund raising and directmail campaigns pull in 5 
million 
the league spends half a million dollars a year placing ads and 
mails out over 30 million pleadings to potential donors each year 
it is open 12 hours a day seven days a week 
the average contribution by adopters is 17 
despite the good work the leagues animalloving staff is quick 
to point out that their effort scarcely makes a dent in the 
slaughter of unwanted pets in this country 
the american humane society based in denver estimates that 
about 20 million unwanted dogs and cats are put to death each year 
the league works hard to educate people to neuter their pets and 
its credo is that there is no such thing as an unadoptable animal 
its their job to match the right animal with the right person 
they matched a deaf dog with a deaf woman who was not only able to 
teach it tricks by hand signals she also taught it to bark just 
as she had been taught to talk 
while the great majority of their animals are perfectly healthy 
the league has managed to place threelegged dogs a 12yearold 
newfoundland a giant pyrennees that couldnt walk and a cat with a 
bladder problem on one freezing day recently a cat lover named 
donna taffen of queens came in and asked for the least adoptable 
cat she took home a 7month old calico with a prolapsed eye 
when an animal has been here for a while the associates ask 
me to help if i can get its picture in the paper or call it pet 
of the week that usually works says betty rosenzweig the 
director of adoptions who has worked at the shelter for nearly 20 
years 
shes also a born saleswoman as she roams the compound with 
praise for this dog or that cat 
we are all salesmen in a sense except that our commission is 
the satisfaction that up to 300 dogs and cats are adopted on some 
days says michael arms director of operations 
some big hound and shepherd mixes allamericans as the league 
calls the nonbreed have been waiting five or six months but the 
league knows eventually someone will fall for one of these big 
mongrels 
some breeds like yorkshire terriers and poodles move so fast 
they often never see the inside of a cage ditto purebred persian 
and siamese cats 
alan cooper 24yearold graduate student in psychology and 
currently kennel manager says that when he walked in the league 
five years ago it was the best thing he ever did 
he has seen cruelty and animal abuse but also nobility he never 
expected 
one man came in one day and asked for the ugliest dog we had 
he wanted to adopt it and he did recalls cooper actually was 
a 5 or 6yearold terrier mix and it was so ugly it was almost 
cute 
another asked for the dog that had been there the longest 
another requested the fattest cat a blind man specified he wanted 
the dog with the most beautiful eyes

<TEXT>
when cooper began here he drove one of the vans that rescue 
doomed dogs from the pounds workers on that duty usually burn out 
quickly he said 
theyre told they can only bring 10 dogs back and the pound 
might have 40 dogs that are going to be put to sleep its awful to 
make that choice he says they usually bring back 14 instead 
of 10 but they know there is no room for all 40 
the north shore animal league is truly a national organization 
contributions and animals come in from many parts of the country 
and because of the leagues reputation people often adopt their 
pets here while on vacation 
the notsosecret ingredients behind its success are alex and 
babette lewyt a welltodo couple who came to port washington to 
retire in the late 60s lewyt made his fortune as an inventor 
with 200 patents to his credit including the lewyt vacuum cleaner 
babette lewyt took one look at the old north shore league a 
downattheheels operation that was about to go under and set out 
to transform it 
both of them would work here from dawn to dusk cleaning out 
cages and doing everyting that needed to be done says ms 
rosenzweig he took out the first ad in the new york times under 
the adoption columns advertising a free golden retriever and some 
other purebreds the ad cleared out the shelter 
in business since 1944 the physical plant is not much to look 
at a gerrymandered hodgepodge of rooms with cages stacked atop 
each other its on a side street in a long island bedroom 
community some 20 miles from manhattan the original building was 
donated by a san francisco woman one individual left the league 
200000 in a will 
the league has strict guidelines one out of five potential 
adopters are turned down it is no coincidence that the man working 
the parking lot is an offduty policeman punches have been thrown 
when someone was rejected 
besides precautions there is a dowry including a leash 
collar id tag starting food a training book and a 30day health 
insurance policy but they also check references right there on the 
spot making one area resemble a bookie operation on occasion 
they make onsite followup calls this accounts for a return rate 
of only 6 percent 
arms partial to newfoundlands worried when his favorite was 
adopted by a queens couple he drove by the house and found the dog 
chained outside on cement with the new owners at work an 8foot 
cyclone fence enclosed the area 
arms telephoned the pair fibbing about a faulty blood test and 
asked the couple to bring the dog in for further checking then he 
snatched the newfie back and delivered a lecture to the highly 
displeased couple 
arms can be a tough guy when it comes to rescuing dogs when he 
worked for the american society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals in the bronx he was stabbed by three men who were betting 
on how long a wounded dog would live they objected to arms 
interference with the outcome 
the league also backs their orphans for 15 you can bring your 
dog back for obedience training for as long as it needs it such 
training can cost as much as 50 an hour elsewhere 
the league will also neuter your animal for a token fee 30 
for a female 20 for a male and if you cant afford that it 
gets even cheaper says arms free 
once in a while workers let instinct replace checking 
such was the case with bruce and monsita abramski and their 
three children of central islip ny 
both adults were experienced dog owners the children all loved 
grandmas dog and they were about to move into a larger and more 
secluded home where mrs abramski would be all alone with the kids 
they wanted a puppy to grow up with the kids but mature into a big 
watchdog 
they settled on a chubby bigboned mostly black pup about 6 
weeks old with telltale big paws and to judge by looking lots of 
shepherd genes 
jessica the eldest at 8 took over as family spokesperson and 
declared the puppy would be named tramp 
we will all vote on the name her father corrected as six 
little hands all reached in unison to pet the new addition whose 
sad brown eyes looked a bit overwhelmed 
monsita abramski shook her head 
do you think the puppy is up to these kids 
if puppies are puppies and kids are kids mrs abramski its a 
sure thing

editors note there are still a lot of lakes and mountains and 
such in alaska without proper names but not because no one has any 
ideas naming geographic features simply gets bogged down in red 
tape with both state and federal agencies to satisfy and some of 
the suggestions seem frivolous at best 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a fishermans pet dog dies dead blackfish 
are found floating on a lake a college student loses his a skiff 
in a storm british paratroopers scale an alaskan peak 
those are some of the events that inspired requests from people 
who want the state of alaska to name a lake stream creek island 
mountain or some other landmark in honor of someone or something 
don lallemand from the state of washington buried his dog mitzi 
on an unnamed southeast alaska island 12 years ago he wrote the 
state geographic board in 1986 asking that the twoacre island be 
named in honor of mitzi 
we buried a small dog who had traveled with us for years 
aboard the boat and loved the area as much as we do he wrote 
lallemand included a picture showing the sign he posted on the 
island naming it for mitzi he plants flowers and trees near the 
grave site every year 
but lallemand has not heard anything from the state board in the 
two years since he submitted his request were very 
disappointed he says 
he is not alone 
the board has almost 100 requests on file waiting for action 
the board last met in august before that it met in march 1985 
we are swamped says gladyce williamson secretary to the 
board 
williamson serves as secretary to the state community and 
regional affairs commissioner who chairs the geographic board she 
said there is no extra staff for the board and she must process 
the applications while also handling her regular duties for the 
commissioner 
the eightmember board comprised of state officials and one 
public appointee reviewed 10 requests at the august meeting the 
federal people had really been pushing and really wanted some 
action on the oldest cases williamson says 
the oldest cases date back six or seven years she says 
all recommendations from the state board go to the us domestic 
geographic names board for final approval 
one of the priority cases was a request from the us army corps 
of engineers to name a mountain near the interior brooks range for 
a federal geologist his name is reuben kachadoorian for ease of 
pronunciation williamson said the corps proposed reubens peak 
most requests come from individuals not government agencies 
some landowners get upset when the board refuses to allow them to 
name features on their own property 
a homesite owner had asked that a lake be named for dead 
blackfish found floating on the surface his nomination of deadfish 
lake southwest of fairbanks was deferred by the board 
homesteaders north of anchorage want to pick their own name for 
a small lake on their property we felt it was not only our 
responsibility to the community but also our privilege to name a 
feature on our property they wrote in their nominating letter 
the backlog of nominations includes the expected personal 
requests such as ottos lake and moores mountain and also some 
unexpected ones 
in 1985 a 24yearold college student from the lower 48 wrote a 
sad tale of losing and finding a skiff while crab fishing in 
the aleutian islands 
his crew lost their skiff in a storm and then recovered it 
now when we happen to anchor at this cove we affectionately 
refer to it as skiff cove 
the board also deferred action on skiff cove 
williamson said nominations must meet certain criteria to win 
the boards approval commemorative names get the most thorough 
review 
the person for whom the feature is to be named must be dead at 
least one year 
the application must include a biography and the persons 
length of stay in alaska 
the nomination must have local support and the native 
corporation in the area must be consulted 
the person must have made a substantial contribution to a city 
or the state or their rural area williamson says 
some commemorative requests appear to fall a little short of 
that criterion 
a small creek northeast of fairbanks has been nominated as pete 
bloom pup after a trapper who killed himself in 1937 
according to the nominating letter and a 1937 newspaper article 
accompanying the request pete bloom had fallen into the ice and 
knew that even if he lived he would lose his hands and feet to 
frostbite he took a snare and put it around his neck and then 
attached it to his dog sled he then told his dogs to mush thereby 
choking himself to a fast death 
a kenai peninsula resident wants the board to name a lake in the 
kenai national moose range as dangerous lake the person had once 
found a cow moose near the lake killed by a bear and must have 
figured it was a dangerous spot to be 
a fairbanks resident wants a waterway near the dalton highway 
named solitude creek 
this wayward wandering hall of wonder does not entertain the 
aspects of fear only unpolluted silence this is a fitting name as 
it will no doubt draw others who will be searching for that very 
avenue of adventure 
an anchorage resident nominated tranquility lake northwest of 
town 
a kenai resident likes the name of the greek goddess of the sea 
giving a lesson in mythology the person wrote thetis the 
mother of achilles saved him by hanging onto his foot and the lake 
is shaped like a foot therefore he proposes the name lake 
thetis 
never mind that thetis is also the kenai mans first name 
a 12060foot peak in denali national park was scaled in 1956 by 
members of a british parachute regiment the regiments symbol is 
pegasus the flying horse 
although the regiment may have named the peak in their honor 
the federal review board in 1985 rejected pegasus peak the state 
geographic board still has the file open 
tired of butterfly lake and butterfly creek of which there are 
several in the state one nominee suggested the french name for the 
insect papillon pond 
even children get into the act my daughter thought of the 
name after my mustache and a moose said a proud parent in asking 
that the state name a small lake moosestache lake

editors note its the southernmost inhabited point in canada 
an island on lake erie virtually isolated in the winter but the 
islands population has dwindled as farms become more mechanized 
and today local officials are looking for ways to keep the young 
folks at home 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they sometimes call it canadas key 
west but until the spring thaw comes the 195 yearround residents 
of pelee island on icecrusted lake erie are virtually cut off from 
the outside world 
from middecember when the last tourist boats head home until 
the ice pack breaks up in late march commuter flights to windsor 
ontario and sandusky ohio are the only direct link with the 
mainland 
pelee island 16 miles south of the canadian mainland and 22 
miles north of sandusky is the southernmost inhabited point in 
canada 
the only problem with pelee island is you either love it or 
hate it says donna olsen who runs a bait and tackle shop with 
her husband svend the olsens are among the yearround residents 
of the island 11000 acres of farmland scrub and beaches 
about 300 people consider it their primary residence and up to 
1500 people crowd its 17 square miles during the summer when the 
ferries mv pelee islander and mv upper canada ply their regular 
routes between the island kingsville and leamington ontario and 
sandusky 
visitors are few in the winter months mostly small groups of 
hunters who want to make use of one of the few decent spots within 
hundreds of miles for shooting pheasant 
i dont have an attitude that its an isolated place says 
helen mccormick owner of the pelee passage restaurant which 
offers the islands only yearround food service 
the islands hotel motel bar and other two restaurants close 
for the winter 
the pelee passage restaurant is the site of a tuesday night card 
game and the canadian legion hall hosts a friday night gathering 
seated at the restaurant one recent afternoon were four pheasant 
hunters who had flown over that morning on the sixpassenger piper 
navajo that makes twicedaily flights to the island 
were friends and we go up north every fall moose hunting and 
bear hunting says dudley sparks of merlin ontario 
if you want to hunt pheasant you have to go to pelee said 
one of his companions gary ryckman of muirkirk ontario 
farming has dominated the economy of pelee island since the 
first european settlers arrived in the 1820s while fields of soy 
beans wheat and corn still cover about 7000 acres the population 
has dropped sharply as mechanization has increased the acreage one 
farmer can plant and harvest 
there were close to 1000 people here when i was growing up 
says don gow a retired postmaster born on the island in 1902 if 
you had 50 acres and a team of horses you were pretty busy all 
summer if you work it with a tractor thats a days work 
more typical today is the 540acre spread farmed by bill 
krestel the reeve or supervisor of the township of pelee 
island krestel was born on the island to a farm family that 
emigrated from romania before world war ii 
as is common among farmers everywhere he holds several jobs to 
supplement his income working as a telephone repairman for bell 
canada deputy game warden and occasional hunting guide 
his post as the islands top elected official brings him about 
1200 a year 
krestel says lack of employment opportunity drove most of his 
classmates off the island he wants that to end 
when i went to school there were 13 kids in my class and 
about 130 in the school he says now there are 25 in 
kindergarten through eighth grade at the tworoom pelee island 
public school 
five young people from the island attend high school in 
kingsville on the canadian mainland boarding with local families 
and flying home on weekends

what youve got to have is a job that a kid who has gone to 
school can be proud to do krestel said you can look at a 
million things and it always comes back to tourism 
he and other island officials and merchants are at work on a 
number of projects to boost pelees tourist trade 
key to the expansion is the introduction of a larger 
400passenger ferry with space for 45 cars to replace the mv 
upper canada which can carry a maximum of 100 people and 10 
vehicles 
the mv pelee islander with capacity for 267 people and 15 cars 
will continue to run 
well almost double our capacity he says 
getting tourists to the island is only half the battle krestel 
and others are trying to drum up more things to keep visitors busy 
while theyre here 
a pelee heritage center featuring exhibits on the islands 
history and economy is to open on may 1 the town council will 
experiment with a third pheasant hunt importing adult birds to 
supplement the 20000 raised each year on the islands pheasant 
farm 
the 1600 permits for the two hunts sell out within days 
recently krestel and peter pfeifer vineyard manager for the 
pelee island winery sat at pfeifers kitchen table and discussed 
plans for a tasting center that would allow visitors to sample 
products of the islands grapes and tour the nearby pheasant farm 
pfeifer took the job in february 1986 after answering an 
advertisement in a west german wine magazine bringing his wife 
inge and their two daughters from heppenheim a city of 36000 to 
the island community 
the moderating effect of lake erie gives pelee island an average 
of 19 more frostfree days than the mainland and its rich dark soil 
yields hearty sweet grapes that are shipped to the winery in 
kingsville for processing 
while pfeifer talks daughter alice 4 wanders in from the 
living room where she is watching cartoons on television clutching 
a stuffed bear 
daddy im thirsty and baby bear is thirsty she said 
pfeifer gets them a drink 
island life has been good for alice and her big sister denise 
7 a secondgrader at the islands tworoom school other children 
live just across the road 
the remoteness has been harder on his wife who had stayed on in 
windsor after a family trip to the mainland earlier in the week 
its a little more difficult for the women out here pfeifer 
said there is no shopping it can be isolating out here 
occasionally if the lake freezes hard and deep enough 
snowmobilers will trek from pelee south to putinbay on south bass 
island a part of ohio 
lisa nageleisen came to pelee island to teach in 1981 met and 
married a ferry worker she teaches 11 children in grades four 
through eight while in the next room debbie janzen teaches 14 
children from kindergarten through third grade 
its a juggling act nageleisen said as she and janzen 
watched from a classroom window as the children frolicked outside 
the kids learn to work a little more independently the older 
ones will sometimes help the younger ones 
theyre not as segregated in terms of grades at lunch the 
whole school was playing soccer 
because the children spend years with the same teachers they 
often become very close 
nageleisen says she stays in contact with former students who 
have gone away to college on the mainland 
i hope that they come back and find something here and remain 
pelee islanders she says

editors note over the past two decades he has written some of 
americas most popular songs starting with up up and away in 
1967 but jimmy webb has not been able to get off the ground on 
broadway even while working with some of the top names in the 
theater hes still trying with three productions in the works 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ace songwriter jimmy webb who has returned to 
performing is still trying to crack broadway after several 
frustrating years of trying 
so many of these things you can work on them for years and 
you dont get to see anything he says someone told me it took 
eight years to get annie on broadway its a tough business 
webb is also not forgetting the record market his bread and 
butter he alternates writing one song for records one for a 
broadway show 
nobody pays anybody to write broadway shows he says 
theres nothing up front and i think its dangerous to work 15 
months on a musical and not write one song for the record market 
record people say is he still alive 
after 1967 when his up up and away became the first big 
hit for the fifth dimension and his by the time i get to 
phoenix put glen campbell on the charts webb concentrated on the 
record market campbell scored again with webbs wichita 
lineman and galveston actor richard harris had record hits 
with webbs macarthur park and didnt we 
but in the 1980s webb has concentrated on writing for broadway 
three productions are planned for next season on broadway 
offbroadway and in dublin ireland 
so far nothing webb has written has been performed on broadway 
the shows he worked on with some of the top names in the theater 
never opened 
webb composes in a studio in a manhattan building that was owned 
by the late michael bennett the master director of a chorus 
line and dreamgirls 
the first musical i did with michael scandal i spent 14 
months in this room writing almost every day webb recalls to 
no avail 
i got kind of uncomfortable with that i feel i have to get 
back to these individual songs but theyre harder i think its 
easier to write songs when you know the plot than sitting down with 
a blank piece of paper and going lets write a hit here 
webb accomplished the latter this winter with still within the 
sound of my voice glen campbells first hit record in 10 years 
it was campbell a friend for 20 years who in 1985 suggested 
webbs fourverse the highwayman to waylon jennings willie 
nelson johnny cash and kris kristofferson 
at 41 webb also is singing in cabarets accompanying himself on 
the piano during january and february he performed at jan 
wallmans and the ballroom in new york and at the hollywood 
roosevelt hotels cinegrill 
im just not ready to pack it up yet webb says 
he performed with a rock band in the early 1970s but stopped 
after a second tour as opening act for the group america he made 
six record albums in the 1970s but none sold exceptionally well 
amy grant sings webbs if these walls could speak on her 
next album webb cowrote home of the brave with david paich of 
toto for that groups new album his father marty paich 
arranged up up and away webb says david was about 12 then 
in 1980 webb moved to tuxedo park ny and began writing 
tuxedo a show based on the history of the oncefashionable 
suburb of new york city where the dinner jacket that bears its name 
was introduced i was wasting time webb says i knew nothing 
about what i was doing 
then recording mogul david geffen introduced webb to michael 
bennett and webb started working on scandal 
but bennett announced the postponement of scandal two weeks 
before scheduled rehearsals in broadways mark hellinger theater 
we call it black monday webb recalls we had treat 
williams and swoosie kurtz and most of the great dancers and 
singers from the original chorus line and some others from 
dreamgirls 
webb says that bennett probably decided the times were not right 
for a show about infidelity 
next they started working on another musical together called 
childrens crusade 
there was a mass uprising of children in france and germany 
twice 40 years apart in the 13th century huge groups of children 
left their homes and banded together and declared their intention 
to go to the holy land and did it people would ask where they 
were going theyd say they were going to heaven to see jesus 
there were hundreds of thousands of them whiterobed children 
carrying little wooden crosses with this light in their eyes 
one of the last conversations i ever had with michael he 
wanted me to go ahead with it he still thought it was the best 
idea hed ever had for a broadway show 
webb hopes itll arrive on broadway next season 
last summer webb wrote the music and he and ray bradbury 
collaborated on lyrics for a musical based on bradburys novel

editors note early this century railroads looking for cheap 
labor brought mexicans to an illinois town where they lived first 
in boxcars and later in cramped bungalows along a narrow street 
but that winding lane has earned the name hero street for the 
patriotism of its residents and some think it should be made a 
national monument 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for more than 40 years scores of 
mexicanamericans have gone off to war from a winding drive of tiny 
woodframe houses perched on a hillside rising from an old rail 
yard in this illinois town 
eight have returned in caskets 
and since 1968 the street has been named hero street usa in 
honor of the 110 young warriors who have left it for the armed 
forces since 1941 now a move is under way to get congress to name 
the former dirt path a national monument 
for joe munos and his family life on hero street always meant 
serving their country not only did munos and his three brothers 
all fight for the united states his younger brother johnny died 
in korea but his three sons and his daughter joined the armed 
forces as well as his grandson 
thats the tradition of hero street munos says it must 
be in our blood its an honor for me to be a veteran of foreign 
wars 
for georgia sandoval herrera growing up on hero street meant 
watching a halfdozen brothers leave during world war ii and seeing 
two return in caskets brothers joe and frank died 10 months apart 
and portraits of them in uniform still hang on her living room wall 
it seemed like a ghost town during the war because so many of 
our boys were gone she recalls but we were one big family on 
hero street the losses pulled us together were still a very 
close community 
my son says why dont we move and i say the only place id 
want to live is hero street theres no place like hero street 
another sandoval family sent seven boys into world war ii and 
suffered one death 
those kinds of statistics are common on hero street 
no other single block in america has made so great a sacrifice 
according to local officials although the defense department cant 
confirm the claim its never been disputed in 20 years 
a memorial park was built on the site in 1971 and now a city 
alderman is leading the drive to have congress declare hero street 
a national monument as a tribute to all who died in service 
especially immigrant soldiers 
these men walked into this country and picked up arms without 
a complaint says alderman joe terronez 58 some werent even 
citizens when they joined the armed forces this is a great story 
about great heroes and it should be a national monument 
located between billy goat bluff and honey creek hero street is 
a small mexican barrio that winds its way back up a deadend hollow 
near the rail yard in this town of 7200 
some of its 36 tiny bungalows sit precariously on the steep 
terrace of the bluff while others are perched just above the creek 
and appear to be sinking into the gully 
many of the woodframe homes are long and narrow like the 
railroad boxcars they replaced until a few years ago the street 
was a dirt path that turned to mud and trapped hearses as they 
brought home dead soldiers 
when terronez was growing up hero street was simply 2nd street 
and a tough neighborhood living conditions were poor for the 
large mexican families crowded into the cramped houses 
the mexicans were brought to silvis early this century by the 
railroads who were looking for cheap labor originally they lived 
in boxcars in the nearby rail yard but were moved to 2nd street 
when townspeople complained about the growing mexican population in 
the yard 
this is a story of our parents coming to the united states and 
adopting it terronez says although we were all viewed as 
aliens the boys of hero street proved this was their country 
the fight for national monument status is more than just a 
battle for recognition of the contribution made by eight dead 
soldiers or even 110 men and women who joined the armed forces 
for terronez it epitomizes the struggle of hispanic americans 
everywhere for appreciation and respect as firstclass citizens 
hes enlisted the help of us rep lane evans a democrat from 
nearby rock island in achieving national recognition in congress 
hero streets residents hope for tangible benefits from 
elevating the street to a national monument 
federal money would be available for maintaining the memorial 
built on a bluff to resemble a mayan temple residents also hope it 
would become a tourist attraction after placement on national parks 
system maps 
steve vetzner an aide in evans washington office said the 
congressman plans to work with the illinois delegation to get some 
sort of designation for hero street such as a national monument 
historic site or historic landmark 
lets be honest naturally this would be a shot in the arm to 
hispanics terronez says sometimes we feel we are 
secondclass citizens but when you look at the blood shed by 
hispanics on that one street you know we are real americans it 
would be a source of great pride for all mexicanamericans

actor kirk douglas says he learned just how 
controversial inherit the wind is when the movie company was 
turned away from filming at a private school in oregon 
this is a play about the scopes monkey trial in 1925 but the 
issue is as relevant today as it was then he says 
the best example of that came when we planned to shoot a scene 
in a schoolhouse in a small town in oregon we had made 
arrangements with the schools board to film scenes of the young 
teacher teaching darwins theory of evolution but when they found 
out what we were going to film they threw us out they said they 
only teach biblical creationism 
douglas jason robards jean simmons and darren mcgavin star in 
the new twohour production of inherit the wind david greene 
directed from a screenplay by john gay based on the play by jerome 
lawrence and robert e lee 
douglas plays matthew harrison brady a brilliant orator and 
fundamentalist politician invited to prosecute a teacher for 
bringing darwins theory into the classroom robards is henry 
drummond a liberal lawyer who defends the teacher simmons is 
bradys wife and mcgavin is a cynical reporter named ek hornbeck 
the play of course is based on the trial of john scopes in 
tennessee brady is really william jennings bryan the threetime 
democratic presidential nominee drummond is clarence darrow and 
hornbeck is hl mencken it was made into a movie in 1960 with 
spencer tracy as drummond frederic march as brady and gene kelly 
as hornbeck 
its interesting for an actor to play a role with a point of 
view you dont believe in douglas says i think he was very 
sincere he wasnt a charlatan he wasnt a buffoon he believed 
every word in the bible should be accepted as it was written 
thats what creates the dramatic friction between my character 
and jason robards they were both sincere in their beliefs the 
pathetic quality which we develop is that these two men had been 
friends clarence darrow had backed bryan in his first run for the 
presidency its touching because these two men are now bitter 
enemies 
douglas says he wasnt interested when his son peter the 
executive producer first brought the idea to him he didnt want 
to do a remake of the movie in which brady was more buffoonish 
i never thought he should be played as a fool he says i 
played him as a mixture of pat robertson billy graham and jimmy 
swaggart brady wasnt gluttonous and eating all the time the way 
he was in the movie 
he also began to see how relevant the subject was because of the 
ongoing debate evolution vs creationism 
the time of the trial was also moved to the fall 
in the movie you see a hundred extras fanning away because of 
the summer heat douglas says we didnt want that we also 
went back to the original trial transcript and picked up a few 
things brady dies in the courtroom but in reality bryan died five 
days after the trial ended the play was never an attempt to be 
exact history 
inherit the wind is douglas second movie with son peter 
the first was called amos which was set in a home for the 
elderly 
thats the exciting thing about doing movies for television 
he says you can deal with subjects you cant do for theatrical 
films theatrical films seem to fall into certain formulas wild 
comedies violence or young kids finding out about sex 
on television you can do something with substance this is the 
first program in the new atampt presents series what i like about 
that is that we have fewer commercial breaks 
douglas last theatrical film was tough guys which also 
starred burt lancaster 
ive got several projects pending but ive been devoting my 
time to my autobiography he says ive just finished it and 
simon amp schuster will publish it it was interesting to write like 
taking a selfinventory it was hard work i found it painful i 
wrote it by myself 
one of my motivations for the book is that i have four sons 
ill say something and one of them will say gee dad i didnt 
know that i think this book is my chance to say who i am 
douglas believes that the public has a different image than the 
one he has of himself 
before champion in 1949 id played an intellectual 
schoolteacher a weak schoolteacher and an alcoholic after 
champion i was a tough guy i did things like playing van gogh 
but the image lingers thats one of the things i loved about 
inherit the wind it was a battle of ideas rather than of 
physical violence

second stage has devoted an entire theater 
season to the plays of michael weller a rare honor for playwrights 
these days 
since november the enterprising offbroadway company has 
presented moonchildren and loose ends two of wellers 
bestknown efforts in april it will offer the world premiere of 
his latest drama spoils of war at the troupes small theater 
in what was once an old gymnasium on the upper west side 
and in between there will be staged readings of other weller 
plays panel discussions about weller and his work and viewings of 
ragtime and hair two movies for which weller wrote the 
screenplays 
for weller the second stage celebration is a homecoming of 
sorts since its start nine years ago the company which 
specializes in second looks at plays that may not have been 
successful the first time around has been receptive to the 
playwrights writing 
mike is one of the people who started the theater with us 
remembers robyn goodman one of the companys two artistic 
directors he was one of the first people to write a play for 
us 
and hes doing it again this year spoils of war the story 
of a mother and son in the 1950s was commissioned by goodman and 
her second stage partner carole rothman kate nelligan plays the 
mother 
one of the enticements in writing a new play was that mike 
would be cushioned to a certain extent by having his other plays 
done during the same season rothman says new york has kind of 
a hitormiss mentality with our current season people will be 
able to see a body of work its not as frightening for a 
playwright to premiere a new play when its surrounded by plays 
that have been done before 
the object of these theatrical festivities is a boyish 
45yearold writer who does his writing out of an east village 
studio 
the man is surprisingly lowkeyed considering he is under 
deadline to get spoils of war finished before it goes into 
rehearsal and considering he is juggling phone calls from texas 
where his latest screenplay actually has gone into production its 
a movie as yet untitled directed by hugh hudson and starring 
donald sutherland and adam horovitz of beastie boys fame 
the film is about kids whose parents dont supervise them too 
much weller says the movie follows one boy through his 
adventures with a gang and getting into trouble with the law 
he had no problem taking a new look at his old plays and was 
closely involved with the casting and directing of each revival 
weller found the experience a pleasant one and didnt feel 
compelled to rewrite what he had written years ago 
its like going into your old neighborhood again weller 
says i usually work out of a real emotional knot and once thats 
untied i dont feel much inclination to go back to a play 
moonchildren a look at college students in the 1960s at the 
beginning of the vietnam war protests was his biggest success it 
flopped on broadway in 1972 but had a successful offbroadway run 
the following year and has been a staple of regional theaters and 
acting classes ever since 
loose ends examined the same generation 10 years later when 
they were struggling to sort out their lives and loves it was a 
harder play to write weller says 
for one thing i knew more weller says the more 
deliberate you are in your writing the harder it is when youre a 
kid you think no ones ever done this before but the next time 
you realize its been done a million times 
weller didnt start out to be a writer he wanted to be a 
composer and studied music composition at brandeis 
i wasnt a good musician he admits but when an opportunity 
came up to write a college musical he enrolled in a playwriting 
course writing eventually took precedence over composing and 
weller went off to england to study playwriting before eventually 
coming back to the united states 
a handwritten copy of spoils of war lies on the desk in 
wellers study the penmanship is small and precise 
i write quite a bit every day but i hardly use any of it 
the playwright says i keep going back and poring over it 
pulling things out in that way i am very slow to select what im 
finally going to use 
wellers parents were both painters so artistic discipline was 
in his blood and success wasnt what counted the most 
i saw people who went off to their workshop every day and 
painted he recalls for some of them the glory train came in 
and for others it didnt you couldnt allow that to hinder your 
daily output you couldnt allow yourself to get thrown by it 
for that reason weller when he isnt helping take care of his 
young son keeps to a rigid writing schedule he jots down in 
notebooks ideas and notes for projects he will get to when he has 
time 
i think the only hard lesson is not to have any big 
expectations he says just concentrate on what you are doing 
and get it right

the nazi occupation in world war ii and a 
lingering antisemitism left the jews of france in disorder and 
disarray so much so that many renounced their heritage and took 
french names but more recent years have seen a rebirth of jewry in 
a nation that is largely roman catholic and a new era for jews has 
set in 
</TEXT>

friday is a busy day on the rue des rosiers a 
narrow street in the heart of paris oldest jewish quarter it is 
there that shoppers preparing for the sabbath find everything from 
kosher chickens to prayer books and sacramental wines 
this colorful neighborhood and many others like it throughout 
predominantly roman catholic france have come alive again as the 
jewish community revels in a new era of jewish pride and an upsurge 
of judaism 
traumatized by world war ii which saw the virtual dismantling 
of french jewry and the deportation of some 117000 jews to nazi 
gas chambers the community of guiltridden survivors lived in fear 
of antisemitism and new persecutions 
many renounced their jewish identities changing their names 
refusing to circumcize newborn boys as prescribed by their faith or 
to give their children jewish educations 
today those are just bad memories 
jews again are playing major roles in the upper levels of french 
life government industry the intelligentsia entertainment and 
the media 
the change is largely due to the 150000 sephardic jews from 
algeria morocco and tunisia who poured in during the 1950s and 
1960s as the french colonies in north africa gained independence 
the sephardim are jews who originated in spain in the middle 
ages and who migrated to north africa after the spanish inquisition 
in 1492 many also moved to the middle east and the term now refers 
to all jews who are not of askenazic or eastern european origin 
the sephardim make up more than 60 percent of frances 
population of 650000 jews the worlds fourthlargest jewish 
community after the united states israel and the soviet union 
no one was as startled as todays sephardic jewish community 
when word came from washington earlier this year that they were 
considered wretched enough to warrant 8 million in emergency 
relief from the united states 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii one of the measures 
congressional backers said the money for schools for north african 
jews in paris was earmarked for these unfortunates these jews 
who have not been absorbed or assimilated 
the american funding later cancelled by congress was to build 
schools for ozar hatorah a nonprofit organization that promotes 
education assistance and charity in 20 countries 
globally you can say that the integration of north african 
jews into french society has been a real success story said 
emile touati director of consistoire the religious governing body 
for french jews 
besides their own folklore culinary habits tightknit family 
stucture and socalled mediterranean mentality north african 
jews brought their unconditional devotion to judaism and a demand 
for jewish culture 
in the past 15 years the number of synagogues in the paris 
region has increased from 30 to 70 in 1950 paris had just three 
kosher butchers today they number more than 100 
touati says it has become virtually impossible to keep track of 
the dozens of restaurants grocery stores professional caterers 
supermarkets and fastfood outlets serving kosher fare before the 
coming of the sephardim there were virtually none 
there was a time when you couldnt even find a bottle of 
kosher wine for the sabbath meal touati said in an interview 
now the finest chateaux in burgundy bordeaux and champagne 
produce kosher wines which we export all over the world 
the pletzl in the marais a ghettolike haven for poor 
askenazic jews since the middle ages has seen an influx of 
sephardim too and the shops that once sold chopped liver and 
gefilte fish have been joined by fastfood joints serving falafel 
and kosher couscous 
these places are filled with young people looking for their 
jewish identity and a sense of community said eric ghebeli 
fomer president of frances jewish student union they are 
minicultural centers where people get together to enjoy a dish 
their mothers once made but there is also a thirst for knowledge 
enrollment in jewish schools is higher than ever with 10 
percent of schoolage children about 15000 enrolled fulltime in 
one of frances 33 jewish schools an equal number attend sunday 
school 
a century ago the watchword was assimilation today it is the 
preservation of jewishness among frances 555 million people the 
lucien de hirch school founded in the early 1900s to help new 
immigrants adapt to french life has done an about face today it 
teaches the principles of judaism to its 850 students 75 percent 
of whom are north african sephardim 
since the arrival of the sephardim more than 6000 study 
groups with different goals and religious tendencies have sprung 
up around the country along with countless adult education courses 
teaching hebrew and yiddish 
in a country where jews have long believed that flaunting their 
jewishness was asking for trouble the lubavitch ultraorthodox 
hasidic jews originating in 18th century poland have seen their 
memberships swell thanks to new sephardic recruits 
dressed in long black coats wearing beards and earlocks some 
have even learned yiddish to read in the original the works of 
rabbi menachem mendel schneerson head of the sect who lives in the 
brownsville section of brooklyn ny in december they plastered 
billboards around paris with posters telling jews to light hanukkah 
candles and installed a giant menorah at the place de la concorde 
jews around france can tune in to any of 13 radio stations 
playing hebrew and yiddish songs and broadcasting cultural programs 
and news commentaries the three paris stations claim a daily 
audience of 37000 
jewish publications also have more readers than ever numerous 
weeklies are distributed free in jewish centers and shops the 
monthly larche geared to frances educated middle class 
reaches 10000 subscribers it was joined in december by 
passages a magazine offering what it calls a jewish point of 
view on the news

the jewish community as a whole has been deeply troubled by the 
recent events on the israelioccupied west bank in the middle east 
we deplore the violence but our support of israel is 
unconditional said roger pinto president of siona a zionist 
group made up of north african sephardim unlike many askenazim 
we support israel first and then ask questions 
in a recent statement an umbrella organization of jewish 
institutions known as crif reiterated its support of israel and 
condemned its arab neighbors for refusing a real and useful 
dialogue to solve the problems of the region 
in an editorial in the monthly information juive the 
consistoires touati asked under the circumstances what army in 
the world would have behaved better than tsahal the israeli 
army 
nonetheless nearly a dozen jewish groups have publicly called 
for a peaceful and political solution to the violence 
the french government strives for evenhandedness in relations 
with israel and the arab nations of the middle east where 
historical ties translate today into what france considers 
special relationships with several of the arab nations france 
supports the convening of an international conference with all 
parties represented to resolve the middle east conflict 
many french intellectuals of jewish origin have begun 
identifying with judaism some for the first time 
benny levy militant founder of the proletarian left and close 
friend and secretary of the authorphilosopher jeanpaul sartre in 
the years before his death has abandoned politics completely and 
embraced a life of piety and study of the torah judaisms holy 
scriptures 
philosopher jacques derrida the father of deconstruction a 
textual analysis based on the theory that language refers to 
itself has been discussing jewish and biblical themes in seminars 
at the elite ecole normale superieure and at yale university in new 
haven conn for several years 
intellectuals bernardhenri levy andre gluckmann and alain 
finkielkraut once committed leftists and later the major force 
behind the new philosophy movement of the mid1970s are among 
frances most visible jews publicly rediscovering their jewish 
roots writing on jewish issues and supporting jewish causes 
but for joseph sitruk frances newly installed grand rabbi 
they are hardly examples of what he calls in hebrew teshuva or 
return 
many of them are interested in judaism the same way they would 
be interested in buddhism or leninism he said in an interview 
they may be going through an identity crisis and thats 
respectable but theyre not calling themselves into question and 
going all the way 
rabbi michael williams of the liberal copernic synagogue 
said he understands the cyncism of the religious establishment 
how can the socalled return be anything but superficial when 
its standardbearers dont respect the very basic rules of judaism 
and marry out 
williams maintains that french jews are going through an 
intense crisis of love he says he regularly meets with observant 
young people planning to marry gentiles 
indeed studies show that intermarriage is on the rise at about 
50 percent among the sephardim the figures are only slightly 
lower 
the family structure among north african jews is still quite 
strong and plays an important role in influencing decisions made 
by family members touati said the increase in intermarriage 
is one of the consequences of rapid assimilation and integration 
into french society 
yet sitruk maintains the current upsurge in judaism is not 
superficial but profound touching all classes and backrounds rich 
and poor 
it comes in the wake of the holocaust the birth of the state 
of israel the new positions of power held by jews worldwide and 
the profound and farreaching need to identify with the jewish 
biblical message sitruk said 
reform jews too have been swept up in the trend towards 
orthodoxy five years ago friday night services at copernic 
frances largest reform community were mostly in french today 
threequarters of the service is in hebrew 
there is definitely an unspoken demand for a return to jewish 
knowledge and values williams said but we must be careful 
that it doesnt come at the expense of a new ghettolike 
mentality

from the conviction of the army officer alfred 
dreyfus nearly 100 years ago to the french police zealously 
rounding up jews during world war ii france has a long and sordid 
history of antisemitism 
today however jewish leaders say it is on the wane 
the bombing of the copernic synagogue in 1980 and a terrorist 
attack on a kosherstyle delicatessen two years later were not the 
work of frenchmen but of palestinian terrorists who are still at 
large 
according to the bnai brith antidefamation league office in 
paris the number of antisemitic acts of violence has dropped 
considerably in recent years in 1986 it recorded two though the 
desecration and vandalism of jewish tombstones remains frequent 
recent polls indicate that jews are better accepted than ever 
before in france in 1946 37 percent of the population thought 
jews were like any other french citizens in 1987 that figure rose 
to 94 percent 
i certainly look jewish when i walk down the street said 
joseph sitruk frances grand rabbi ive been in marseilles for 
the past 12 years and have heard only two remarks thats two too 
many of course but not very much 
nevertheless french jews remain vigilant and many express 
concern over the growing popularity of jeanmarie le pen leader of 
the extreme rightwing national front that rallies roughly 10 
percent of french voters around an antiimmigrant 
franceforfrenchmen platform 
le pen prides himself on saying out loud what everybody thinks 
to himself he caused a storm of controversy last year by 
referring to the nazi gas chambers as a detail adding their 
existence was still being debated by historians 
for decades french jews didnt like themselves much either 
anatole france summed up a whole mentality when he said that 
if alfred dreyfus had been on his jury he would have convicted 
himself said rabbi michael williams of the copernic synagogue 
robert goldman spokesman for the bnai brith antidefamation 
league says the ageold cliches of the jew as the dangerous 
moneyhungry foreigner with the long noses are dead but they have 
been replaced by antizionism 
he called french press coverage of violence in the 
israelioccupied west bank biased and said israel has taken an 
excessive drubbing 
being harsher in judging israel than other western countries 
is a new form of discrimination goldman said it deeply 
affects jews in the diaspora given the role israel plays in the 
minds of jews after the holocaust

wheel a baby down any street in italy and youll 
never walk alone 
fussing over children seems like a national pasttime but if 
present trends continue italians will have fewer and fewer toddlers 
to dote on 
to the concern of politicians and sociologists the italian 
family is steadily shrinking the latest statistics say each family 
has an average of 127 children the lowest in europe 
children are still king in italy but these days one king is 
enough not two or three said renato tagliani a father who has 
just one little emperor in his household 11yearold 
chubbycheeked gianbattista 
family is practically a sacred institution in italy its 
certainly the most enduring one in a country that has seen invaders 
conquer and crumple and governments rise and fall 
the value of family as an institution hasnt changed said 
lorella spinelli a 30yearold roman who had her first child in 
the fall but to create a world for children these days is very 
difficult 
fingers point to the slow but steady changing of womens roles 
the difficulty of finding jobs and housing and the irritations of 
daily life that are particularly italian and particularly 
frustrating if you want to have children 
to have more children signifies being penalized suffering the 
lack of services inadequate salaries said demographer antonio 
golini who directs a national center for population research 
whats especially intriguing is that surveys show the practice 
of birth control is low in italy compared to other western european 
countries 
less than 12 percent of women use the pill more than 60 
percent dont use any contraceptive said panorama an italian 
news weekly in a recent issue 
are italians not making love any more have they all become 
sterile 
studies are under way here to see if italians are indeed 
becoming infertile 
for laura spinelli just starting out as a parent and renato 
tagliani with more than a decade of experience the reluctance of 
so many italians to be parents once let alone more than once 
seems understandable 
having children once was the goal of an italian womans life 
you married had kids stayed at home said mrs spinelli 
now the role of women is more like mens you go to university 
and finish when youre 25 or 26 then its usually a year or so 
before you find a job once you find one youre reluctant to leave 
it to have a child 
her husbands success in business allowed her to give up her job 
after childbirth but hes on the road a lot 
im lucky to have my mother at home mrs spinelli said 
her 67yearold mother helps with the care of grandson luca 
i have a friend whose mother lives on the opposite end of the 
city mrs spinelli said she leaves her 7monthold baby with 
her mother all week because with all the traffic it would take her 
too long to get there and back 
such daily trials mean nonna grandmother is rapidly 
replacing mama as the anchor of the italian household 
nonna is in special demand because babysitters are hard to find 
and can be expensive 
many italians wont let their teenagers work because they are 
obsessed with brutta figura making a bad impression and 
neighbors might gossip that your children have to work because you 
dont earn enough 
with no grandma handy the taglianis a twocareer couple with 
their own business a media agency feel the shortage of 
babysitters daily 
italian schools close at 130 pm so where do you put your 
child when he gets out said clemenzia tagliani 
in italy stores are closed at lunchtime in the evening and on 
sundays and public schools are open saturday mornings 
so if you have to buy a pair of shoes for your son you drag 
him out of school on saturday when youre off and make a mad dash 
to the store before they pull down their shutters at 1 pm mrs 
tagliani said 
miriam mafai a journalist who has written extensively on 
italian women finds it curious that an overwhelmingly roman 
catholic country where the pill was illegal until the early 1970s 
and where christian democrats are the dominant party doesnt have 
a policy to make it easier to raise a family 
some political debate has begun about what to do but so far no 
legislation has been adopted 
among suggestions are financial incentives but none so 
ambitious as the family program in neighboring france gen charles 
de gaulle after becoming president in 1959 used monthly 
allowances to encourage the french to have more children the 
result is that a french couple with two children today collects 
more than 1200 francs about 200 a month from the government 
ms mafai said such ideas invoke the stigma of benito 
mussolini italys fascist dictator who tried to swell the 
population for his glory his army and his dreamedof imperial 
colonies 
war is to man what motherhood is to woman mussolini once 
said he introduced family allowances in the 1930s and made 
bachelors pay a heavy tax but the birth rate actually fell for 
several years under his rule 
golini the demographer predicts italys child population will 
swell in the next few years but that will be only a consequence of 
the 1960s economics boom babies reaching childbearing age 
in the first six months of 86 the average number of children 
per family was 133 at the end of the year we went down to 132 
in 87 in the same period the average was 129 in december 
127 you see were always going down 
but remove the cause and italy will grow again golini said

its the kind of place englishmen left to join 
mad dogs in the noonday sun or perhaps strike out on the road to 
mandalay the more sensible sat around sipping singapore slings 
its raffles hotel which has survived for 102 years ceiling 
fans still whirring grillwork elevator clanking up and down dark 
paneling and long corridors with creaking floors wide verandas and 
elderly waiters shuffling around the palm court garden 
dear as it was to the hearts of many raffles in recent times 
has become a bit seedy and the talk was that it would come down 
because the land on which it sits is extremely valuable one plan 
to renovate it was scrapped in 1983 because tourism had slumped and 
thousands of rooms in singapores more modern hotels stood empty 
but another chance has come for the legendary raffles with the 
announcement by its owners that it will be restored to some 
semblance of its old self in a twoyear 273million face lift 
a tourist industry study two years ago had suggested that the 
national asset might make it if turned into a suitesonly 
establishment for state guests and vips 
the 127room hotel will remain open during the renovation which 
will be done in phases according to the bankers that now own it 
the central block will remain but the old ballroom and courtyard 
wing are to be demolished to make way for a basement parking 
garage function rooms and a bedroom wing 
raffles is in many respects the antithesis of a standard modern 
hotel with its french renaissance architecture and palm trees all 
around 
the atmosphere is still tropically relaxed but with a residual 
whiff of stiffupperlip british colonial 
raffles dates to the early 1800s when it was founded as a 
tiffin house or lunchroom in a private home the actual hotel 
in beach road was started in 1886 by three armenian brothers and 
named for the founder of singapore sir stamford raffles 
by the turn of the century it was the social center in a key 
outpost of the british empire rubber planters merchants military 
officers ships captains remittance men and other colonials 
stayed there the years have left legends 
one says that cm phillips the principal of a nearby school 
was summoned in 1902 to shoot a tiger that had taken refuge under 
the billiard table at the hotel a stuffed tiger on the premises 
keep that legend alive today then theres the hotels tiger 
tavern which serves the locally brewed tiger beer 
bartender ngian tong doon is credited with mixing the first 
singapore sling 73 years ago the hotel sells more than 1000 
glasses of the ginbased cocktail each day 
lounge lizards who kept their elbows on the bar gave cads alley 
its name it was later changed to gins alley to honor bartender 
ngian and his concoction 
another legend has it that joseph conrad got the idea for lord 
jim while on the veranda reading a newspaper story about a 
british crew that abandoned ship and left 200 passengers to die 
feed at raffles when visiting singapore was rudyard 
kiplings advice but he found the beds less than comfortable and 
suggested sleeping elsewhere 
those were the days of awesome appetites and massive meals one 
dinner menu surviving from 1900 lists 18 courses 
a typical breakfast of that period porridge fish mutton 
chops deviled fowl cold beef salad boiled eggs cheese toast 
tea or coffee and benedictine 
when japanese bombers attacked at the start of world war ii 
raffles band played on in the ballroom behind blackout curtains 
singapore surrendered to the japanese on feb 15 1942 and with 
occupation imminent the staff buried the hotels silver in the palm 
court garden 
hotel records show highranking officers of japans occupation 
army lived there when the war ended in 1945 former inmates of 
changi prison and other japanese internment camps were taken in by 
the hotel the silver was dug up and raffles reopened for business 
again in 1946 
somerset maugham the late british novelist and shortstory 
writer once had said raffles stands for all the fables of the 
exotic east 
the hotel uses that as its motto today and has a plaque outside 
one of its rooms in maughams his honor

heres a switch the twohour movie pilot for 
nbcs aarons way is set in pennsylvania and california but it 
was filmed in australia 
we had to have a grape harvest when we filmed it last march 
said merlin olsen who stars in the new series as aaron miller 
we were able to duplicate parts of california and pennsylvania 
in southeastern australia we shot the entire pilot there we did 
all the episodes at the lorimar studios and in the santa ynez 
valley near solvang we have our own grape vineyard and home 
there 
olsen stars in aarons way as an amish farmer who is 
suddenly forced to leave his sect and confront the modern world 
miller leaves his peaceful pennsylvania amish village to run a 
california vineyard yet tries as much as possible to cling to his 
religion and his traditions 
the series also stars belinda montgomery early miami vice 
jessica walter play misty for me and kathleen york the 
series is from william blinn and jerry thorpe producers of nbcs 
our house blinn who wrote brians song and cowrote 
roots wrote the pilot with reno down 
the series is in the tradition of little house on the 
prairie the waltons and our house although olsen said 
its probably slanted more toward adults 
the pilot premiered last week the hourlong series begins a 
spring tryout on wednesday 
its the fourth series for the 6foot5 olsen selected to the 
pro football hall of fame after being an allpro defensive tackle 
for the los angeles rams for several years he has been an nbc 
football analyst and is probably best known as the spokesman for 
the ftd florists group 
immediately after retiring from pro football olsen became 
jonathan garvey on little house on the prairie in 1977 and 
stayed for four years he then starred for a year in father 
murphy a spinoff series another series fathers and sons 
ran briefly in 1986 
in the pilot miller goes to california after his son noah who 
has left the amish ways is drowned in a surfing accident there he 
learns that noah had a commonlaw wife who is pregnant and owns a 
vineyard that needs to be harvested 
aaron feels that he must help her and the whole family shows 
up on her doorstep one day he said i say that we just happen 
to be in the neighborhood although hes amish aaron is a man 
whos looked over the fence and accepted some things that are not 
amish if they suit the needs and lifestyle of his family 
olsen said he knows that the amish want to be left alone and 
were unhappy about how they were portrayed in the movie witness 
we did some research because its our desire and our 
responsibility to present the amish as honest and as respectfully 
as we can he said but the amish like any other faith have 
members with different levels of adherence aaron miller was in 
danger of being shunned because he kept in contact with his son 
olsen said the show would deal with many contemporary and adult 
problems many of the problems will arise from miller trying to 
hold onto his traditions yet having to make concessions to 
survive it will ask very serious questions about the values and 
morals of an old world family suddenly brought face to face with 
the modern world he said 
he concedes that his role as aaron miller is not that different 
from jonathan garvey on little house or john murphy on father 
murphy 
its deliberate in a way he said there are some things 
im not eager to do on the other hand these are roles that came 
looking for me partly because of my size it reminds me of what 
happened when i first went out for football the coach asked me 
what position i wanted to play i said quarterback the coach took 
one look at me and told me to play tackle 
i dont think im being stereotyped each role is different 
but there is a thread of similarity i want to do roles that i can 
sit down and watch with my children i want to be able to point to 
the screen and say thats your father im afraid theres a lot 
of things on tv i wouldnt want to watch 
olsen said he filmed 13 episodes of aarons way while 
continuing his full schedule of sportscasting for nbcs pro 
football coverage that was a tough fall he said i dont 
want to do that again if the show is picked up im going to have 
some conversations with nbc sports about cutting back he said 
i love doing this show i look forward to getting up in the 
morning and going to work i love working with belinda montgomery 
and jessica walter

western banks and brazil have reached agreement 
on important elements of a loan restructuring package for the third 
worlds most indebted country providing it with more money at 
lower interest rates 
banking sources familiar with the agreement who spoke on the 
condition they not be identified by name said the negotiations 
reflected a surprising level of cooperation from brazil which last 
year toughened its position over loan repayment terms and aroused 
considerable concern in the banking industry 
fernando milliet president of brazils central bank and 
william r rhodes chairman of the bank advisory committee for 
brazil said sunday that under the agreement reached in new york 
brazil will get more than 6 billion in new financing to help make 
debt payments through the first half of 1989 
both sides also agreed that the interest rate for repaying that 
money will be 1316ths of 1 percent over the london interbank 
offered rate a commonly used benchmark for determining foreign 
debt payments brazil has been paying 1 percent above the 
socalled libor rate because of its highrisk status 
under the agreement brazil also will make a payment next week 
of about 700 million from its reserves to cover unpaid interest on 
foreign bank loans for january and february milliet and rhodes 
said in a press statement 
the amount of delinquent interest theyre paying is 
considerably more than the market had expected said one source 
knowledgable about the negotiations the market had expected they 
would wrap up the month of january but theyre adding the month of 
february theyre starting to make interest payments more often and 
in larger amounts than wed foreseen 
concerned about its deteriorating economy and reliance on 
outside money brazil hasnt repaid any principal on its 114 
billion foreign debt since 1983 in february 1987 it decreed a 
moratorium on interest payments but late last year agreed to resume 
them 
with the agreement announced sunday the countrys interest 
payments will be current for all 1988 and the last quarter of 1987 
brazil still owes backinterest from feb 20 1987 when it first 
declared the moratorium up to sept 30 1987 
plans for repaying the remaining delinquent interest are still 
under negotiation as part of a broad plan to restructure a foreign 
bank financing package for brazil 
the banking sources said the package should be ready by the time 
a meeting of foreign bank creditors and latin debtor nations 
convenes march 20 in caracas venezuela 
this accord marks the end of a period of great uncertainty 
brazils finance minister mailson de nobrega told a news conference 
in brasilia we should have all the details smoothed out by the 
end of march 
the agreement also is expected to help brazil in negotiations 
with the international monetary fund that were scheduled to begin 
monday in washington brazil was expected to ask the imf for 17 
billion in standby loans 
rhodes said in the statement that the negotiations and the 700 
million interest payment represent significant progress in 
restoring brazils traditionally good relations with its commercial 
bank creditors 
about 25 perent of brazils foreign bank debt is held by us 
lenders concern about the countrys ability or willingness to 
repay has caused many us banks to reclassify some loans as 
possibly uncollectable and raised concern about the health of banks 
with large brazilian loan portfolios 
negotiations over restructuring brazils loan repayments began 
in october between brazilian finance officials and the 14member 
bank advisory committee which represents 700 creditor banks

one of alpine countys main 
industries is a silver mine but neither silver ore nor a gold mine 
of ski business are enough to keep the countys only bank from 
checking out 
bank of america will close its markleeville branch tonight 30 
years after the county tax collector cajoled the banking giant to 
set up shop in californias least populated county 
the bank says the closure is a costcutting move forced by keen 
competition following deregulation of the banking industry it 
promises to continue serving alpine county customers at its south 
lake tahoe branch about 35 miles away 
the move angers many customers who lament bygone days when 
resident bank managers would open the bank and approve loans after 
hours attend neighborhood potlucks and host an annual holiday 
buffet in this sierra nevada community 
they claim the bank would have done well in the county had it 
made efforts to secure accounts such as the kirkwood ski resort and 
the washoe indian tribe now alpine is the only one of 
californias 58 counties without a bank 
its not the community failing the bank said don jardine 
one of five members of the alpine county board of supervisors 
its the bank failing to aggressively go out and just provide 
basic services 
corporate spokesman richard beebe said its not our intention 
to abandon anyone 
beebe said alpine county clients wont see any interruption in 
their accounts and will be able to do much of their banking 
including loan applications by telephone 
although some customers are grumbling theyll bank in nevada 20 
minutes away by car the county doesnt have that option 
state law requires that local governments bank in california 
alpine county which has cash assets of 3 million and an annual 
budget of 5 million is considering hiring an armed transport 
service for 70 a trip to deposit its money at south lake tahoe 
dee rudden who moved here two years ago from san jose with her 
husband bob and bought the markleeville general store said the 
banks closing is really going to be a problem for everyone 
i guess what were going to do is buy a safe rudden said 
were going to have to do something 
in markleeville the economy seems as slow as the pace of life 
welcome signs on the edge of town boast a population of 165 in a 
county of 1200 people work is seasonal at the silver mine four 
miles south of town 
doranna tognotti deputy treasurertax collector said the 
estimated 75500 it would cost to start a new bank in alpine 
county may be prohibitive 
you cant help but wonder if were going to end up being a 
ghost town she said

the mexican government said it would raise by 
3 percent the minimum daily wage in march and freeze officially 
regulated prices under its inflationfighting program 
it also said the value of the peso currency against the dollar 
would be maintained in march at the level reached today the 
government had been paring the currencys value by 3 pesos per 
trading day 
the national motto is no increase in prices in the month of 
march president miguel de la madrid said sunday in announcing 
that the government was stepping up the pace of its antiinflation 
program 
he said the decision was made after fresh inflation figures 
showed an important deacceleration in february 
the inflation tally for february he said will be about half 
the record 155 percent posted in january consumer prices rose 87 
percent in the first half of this month the government reported 
last wednesday 
in outlining inflationfighting steps for march the 
presidential office said the prices of governmentproduced and 
controlled goods and services such as gasoline telephones and 
electricity will be frozen 
private companies it said will be urged to absorb the increase 
in the minimum wage and not pass it along to consumers in the form 
of higher prices 
moreover it said the government will push ahead with plans to 
reduce the governments redink spending 
the government had been expected to announce over the weekend a 
target for boosting wages and prices in march under an indexation 
plan scheduled to go into effect on tuesday 
under that plan wages and prices of governmentregulated goods 
and services were to be increased by a set amount based on 
projected inflation 
but officials decided instead to raise only the minimum wage 
which will move from 7765 pesos a day to just under 8000 pesos 
or about 350 at the current exchange rate the higher pay will go 
into effect tuesday 
the small increase dealt a setback to labor labor officials had 
called for a gain of at least 10 percent to help workers keep pace 
with the sharp rise in prices in recent months 
but during a meeting at the presidential office labor chief 
fidel velazquez said he believed the fresh steps would help 
attack inflation he said workers had once again placed the 
interests of the country ahead of their own interests 
the inflation rate in all of last year was a record 1592 
percent up sharply from the 1057 percent of 1986 
de la madrid unveiled the antiinflation program called the 
economic solidarity pact in middecember in an effort to prevent 
the nation from spinning into hyperinflation officials have 
predicted that the plan will reduce the monthly inflation rate to 
just 1 percent to 2 percent by years end 
as part of the solidarity pact the government authorized sharp 
increases in the prices of a variety of officially controlled goods 
and services which kicked up costs throughout the economy 
the exchange rate on friday was 2270 pesos to the dollar in the 
controlled market which is regulated by the government and used in 
about 75 percent of commercial transactions 
the rate in freemarket trading used in tourism and 
transactions along the usmexico border was 2327 pesos to the 
dollar 
in february the bank of mexico the central bank sliced the 
currencys value by an average of 3 pesos per working day the rate 
had held fairly steady from middecember to february

japanese automakers exported 91 percent fewer 
cars trucks and buses in january largely because the yens rise 
against the dollar shrank shipments to the united states an 
industry association announced monday 
exports to the united states dropped 194 percent from a year 
earlier to 199904 units according to the japan automobile 
manufacturers association 
japanese companies exported a total 524785 units in january 
an association spokesman who requested anonymity said there 
was no single reason for the drop in shipments to the us market 
he added that the higher value of the yen which makes cars 
exported from japan more costly to american buyers was an 
important factor 
the united states is the largest market for japanese car exports 
exports to the united states in the first 10 months of fiscal 
1987 which ends in march were down 54 percent compared with a 
year earlier to 1978 million units 
total exports to the us market for fiscal 1987 will probably 
not exceed the 23 million unit quota set in japans voluntary 
export restrictions the spokesman said

firm of smith barney harris upham amp co said the 02 percent drop 
originally reported for december might be revised to show a gain

the supreme court today asked the reagan 
administration for its opinion of a ruling that states indirectly 
may tax interest paid to financial institutions from investments in 
federal home loan bank fhlb bonds 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before saying whether it will review fully a challenge to a 
maryland bank franchise tax 
the maryland national bank challenged the tax seeking a refund 
of 197310 it paid under protest to the state for the years 1979 
through 1982 
during that period the bank reported 282 million in interest 
from fhlb bonds 
the sum was included in the banks net earnings that were 
subject to marylands franchise tax which is imposed on financial 
institutions for the privilege of doing business in maryland 
the difficulty over whether earnings from fhlb bonds are taxable 
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws 
the 1932 law that created the fhlb generally exempts the bonds 
from taxes 
but a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a 
nondiscriminatory franchise tax on stocks and obligations of 
the united states government that generally are exempt from state 
and local taxes 
the maryland court of appeals upheld the state franchise tax 
ruling in october that the 1862 law takes precedence 
the state court based its ruling in part on a 1975 opinion by 
the general counsels office of the federal home loan bank board 
the state court said a franchise tax paid for the privilege of 
doing business in the state is not the same as a direct tax on a 
banks income 
the state court also said the tax does not violate the 
constitutions supremacy clause which binds states to adhere to 
federal law 
the case is maryland national bank vs state department of 
assessments 871080

fidelity investments the nations largest mutual 
fund firm today announced plans to lay off about 800 workers with 
more than 70 percent of the cuts in its boston area offices 
the company attributed the 105 percent workforce reduction to a 
slump in new stock transactions and slower money management 
business since the oct 19 stock market crash 
the layoffs to take effect immediately include 530 workers in 
greater boston about 150 in dallas and about 50 in new york said 
fidelity spokeswoman karen ernst 
the remainder of the cuts will come from other offices around 
the country she said 
the action reduces fidelitys nationwide staff to approximately 
6850 about the same number of workers employed by the firm in 
mid1987 since the early 1980s fidelity experienced significant 
growth as the economy improved 
most of the layoffs were from corporate staff department and 
volumesensitive areas such as telephone representatives and 
order takers said the corporate announcement no investment 
personnel were effected 
fidelity which operates 54 offices in the united states 
presently manages about 80 billion in assets down from a peak of 
about 85 billion in mid1987 
the company dismissed about 300 parttime and 50 filltime 
workers feb 11 including 50 in boston and 125 each in dallas and 
salt lake city 
earlier this year fidelity laid off 32 workers at investment 
centers nationwide 
among fidelitys other services include discount stock brokerage 
and institutional pension management 
eric kobern a former fidelity employee who publishes an 
independent newsletter that monitors the company predicts future 
layoffs if business does not accelerate 
this is a first step said kobern i would not be 
surprised if we see further cuts after the ira season if business 
stays at the same pace this may be the first round of cuts and 
they will digest it and see how they are doing then proceed with 
others

the supreme court agreed today to consider 
barring the us customs service from conducting drug tests for 
people seeking drugenforcement jobs setting the stage for its 
first ruling on the constitutionality of mandatory drugtesting for 
public employees 
the court said it will hear a challenge to the testing program 
by a federal workers labor union that says taking urine samples 
from employees violates their privacy rights 
the outcome will carry no direct effect on such tests conducted 
by private nongovernmental employers 
president reagan signed an executive order in 1986 calling for 
drug testing of government employees 
the transportation department with 30000 employees became the 
first cabinetlevel department to adopt random testing for civilian 
workers the program covers those in safetyrelated jobs such as 
air traffic controllers federal aviation administration pilots and 
workers with highrated security clearance 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that the 
customs service tests which are not administered randomly are 
lawful 
the appeals court said the tests may be considered searches but 
do not intrude unnecessarily on the privacy rights of workers 
because of the strong governmental interest in employing 
individuals for key positions in drug enforcement who themselves 
are not drug users and the limited intrusiveness of this 
partricular program it is reasonable and therefore is not 
unconstitutional the appeals court said 
the national treasury employees union challenged the testing 
program which requires some workers to provide urine samples in 
restroom stalls as a person overseeing the test waits outside the 
stall the tests are conducted by an independent company hired by 
the customs service 
the union said the tests are a humiliation for workers and 
are being administered indiscriminately to employees who otherwise 
are thought worthy of promotion and are not suspected of drug use 
the tests are given to those in the customs service applying for 
promotion to drugenforcement jobs and for outside applicants for 
those jobs 
the union president robert m tobias praised the high courts 
decision to hear the case saying its ruling should clarify the 
constiutional boundaries of drug testing for federal employees and 
we hope destroy reagans plans for wholesale testing of the 
federal work force 
in other action today the court 
refused to revive lawsuits charging the government and federal 
contrctors with negligently causing deaths and disease among people 
exposed to openair atomic tests 
the court without comment let stand a federal law that 
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself 
against claims seeking billions of dollars 
agreed to consider letting the federal government apply 
retroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to hospitals 
treating medicare patients 
the court said it will hear reagan administration arguments that 
some hospitals could reap a windfall from the ban on retroactive 
application of the formula 
let stand rulings that threw out a reporters attempt to force 
the state department to release documents from us embassies 
around the world 
the lawsuit by donald f goldberg a reporter on the staff of 
syndicated columnist jack anderson had been filed under the 
freedom of information act he had sought from the state department 
responses to an unclassified 1982 questionnaire on foreign 
governments diplomatic practices 
asked the reagan administration whether it thinks highstakes 
bingo games run by indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before it says whether it will review an attempt by oklahoma 
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in tulsa run by the 
muscogee creek nation 
the reagan administration said the drug tests are needed to 
prevent drug enforcement agents who used drugs from being bribed or 
blackmailed 
justice department lawyers said any affront to privacy felt 
by those applying for the affected positions is outweighed by the 
services interest in ensuring that officials responsible for the 
interdiction of drug smuggling are not themselves drug users 
customs employees are not immune from a problem that is 
ravaging the society at large the government lawyers said in 
urging the court to reject the unions appeal 
they said the tests are particularly important now because the 
customs services plans to recruit some 3000 new employees 
including many in the 18to25 age range in which use of illegal 
drugs is most prevalent 
the tests were halted in 1986 after a federal judge ruled they 
are unconstitutional and ordered them stopped 
the 5th circuit court then overruled the judge and the supreme 
court last may permitted the tests to resume 
drug testing policies also have come under legal attacks led by 
the american civil liberties union 
the case is national treasury employees union vs von raab

the number of local businesses bankruptcies 
reached an alltime high in 1987 and increased for the fifth 
consecutive year according to an accounting firms report 
there were a record 1688 bankruptcies in houston last year a 4 
percent increase from the previous year a price waterhousehouston 
study showed the small percentage increase indicates a 
stabilization of the business climate the company said 
price waterhouse said the number of bankruptcies increased by 17 
percent in 1986 and 33 percent in 1985 
we expect bankruptcies in houston to decline in 1988 said 
carol bennett senior manager and economist with price waterhouse 
such a decline would be the first we have reported since we began 
these bankruptcy analyses in 1982 
in its survey last year the company predicted houston 
bankruptcies had peaked in 1986 
retail businesses represented the largest industry segment in 
the bankruptcy figures with a 415 percent share the study said 
but the beleaguered oil and gas industry improved dramatically 
in its survival statistics showing a 53 pecent decrease in 
business failures and bankruptcy filings last year compared with 
1986 the 59 filings in the energy sector last year were the fewest 
since 1982

the possibility of a bidding war for federated 
department stores inc arose today after the nations fifthlargest 
retailer announced that another party in addition to campeau corp 
was presenting an acquisition proposal to the federated board 
federated did not identify the new bidder but said it had been 
advised that the party planned to submit a proposal that appeared 
competitive with campeaus 61 billion 68pershare bid to buy 
federated 
federateds board of directors meeting today to consider 
campeaus proposal was to consider the rival bid as well the 
retailer said 
the cincinnatibased federated which owns chains including 
bloomingdales filenes and burdines declined to say where the 
board was meeting or when it would announce a decision 
representatives of federated and campeau negotiated over the 
weekend on a merger plan however the retailer said last week 
there was no guarantee its directors would agree to a merger with 
campeau which owns store chains including jordan marsh ann taylor 
and sterns 
federated stock was up 150 to 6625 a share in late morning 
trading on the new york stock exchange today 
federated ended weeks of fending off campeaus takeover attempts 
by announcing friday that its board of directors authorized merger 
negotiations after the torontobased development company offered 
68 per share 
the directors previously rejected lower campeau offers and 
ordered managers to study alternatives to a takeover 
analysts speculated that federated decided to negotiate with 
campeau because it could not find a favored buyer to acquire the 
company or develop a restructuring plan that would pay shareholders 
what campeau was offering 
most analysts said that if an agreement was reached campeau 
probably would sell some federated divisions to help pay off the 
45 billion in debt it would incur to make the acquisition 
campeau took similar steps after acquiring allied stores corp 
in december 1986 and sold off 16 of 24 store units 
campeau has already indicated it would sell federateds 
nondepartment store operations which include gold circle discount 
stores based in columbus and ralphs supermarkets in los angeles 
it indicated it would combine headquarters operations of federated 
and allied stores 
some analysts said the cincinnatibased lazarus department store 
chain is considered among federateds weaker performing units and 
could be sold 
there have been rumors that a number of other retailers such as 
may department stores would step in and buy federated william 
smith a retail analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co said 
st louisbased may would be interested in acquiring some of 
federateds stores but they dont have to buy the whole company 
to do that 
federated had 11 billion in sales last year it operates 650 
stores nationwide its holdings also include abraham amp straus 
richs bullocks and bullocks wilshire and i magnin 
campeau said last week it would raise a substantial amount of 
equity for its proposed buyout of federated by selling the brooks 
brothers division of allied stores to britains marks and spencer 
plc for 770 million the brooks brothers sale was conditioned on 
campeau acquiring federated

a pair of connecticut entrepreneurs have 
in hand the blueprints they think will alter the popular image of 
modular homes as boxy structures that sway in the breeze 
harvey f gerber jr and his wife wendy a horgan have formed 
a company that will sell modular houses designed by an architect to 
look like and compete with the best custombuilt homes 
its a new market with few competitors 
the incentive to homebuyers is that socalled highend modular 
homes can be built at a lower cost and much faster than 
comparable stickbuilt homes that are constructed from the ground 
up gerber said 
the four styles offered by gerber builders inc are twostory 
homes with large porches 9foot ceilings family rooms multiple 
bathrooms and at least three bedrooms the houses also allow for 
personalized touches such as a choice of flooring siding and trim 
molding 
the price ranges from about 70000 to 130000 for a 
2000squarefoot house depending upon whether a buyer purchases 
an unfinished model or a completed home the price of land isnt 
included 
what we have here is a product that is aimed at a highend 
market it is going to be indistinguishable from te best 
stickbuilt homes gerber said during a recent interview 
gerber 39 and his wife are both former wall street attorneys 
they got their start in construction 10 years ago when they began 
renovating historic buildings in new york city they had branched 
out into condominium construction in new jersey when they decided 
to focus on modular homes 
they chose connecticut because of their connections to the 
state ms horgan originally from new canaan received her 
masters and law degrees from the university of connecticut gerber 
attended yale and got his law degree from fordham university 
the company has constructed a victorianstyle model on its 
11acre headquarters site in newtown an affluent suburban 
community about 70 miles north of new york city the firm is 
constructing three other models on a parcel in sussex county nj 
the completion of the model was the culmination of three years 
of design work and planning that has cost the company about 1 
million gerber said 
the companys goal is to sell at least 100 homes the first year 
and begin construction of connecticuts first modular home factory 
at the newtown site 
if all goes well ground could be broken on the proposed 
57000squarefoot factory this summer the factory would produce 
300 homes a year and the product line would be expanded to include 
lowerpriced and more expensive models along with the 
intermediatepriced models now being offered 
the gerber homes currently are constructed by contempri homes in 
taylor pa and shipped to connecticut all the gerber homes have 
been designed by deborah berke who teaches architecture at yale 
university and runs a business in new york city 
modular homes account for about 5 percent of all housing starts 
nationwide and perhaps 15 percent of new houses in the northeast 
where most modular home factories are located said barbara martin 
special projects consultant for the buildings systems council of 
the national association of home builders in washington dc 
she could name only three companies selling highend modular 
homes 
george oswald of techno craft inc another modular home 
company predicts that 50 percent of the housing starts in the 
northeast will be modular homes by the year 2000 
techno craft which opened a 100000squarefoot factory in 
mcelhattan pa last year already has about 80 million in orders 
for its luxury homes 
were the ones who broke the sound barrier by going into the 
highend modular home market oswald said 
the smallest technocraft home is 2600 square feet with its 
colonial mansion models ranging up to 7000 square feet oswald 
said the cost averages about 50 a square foot the homes are sold 
finished and are available only through developers 
gerber plans to sell to individual home buyers and small 
contractors 
his current models cost about 65 a square foot completed or 
about 130000 it would take a crew several days to assemble the 
six pieces of each model and then about three more months to 
complete the home gerber said 
to those wanting to save money the company will sell unfinished 
homes for about 35 a square foot or about 70000 for that 
price the home comes with much of the work done such as all the 
plumbing and electrical wiring run and the insulation and 
wallboard installed but an unfinished house has no roof no 
siding and the plumbing and wiring need to be hooked up 
the company also will sell kits to those more than 30 miles away 
from its newtown office 
weve gotten universal praise from every bank appraiser 
engineer contractor and prospect who has visited the house in 
newtown prior to its formal opening said gerber at the same 
time we havent had the ultimate test which is market exposure 
we cant conclusively say weve designed a hula hoop although 
thats what we believe

officials from leading cocoa producers and 
consuming countries began two weeks of talks monday on measures to 
support world prices against the background of a renewed slump in 
the market 
cocoa bean prices have declined by more than seven per cent 
since the start of the year with contracts for may delivery 
dropping the equivalent of 2640 to touch a fiveyear year low of 
995 pounds or 1751 per metric ton dealers said 
cocoa prices have been undermined by a world surplus following 
four seasons of overproduction and the ending of intervention 
buying to support the market 
intervention buying of cocoa by the 37nation international 
cocoa organization was halted indefinitely last week because 
purchases had reached the maximum 250000 tons permitted under the 
pricestabilization treaty 
dealers said that the markets weakness also reflected doubts 
whether cocoa organization members can agree on supplementary 
measures to support the market at the talks that opened monday 
the cocoa treaty allows the introduction of a stock withholding 
process to restrict supplies when intervention purchases have been 
halted 
under the procedure the organizations leading producers the 
ivory coast brazil ghana nigeria and cameroon can hold back up 
to 120000 tons of cocoa the beans would be put into storage and 
only released when prices were rising strongly 
industry sources said that although it was likely to come into 
force this week or next there were doubts whether all producers 
would operate it 
holding back cocoa will mean lost export revenue and that is 
something that some countries may not be able to afford said one 
analyst 
he noted that most of the producers are massively in debt and 
making huge interest repayments 
the talks will be complicated by a call from cocoa organization 
consumers for a cut in the support price said delegates to the 
meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity

norways labor government proposed a wage 
freeze monday in an emergency measure to put a lid on inflation 
which leaped to 87 percent last year 
the government said the freeze which also covered stock 
dividends would be temporary until economic planners can prepare a 
more comprehensive program to regulate salaries 
the second stage was due to be introduced in about two weeks and 
would keep salaries under control at least until 1989 
norways inflation rate has grown steadily over the past three 
years from 57 percent in 1985 to 72 percent in 1986 and 87 
percent last year by comparison the average rate in european in 
1986 was 38 percent according to the organization of european 
cooperation and development 
under the proposed bill prices would be controled but not 
frozen an already existing monitoring agency would be instructed 
to ensure prices were not raised unreasonably 
it was the most extreme antiinflation measure since another 
socialist government froze prices and wages ten years ago 
on saturday prime minister gro harlem brundtland said she would 
introduce the wage legislation after the national employers 
organization closed a deal with the countrys federation of trade 
unions giving workers wage increases and benefits amounting to 
roughly five percent 
the agreement affected 350000 union members in the private 
sector but the proposed wage freeze would extend the agreement to 
most of norways work force 
the bill raised a cry of protest from other unions that their 
own negotiations were cut off and superceded by a deal in which 
they had no say 
exemptions were made for teachers and nurses who have staged 
sporadic strikes over the past several weeks and who were holding 
separate pay negotiations 
although mrs brundtlands government lacks a majority in the 
157member parliament the storting the legislation was almost 
certain to win approval in a vote later this week with the likely 
support of the opposition conservative party 
mrs brundtland told a news conference the bill was designed to 
bring inflation down to the level of other european countries and 
make norways industry more competative

two financial company executives were 
sentenced to prison today for their roles in bilking mortgage 
company investors of millions of dollars 
oakland county circuit judge norman l lippitt sentenced barton 
greenberg to the maximum six years eight months to 10 years in 
prison and sentenced gary l mitchell to 16 months to three years 
in prison 
scattered applause broke out as the two former executives of 
aj obie amp associates and diamond mortgage corp were led away in 
handcuffs 
lippitt gave the two 56 days to appeal 
the pair were accused of defrauding 1600 investors of about 47 
million in what state attorney general frank kelley has termed 
michigans largest mortgage scam 
greenberg and mitchell were charged last year with 18 counts of 
securities fraud greenberg also was charged with two counts of 
obtaining money under false pretenses 
in a plea bargain arranged before trial greenberg pleaded no 
contest to one count of obtaining money under false pretenses and 
mitchell no contest to a count of securities fraud the other 
counts were dropped 
kelley has said that greenberg former board chairman of diamond 
and former obie president used corporate accounts for personal 
purposes while drawing a 1 million annual salary 
mitchell owned no stock in either company had little control 
over bank accounts and drew a 100000 annual salary kelley wrote 
lippitt in a letter last week kelley said while mitchell knew of 
two of the fraud schemes he was not the primary instigator and did 
not benefit nearly as much as greenberg 
diamond and obie were charged with arranging highrisk mortgage 
loans at abovemarket rates that obie then resold to investors 
because they had more investors than borrowers obie frequently 
gave individual mortgages to several investors diamond also was 
accused of failing to account properly for escrow money to pay 
taxes and insurance

the chairman of prudentialbache securities inc 
has agreed to a censure by the new york stock exchange for failing 
to oversee ef hutton amp co properly when he was president of that 
firm during an illicit overdrafting scheme sources familiar with 
the settlement said monday 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
the exchange determined george l ball wasnt aware of the scheme 
which was conducted in the early 1980s and played a role in 
huttons later demise but the exchange felt ball still bore some 
responsibility the sources said 
huttons former chief financial officer thomas lynch also will 
be censured and hutton must pay a 400000 fine to the exchange 
among the largest ever levied the sources said because hutton was 
acquired by shearson lehman brothers inc late last year shearson 
will pay the fine 
norman epstein a former hutton executive responsible for 
overseeing some of its operations also faced discipline by the 
exchange but reportedly has been resisting a settlement 
ball was away from his office and did not return telephone 
messages for comment but a prudentialbache official said the 
chairman agreed to the settlement in order to put the matter behind 
him 
this is the mildest form of action available to the 
exchange said the official there is no fine no restrictions 
its a censure 
the action by stock exchange investigators is regarded as 
largely inconsequential it isnt expected to have any effect on 
balls position at prudential bache 
what theyre saying is we realize and acknowledge you 
werent aware of any of the improprieties the prudential bache 
official said 
stock exchange spokeswoman sharon gamsin declined comment in 
accordance with its policy on investigations that havent been 
concluded 
shearson officials did not return calls for comment and the 
whereabouts of lynch and epstein werent clear 
shearson has said previously that in acquiring hutton it 
scrutinized the firms legal history and potential liabilities 
the exchanges investigation stemmed from a 1985 
checkoverdrafting scheme that hutton orchestrated through its 
retail brokerage network the firm earned up to 8 million in 
interest income at commercial banks by deliberately overdrawing 
checking accounts and putting the money to use elsewhere 
hutton pleaded guilty to 2000 federal fraud counts and paid a 
2 million fine in may 1985 because of the scheme which exposed 
serious management lapses at the firm and led to a chain of events 
that forced hutton to sell itself 
ball departed hutton for prudentialbache in 1982 after a 
federal probe of the overdrafting scheme had begun 
the stock exchange routinely disciplines member firms for 
violating its rules of conduct with punitive actions ranging from 
expulsions for severe infractions to fines or censure for less 
serious offenses 
previous large fines levied by the stock exchange included 
400000 against first wall street settlement in 1981 and 400000 
against bache halsey stuart shields in 1982

carlo de benedetti reached a 
partnership agreement with two belgian firms monday bringing the 
italian investor closer to gaining control of societe generale de 
belgique sa belgiums biggest holding company 
de benedetti belgian industrialist andre leysen of gevaert nv 
and pierre scohier of cobepa sa a belgian investment firm said 
they agreed to form a new holding company with 45 million or 
about 16 percent of societe generale shares 
the groups aim is to control a stake of 20 to 25 percent of 
societe generale shares scohier said 
de benedetti together with allies already claims to control 45 
percent of societe generales 282 million shares but it was 
unclear monday whether the new partnership could give him a 
majority stake in the company at the expense of an alliance of 
mainly french and belgian companies that claims 52 percent of the 
shares 
the alliance built around the french investment cie financiere 
de suez and belgiums biggest insurer groupe ag wants to keep 
societe generale which has a stake in a third of the belgian 
economy anchored in belgium 
de benedetti wants to use the 166yearold firm as a platform 
for a paneuropean holding company 
but in the deal with the two belgian companies he seemed more 
willing to let societe generale maintain its belgian identity 
de benedettis french investment firm cerus sa will have a stake 
of 55 percent in the new holding company and gevaert and cobepa 
holdings of 225 percent each 
scohier said copeba the belgian subsidiary of the french 
investment group paribas currently did not own shares of societe 
generale but that it planned to buy about 1 million he did not 
elaborate 
paribas and suez are fierce competitors on the french investment 
market and are in opposing camps in the battle of societe generale 
the three parties said in a statement the new holding company 
will ensure that societe generale will have a belgian base and 
invited other belgian as well as international investors to join 
the holding company 
societe generale has interests in some 1400 companies 
worldwide and in about half of belgiums top 50 firms it has such 
pervasive influence in the national economy that it is sometimes 
identified with belgium itself 
leysen told the west german magazine der spiegel the importance 
of societe generale was reflected in its stake in all vital 
economic sectors of belgium the energy sector gas electricity 
petroleum and belgiums largest bank 
the announcement further said that de benedetti will be 
president of the new holding company with leysen and scohier 
vicepresidents 
de benedettis insistence on having personal control over at 
least daytoday management of societe generale had been a 
stumbling block when he failed to forge a partnership with leysen 
last month 
but the statement released monday said the decisionmaking 
center of the company will remain in belgium and the essential 
interests of belgium will be preserved which had been a constant 
demand by leysen 
de benedetti said prior to mondays agreement he controlled 45 
percent while the alliance opposing him claims 52 percent 
maurice lippens managing director of belgiums groupe ag said 
on belgian rtbf radio the shareholders meeting would not be called 
to assess the size of the two factions trying to take control of 
the company 
lippens further said he and officials of the suez group which 
holds the largest single known bloc of shares within the coalition 
had met with belgiums caretaker prime minister wilfried martens 
over the weekend 
no details of the meeting were available 
the battle for control of societe generale started jan 18 when 
de benedetti announced he was seeking effective control of the 
holding company in view of the completion of the european internal 
market of 1992 
by that date the common market hopes to free all movement of 
goods services and people within the 12nation european economic 
community

the value of midwestern farmland is up 
about 7 percent from depressed 1986 levels but still is little 
more than half what it was seven years ago the federal reserve 
bank of chicago says 
the bank says its survey of about 500 agricultural bankers in 
five midwestern states shows farmland values rose 32 percent 
during the last three months of 1987 the fourth consecutive 
quarterly increase 
the reversal last year of the long downtrend in farmland 
values stems largely from the improving income trend of the 
sector said peter heffernan an analyst for the chicago bank 
net farm income in 1987 rose 20 percent from the previous years 
level said heffernan 
while much of the improvement in farmsector earnings is 
attributable to large government payments strong livestock returns 
over the past few years and sharply curtailed production expenses 
have also contributed to the sectors improved income 
performance said heffernan 
the most substantial increases in farmland values during the 
fourth quarter of 1987 were the 58 percent reported in indiana and 
49 percent in iowa the survey showed 
illinois bankers reported a 21 percent increase in farmland 
values during october november and december and wisconsin bankers 
reported a 1 percent increase 
michigan bankers said there was virtually no change from 
thirdquarter values 
heffernan said the best annual increase in farmland values was 
13 percent in iowa the others were 82 percent in indiana 72 
percent in illinois and 2 percent in michigan with no change 
reported by bankers in wisconsin 
district bankers remain optimistic regarding the farmland 
market in 1988 said heffernan the vast majority of surveyed 
bankers almost 70 percent expect farmland values in their areas 
to remain stable during the first quarter of this year 
he said 28 percent of the bankers expect farmland values to 
continue to rise this quarter while just 2 percent expect a 
decline 
even with the latest increase in farmland values the survey 
showed that they are 45 percent below their 1981 peak

futures prices for corn and soybeans were higher 
while wheat prices were mixed at the close monday in moderate to 
good volume on the chicago board of trade 
soybean prices closed near 7 cents above fridays prices 
lighter than expected delivery notices for soybeans helped 
support higher soybeans prices said jerry gidel grains analyst 
for gh miller amp co 
wheat prices were supported by import interest from the 
phillippines 175000 tons worth and talk that the soviets may be 
back in the market gidel said

the government has authorized a 3 percent 
increase in the minimum wage in march and ordered a freeze in 
official prices and the value of the peso 
the new measures announced late sunday marked the governments 
most aggressive attempt yet to rid the nation of its no 1 economic 
problem inflation 
president miguel de la madrid told a meeting of labor business 
and campesino leaders the national motto is no increase in 
prices in the month of march 
labor leader fidel velazquez worried though that merchants 
would quickly mark up their prices before tuesday the first day of 
the freeze 
prices in march are going to try to be checked but last 
night and today they have been raising them he contended late 
sunday 
the small increase in the minimum daily wage to 8000 pesos 
about 350 was a blow to velazquez and his 3 millionmember 
mexican labor federation which had been pushing for a 10 percent 
gain 
workers he said have agreed to put the interests of the 
country ahead of their own interests 
about half the nations 25 million workers are estimated to earn 
the minimum wage 
analysts calculate that the purchasing power of workers making 
the minimum pay has deteriorated to about half of what it was in 
1978 
de la madrid said he was quickening the pace of his 
inflationfighting program unveiled in middecember because fresh 
price figures showed an important deacceleration in february 
consumer prices the president predicted would rise in february 
at about half the record 155 percent of january last week the 
government announced a a gain of 87 percent in prices in the first 
half of february 
jonathan heath senior economist at the forecasting firm of 
macro asesoria economica predicted an inflation rate of about 85 
percent in february and 5 percent to 55 percent in march 
the new economic program he said appears to be successful so 
far but he added we cant look at shortrun indicators 
we want to see if it is a permanent drop and the government is 
not inducing a temporary artificial drop we want to make sure 
its a permanent onceandforall drop in inflation he said 
the government had been expected to release a target level that 
would be used starting tuesday to index wages and prices the 
indexation plan was designed as the centerpiece of the 
antiinflation program called the economic solidarity pact 
the government drew up the solidarity pact because of worries 
the nation was on the verge of hyperinflation consumer prices 
skyrocketed a record 1592 percent last year 
but in a surprise move the presidents office authorized the 
smallerthanexpected increase in the minimum wage and ordered a 
freeze on the prices of governmentregulated and controlled itms 
such products range from gasoline and electricity to tortillas and 
milk 
it also urged private companies to join in the freeze 
refraining from marking up prices to make up for higher wage costs 
moreover officials said the exchange rate for the peso will be 
held steady in march at mondays level the bank of mexico the 
nations central bank trimmed the currencys value against the 
dollar by 3 units each trading day in february 
at midday monday the peso in freemarket trading ranged from 
2300 pesos to the dollar to 2360 pesos at the private firms it 
was 22372267 on friday the free rate is used in tourism and 
border transactions 
a second rate regulated by the government was 2281 pesos to the 
dollar this rate used in about 75 percent of all commercial 
transaction stood at 2270 on friday

the supreme court on monday refused to revive 
lawsuits that charged the government and federal contractors with 
negligently causing deaths and disease among people exposed to 
openair atomic tests 
the court without comment let stand a federal law that 
effectively spared the government from having to defend itself 
against claims seeking billions of dollars 
in another case the court asked the reagan administration for 
its opinion of a ruling that states indirectly may tax interest 
paid to financial institutions from investments in federal home 
loan bank fhlb bonds 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before saying whether it will review fully a challenge to a 
maryland bank franchise tax 
in other cases dealing with economic or businessrelated issues 
the court 
agreed to decide whether the us customs service may force 
applicants for drug enforcement jobs to be tested for drugs a 
federal workers union challenged the tests calling the taking of 
urine samples from employees a humiliating invasion of privacy 
let stand rulings that warrantless searches of illinois 
racetrack employees ongrounds living quarters violate 
constitutionally protected privacy rights 
said it will decide whether employees of a pentagon 
intelligence agency are entitled to administrative hearings when 
the government fires them as security risks 
agreed to consider letting the federal government apply 
retroactively a formula that limits reimbursement paid to hospitals 
treating medicare patients the court said it will hear reagan 
administraion arguments that some hospitals could reap a windfall 
from the ban on retroactive application of the formula 
asked the reagan administration whether it thinks highstakes 
bingo games run by indian tribes are subject to state sales taxes 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before it says whether it will review an attempt by oklahoma 
officials to tax revenue from a bingo game in tulsa run by the 
muscogee creek nation 
the atmospheric nuclear tests that gave rise to the case 
involving the government and federal contractors took place between 
the closing days of world war ii and the adoption of a treaty 
between the united states and the soviet union in 1963 banning 
openair testing 
suits were filed on behalf of 29 people civilians and members 
of the military including 26 who died from cancer or 
cancerrelated causes the suits alleged that the health problems 
were caused by radioactive fallout from the explosions 
charged with negligence were the university of california which 
operated the los alamos nm project lawrence livermore 
laboratories which helped develop the atomic bomb sandia corp 
which provided engineering for the weapons program and reynolds 
electric engineering co which helped build and operate a test 
site in nevada 
the suits accused the private contractors of failing to take 
adequate safety precautions at the test sites and also said the 
government was responsible for failing to enforce its own safety 
standards 
if the suits were successful the government ultimately would 
pay the claims because it had insured the private contractors for 
any losses 
but in 1984 congress passed a law supported by the reagan 
administration that says only the us government may be sued for 
negligence allegedly caused by a private contractor in the atomic 
weapons testing program 
the result was to bar the claims since the government is immune 
from such suits unless it surrenders immunity under the existing 
federal tort claims act 
in the fhlb bond interest case the maryland national bank 
challenged the tax seeking a refund of 197310 it paid under 
protest to the state for the years 1979 through 1982 
during that period the bank reported 282 million in interest 
from fhlb bonds 
the sum was included in the banks earnings that were subject to 
marylands franchise tax which is imposed on financial 
institutions for the privilege of doing business in maryland 
the difficulty over whether earnings from fhlb bonds are taxable 
arises because of two apparently conflicting federal laws 
the 1932 law that created the fhlb generally exempts the bonds 
from taxes 
but a law enacted in 1862 permits states to levy a 
nondiscriminatory franchise tax on stocks and obligations of 
the united states government that generally are exempt from state 
and local taxes 
the maryland court of appeals upheld the state franchise tax 
ruling in october that the 1862 law takes precedence

a federal appeals court has upheld a lower court 
ruling that blamed defective design of a winchester rifle for an 
accidential firing that injured two new hampshire teenagers during 
a 1977 hunting trip 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals rejected arguments from 
the manufacturer of the rifle olin corp that a federal judge in 
new hampshire erred when he held the company liable for the 
shooting 
damages were not an issue in the appeal but the victims henry 
fortier and raymond croteau were awarded a total of 560000 as 
part of the sept 16 1986 decision by us district judge martin 
f loughlin 
fortier and croteau suffered foot wounds when a third teenager 
paul croteau stumbled and fell during the hunting trip near 
berlin nh the rifle discharged when it hit the ground and the 
bullet passed through raymond croteaus left foot then pierced 
fortiers right foot 
it could reasonably be concluded from the evidence that the 
defective design made the rifle unreasonably dangerous for the 
purpose sold to be used as a hunting weapon the appeals court 
said in a decision published thursday 
there was evidence that defendant despite its denial had a 
consumer product safety committee which was aware that there could 
be an accidental discharge caused by a hunter falling while 
carrying a rifle in a position similar to that of paul croteau on 
the day of the accident the court said 
howard b myers the new hampshire attorney who represented the 
connecticutbased company did not immediately return telephone 
calls from the associated press on monday an olin spokesman said 
he did not know if the company would appeal 
at the new hampshire trial three firearms experts who testified 
for the victims blamed the accident on the design of the winchester 
model 94 rifle a commemorative replica of the original 1866 
winchester one of them testified that because of its weight the 
firing pin was thrust forward when the rifle hit the ground and 
caused the bullet to discharge even though the gun was half cocked 
which acts as a safety on the rifle 
two of the experts testified that they had tested the rifle and 
said it would fire even when in the halfcocked position if 
rapped with a hand or a rubber mallet 
the victims also introduced evidence that olin conducted tests 
on the rifle in 1974 and 1976 to determine if it would fire when 
dropped to the ground the tests indicated that the gun fired a 
small percentage of the time 
also introduced as evidence by the victims was a 1976 letter in 
which an olin weapons engineer said it would cost between 175 and 
250 a rifle to add an additional safety 
in 1982 us repeating arms of new haven conn which had 
obtained licensing rights to the winchester name from olin 
introduced a modified version of the rifle with a lighter weight 
firing pin us repeating arms since has been purchased by another 
company

fidelity investments the nations largest mutual 
fund firm said monday it would lay off 800 workers hired to handle 
the rapid growth it enjoyed before octobers stock market crash 
the firm said it would base the need for future cuts on the pace 
investors return to mutual funds 
we will be monitoring business conditions said spokeswoman 
karen ernst we dont anticipate anymore layoffs at the moment 
but that will depend on the market 
fidelity attributed the 105 percent work force reduction to a 
slump in new stock transactions and slower money management 
business since the oct 19 crash 
also the company reported a drop in individual retirement 
accounts due to new federal laws limiting the tax deductability of 
ira contributions 
ernst said most of the dismissed fidelity workers were from 
corporate staff departments and volumesensitive jobs such as 
telephone representatives order takers and mail processers 
these were the people directly affected by a decline in new 
business she said 
approximately 530 workers were laid off in boston area offices 
with about 150 in dallas and about 50 in new york the remainder of 
the cuts are from other offices around the country 
the action reduces fidelitys nationwide staff to approximately 
6850 about the same number of workers employed by the firm in 
mid1987 fidelity operates 53 us offices and one in london 
ernst said fidelitys boston headquarters was most affected by 
the cuts since it was one of the companys largest growth areas 
during its rapid expansion 
since 1982 fidelity increased its work force fourfold to about 
7800 while assets swelled from about 19 billion to a peak of 
about 85 billion dispersed among nearly 100 funds including the 
extremely popular magellan fund 
the firm also branched to other ventures such as real estate a 
discount stock brokerage and institutional pension management 
eric kobren a former fidelity employee who publishes an 
independent newsletter that monitors the company said fidelity may 
be forced to reduce services and bring additional layoffs if 
business does not accelerate 
this is a first step said kobren i would not be 
surprised if we see further cuts after the ira season if business 
stays at the same pace this may be the first round of cuts and 
they will digest it and see how they are doing then proceed with 
others 
the company dismissed about 300 parttime and 50 fulltime 
workers feb 11 including 50 in boston and 125 each in dallas and 
salt lake city 
earlier this year fidelity laid off 32 workers at investment 
centers nationwide 
while mutual fund activity is less than onethird of last years 
bull market levels there has been a steady resurgence since the 
crash according to kathryn morrison spokeswoman for the 
washington dcbased investment company institute 
net mutual fund sales have risen from minus 58 billion in 
october to 18 billion in january she said the figures reflect 
total sales minus redemptions said morrison 
morrison said there are approximately 2000 funds available 
in money market accounts nationwide total assets have risen 
from 2413 billion in september to about 280 billion in january 
theres 40 billion on the sidelines now waiting to see what 
happens with the market said morrison theres no shortage of 
assets out there its just not in mutual funds like before

union flight attendants for northwest 
airlines were told by teamsters officials monday that a company 
proposal to delay the promotion of bscale workers to the 
higherpaid ascale bracket is the only major issue separating the 
two sides in contract talks 
about 150 of the companys 6700 flight attendants were informed 
of the situation at a rally at a teamsters office less that two 
miles away from the corporations headquarters 
an 11 pm friday strike deadline passed without a settlement in 
talks aimed at bring former republic airlines employees and their 
northwest counterparts under one contract the employees have been 
working under separate contracts since northwest acquired republic 
in the fall of 1986 
talks broke down saturday at dawn after an allnight bargaining 
session with a federal mediator but flight attendants have not 
been called on to strike and the company has not exercised its 
right to impose a contract on the flight attendants 
jeff musto a spokesman for the teamsters said monday that no 
talks have been held since saturday and none are scheduled 
were still on red alert to strike musto we want to keep 
the company guessing 
as musto explained the one major issue left unresolved in the 
negotiations are wages which are governed under a twotiered scale 
all northwest flight attendant were paid under one scale before 
a 1982 contract created the b scale all new employees hired since 
then have started as bscale employees at rates of pay lower than 
the old system musto said 
but the 1982 contract called for bscale employees to jump to 
ascale levels in their sixth year of employment the company has 
proposed extending that wait until the ninth year of employment 
musto said 
for the average flight attendant that would mean a loss of 
16776 over the three years musto said 
the company said the hourly wages it has proposed for the flight 
attendants would make them the secondhighest paid in the industry 
musto said he agrees with that assessment but he added that the 
union has a commitment to flight attendants hired under the bscale 
not to break our promise that they would be promoted to the 
ascale in their sixth year 
they could see light at the end of the tunnel musto said 
now all of a sudden the company is dangling the carrot out in 
front of them a little further 
about a third of the companys flight attendants are at the 
bscale level musto said by delaying their promotion to ascale 
the majority of flight attendants would be under the bscale when 
it is time to negotiate the next contract 
then the company could win support for cutting the wages of 
ascale flight attendants because ascale employees would be in the 
minority musto said 
under northwests latest contract offer base pay for senior 
flight attendants would be about 3518 an hour based on a 78hour 
work month about half of what most americans work that would 
increase to 3660 an hour by may 1 1991 the company said 
william wren said a large number of senior flight attendants 
make more than 40000 a year plus meal payments when theyre 
working 
most entrylevel flight attendants are making about 15000 a 
year wren said 
the chief negotiator for the flight attendants william genoese 
was denied a request monday to meet with steven rothmeier chairman 
and chief executive officer of the airline musto said 
there was no further word monday on whether pilots and mechanics 
at northwest would honor picket lines by the flight attendants 
officials from the unions representing pilots and mechanics have 
said they will wait to make a decision 
wren has said the mechanics are barred from sympathy strikes 
under their contract and pilots are barred from sympathy strikes 
under the railway labor act 
wren said the company was operating under its normal flight 
schedule monday about 2000 nonunion flight attendants are on 
call to fill in if a strike is called he has said

american telephone amp telegraph co said monday 
it will make sure that its widely used unix operating system the 
internal traffic cop of computers is readily available to all the 
computer hardware companies that want to use it 
some major computer companies had charged that atampt was playing 
favorites by giving early information about future versions of unix 
to sun microsystems inc a silicon valley maker of engineering 
workstations that is a close partner of atampt 
people have had a big misconception about what the nature of 
the agreement has been bill klinger an atampt executive in charge 
of unix product management said in an interview 
klinger said it would be a mistake for atampt to play favorites 
because that would delay the spread of unix an operating system 
that is used mainly for scientific and engineering work 
motorola inc said monday that the londonbased unisoft group 
working closely with atampt would work to make sure that unix runs 
on computers that contain microprocessors made by motorola 
combined with atampts support this will ensure motorolas 
customers the same full and timely access as early as any 
competitive architecture gary tooker motorolas chief operating 
officer said in a news release 
motorola claims that 80 percent of all unixbased computer 
programs run on computers containing its microprocessors 
motorolas goal is to have programs run without modification on 
any computer that uses one of its microprocessors

american express chairman james d robinson 
iii on monday suggested creation of a new international financial 
organization to help ease the debt crisis of developing nations by 
buying their loans 
robinson in remarks prepared for a meeting of the overseas 
development council said the organization which he named the 
institute of international debt and development would buy 
outstanding third world loans at a discount 
one possibility he suggested would be for the loans to be 
acquired at about 60 percent of face value 
the organization would then offer the banks which had held the 
loans new longterm highquality obligations including bonds 
and certain forms of stock robinson suggested 
i hope it the proposal will at least serve as a catalyst to 
start an active dialogue he said he said new approaches were 
needed because the risk of a debt crisis still hovers over the 
fianancial markets 
under robinsons proposal the new organization would oversee 
and manage many facets of refinancing of loans owed by latin 
american and other developing nations 
total third world debt now stands at about 12 trillion 
however robinsons proposal would be targeted to some 250 billion 
owed to commercial banks by developing governments 
because the plan involves purchase of outstanding loans at a 
discount it would involve partial writeoffs of the loans 
such an approach has been a part of some previous proposals 
including those advanced by sen bill bradley rnj and rep 
john lafalce dny but long opposed by the reagan administration 
instead the administration favors instead a rival plan by 
treasury secretary james a baker iii that calls for new lending to 
developing countries on a nationbynation basis both by 
international organizations like the world bank and by commercial 
banks 
but robinson said the casebycase approach has bought time 
and set the stage for a solution but many believe it has not 
helped the developing country debt problem get much better 
robinson long has been active in international financial matters 
and he had previously advanced earlier versions of his proposal for 
a new international debt agency 
he said the new agency should be a joint venture of the world 
bank and the international monetary fund and that major industrial 
nations would provide startup capital for the organization 
totaling about 125 billion 
under the existing formula by which the united states 
contributes 20 percent to the funds of the imf this would result 
in a us share of about 25 billion 
the current strategy of casebycase negotiations has so 
far held a crisis at bay but it has not brought with it 
adequate resources to support sustained growth in developing 
economies robinson said

gold prices tumbled monday in europe but 
rebounded sharply in new york based on a stunning rally in 
platinum that traders ascribed to fear of unrest in south africa a 
leading producer of precious metals 
the dollar vacillated in a narrow range in sluggish foreign 
exchange transactions reflecting what brokers called the lack of 
economic news and a typical trading slowdown at months end 
european gold traders sold the metal aggressively based on an 
underlying fear that gold was becoming a less attractive investment 
because of evidence of eased inflation 
in london gold fell 650 a troy ounce from friday levels to 
425 and in zurich it fell 550 an ounce to 426 earlier in hong 
kong gold was down about 15 cents to 43019 
later in new york gold recovered the loss and by 4 pm 
republic national bank of new york quoted gold at 43050 a troy 
ounce up from 42950 friday on the new york commodity exchange 
gold bullion for current delivery was quoted at 43050 an ounce 
up 90 cents 
the one word to explain it was platinum said john norris a 
precious metals analyst at citibank in new york we saw a sharp 
rally in platinum based on continued unrest in south africa and 
that helped firm gold prices

all dialaporn telephone messages would be 
placed under one exchange and customers would be allowed to block 
all calls to that exchange at no charge under a plan announced 
monday by new york telephone co 
it will give parents a means of preventing their children from 
calling these companies company spokesman steve marcus said of 
the plan which has been proposed to the state public service 
commission 
the proposal is similar to plans now being implemented elsewhere 
around the country as phone companies have sought legal ways to 
pull the plug on sexually explicit telephone dialup messages 
new york telephone proposed that adult messages be grouped under 
the 970 exchange customers in the new york metropolitan calling 
area could control how their phones are used by having the phone 
company block that exchange 
the metropolitan calling area includes area codes 212 718 516 
and part of 914 calls from other points in the state to the 970 
exchange would be blocked automatically the company said 
customers would also have the option of blocking all calls to 
group bridging services numbers which allow several customers to 
participate in the same conversation 
there would be no charge for ordering the block for 90 days 
after the plan becomes effective march 11 if the psc approves 
after that residence customers would pay 5 for instituting the 
block and business customers 10 
currently adult messages and other mass announcement services 
are spread over the 540 550 970 and 976 exchanges the phone 
company supplies the lines but does not control the content 
new york telephone has about 42 million residential customers 
in the metropolitan area about 26 percent of them would require a 
number change to implement a block because not all exchanges have 
the updated switching equipment required for the move those 
needing a number change would be given it free of charge the 
company said

stop amp shop cos inc announced monday it has 
agreed to be acquired in a 123 billion leveraged buyout by the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts inc but dart group corp 
said the news will not deter its attempt to gain control of the 
retailer 
stop amp shop said a kohlberg kravis subsidiary ssc holdings 
corp will purchase at least 66 percent of the 28 million 
outstanding stop amp shop shares at 44 each 
if all outstanding stock were purchased the leveraged buyout 
would total 123 billion in a leveraged buyout investors borrow 
heavily to buy out a company and then pay off the debt with the 
target companys cash flow or the sale of its assets 
dart which launched the hostile takeover bid in january 
extended until march 9 an offer of 37 a share for all outstanding 
stop amp shop stock and indicated it planned to go ahead with a proxy 
fight to replace stop amp shop directors later this month 
dart spokesman jeffrey gast said the landover mdbased firm 
planned to continue the cash tender offer past march 9 on a day to 
day basis 
however harry wells an analyst at adams harkness amp hill in 
boston said it was unlikely dart could match the 44 a share offer 
i think its over said wells youve got to be able to 
support the debt with some level of safety and 44 is about 
as much as one can reasonably afford to pay for stop amp shop 
stop amp shop has rejected as inadequate darts 103 billion 
offer and filed suit in federal court seeking to block dart 
a countersuit filed by dart claiming stop amp shop illegally 
withheld corporate information was rejected last week by us 
district court judge rya zobel who ordered that the suit must be 
filed in state courts 
dart which purchased nearly 730000 shares through its 
jefferson acquisition corp subsidiary announced feb 26 it 
received approval from at least 10 percent of stop amp shop 
shareholders to call a special shareholders meeting on march 30 
at the meeting dart wants to remove the stop amp shop board and 
replace it with jefferson nominees 
under the deal with kohlberg kravis stop amp shop said it will 
retain its present management and remain based in braintree 
the sale which must be approved by a majority of stop amp shop 
shareholders and the securities and exchange commission is 
expected to commence on or before march 4 stop amp shop said 
kohlberg kravis has received a financing commitment from 
manufacturers hanover trust co the retailer said 
other companies reportedly have been interested in stop amp shop 
including thomas h lee co of boston and riordan freeman amp 
spogli inc of los angeles 
stop amp shop has 113 supermarkets and 169 bradlees in 12 states 
in the northeast 
the companys stock has gone up more than 25 a share since dart 
first announced its takeover intent in january it rose 87 cents a 
share in new york stock exchange trading monday closing at 4350 
dart is known for a series of unsuccessful but profitable bids 
to gain control of other companies and its chairman herbert haft 
and president robert haft have acquired reputations as corporate 
raiders 
in its most recent bid dart dropped an attempt for 
minneapolisbased dayton hudson corp following the october stock 
market crash 
other dart takeover attempts include a 1986 bid for safeway co 
and supermarkets general last year 
kohlberg kravis which acquired safeway following the failed 
dart bid has conducted about 33 leveraged buyouts since forming in 
1976 including a 62 billion deal that took beatrice cos private 
in 1986 
last week kohlberg kravis acquired new yorkbased seaman 
furniture co for 350 million in july 1987 the firm obtained 
control of jim walter co a florida construction material 
manufacturer

pittsburgharea residents should wake up if 
theyre still dreaming that empty steel plants will come back to 
life say city planners from an international architecture 
conference 
youve got to face reality theyre gone said tony mcgann 
whose hometown of liverpool england lived through the decline of 
dockyard industries if you wait for the steel industry to come 
back youll wait forever 
the planning team 12 americans and five britons toured 
monongahela valley communities whose economies have been gutted by 
the decline of steelmaking they addressed about 100 mon valley 
residents saturday in homestead and released a report monday 
suggesting how the oncethriving steel centers of homestead 
duquesne and mckeesport could recover 
the planners effort was organized by the american institute of 
architects a sponsor of this weeks remaking cities conference in 
pittsburgh britains prince charles an advocate of better city 
planning is scheduled to address the conference saturday 
plants last operated by usx corp in homestead a river gateway 
to pittsburgh could be leveled and replaced by fiveacre flower 
plots like those featured in european garden festivals the 
planners recommended 
we cant use all the land at once but if it looked green it 
would be easier to sell said team leader john clarke of trenton 
nj 
the planners envision turning one old ironmaking blast furnace 
into a museum developing the riverbank as a yacht landing and 
perhaps within a decade building luxury riverfront homes 
its the greening of industrial america british architect 
richard burton said 
it sounds innovative anyway most of us around here though 
were looking for things that were going to create more jobs said 
robert anderson a founder of homesteads rainbow kitchen which 
feeds about 100 unemployed people per day and distributes groceries 
as needed to about 600 households 
at its peak about 15000 workers were employed at the homestead 
plant the last steel was rolled in may 1986 
few white knights are likely to ride into the mon valley and 
bring thousands of jobs at once the report said 
the report recommended that a former usx plant site at 
mckeesport be used for sports events a giant flea market a 
discount sales center and a factory outlet 
its better than using it for a warehouse it would employ 
people and bring activity to downtown mckeesport clarke said 
duquesne seems best suited as a center for recycling trash or 
converting it to energy the report said 
homestead councilwoman betty esper and mike stout a member of 
the steel valley authority and tristate conference on steel were 
among the town meeting speakers who said steel plants should not be 
redeveloped so quickly because the industry might need them again 
you have to move forward this is like a lingering divorce 
that until it is finally settled is very painful and even after 
its settled will be painful said architect michael swartler of 
new york 
longstanding dependence on one industry has left mon valley 
communities with little experience in developing their economies 
clarke said 
we have heard from mayors who dont know what role they play 
in development of the sites he said our work is an 
illustration of how to embark on that process

sears roebuck and co plans a major management 
overhaul in its retail division but will not reveal what the 
restructuring will include until the changes are described to the 
companys headquarters staff a sears spokesman said monday 
philo holland the companys national public affairs manager 
said sears merchandise group officials would meet with employees in 
chicago this week to discuss the restructuring which will take 
place over the next several years 
holland said he could neither confirm nor deny a report in 
crains chicago business that the nations largest retailer planned 
to transform its 27 merchandise buying groups into independent 
business units and lay off some headquarters personnel 
we need to hold these meetings this week with our own people 
to lay out the plans he said i cant confirm or deny the 
crains report until were able to talk to our employees for them 
to read it in the newspaper before we tell it to them would be 
inappropriate 
crains a weekly newspaper reported in its editions out monday 
that sears planned the overhaul because of sluggish sales and 
profits 
quoting a sears source it did not name crains said the company 
planned significant workforce reductions among its headquarters 
personnel through layoffs or attrition 
while holland declined comment on the companys future plans he 
said there will not be any layoffs announced this week 
crains reported that as part of the restructuring sears would 
reorganize buying groups for every product line and scrap its past 
policy of using one management structure for each unit 
the company also plans to analyze the competitiveness of each 
product line from hard goods like washing machines to soft goods 
like fashion to see if its profits are at an acceptable level in 
individual areas 
while wall street analysts said they did not know what sears 
executives had in mind they said the company could be trying to 
reposition itself in the retail industry as well as cut costs 
theyve been an underperforming group for the company said 
karen sack an analyst with standard amp poors corp of the sears 
merchandise group theyve turned in a really mediocre 
performance and its a difficult retail market for at least 1988 
theyre going to have to do something to become more flexible 
and responsive to the changes in whats going to be a very 
lackluster sales environment she said 
monroe h greenstein an analyst with bear stearns amp co inc 
said sears has been considering a shift toward more fashion 
retailing 
he added theyre trying to get rid of some of the fat 
crains also reported that sears would promote three executives 
to newly created management positions to oversee the restructuring 
but holland said that step was not planned

unemployment in japan fell to a seasonallyadjusted 
27 percent in january from 30 percent a year earlier but was up 
01 percentage point from the previous month the government 
announced tuesday 
the number of job holders rose during the oneyear period by 
112 million to 5828 million an increase of 19 percent 
according to the statistics bureau of the prime ministers office 
bureau officials said the number of people employed rose sharply 
in the latter half of the year as the economy recovered from the 
effects of the higher value of the japanese yen the strong yen 
curbed overseas sales and earnings and forced japanese 
manufacturers particularly shipbuilders and steelmakers to slash 
production and manpower 
after hitting a record 32 percent last may japans 
unemployment rate has drifted lower as manufacturers adjusted to 
the high yen 
japans unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by us 
and european methods 
in japan members of the armed forces and people who worked more 
than one hour during the last week of the month are counted as 
employed in the united states military personnel are not included 
in the work force and those who work less than 15 hours a week are 
considered unemployed
