the communist party agreed to 
withdraw 90 to 100 of its deputies before the month is out to 
become a minority party ending 41 years of communist dominance in 
parliament a civic forum spokesman said friday 
spokesman petr pithart told journalists the agreement came late 
thursday at negotiations among the communists the civic forum 
opposition movement and other political parties 
the communists now hold more than 200 of the 350 seats in 
parliament 
the remaining seats are held by members of parties that in the 
past were allied with the communists but have become increasingly 
independent and by some nonparty members 
negotiators agreed that parliamentary elections will be held 
june 8 
pithart said it has been agreed that all the vacant seats 
will be available to nonparty members and candidates will be 
proposed by the civic forum in the czech lands and public against 
violence in slovakia 
civic forum and public against violence are sister 
organizations they represent a loose grouping of reformist forces 
and opposition groups in czechoslovakia trying to eliminate 
communist domination in political life 
the concession was the latest by the communists here in the past 
two months following revolutionary changes that led to 
establishment of a coalition government not dominated by communists 
pithart said the talks produced consensus on rough principles 
of the new parliamentary elections 
among them 
every party that wants to run its candidates in the 
elections must have at least 1oooo members or enough 
signatures to total 10000 with the deadline for registering 
midapril 
each party will have to obtain a minimum 5 percent of the 
national vote to have a deputy in parliament 
all these measures represent a way of preventing minute 
parties from getting into parliament all the participants agreed 
on the need for a strong government based on the new parliament and 
that small parties could endanger the future coalition 
the elections will take place on the principle of 
proportionate representation in 12 districts roughly identical 
with the present regional structure in czechoslovakia 
the state will reimburse campaign costs based on the number of 
seats won

the newly appointed director of the citys board 
of ethics resigned thursday after it was disclosed he had been 
named in a lawsuit for alleged violations of louisiana campaign 
financing regulations 
gary m oneill who served about a month as executive director 
of the chicago board of ethics was accused of violating louisiana 
regulations while helping that states commissioner of insurance 
doug green finance his successful 1987 election campaign 
in his resignation letter oneill said he was quitting his job 
as head of the agency that enforces the citys ethics and financial 
disclosure laws because of my failure to disclose the fact that i 
was named in a civil complaint filed by the louisiana ethics 
commission 
at no time has there been any finding of civil or criminal 
wrongdoing his letter said 
oneill said he did not want his failure to discuss the matter 
when he was being interviewed for the job to reflect adversely on 
the board or the work to be done 
after submitting his resignation oneill said it is 
unfortunate that people who aspire to public office have things 
happen in their lives that do come back to be a cloud over their 
head 
johnnie dewilde the ethics boards current deputy director was 
appointed acting executive director effective immediately the 
board announced 
oneill resigned one day after the morning advocate a baton 
rouge la newspaper revealed that he had been named as a 
defendant in a lawsuit by the louisiana board of ethics for elected 
officials 
the lawsuit accuses green of attempting to conceal the true 
source of 22 million in contributions to greens 1987 campaign 
the lawsuit said the campaign funds went from oneill and others 
to a company controlled by the head of a nowdefunct insurance 
agency the insurance agency champion insurance co was regulated 
by greens office 
the states lawsuit was thrown out of a state district court in 
baton rouge last year when the ethics boards enforcement 
provisions were declared unconstitutional by a state judge a 
rehearing of the issue is pending before the louisiana supreme 
court 
oneill 38 had a successful law practice and was active in 
louisiana politics he said he has been traveling extensively since 
he left baton rouge on may 1 and did not keep in contact with his 
law practice or state affairs 
the morning advocate said he dropped out of sight last spring 
shortly before his law firms chief client champion was placed in 
courtordered liquidation 
the disclosure about the lawsuit against oneill surprised 
chicago officials 
if we had known about the allegations against mr oneill we 
would not have hired him as executive director albert hofeld 
the ethics boards chairman said thursday 
its not that we think hes done anything wrong but it places 
a cloud over the ethics board 
oneill said he did not mention the louisiana ethics case during 
his interview for the chicago job because he considered the matter 
concluded 
i didnt try to keep any information from them at all he 
said

former president richard m nixon mixed a little 
football and foreign affairs during a visit thursday to the miami 
project to cure paralysis and praised patients for their courage 
and tenacity 
nixon a strong supporter of the project and longtime friend of 
its founder nick buoniconti spoke with paralyzed patients working 
on stateoftheart equipment during a 30minute tour of the 
facility located at the university of miamis jackson memorial 
center 
nixon a frequent visitor to miami during his presidency with a 
compound in nearby key biscayne and close ties to south florida 
banker charles g bebe rebozo appeared relaxed he smiled 
asked questions and expressed admiration for those left paralyzed 
from spinal cord injuries 
buoniconti and his son marc who was left a quadriplegic after 
being injured in 1985 during a college football game were among 
those showing nixon the worldrenowned facility 
sometimes all of us feel lifes a little tough nixon told 
reporters later we have some problems disappointments whenever 
you get discouraged you should think of these people its 
been an inspiration to me to go through this facility 
on other matters the former president called the recent lifting 
of martial law in china an important symbolic step that can have 
a significant effect in the future 
theres no question in my mind this will be followed by other 
steps he said it indicates the chinese dont want to be left 
outside of the world community 
he had no comment about ousted panamanian gen manuel noriega 
who is in miami awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges but 
nixon noted that getting noriega out of panama was the easy part 
now the difficult part comes in rebuilding the central american 
country 
on changes in eastern europe nixon said technological 
developments in communication had played a significant role in 
releasing the forces of revolt 
four years ago you had to go under borders and across 
borders now you go over borders and theres no stopping the 
flow of information he said 
on cuba and the effects of upheaval in eastern europe and 
panama no question if i were in castros place id be 
concerned nixon said 
nixon who says he still visits south florida occasionally 
heaped accolades on nick buoniconti a friend since 1972 when he 
was a linebacker with the super bowl champion miami dolphins

was presented with a football autographed by the projects doctors 
and scientists hes made a difference now in a much bigger way

injuries each year there are about 10000 new injuries the miami 
prject was founded in 1985 and serves as a research center as well

a study of 643 people killed in new york city 
traffic accidents shows that 182 percent had used cocaine within 
48 hours of the accident 
of those 643 bloodalcohol and cocaine tests were available for 
378 drivers and 56 percent had used one or both 
this will be a national problem the lead researcher dr 
peter m marzuk said thursday i think if you looked at driver 
fatalities in other large cities you might find relatively 
comparable results 
marzuk and colleagues at cornell university medical college in 
new york city and at the new york city medical examiners office 
looked at records on all 905 traffic fatalities of passengers or 
drivers from 1984 through 1987 the study excluded fatalities 
involving pedestrians bicyclists or people getting out of vehicles 
appropriate autopsy findings were available for 643 of the 
fatally injured drivers and passengers and 182 percent showed 
evidence of cocaine use within 48 hours before the accident the 
researchers reported in fridays journal of the american medical 
association 
among the drivers 70 percent of the 643 the prevalence of 
cocaine use was 20 percent of the drivers ages 16 to 45 the 
prevalence was 243 percent the researchers wrote 
thats high thats the highest ive seen said steven gust 
a research psychologist with the national institute on drug abuse 
in rockville md 
previous studies have found prevalences ranging from 3 percent 
to 11 percent he said in a telephone interview adding that 
regional differences in cocaine use exist and new york is one of 
the highestuse cities 
bloodalcohol tests were available for only 378 of the drivers 
killed and of those 56 percent showed evidence of cocaine or 
alcohol or both in their bodies the study said 
by assuming all 262 fatalities excluded from the study were 
cocaine free the most conservative estimate of overall cocaine use 
would have been 141 percent the researchers said but they 
believe their results underestimated prevalence because some 
individuals who had used low doses of cocaine might have gone 
undetected 
the authors cautioned that their findings do not prove cocaine 
use caused accidents 
it could be that cocaine users are lousy drivers and it 
may have nothing to do with cocaine marzuk said in a telephone 
interview 
however the study said there are several reasons to suggest 
that cocaine might compromise driving ability 
minutes after cocaine administration users report feeling 
hyperalert and euphoric but can also report aggressiveness 
irritability psychotic distortions and a tendency toward greater 
risktaking it said 
several hours to days after using the drug addicts report 
feeling edgy anxious confused andor sleepy it added 
to offset some of cocaines unpleasant effects many users 
resort to sedatives most often alcohol the researchers wrote 
its still true by far that alcohol is the most important 
contributor to motor vehicle fatalities marzuk said but many 
cocaine users especially crack users are alcoholics 
he called for further study of the effects of cocaine and 
alcohol on driving and the authors said screenings of injured 
accident victims could lead to identifying people in need of drug 
treatment 
however such screening would be difficult said robert 
borkenstein past president of the international committee on 
alchol drugs and traffic safety 
the trouble is that there are so many variations of drugs 
they all have different pharmacological effects he said in a 
telephone interview from indiana adding that addicts to 
amphetamines and cocaine develop a tolerance to the drugs to a much 
greater degree than people do to alcohol 
people are not alike as far as their response to alcohol is 
concerned the retired indiana university professor said but 
it is much closer than for any other drug

redoubt volcanos tantrums have not 
been as destructive as mount st helens but they have interrupted 
oil production and international travel and closed schools for 
thousands of youngsters 
earlier this week 10000 face masks were distributed to 
residents of the central kenai peninsula worried about inhaling the 
fine volcanic ash gritty highly abrasive bits of pulverized lava 
that the volcano has blown as high as eight miles into the 
atmosphere 
the quake activity indicates the volcano is relatively quiet 
for now and it does not appear to be building toward stronger 
eruptive activity geologist steve brantley of the alaska volcano 
observatory said wednesday still a major eruption like last 
mondays is possible he said 
theres no telling how long the seismic activity will continue 
and the mountain could spew ash intermittently for years brantley 
said 
mount st helens in washington state erupted explosively in may 
1980 levelling hundreds of square miles of forest blowing ash so 
high into the atmosphere it circled the globe killing 57 people 
and causing over 3 billion in damage 
redoubt which roared back to life dec 14 after 25 years of 
quiet is not only smaller but also more remote sitting 115 miles 
southwest of anchorage 
but it still has the power to disrupt commerce and everyday life 
redoubts threat forced the closure tuesday of the drift river 
oil storage terminal 20 miles from the volcano and much of the 
cook inlet offshore oil field that the facility serves 
the terminal with 38 million gallons of oil in its tanks sits 
near the drift river which has overflowed with water from snow and 
glaciers melted by redoubts internal heat the river flooded 
extensively during the volcanos last eruption 
the affected fields contributed much of the 233 million in 
royalties alaska collected last year from cook inlet production 
said said chuck logsden a petroleum economist with the department 
of revenue 
because the airborne ash threatens aircraft engines traffic at 
anchorage international airport came to a virtual halt shortly 
before christmas stranding hundreds of passengers and christmas 
mail deliveries and was patchy after another eruption jan 2 
redoubts ash shut down all four engines on a klm royal dutch 
airlines 747 and the big jet glided from 25000 to 12000 feet in 
12 minutes before the crew could get the engines restarted 
although recent ash eruptions have spared air routes leading to 
anchorage some international carriers that used anchorage as a 
refueling stop continue to divert planes elsewhere 
the diversions are being felt in the city where airline crews 
stay in hotels and shop 
it is during december and january that hotels are most 
appreciative of the airline business said forest j paulson 
general manager of the sheraton anchorage hotel alaska gets few 
tourists during the winter 
there is concern that international carriers that rerouted 
because of the volcano will find the alternative refueling stops 
desirable and stick with them since redoubt came to life soviet 
officials have been opening siberian routes more readily than 
before said jon ungar controller for the alaska international 
airport system 
even on the ground street traffic on the central kenai 
peninsula is affected by the ash 
weve had a lot of requests for filter changes said lewis 
fowler manager of toms automotive in soldotna engine problems 
and autobody corrosion are among the foremost concerns he said 
health problems have been not been overwhelming but they 
include nosebleeds among people who work outdoors and an increase 
in respiratory ailments among the elderly said dr george garnett 
a health adviser to kenai peninsula borough 
the ash is like finely broken glass garnett said 
microscopically it is actually harder than glass he said 
inhalation can result in tiny internal cuts that create irritation 
school closures in effect at least through thursday affected 
more than 5000 students partly for health reasons and partly to 
keep the dusty grit outside 
on the other hand the tourism industry sees a potential ray of 
economic sunshine 
weve been talking about the fact that there are some tour 
companies that might see redoubt as an attraction come see the 
little volcano that did said keith fernandez marketing 
director for the anchorage convention and visitors bureau 
i wouldnt be surprised if some enterprising business said 
yeah i bet i could make it work

antiabortion groups intend to project a more moderate image 
this year as they lobby state legislatures in the aftermath of the 
supreme courts webster decision but they will face reenergized 
opposition not just from prochoice groups but from their own 
movements hardliners 
with public opinion polls showing a majority of americans in 
favor of legalized abortion some antiabortion groups have scaled 
back their goals to restrictions they believe are publicly 
acceptable 
those measures including bills banning abortion as a form of 
birth control and requiring minors to get parents permission for 
an abortion will face legislators in most states when 1990 
sessions begin this month 
virtually every legislature that is meeting this year will 
consider some form of abortion legislation and it will be a major 
issue in many states including alabama illinois maryland 
michigan new hampshire north carolina oklahoma rhode island and 
virginia 
this issue is the most controversial issue any legislature 
will deal with in the next decade said alabama state sen chip 
bailey who opposes abortion 
alabamas legislature will consider two bills aimed at banning 
abortion as a means of birth control leaving it legal only in 
certain cases antiabortion groups already are battling over what 
those exceptions should be one sign of a rift that seems to be 
growing 
one group alabama citizens for life supports a bill that would 
allow abortions in four instances rape incest when a womans 
life is in danger or when a pregnancy would produce an infant with 
profound or irremediable deformities 
but another group the alabama prolife coalition opposes 
abortion in cases involving deformities legislators are cught in 
the middle and not happy to be there 
if i had any advice id say to the people interested in this 
to get together and decide on legislation that might get through 
the legislature said house judiciary committee chairman gj 
dutch higgenbotham 
the alabama split mirrors a national debate about the direction 
of the antiabortion movement which has been stung by a strong 
prochoice backlash in the six months since the supreme court 
upheld missouris abortion law 
some groups remain zealously committed to fighting abortion in 
all forms while others such as the national right to life 
committee are now willing to compromise 
burke balch state legislative coordinator for national right to 
life said the group is only supporting legislation that has 
strong support in the polls 
we think were putting forth legislation that stands a good 
chance of being upheld by the current supreme court and that is 
legislation that doesnt outright ban abortion but bans some of the 
more egregious forms he added 
more radical antiabortion groups believe there can be no 
compromise in an issue with such strong religious and moral 
overtones 
brian young director of model legislation for the hardline 
american life league conceded there was perhaps a difference of 
opinion among antiabortion groups 
young said his group would continue to fight all abortions i 
think youll find among the grass roots a sentiment that we dont 
abandon some classes of babies out of political expediency he 
said 
prochoice advocates tend to dismiss such distinctions and 
recoil at the notion of moderate antiabortion legislation 
all of the antichoice legislation is extremist said 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league there is nothing moderate in any of these 
campaigns they all are aimed at undoing this right 
to strike back prochoice advocates are proposing legislation 
in at least five states illinois michigan maryland new 
hampshire and ohio that would guarantee a womans right to an 
abortion 
they also are taking the battle to court and won an early 
victory thursday when a federal judge blocked sections of 
pennsylvanias tough new abortion law from going into effect those 
sections require women to notify their husbands and wait 24 hours 
before having abortions 
most of the action around the country is being propelled by the 
antiabortion movement however 
in michigan the hottest item on the legislative agenda is a 
bill to require minors to get approval from at least one parent 
before getting an abortion 
according to groups that track abortion legislation at least 
eight other states will consider bills to require parental consent 
or notification they are hawaii illinois louisiana missouri 
new jersey virginia washington and wisconsin 
at least seven will consider legislation to ban public funding 
of abortion california hawaii illinois minnesota missouri new 
mexico and west virginia 
and at least nine states will consider legislation to outlaw 
abortion as a form of birth control they are alabama california 
idaho indiana kentucky minnesota mississippi missouri and 
tennessee 
indiana minnesota north carolina oklahoma and virginia are 
expected to take up bills that mirror the missouri law that the 
supreme court upheld last july 3 that law bans abortions in public 
hospitals and stops public employees from counseling women about 
abortion among other things 
the court is still considering the legality of parental consent 
laws in ohio and minnesota but it has not yet taken up a case that 
poses a direct threat to roe vs wade the 1973 decision that 
required states to legalize abortion 
for now balch said the national right to life committee has 
set aside its goal of getting legislation passed that directly 
challenges roe what the group wants he said is not an outright 
assault on roe but a very substantial modication of it 
that goal is not universally shared young said the american 
life leagues goal is to get a case to the court that will 
challenge roe vs wade directly 
speaking about abortion in general young added its going to 
be at this point a highly politicized issue and its no secret 
a very emotional very hot issue its something thats not 
going to be decided in one year its going to go on and on

an official of the largest 
antisandinista bloc says it has yet to receive a penny of 9 
million approved by the us congress in october to help in its 
political campaign and time is running out 
antonio lacayo of the 14party united national opposition uno 
accused the leftist sandinista government of dragging its feet to 
release money that was meant to train poll watchers for the feb 25 
election just six weeks away 
if for lack of funds these programs cannot take place its 
impossible for us to say that these elections are free and 
honest lacayo unos campaign manager said thursday 
he said without a uno representative at each of the 4394 
polling stations nationwide the opposition will not be able to 
effectively monitor voting in the general elections and watch out 
for possible fraud 
unos presidential candidate publisher violeta barrios de 
chamorro is president daniel ortegas main rival in his bid for 
reelection nicaraguans also will choose a national assembly and 
municipal governments 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said wednesday it was 
troublesome that some of the 9 million the united states sent 
to help the opposition has been held up in banking bureaucracy and 
red tape 
we expect free and fair elections to take place popadiuk 
said but he added weve noticed that the nicaraguans have been 
harassing the opposition to a great extent all of which is 
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly 
uno says it is at a disadvantage in the campaign and accuses the 
sandinistas of using state resources for party purposes 
the supreme electoral council responsible for all matters 
regarding the elections last dec 20 approved the deposit of 
3584370 in the central bank 
this is part of the 9 million in a congressional measure signed 
into law by president bush on oct 21 most of the money is to be 
channeled through the national endowment for democracy funded by 
the us government 
under nicaraguan law foreign donations in cash must be split 
evenly between the recipient party and the electoral councils fund 
for democracy to help defray the cost of the electoral process 
uno and the fund for democracy are to get 18 million each from 
the 9 million lacayo said 
an additional 15 million is to be split between the fund for 
democracy and an institute founded by uno members to help train 
poll watchers and promote civic education 
but only 400000 has been deposited in the central bank said 
electoral council secretary rosa marina zelaya 
lacayo said half of that is for unos institute for electoral 
promotion and training 
our donors said there would be no more money until we could 
see how that would go through lacayo said 
he said a snag developed in trying to get permission from the 
ministry of external cooperation to release the funds from the 
central bank 
lacayo said that after being shunted from bureaucrat to 
bureaucrat for three weeks the uno institute people were told by 
the ministrys director of donations xiomara ortega that 
institute bylaws did not specify it was a nonprofit organization 
the bylaws would have to be rewritten before the ministry would 
agree to authorize release of the money lacayo reported adding 
there wont be enough time for training 
asked exactly how much of the 9 million uno has received so 
far lacayo put his index finger and thumb together and looked 
through the hole zero he said thats exactly how much 
uno has been paying for secretaries vehicles technical aid 
equipment and the like out of private funds grumbling has started 
one businessman said he is owed nearly 20000 and if they 
dont pay me soon im going to have to cut them out i like them 
but i am a businessman im not in this for fun 
in the midst of an interview at his office lacayo told a 
telephone caller just tell them there isnt any money for the 
gunpowder nothing for the musicians or even to buy a coke 
musicians and gunpowder for firecrackers typically enliven 
nicaraguan political rallies 
council spokesman adolfo beteta said uno has received donations 
such as caps tshirts and plastic flags worth at least 73000 
electoral law exempts these items from taxation 
beteta said one donor was the miamibased committee of friends 
of democracy and another was a guatemalan citizen but that he 
had no more information on donors 
ms zelaya said the sandinista front has received 126000 in 
cash donations from abroad half of it going to the fund for 
democracy

vice president dan quayles mission to soothe 
latin american ire over the us invasion of panama is on a stormy 
course even before his itinerary is set diplomatic sources said 
people are very skeptical about it you invade and then you 
try to convince us that an invasion is not an invasion he tries to 
patronize us said a costa rican official referring to president 
bush 
quayles office said no latin countries have refused to talk to 
the vice president but other sources said sentiment in venezuela 
is such that caracas could signal it does not welcome a visit at 
this time 
maybe the government will say ok you are welcome but in 
two or three years said one diplomatic source laughing to 
indicate he was exaggerating the venezuelan resistance to the 
quayle trip 
venezuela has been one of the harshest critics of the military 
action 
some countries welcomed bushs gesture in sending quayle to 
explain the invasion of panama its a gesture no asked an 
official from one nation 
but other latin diplomats predicted quayle will have a tough 
time succeeding at what bush termed very very important 
diplomacy in presenting the us rationale for the military 
invasion 
the costa rican said in a telephone interview thursday from san 
jose that his country because of its prous stance will welcome 
quayle but predicted reaction in some south american nations will 
likely be very icy 
the white house has not announced what countries quayle will 
visit or a timetable for the trip other than that he will keep a 
previous commitment to attend the jan 27 presidential inauguration 
in honduras 
stops in several central american and south american nations 
could come in a subsequent trip as well as further opportunities 
for discussions with heads of state during quayles expected 
attendance at the march presidential inaugurations in brazil and 
chile 
bush and other officials have acknowledged the invasion of 
panama strained us relations with latin nations the organization 
of american states voted to deplore the military action 
by sending quayle to the region bush said he hoped to explain 
his reasons for the invasion and convince latins of the truth 
and that is that we are not just reverting to just a willful 
use of force that has no rationale 
but latin officials say it will take some major convincing and 
some say its not the best time for quayle to visit 
the people of latin america will be more comfortable if the 
united states gets its troops home as soon as possible and helps 
panama carry out an election said one latin diplomatic source in 
washington 
asked about those rumblings which also surfaced in caracas 
media reports one administration official tersely replied just 
as were always happy to accommodate the visits by caribbean and 
latin leaders im sure they will be pleased to welcome the vice 
president 
i have no indication that venezuela or anyone else is not 
willing to talk with us said quayles press secretary david 
beckwith 
venezuela abstained from the oas vote deploring the invasion 
saying the resolution was not strong enough and should have tied 
recognition of the usinstalled government of president guillermo 
endara to withdrawal of the us invasion troops 
in 1958 vice president richard nixon was confronted by an 
angry rockthrowing mob in caracas during a goodwill tour to 
several latin american countries rioters attacked the stalled 
cars shattered windows in nixons limousine and tried to drag 
nixon and his wife patricia from the car the motorcade managed 
to escape the mob 
the latin countries like the united states opposed the 
dictatorship of panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega but they 
have voiced dismay at what they see as us heavyhandedness in 
invading to topple him 
latin diplomats whose national economies are tightly interwoven 
with us assistance were cautious in discussing the quayle trip 
and spoke only on condition of anonymity

the bush administration facing strong 
opposition from the auto and oil industries is trying to revive 
its plan to make alternative fuel cars readily available in some of 
the most polluted cities and break the monopoly of gasoline 
william rosenberg associate administrator at the environmental 
protection agency told a senate hearing thursday that the 
alternative fuel program is a vital and integral part of hopes 
of getting air quality within federal standards in nine urban 
centers 
a phasein of cars and small trucks powered by fuels other than 
gasoline was a key part of president bushs clean air package sent 
to congress last year the proposal envisioned up to a million such 
cars being sold annually by the late 1990s 
but the requirement was removed from clean air legislation in 
the house and was never included in the senate because of intense 
pressure from both the auto industry and oil companies among the 
less polluting fuels seen as alternatives to gasoline are methanol 
ethanol natural gas propane and various blends 
administration officials and environmentalists hope to reinstate 
the alternative fuel provision into clean air legislation that is 
moving toward floor consideration in both the house and senate 
rosenberg the administration point man on clean air matters 
told the senate environment and public works environmental 
protection subcommittee that efforts to clean up the worst urban 
smog would be fruitless without use of alternative fuel cars 
the only other way to meet federal air quality requirements at 
the turn of the century will be to dramatically restrict automobile 
use an option he said is not considered appropriate 
sen john chafee of rhode island the committees ranking 
republican said he plans to offer anamendment that would require 
automakers to begin making 150000 alternative fuel vehicles 
available in california within four years and phase in similar cars 
in eight other urban areas beginning in 1997 
under the chafee proposal nearly a third of the cars sold in 
the nine cities would be powered by fuel or a blend other than 
gasoline by 1999 and fleet owners in severely polluted areas would 
have to begin phasing in ultra clean fuel cars including 
electricpowered vehicles beginning in 1997 
just cleaning up the tailpipe emissions on cars hasnt been 
enough to assure healthy air quality said chafee who said 
tighter pollution controls on individual gasoline powered cars are 
often offset by the increasing number of cars on the road 
the automakers have opposed any federal requirement for 
alternative fuel vehicles arguing the sale of such cars should not 
be required by the government unless separate measures such as tax 
incentives also are offered to ensure a market for the vehicles 
we know very little about how us consumers will respond to 
alternative fuels and the vehicles that use them said james 
fitzpatrick vice president for general motors corp in testimony 
before the subcommittee 
if congress requires such cars it also should require 
incentives to stimulate consumer demand and ease stringent tailpipe 
emission controls already in the clean air bill in the senate said 
donald buist of the ford motor co 
but leading democrats in the senate say that although they favor 
alternative fuel car development they are not prepared to trade a 
clean fuel car program for more relaxed tailpipe emissions 
standards already in the senate bill 
i want to be clear one is not a substitute for the 
other sen max baucus dmont chairman of the subcommittee 
said thursday in commenting on chafees proposal 
but baucus and other senators expressed concern that consumers 
might not buy the alternative fuel cars 
the automakers must have the responsibility to provide 
incentives rosenberg replied were not talking about crazy 
cars were talking about cars similar to those already on the road 
we think theyll sell very well 
according to the epa the cities where air quality is so poor 
that alternative fuel cars would be required are los angeles 
where local officials already are development similar requirements 
houston new york chicago milwaukee baltimore philadelphia san 
diego and hartford conn

congress concerned about the increasing cost 
of the b1 bomber is facing an additional expense with recent air 
force estimates that installation of a fire protection system will 
cost about 170 million 
documents released on capitol hill thursday show that putting a 
fire detection and isolation system in the fleet of strategic 
aircraft will cost about 99 million and a fire suppression system 
is 70 million 
its amazing that we have to spend this much rep john 
kasich rohio a member of the house armed services committee who 
requested the figures said in a telephone interview from ohio 
thats what happens when we build things too quickly 
the air force has stressed need for the system as a result of a 
november 1988 accident near dyess air force base in texas in which 
wings sweeping back on the bomber penetrated fuel lines and touched 
off a fire 
we did not have sufficient fire suppression in the overwing 
said air force lt richard cole referring to the section that 
houses the wing where it is attached to the fuselage 
cole said the fire detection and suppression system is an 
outgrowth of the accident 
all four crew members ejected safely from the aircraft before 
the crash the third since the b1 began flying in 1985 as the 
nations first longrange bomber in more than 25 years 
the air force point paper said the service plans to go ahead 
with the fire detection and isolation system using money from 
existing accounts 
however the air force is looking to congress to pay for the 
suppression system 
asked if congress will accept the expense kasich said the 
b1 clearly has to be fixed the b1 preserves our option for 
canceling stealth 
kasich has been an outspoken critic of the b2 stealth bomber 
the radarevading plane that carries a pricetag of about 530 
million apiece 
the b1 a fourengine swingwing bomber is designed to fill 
the gap between the aging b52 and the stealth bomber in the air 
force arsenal 
the b1 has a maximum speed of about 1000 mph and a range of 
more than 7000 miles it is smaller than the b52 but capable of 
carrying more bombs and already holds a number of world aviation 
speed records for a plane of its size 
the b1 killed by president carter in 1977 was resurrected 
four years later by president reagan who said the plane was needed 
to update the nations aging force of nucleararmed bombers 
reagan ordered 100 b1s at a cost of 205 billion three have 
crashed leaving the service with 97 of the planes the air force 
has already received all the b1s it intends to buy and is 
proceeding with plans to buy the b2 stealth bomber 
in addition to needing the fire system the b1 has been plagued 
with problems over its defensive avionics or electronic 
countermeasures system the avionics were designed to improve the 
bombers chances of penetrating the soviet union by allowing the 
aircrafts crew to avoid degrade and deceive the soviet air 
defenses 
the problems involve the systems radar warning receiver and 
processor function 
in its fiscal 1990 defense bill a congress wary of the b1 
problems imposed strict testbeforeyoubuy requirements on the air 
force and its avionics system 
the house report on the bill said the test program will 
provide the basis for the congress to determine whether the 
proposed modifications will provide an increase in penetration 
capability commensurate with the additional costs which will be 
about 1 billion

members of congress who oversee the defense 
budget are giving defense secretary dick cheneys plan to save 
billions of dollars by reforming the pentagons purchasing 
bureaucracy a skeptical reception 
well ultimately find the proof in the pentagon checkbook 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said thursday after cheney updated his plans for 
overhauling the massive system 
aspin said in a statement that cheneys defense management 
system offers no blueprint for implementation 
cheney told reporters he expected billions of dollars to be 
saved in the overhaul and 42000 jobs will be eliminated but he 
acknowledged there is no major fix for the departments 
problems 
this is going to be a continuous process he said this is 
the first bite of the apple if you will 
for example no major departments will be eliminated and most 
of the job cuts are expected to be reached through attrition 
but cheney argued that radical reforms were not necessary to 
respond to the procurement scandals that resulted in budgets 
bloated by overpriced coffee pots ashtrays and hammers 
the idea that this organization is all fouled up is a totally 
fallacious idea he said saying he wants not simply to cut the 
budget but to obtain a more efficient system that can run with 
fewer people and greater accountability and that will result in a 
system that costs less to operate 
real changes are being made that we believe will improve 
pentagon management and help make it possible for us to buy what we 
need at lower cost in less time and with greater assurance of 
quality cheney said 
the secretary said precise details on how the savings would be 
achieved and where job cuts would come from would await release of 
president bushs fiscal 1991 budget later this month 
asked whether there would be additional base closings cheney 
said the budget will include extensive closures when asked to 
define extensive he quipped more than two 
cheney said 600 toilet seats are sexy and easy to get people 
to focus on the work of getting the department of defense to 
function in such a way so that we dont have 600 toilet seats is 
hard and complex 
the reform effort was spurred by weaponsprocurement scandals 
that rocked the defense establishment in the 1980s cheney also has 
been eager in the face of congressional budgetcutting pressures to 
show he is working to pare the militarys fiscal hunger 
in a letter dated tuesday leading members of the house and 
senate armed services committees expressed concerns that 
effective implementation of reform recommendations will be 
difficult 
the defense department needs to take these efforts the one 
necessary step further and formulate a plan of action to put these 
recommendations into practice the lawmakers wrote 
in his statement aspin noted the congress and administration 
agreed on an acquisition summit to measure the effectiveness of 
the reforms and hoped to see progress in savings there 
in a separate statement sen carl levin dmich warned 
against cutting out the waste fighters and the whistleblowers 
its one thing to reduce the number of players on the bench 
but its quite another to take the referees out of the game 
levin said 
weapons purchases account for more than 60 billion of the 
departments 305 billion military budget the management and 
logistics work force numbers some 580000 civilian and military 
workers 
although reports circulated recently that cheneys reforms would 
include doing away with some duplicative purchasing systems 
entrenched in various branches of the military services the 
pentagon announcement said the savings would be achieved primarily 
through 
streamlining each services purchasing system 
reducing the use of consultants and outside advisers 
creating a fulltime acquisition corps in each service that 
would report to a streamlined chain of command to top civilian 
department officials 
eliminating unnecessary paperwork 
according to a statement released to reporters management 
improvements will generate 23 billion in savings in fiscal 
1991 and an estimated 39 billion through fiscal 1995 
the improvements make it possible to trim the logistics and 
management work force of 580000 civilians and military personnel 
and by as many as 8000 civilians and 8000 military personnel in 
fy 91 and by 18000 civilian and 24000 military personnel by the 
end of fy 95 the statement said

a carpenter who was one of the 
first single men in florida to adopt children pleaded guilty 
thursday to sexually abusing four boys including three of his 
adopted sons 
david allen lindsey sr 45 agreed to accept a 15year prison 
sentence under the plea bargain palm beach county circuit judge 
thomas sholts also extended lindseys threeyear probation on a 
separate molestation conviction to 10 years 
lindsey declined to comment on the plea deal as he was 
fingerprinted in the courtroom handcuffed and led away to a 
courthouse holding cell but his lawyer richard lubin said later 
that lindsey maintains he is innocent despite the formal 
acknowledgement of guilt 
it was a pragmatic decision that he made lubin said he 
learned at his last trial that whether theres reasonable doubt or 
not you can easily be convicted of child abuse 
on sept 28 lindsey was convicted of lewd assault on a 
14yearold boy he was sentenced nov 11 to 5 years in prison and 
three years of probation and forbidden to have contact with 
children under age 16 
david lindsey jr one of 11 boys adopted by lindsey and his 
adopted fathers chief accuser said he was relieved to see the 
2year legal process end its been a longawaited day the 
younger lindsey said and im glad its here and we dont have to 
go through a trial 
i think it serves the interests of all of us in the long 
run he said of the plea bargain 
lindsey faced 17 sexrelated charges before thursdays hearing 
all involving three of his adopted sons and a fourth boy a friend 
of one of the sons 
under the plea arrangement lindsey pleaded guilty to one charge 
each against the four boys and the remaining 13 charges were 
dropped 
one of those four charges lindsey pleaded guilty to involved a 
boy under 12 and carried a mandatory 25year sentence that charge 
had been reduced as part of the plea agreement 
in addition lindsey cannot be prosecuted for any illegal sexual 
activity occuring before the plea 
lindseys sentence also prohibits any contact with children 
under age 16 during his ten years of probation and includes 
psychiatric treatment lindsey agreed under the plan to drop his 
appeal of the earlier conviction 
supporters of the elder lindsey attending the hearing included 
his wife whom he married after adopting the boys his mother 
his two sisters and four of his other adopted sons who have backed 
him since his arrest in june 1987 
singleparent adoptions were a rarity in 1969 when lindsey 
first asked permission to adopt a son after two years of volunteer 
work at an orphanage he was given his first son 
by 1981 his family had grown to include five boys the fifth 
being his namesake david jr after a series of quarrels with his 
adoptive father in 1987 david jr went to authorities with his 
allegations

like an immense gravitational magnet a 
vast celestial structure nicknamed the great attractor is 
pulling powerfully at the milky way and more than 100 other 
galaxies causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of 
the nearby universe 
the structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on 
galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space 
astronomer alan dressler said thursday at a meeting of the american 
astronomical society 
dressler with the carnegie institution of washington said he 
and sandra faber of the university of california at santa cruz have 
confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the 
movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what 
is considered normal for an expanding universe 
more than 100 galaxies were found to have a peculiar motion 
that pointed toward the center of what dressler labeled the great 
attractor 
current theory is that the universe is expanding at a steady 
rate hence all galaxies are moving in one direction at a constant 
rate any change in rate or direction is considered peculiar 
motion 
the great attractor is a large area of density in which 
galaxies are moving toward it from one side and toward it from the 
other dressler said the distortion in motion is very marked 
and very significant 
dressler said the gravitational pull of the great attractor has 
added about 600 kilometers a second or about 13 million miles an 
hour to the motion velocity of the galaxies it is drawing in 
dressler faber and five other astronomers called the seven 
samurai in the astronomy community presented preliminary 
evidence for the presence of the great attractor in 1987 
the idea was met then with great skepticism because it went 
against theories that matter formed in generally smooth patterns in 
the universe 
we had found a rather large lump dressler said their 
studies then showed that only galaxies on the same side as the 
milky way were being drawn toward the attractor 
since then dressler said he and faber have found many 
additional star clusters also moving toward the great attractor 
including some moving from beyond the assumed location of the 
structure 
there is evidence now that galaxies are falling in from the 
other side he said 
measurements he said have determined that the great attractor 
is about 500 million light years across and that the center of the 
structure is about 150 million light years away from the milky way 
which is the home of the sun and the earth 
a light year is the distance in space that light will travel in 
one year about 6 trillion miles 
dressler said the structure stretches about 60 degrees across 
the earths view of the sky reaching from superclusters of 
galaxies known as hydra and centaurus through the plane of the 
milky way to the superclusters pavo and indus 
the great attractor is not solid but rather is an area where 
there is a greater than average density of superclusters of 
galaxies and the socalled dark matter universal material that 
cannot be seen dressler said much of the mass in the universe is 
thought by astronomers to be dark matter 
the new study was presented in a paper at the 175th national 
meeting of the aas

two elderly japanese have emerged from 45 years in 
the jungle becoming the most recent of a group of japanese for 
whom world war ii stretched on for decades 
shigeyuki hashimoto now 71 and kiyoaki tanaka 77 were 
employees of a japanese company in malaysia at the end of the war 
but they joined communist guerrillas fighting for malaysias 
independence from britain one of japans former enemies rather 
than return home 
the group the communist party of malaysia continued its 
insurgency after the country became independent in 1957 but 
officially laid down its arms dec 2 when it signed a peace accord 
with malaysian and thai officials 
hashimoto and tanaka who are to return to tokyo on saturday 
are unlikely to get the massive heros welcome given to japans 
most famous world war ii holdouts sgt shoichi yokoi and lt hiroo 
onoda when they emerged in 1972 and 1974 respectively 
friends plan welcoming ceremonies for the two but many japanese 
are uncomfortable with the issues of blind dedication and loyalty 
raised by the mens return 
wartime japanese were taught to be loyal to the nation and 
emperor and soldiers were trained to obey a code that said death 
was preferable to surrender 
in interviews televised here tanaka and hashimoto said they 
felt a responsibility to stay and help the guerrillas because of 
japans wartime claim to be saving asia from european dominance 
we thought malaysians would think we were taking advantage of 
them if we let britain reclaim their country hashimoto said 
japans ministry of health and welfare still is estigating the 
cases of 48 former japanese soldiers who could be living in the 
vast areas of asia controlled by japan during the war 
the bestknown holdout onoda left the philippine jungle on his 
52nd birthday in 1974 an intelligence officer he received orders 
in 1945 to stay behind and spy on the us armed forces japan 
surrendered in august 1945 
onoda refused to give up despite at least four searches by 
japanese officials in which family members appealed to him over 
loudspeakers and leaflets were dropped from airplanes calling on 
him to surrender 
onoda later said he did not give up because no one had reversed 
his order until his former commander maj yoshimi taniguchi 
traveled to the philippines and ordered him to come out 
in his formal surrender to thenpresident ferdinand marcos 
broadcast on national japanese television onoda wore his 
30yearold imperial army uniform cap and sword all still in good 
condition 
after returning home onoda decided he did not have the skills 
to live in modern japanese society and moved to brazil where he 
danced in discos got married and lived on a ranch 
i do not consider those 30 years a waste of time he said 
i was ordered to go there and i carried out the orders to the 
best of my ability 
a member of onodas platoon pfc shinichi kozuka was shot dead 
in 1972 after he and onoda fired on a philippine constabulary 
patrol on lubang island people there blamed the two for killing at 
least 21 people injuring more than a dozen and burning crops 
apparently in an attempt to aid japans war effort 
yokoi surfaced in 1972 on guam 27 years after plunging into the 
jungle where he tailored his clothes out of tree bark and ate a 
diet of shrimp coconuts snails frogs and rats he called it 
living like a badger in the jungles 
captured by two local fishermen yokoi returned to japan and 
made an apparently successful switch to modern life he got married 
and made a living from writing and lecturing 
in his bestselling memoirs road to tomorrow he recounted 
that he had thought that leaflets saying the war was over were us 
propaganda and so refused to surrender and give up the rifle that 
had been entrusted to him by the emperor 
it was my belief in the emperor that kept me alive kept me 
from surrendering and humiliating myself as a prisoner of war 
yokoi said 
the japanese educational system before and during the war 
emphasized ultranationalism and allegiance to the emperor in 
whose name soldiers fought soldiers were instructed to commit 
suicide rather than give themselves up and about 25 of onodas and 
kozukas comrades on lubang reportedly did so 
now the emperor is a figurehead and japans constitution forbids 
war as an instrument of national policy 
there have been numerous unconfirmed and false sightings of 
former japanese soldiers in remote jungles 
some soldiers have decided to continue their lives away from 
japan one lance cpl chisaburo bise said he was content raising 
corn and selling banana leaves in a remote village in thailand 
where he escaped from an allied prison camp after the war 
another sakunojo kitamura also escaped from a prison camp 
joined the burmese army in 1949 and after retiring continued to 
live in burma he visited japan for the first time in 1985 using 
money raised by a veterans group

serious streptococcal infections including strep 
throat and rheumatic fever have escalated to the point where they 
are a reemerging public health problem federal health officials 
said 
group a streptococcus the bacteria that cause rheumatic fever 
strep throat and impetigo have caused several outbreaks of 
disease across the united states the centers for disease control 
said thursday in its weekly report 
among them an outbreak of streptococcal bacteremia a serious 
feverish infection which pervades the bloodstream in the denver 
colo area last year 
nineteen cases were confirmed in one hospital between january 
and august compared with eight in all of 1988 and three in 1987 
some of the denver cases might have been prevented if doctors 
had better treated the original strep infection before it reached 
the bloodstream said dr ben schwartz a cdc specialist 
many of these patients had respiratory infections others had 
skin infections he said its conceivable that if they had 
been treated early it may not have spread to the severe bacteremia 
that occurred 
that outbreak followed reports of an outbreak of toxic shocklike 
infections in 1987 and clusters of rheumatic fever in 1985 and 1986 
recently streptococcal infections have reemerged as a 
public health problem the atlantabased cdc said 
the cdc also reported an outbreak of strep throat at texas 
lackland air force base in december 1988 and january 1989 186 
trainees tested positive for strep 
that outbreak the cdc said shows that streprelated disease 
which caused substantial sickness among military recruits in world 
wars i and ii still poses a risk to military training centers 
a number of different severe strep infections do seem to be 
increasing in certain areas schwartz said we need to gather 
similar information from other areas and see if this is a localized 
problem or a problem thats more widespread 
the cdc has also received reports of streptococcal bacteremia 
outbreaks in england and scandinavia suggesting widespread 
changes in the pattern of this disease the agency said 
most strep infections are mild such as the typical case of 
strep throat and most cases can be cleared up with antibiotics 
such as penicillin schwartz said very rarely does it spread to 
cause an infection in the blood he said 
severe strep infections such as bacteremia and scarlet fever 
were once much more common than they are today the decline in 
part can be attributed to modern antibiotics the cdc said 
streptococcal bacteremia occurs most often among the elderly 
including nursing home residents the cdc said 
the lackland air force base outbreak resulted in precautionary 
penicillin treatments for each of the more than 6000 trainees 
there the first such program in more than 15 years at that base

asked whether he forgives hinckley who was found innocent by 
reason of insanity of trying to assassinate the president in march 
1981 reagan said yes 
i added him to my prayers that well if i wanted healing for 
myself and maybe he should have some healing for himself reagan 
said 
hinckley wrote a letter published in the washington post in 1984 
in which he asked that reagan forgive me for my past madness 
the former president had little to say about north a 
nowretired marine lieutenant colonel reagan fired as a national 
security council aide over his role in the irancontra affair 
north is appealing his felony conviction for falsifying government 
documents and on other charges arising from the affair 
well i had difficulty in talking about this situation that he 
was directly involved in because it is still before the law and all 
and i could create some problems if i made statements reagan 
said 
but asked if he personally liked north reagan said yes and 
he had a great military record of courage and certainly of taking 
care of the men 
reagan said he also liked gorbachev but did not let that affect 
his bargaining position i have to say i think that there was a 
kind of a chemistry reagan said 
asked if he thought gorbachev could be a successful politician 
in the united states reagan answered yes because i think he is 
a likable person you find yourself liking him 
reagan a movie and television actor before he turned to 
politics said he does not plan to return to his former craft 
i happen to believe that returning to that now would seem as 
if i was trying to capitalize on the presidency he said 
nevertheless that complaint was made about reagan after he and 
his wife nancy accepted a 2 million fee for a trip to japan last 
year 
reagan said he earned the money that he didnt ask for it and 
that other people got paid more for doing less 
we were there for nine days and nancy managed to set up an 
antidrug program as she has in this country he said i felt 
that in going to japan i would help in bringing about a closer 
relationship

the state department is sending an envoy to 
take a fresh look at the problems of the usarmed mujahedeen 
guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked government of afghanistan 
undersecretary of state robert kimmitt is leaving saturday for a 
weeklong trip to saudi arabia pakistan and india the state 
department said thursday he is taking along the administrations 
special afghanistan coordinator peter tomsen 
were taking a fresh look said one us official in light 
of the stalemate in fighting between the mujahedeen and government 
forces since soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan feb 15 
policy must always reflect changing circumstances said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
kimmitt the no 3 official at the state department is 
scheduled to meet with pakistani officials and with the heads of an 
afghan coalition that includes the seven major rebel groups 
in a covert program funded by congress the united states 
funnels about 600 million worth of weapons through pakistan to the 
mujahedeen and the pakistani secret service distributes the arms 
saudi arabia has also been a major contributor to the 
mujahedeen and kimmitt is expected to discuss with saudi officials 
the rebels changed circumstances a us official said 
the united states has grown increasingly concerned with the 
mujahedeens failure to rout the sovietinstalled government of 
president najibullah contrary to american predictions of victory 
following the soviets pullout 
the kabul government has also not succeeded in capturing the 
countryside from the mujahedeen although it has held onto the 
major cities with the help of what us officials claim are massive 
infusions of soviet arms 
the afghan standoff is expected to come up in talks next month 
in moscow between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
im glad the bush administration is reassessing our effort 
said sen gordon humphrey rnh a strong ally of the mujahedeen 
our policy has been on autopilot since the end of the reagan 
administration 
humphrey said new training and a different mix of weapons are 
called for in light of the military stalemate 
the united states should also demand that the pakistani secret 
service stop playing the different afghan groups off against each 
other and provide an equitable distribution of weapons 
humphrey said 
theres a lot of dissatisfaction in the senate because were 
not getting much for our money he said next time congress is 
asked to approve aid for the mujahedeen im going to insist that 
conditions are attached no more carte blanche 
humphrey said he would insist the cia bring in defense 
department experts to help retrain and support the mujahedeen

gun control advocates have a new ally in 
retired chief justice warren e burger a man who has owned 
sporting guns all his life and once made news by answering his door 
armed with a pistol 
in an article to be published by parade magazine sunday burger 
called for steps to halt the growing number of handgun murders in 
america 9000 last year alone 
to keep and bear arms for hunting today is essentially a 
recreational activity and not an imperative of survival as it was 
200 years ago burger said 
saturday night specials and machine guns are not recreational 
weapons and surely are as much in need of regulation as motor 
vehicles 
burger said tighter restrictions on buying and selling guns 
should be considered if we are to stop this mindless homicidal 
carnage a constitutional right to bear arms he said should not 
be interpreted to block all gun regulation 
he proposed requiring gun buyers to fill out an application that 
would include any prior criminal convictions and a 10day waiting 
period before a gun license is issued 
burger also suggested stricter registration and recordkeeping 
such as are required when cars are sold and said it might be 
reasonable to require manufacturers to provide authorities with a 
ballistic fingerprint for each gun they make to help police 
locate murder weapons 
while he has owned sporting guns all his life burger said he 
has done little hunting in recent years he posed for the parade 
magazine cover with an antique rifle 
sixteen years ago burgers ownership of a pistol made news when 
the armed chief justice confronted a newspaper reporter who had 
gone to burgers home late one night seeking comment 
burger retired from the supreme court in 1986 when he left to 
become chairman of the commission on the bicentennial of the united 
states constitution a position he still holds 
he said the right to bear arms spelled out in the 
constitutions second amendment should be understood in context 
it was approved by the same first congress that limited the 
national army to 840 men and provided that each state maintain its 
own militia burger said the founding fathers were concerned 
mainly with protecting individuals against abuses by a national 
army he said 
the right to defend ones home or to own a hunting rifle will 
not be impaired by stricter gun controls burger said in some 
places he noted even bicycles and household dogs must be 
registered

after a year on the job james a baker iii is 
as hard to figure out as the impact of his foreign policy 
correction make that george bushs foreign policy 
difficult as it may be to isolate bakers views his commitment 
to his friend the president is total 
baker is bushs man at the state department not the state 
departments representative to the white house 
he avoids the limelight and has few news conferences hes a 
good bet to pop up as a sunday television talk show guest and just 
as good a bet not to make news 
thats not unusual for a secretary of state even those who come 
from the heated political arena learn to speak a strange tongue 
that reveals virtually nothing about their policies beyond the 
broad outlines 
there is something to be said for quiet diplomacy 
the camp david agreement president carter worked out between 
egypt and israel in 1978 was accomplished during a news blackout of 
nearly two weeks 
it produced frustrated journalists but also a landmark peace 
treaty in 1979 between the two warring middle eastern nations 
still baker is an extreme case 
he prefers talking to reporters off the record which under 
washington rules means he cant be quoted by name or even 
identified as a senior official he says a little more in that 
protective mode but not much 
considering his job and good connections to the president 
bakers influence is assumed to be large but he keeps his head 
down makes few speeches and doesnt leave fingerprints 
he was nearly invisible during the long siege in panama his 
work in the middle east is mostly on the telephone baker showed a 
little irritation this week with the demands arabs and israelis are 
registering as a precondition to negotiations 
and yet the flash of irritation may have been calculated 
designed to pressure the parties to give in or baker may have 
momentarily dropped his mask its impossible to know 
as a political strategist who helped engineer bushs climb to 
the white house baker was not known to be errorprone 
he stumbled a little at the start at state keeping stock in a 
texas bank that had an indirect stake in third world debt policy 
but once his holdings became public knowledge he sold the stock 
and everything else in his portfolio to avoid any conflict of 
interest 
also baker fibbed a bit by saying on television that the trip 
brent scowcroft and lawrence eagleburger made to beijing last month 
was their first since the june massacre in tiananmen square 
baker knew the national security adviser and deputy secretary of 
state had also met with chinese leaders in beijing in early july 
caught in the misstatement baker apologized and said he was 
simply trying to support the presidents secret diplomacy 
i do not think jim baker would ever deliberately mislead 
somebody bush said and so i will stand with him 
from the little baker has said about various foreign policy 
issues and judging also by body language he almost certainly is a 
force for moderation in us foreign policy 
for example he scuttled a key plank in president reagans 
central american policy by refusing to seek renewed military aid 
for the contra rebels in nicaragua and forged a bipartisan approach 
with congress 
his view of mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet union seems to 
have grown more nuanced 
initially baker and his closest advisers found more in the 
nature of public relations and pragmatic tactics in the soviet 
presidents quiver 
but as he listened and looked closer baker overcame the doubts 
of hardliners in the bush administration and grew committed to what 
gorbachev is trying to accomplish in the soviet union 
baker appears to be working as comfortably with eduard 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister as did his predecessor 
george shultz 
shevardnadzes frank account to baker of the soviet unions 
economic plight on a long flight to jackson wyo in september had 
a strong impact on the former treasury secretary 
they will meet again in moscow next month and probably twice 
more before bush and gorbachev hold a washington summit in june 
they are trying to help us and soviet negotiators in geneva 
wrap up a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles on both 
sides by 30 percent to 50 percent 
baker and his close circle of advisers also were instrumental in 
framing bushs proposal to cut us and soviet ground forces and 
nonnuclear arms in europe 
the outlook for a treaty in that area is reasonably bright 
baker meanwhile is giving more emphasis to the political 
situation in europe 
his most important speech as secretary of state was an address 
to the berlin press club last month in which he urged the north 
atlantic treaty organization to reflect the lowering of tensions in 
europe by developing a new architecture for a new era 
the united states would maintain strong ties with the west 
europeans while nato took on a broader role that included 
monitoring troop reductions and mediating regional disputes 
as europe changes the instruments for western cooperation 
must adapt baker said 
the same day baker ventured into east germany to show us 
support for a struggling reformist regime 
it was a surprising gesture and contributed to bakers mixture 
of hope and concern about developments in eastern and central 
europe 
naturally he is pleased with the trend toward democracy but 
hes also apprehensive of the violence and retribution that have 
surfaced at times

the reports thursday said the rebels from unita the national 
union for the total independence of angola attacked the resort of 
cabo ledo 62 miles douth of the capital on monday night they 
held the town for several hours before retreating ahead of a 
government advance backed by tanks helicopters and cuban troops 
according to the reports 
the tpa state television network showed burning buildings and 
cited witnesses saying the fighting killed and wounded many people 
an unofficial estimate said 80 people died 
cabo ledo is a resort famed for beaches and seafood restaurants 
it is a favorite weekend retreat for luandabased diplomats and 
representatives of western companies 
the reports said about 100 guerrillas were involved in the 
attack concentrating their fire on the small army base in cabo 
ledo and work sites of a company reparing the road from luanda to 
porto amboim 143 miles south of the capital 
news of the cabo ledo fighting shocked residents of luanda 
government officials were reported worried at the rebels capacity 
to strike so close to the capital 
news of the cabo ledo attack followed a bomb blast tuesday that 
injured three people in downtown luanda the bomb damaged the 
criminal records office and exploded close to other government 
buildings 
meanwhile military sources in the capital said government 
forces were intensifying an offensive against unita strongholds in 
southeast angola 
the sources said government troops had temporarily halted the 
offensive before the stategic rebel base of mavinga 687 miles 
southeast of the capital but were flying more troops and equipment 
to the southeast 
a statement distributed by the rebels in lisbon portugal 
thursday claimed 63 government soldiers and 13 rebels died between 
monday and wednesday in the southeast 
unita has been fighting to share power since a marxist 
government took power in luanda when angola gained independence 
from portugal in 1975 
efforts to end the 15yearold civil war have floundered since a 
truce last june broke down within weeks 
under a dec 1988 accord cuban troops aiding the government 
have pulled out of southern angola and begun withdrawing from the 
country 
the national news agency angop reported thursday that 31000 
cuban troops out of an estimated 50000 total have left 
under the 1988 accord south africa agreed to halt aid to unita 
and grant independence to angolas southern neighbor namibia

hud secretary jack kemp is moving ahead with 
plans to reshape his departments financial management to remove 
the poison from the system 
kemp said a team of leading accounting professionals would 
search for the most qualified person to manage the billions of 
dollars spent each year by the department of housing and urban 
development 
the nonpartisan panel also will recommend candidates to serve 
as comptrollers in the departments five major divisions housing 
community development and planning public and indian housing 
government national mortgage association and administration 
all six of the new officials will be required to be certified 
public accountants kemp said 
when they are in place and strict systems of financial 
accountability are in operation kemp said he would insist on an 
inflexible standard of zero tolerance for ethical lapses 
i think that is a realistic goal if we are meticulous in 
seeking the very highest caliber of people to create huds 
financial systems for the 1990s kemp said 
he said he hoped the system will serve as a model for 
departments and agencies throughout the government 
kemp made his announcement at a luncheon meeting thursday of the 
association of government accountants 
huds new chief financial officer and comptrollers will put 
our financial house in order he said they will install 
effective financial management for hud guided by the overriding 
requirements of integrity professional competence and 
accountability 
i am totally confident that by placing responsibility for 
rebuilding huds financial management in the hands of individuals 
of integrity we can guarantee that the day of abuse fraud waste 
and lack of accountability is over our goal is to remove the 
poison from the system 
kemp said that when he took over the department a year ago from 
secretary samuel pierce hud had only one actuary to monitor its 
300 billion insurance program had 77 separate financial 
management systems none of which met official standards and had 
not been audited by outside auditors in 15 years 
he declined to criticize pierce by name 
kemp began the search for new financial officers under the 
authority of legislation signed into law last month which is 
intended to improve program management and financial accountability 
at hud 
the legislation grew out of revelations of fraud influence 
peddling and political favoritism at hud during the reagan 
administration 
the multibillion scandal has been the subject of congressional 
and criminal investigations

farmers have boosted winter wheat plantings 
for this years harvest but analysts say poor conditions have 
raised concerns that reduced yields could mean an even tighter 
supply down the line 
an agriculture department report said thursday that farmers 
planted nearly 57 million acres of winter wheat last fall for 
harvest in 1990 a 3 percent increase from 1989 and the most 
acreage in five years 
but the increase was much less than the 6 percent to 8 percent 
that some analysts had been predicting thus said one there will 
be a thinner cushion against possible poor yields this summer 
this would be the largest wheat area since the 1985 crop 
when plantings totaled 578 million acres the departments 
agricultural statistics board said 
lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in the central and 
southern great plains during december the report said in 
midtolate december cold weather stressed winter wheat in the 
southern great plains delta and southeast 
more recently much of the protective snow cover in vast areas 
of the plains has melted raising concerns about damage from 
subsequent cold weather 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year 
it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat output 
last years winter wheat production declined because of 
lingering drought in some major production areas but total wheat 
output increased because of a boost in springplanted areas 
meanwhile us wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink 
keeping market prices high 
to help replenish dwindling reserves the department is 
requiring farmers to idle only 5 percent of their wheat base acres 
this year compared with a 10 percent setaside in 1989 and 275 
percent previously 
in another option intended to boost production wheat farmers 
are permitted to plant up to 10 percent more acreage than otherwise 
would be permitted under the 1990 program 
as originally announced may 31 farmers were to plant no more 
than 95 percent of their wheat land but the option announced sept 
13 lets them plant up to 105 percent or 10 percent more than 
otherwise would be permitted under the basic program 
economist john schnittker a washingtonbased consultant said 
that larger plantings would have provided a better cushion for 
possible yield losses later in the season 
for example he said if plantings had been boosted 6 percent to 
8 percent as many had expected that would have helped offset any 
major impact from reduced yields caused by poor growing conditions 
but with only a 3 percent increase in 1990 plantings that 
cushion is thinner and leaves very little margin for reduced 
yields schnittker said in a telephone interview were at 
greater risk than expected 
the report showed that wheat farmers in kansas traditionally 
the biggest producer kept plantings at last years level 124 
million acres increases were reported in missouri and montana 
oklahoma south dakota and washington 
but nebraska farmers reduced winter wheat plantings by 2 
percent and texas producers cut theirs by 3 percent 
in a supplyanddemand analysis officials said the us total 
wheat stockpile june 1 the beginning of the 199091 wheat 
marketing year could be reduced to 468 million bushels from 702 
million june 1 and 126 billion bushels two years ago 
however the new june 1 forecast was up 25 million bushels from 
indications in december no projections were included for 199091 
export demand has been fed by us price subsidies for a number 
of countries including the soviet union and china even so total 
wheat exports in 198990 are expected to drop to around 1275 
billion bushels down from 1419 billion last season 
domestic requirements are slightly more than 1 billion bushels 
for 198990 the report said 
the analysis said average market prices may average in the range 
of 380 to 390 per bushel over the 12month marketing year 5 
cents to 10 cents less than the december projection wheat prices 
averaged 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788 
another report showed the dec 1 inventory of all us wheat at 
142 billion bushels down 17 percent from a year earlier farm 
holdings at 582 million bushels were down 6 percent from dec 1 
1988 while offfarm stocks at 836 million were down 24 percent 
the dec 1 corn stockpile was estimated at 708 billion bushels 
virtually the same as a year earlier farm inventories were 
reported at 47 billion bushels up 10 percent while offfarm 
holdings dropped 15 percent to 238 billion bushels 
soybean stocks were reported at 161 billion bushels up 18 
percent from a year earlier farm inventories at 793 million 
bushels were up 22 percent and offfarm stocks rose 14 percent to 
817 million 
a review of 1989 crop production relatively minor adjustments in 
usdas previously announced harvest figures 
the 1989 wheat crop was reported at 204 billion bushels up 12 
percent from 1988 corn 753 billion bushels up 53 percent 
sorghum 618 million bushels up 7 percent oats 371 million 
bushels up 72 percent barley 403 million bushels up 39 percent

consumers and government policy makers should 
not be swayed by the phone companies siren song that if only 
given the chance they could give all americans telephone video 
and computer data in one neat package a new report says 
those with low incomes along with the disabled elderly and the 
rural should be especially wary about a new information age 
because these groups will be the least able to foot the bill 
according to a report prepared for the consumer federation of 
america and the american association for retired persons 
the report says rapid integration of voice video and data under 
a centralized phone network would add 250 billion in 
unnecessary expense or about 5 a month for each telephone 
subscriber for 33 years 
if these inflated costs are passed along to basic phone 
customers affordable phone service could be jeopardized john 
rother an aarp executive said thursday 
the groups said the nation should move cautiously to the 
information age and maintain the current decentralized system 
in which the phone companies serve as conduits for phone and 
computer services to individually owned personal computers rather 
than using large central computers video should come into the home 
on a separate line the groups said 
a bell atlantic official said the groups were taking an 
eitheror position that was not called for 
rather than gamble on computers alone we want to increase the 
odds that all americans will have affordable access to information 
services said a gray collins jr bell atlantics executive 
vice president for external affairs the answer lies in network 
intelligence in linking together phones and computers and 
everything in between 
the regional bell telephone companies are trying to persuade 
congress to jump start new technology by freeing them from the 
restrictions of a consent decree that broke up the old bell system 
and from strictures in the 1984 cable act that prevent them from 
owning cable tv systems 
local phone companies are barred from owning information 
services providing longdistance service or manufacturing 
equipment and congress is expected to consider removing some of 
those restrictions this year 
the phone companies want to rewire the nation with highcapacity 
fiberoptic lines that could provide video telephone and data 
services all on hairthin strands of glass 
they say the united states is falling behind in providing 
services such as the home shopping banking and reservation 
services that are offered by networks such as frances 
governmentsubsidized minitel system 
a central network the phone companies argue could introduce 
these new services quickly and efficiently 
but the reports author mark cooper of the citizens research 
public interest group said the lowincome disabled rural 
elderly and educational institutions could face a heavy financial 
burden if phone companies became the central providers of the 
services 
gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer federation 
said it is quite clear the us is not falling behind other 
nations in information services information age infrastructure 
development is right on schedule and offers consumers a wealth of 
services which will expand in the 1990s he said 
kimmelman said if present regulation is maintained through this 
decade the real price of basic telephone service and cable tv can 
be substantially reduced and new technologies and desirable 
informationage services introduced without spending hundreds of 
billions of dollars on a network that many consumers dont want or 
need

it copies it collates and to the dismay of a 
capitol hill office it was the main course for a hardy footlong 
rat 
the staff at the office of the house legislative counsel viewed 
their sophisticated 93000 copying machine as the best ever until 
a rodent elusive to most exterminating efforts made the machine 
his home and restaurant 
he was obviously a smart rat office administrator lynne 
richardson said thursday 
while the staff was away the rat would play roaming the office 
for leftover food overturning plants and building a nest inside 
the xerox copier but far from its moving parts 
the repairman who came to fix the machine when it jammed just 
before adjournment found a nest of shredded paper surrounded by 
banana peels corn cobs rat droppings and a sealed bag with a 
hostess twinkie inside 
he also found that the rodent feasted on the copiers computer 
wires but smartly avoided the machines electrical wires that might 
have left the staff smelling a rat 
xerox deemed the machine a total loss and impossible to repair 
richardson said efforts to revive the copier were complicated by 
the type of wiring which relied on numbering rather than 
colorcoding 
the rodent nicknamed willard by the staff and adopted as an 
official mascot chewed through both the wires and the numbers 
the end result was a 107000 replacement for the nearly 
3yearold copier 
it was the best machine we ever had richardson said of the 
lost copier 
the rat saga was first reported thursday by roll call a 
newspaper that focuses on capitol hill news 
previous exterminating efforts to rid the office of the furry 
visitor included stuffing wall openings for pipes with steel wool 
setting traps with peanut butter and spreading poison powder in 
some areas 
but it wasnt until about two weeks ago that the staff received 
encouraging news from bob miley superintendent of the house office 
buildings who said three rats had been caught and one was 
suspected to be the offices rodent according to richardson 
the office administrator however has her doubts 
im not entirely convinced im really watching for 
evidence she said

the fbi settled a pair of complaints by black 
agents who said the agency discriminated against them when they 
worked in its chicago and omaha offices private attorneys said 
the settlement gives weight to allegations by a third black 
agent donald rochon who is suing the fbi for alleged racial 
discrimination when he worked in those two offices his attorney 
said 
it does confirm that donald rochon wasnt the only black who 
was harassed and discriminated against by whites in these same two 
offices attorney david kairys said on thursday 
attorneys for leadell lee an agent assigned to the chicago 
field office and gertie armstrong a clerk in omaha said they 
reached separate settlements of the complaints last summer 
kairys said he plans to call both ms armstrong and lee as 
witnesses if rochons case goes to trial both could provide 
evidence of a pattern of racial harassment that existed in the 
omaha and chicago field offices he said 
rochons lawsuit suit in federal court in washington claims he 
was the butt of racial jokes and death threats when he was assigned 
to the chicago field office 
his claims of harassment in omaha were upheld in administrative 
proceedings and are not part of the lawsuit in federal court in 
washington 
the lawsuit accuses fbi supervisors of tolerating racial 
harassment against rochon and his family and retaliating against 
him for complaining rochon is now assigned to the philadelphia 
field office 
the fbi declined to comment about the settlements spokesman 
greg jones confirmed there were two settlements but would not give 
further details saying bureau policy prohibited disclosure of even 
the names of the complainants 
the settlement last july of lees complaint resulted in the 
dismissal of his civil rights lawsuit filed in federal court in 
chicago said the agents attorney patricia motto 
lee who is now assigned to a suburban los angeles fbi office 
claimed that he was denied promotions because he was black the 
lawsuit also claimed that he was the victim of racial pranks 
lee testified in a pretrial deposition that fellow agents 
posted on the offices bulletin board a picture of a fat black man 
wearing underwear and smoking a cigar 
beneath the picture someone had placed the caption lee 
finally gets his promotion to supervisor in watts a reference to 
the black ghetto in los angeles ms motto said 
on another occasion he received a typewritten letter entitled 
twenty thousand niggers in heaven 
ms motto said that her client reached the settlement without 
receiving a promotion she declined to say if lee was given a 
monetary settlement 
all i can say is the matter was resolved satisfactorily she 
said 
rochon and lee worked together in the chicago field office at 
the same time for a brief period but were assigned to different 
squads ms motto said 
the omaha case involves a black fbi clerk who twice complained 
to the equal employment opportunity commission about racial 
discrimination that resulted in her being fired twice 
following her first dismissal the eeoc ordered ms armstrongs 
reinstatement with back pay after finding she was the victim of 
racial discrimination said omaha attorney clyde christian 
after her return to the omaha field office the racial 
harassment resumed christian said 
ms lee complained was dismissed again and filed a second eeoc 
complaint which was settled last august he said 
under the settlement ms armstrong was rehired with all 
benefits lost and transferred to the cincinnati field office 
christian said 
christian said the fbis willingness to settle reflected a 
determination by fbi director william sessions to get the 
department a new image 
christian said the bureaus lawyers had been taking a hardline 
position on the case but things started to change change in early 
1989

the fbi would not appeal a sweeping court order to end what a 
federal judge in texas found to be sweeping discrimination against 
hispanic agents

sen dennis deconcinis new television 
commercial makes brief use of a former banking regulators 
testimony that senators did not influence the lincoln savings and 
loan case 
but the ad leaves out the rest of the regulators testimony 
including his contention that deconcini offered a quid pro quo 
on behalf of the failing thrift and was made gullible by the 
bank owners campaign money 
most of the fiveminute commercial is a direct appeal to 
constituents from the arizona democrat one of five senators under 
scrutiny by the senate ethics committee for intervening with 
regulators in the massive thrift failure 
i have every confidence in your sense of justice deconcini 
tells viewers explaining he intervened with regulators because he 
believed lincolns owner charles h keating jr was being 
harassed by the washington bureaucracy 
keating deconcini points out in the commercial was not only 
lincolns owner but head of a firm american continental corp 
that employed 2000 arizona people 
for a brief moment the commercial moves from deconcini to the 
house banking committee hearing last november and the testimony of 
edwin j gray formerly the nations top thrift regulator as 
chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
deconcini spokesman bob maynes said it was proper that the 
commercial shows only the portion of grays testimony that favored 
the senator and not the assertion that deconcini tried to assert 
his influence 
people know that gray was critical of deconcini at the same 
hearing maynes said thats not the problem what people dont 
know is that under oath gray had to admit the senators had no 
impact on the regulation of lincoln 
its perfectly obvious that he gray didnt want to but had 
to admit that we picked gray purposefully because he had been the 
most critical 
deconcini and sens john mccain rariz alan cranston 
dcalif and john glenn dohio met with gray in deconcinis 
office april 2 1987 after keating complained banking regulators 
were harassing lincoln 
a week later those senators and banking committee chairman 
donald w riegle jr dmich met at grays request with regional 
bank board officials from san francisco who were examining lincoln 
keating or his associates donated 13 million to the five 
senators campaigns and causes 48000 of it to deconcini 
many of you may not know however that i gave the money back 
out of my personal funds deconcini told viewers several 
colleagues also returned keatings contributions in each case 
after the money became the subject of critical news stories 
in portions of grays testimony not shown the former regulator 
said he was asked by deconcini at the april 2 meeting to drop a 
rule barring risky investments by lincoln 
do you believe that sen deconcini was offering you a deal 
that if you withdrew the direct investment rule keating would make 
more home mortgages rep chalmers p wylie rohio asked gray 
gray said yes sir that is exactly what he said 
at another point gray testified it sounded like a quid pro 
quo it was a quid pro quo 
gray also testified the receipt of very substantial gifts 
from charles keating and his associates had long since put them in 
the right frame of mind to embrace the notion that there was 
somehow a vendetta against lincoln by regulators 
when enough money flows its apparently easier to be 
gullible 
the portion of the nov 7 1989 banking committee hearing in 
the commercial shows rep stephen l neal dnc asking gray 
did the federal home loan bank board ever take any action 
based on the comments or this intervention on the part of the 
senators 
gray no 
neal how can you blame these senators for 28 billion worth 
of damage if the federal home loan bank board never took any action 
based on anything they did 
gray did not respond the figure referred to some estimates of 
the taxpayers cost of protecting lincoln depositors 
the commercial is airing on 10 television stations in phoenix 
yuma and tuscon according to the political consultant who prepared 
it raymond d strother of washington a newspaper advertisement 
with a similar message will be published sunday

senate finance committee chairman lloyd 
bentsen will conduct trade talks with soviet officials in moscow 
next week his office says 
bentsen dtexas whose committee has jurisdiction over 
international trade matters in the senate was invited to the 
soviet union by government officials there 
under current law a us trade agreement with the soviet union 
would come before the finance committee for approval according to 
bentsens office 
secretary of state james a baker iii told bentsens committee 
at a hearing last fall that the united states could see 
restrictions on soviet trade lifted within the year if moscow 
writes its new emigration policy into law 
i think it is important that we actively explore increased 
commercial relations as one way to encourage this improvements in 
emigration law bentsen said 
we must also ensure that our trade relationship with the 
soviet union makes economic sense that any trade agreement 
provides us as good a deal as the european community recently got 
from the soviets bentsen said 
bentsen said the united states needs assurances that us firms 
would have access to soviet consumers

the airdriven artificial heart failed as a 
permanent device but scientists report work continues on a new 
generation of plastic hearts that would let patients live 
independent of external machines 
some researchers say the food and drug administrations 
withdrawal of approval for the jarvik7 device might hurt their 
work by creating doubt about the longterm feasibility of 
artificial hearts 
they agree that the future of artificial hearts lies in totally 
transplantable devices such as batteryrun devices that also could 
use external energy sources 
some day a patients plastic heart may beat from current 
flowing from his cars cigarette lighter says dr donald olsen a 
university of utah researcher developing the utah100 hydraulic 
heart 
the airdrive heart has failed as a permanent device said 
dr william pierce of the penn state medical center in hershey 
pierce implanted penn states first total artificial heart like 
the jarvik7 a pneumatic device in 1985 but the risk of strokes 
and infection facing recipients of the airdriven heart who 
remain mostly bedridden in hospitals linked by tubes to large 
compressors has sapped early hopes for the device 
its more than what people want to accept pierce said 
thursday 
recipients of the electric heart who will wear a battery pack 
will be able to walk exercise and even work he said 
the national heart lung and blood institute is financing 
research at penn state the university of utah the texas heart 
institute and the cleveland clinic on electric artificial hearts 
gerson rosenberg a biomedical engineer who leads penn states 
electric heart development said the school is in the third year of 
its 5year contract from the nhlbi and is testing the device in 
calves 
penn states airdriven device now is the only fdaapproved 
total heart 
rosenberg predicted the fda will consider a totally implantable 
electric heart by the late 1990s 
pierce and rosenberg said they doubt the decision to pull the 
jarvik heart from the marketplace will hinder research because the 
fdas comments focused on symbion inc of temple ariz which was 
producing the heart as the symbion7 
its regrettable that the symbion company didnt improve that 
device rosenberg said you shouldnt judge all artificial 
hearts by the jarvik there was an awful lot learned 
the jarvik had been criticized because recipients often 
experienced blood clots and strokes some researchers claimed the 
problems arose because of design problems in the sacs that pump the 
blood other criticism centered on the tube running to the air 
compressor 
the penn state total heart has been approved only for temporary 
use other companies produce assist devices which aid the hearts 
function 
at the university of utah where the jarvik7 was developed 
researchers have moved on to study a new generation of heart 
replacement devices known as the utah100 primarily for 
temporary use as a bridge to human heart transplant 
olsen said two models of the utah100 are being used in animal 
experiments one is airdriven requiring external heart drive 
hoses the other a hydraulically driven version is fully 
contained within the recipients chest 
the hydraulic model has generated the most enthusiasm and enjoys 
a fiveyear 56 million national institutes of health grant 
olsen said the nih has set a goal of having a totally implantable 
artifical heart by 1995 
the utah100 is elliptically shaped and smaller than the 
symbion7 its design includes an internal battery and a system of 
electrical induction coils located under and above the skin of the 
chest 
the coil on the outside could be connected to a variety of power 
sources including a battery pack a transformer tapping into 
residential power and possibly a device allowing the patient to 
draw power from a car battery perhaps through a cigarette lighter 
the jarvik heart first was implanted into 61yearold dentist 
barney clark on dec 2 1982 by william devries at the university 
of utah clark lived for 112 days on the jarvik7 and died after 
suffering a seizure pneumonia and kidney failure 
carolyn stadler of st charles mo held the record for living 
the longest on an artificial heart 440 days she received her 
second human heart last fall and died last week at 57 
experts believe 20000 to 75000 americans could use a 
transplant in 1988 1630 transplants were performed doctors and 
officials hope the artificial heart eventually will make up for the 
lack of live heart donors

proponents of artificial hearts fear the food and drug 
administrations withdrawal of approval for the jarvik heart could 
hurt research toward a totally implantable device but most see it 
as a temporary setback 
and they dont believe the action will have a serious impact on 
heart patients because other temporary heartassist devices still 
are available as a bridge to a heart transplant 
it is a shame because the jarvik for its limitation did make 
some positive contributions said dr antonio gotto chief of 
internal medical services at baylor college of medicine in houston 
and past president of the american heart association i hope this 
will be only a temporary not a permanent setback toward the goal 
of achieving a totally implantable heart the fda informed 
symbion inc of tempe ariz this week that it was withdrawing 
approval for continued investigational uses of its artificial 
heart both as a permanent replacement and a temporary bridge for 
patients awaiting a human heart transplant 
the jarvik heart named after its inventor dr robert jarvik 
gained household recognition after it was implanted in barney clark 
on dec 2 1982 he lived 112 days his new heart tethered to a 
bulky external power system before he succumbed to multiple organ 
failure 
in revoking symbions approval the fda said it had found 
serious deficiencies in manufacturing quality control 
monitoring of research sites servicing of equipment training of 
personnel and reporting of adverse reactions to fda 
dr donald olsen director of the university of utahs institute 
for biomedical engineering said he was surprised and 
disappointed by the fdas action and hoped it would not hurt 
future federal funding of artificial heart research in general 
particularly for totally implantable devices 
our concern of course is that this particular publicity will 
not have a negative influence on artificial heart development in 
general said olsen 
but i would like to make sure people know that the 
artificial heart did not fail it was a failure on the part of 
symbion to meet the requirements of the fda for improving the 
device 
gerson rosenberg a biomedical engineer who leads pennsylvania 
state universitys efforts to design an electric heart said he did 
not think the decision to pull the jarvik would hinder research 
but others felt the decision could slow research in the field 
by removing the jarvik you take the first and main artificial 
heart player out of the ballgame said dr jacob kolff who heads 
temple universitys efforts to develop the temporary philadelphia 
heart 
that leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think 
there may be a future for an artificial heart said the surgeon 
whose father dr willem kolff developed the first artificial 
kidney in 1943 
withdrawal of the permanent jarvik heart leaves only one other 
naturalheart replacement with fda investigational approval but 
that device is used only as a temporary bridge and only at hershey 
medical center of penn state 
other companies have approvals for temporary implants and for 
left ventricular assist pumps that help the natural heart work 
without replacement

after months on the sidelines because of a 
stocktrading scandal former foreign minister shintaro abe will 
attempt a political comeback next week with a trip to moscow 
analysts say hes after prime minister toshiki kaifus job 
abe who helped put kaifu in power five months ago is to meet 
monday with president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow the meeting 
has produced an avalanche of publicity for abe who currently holds 
no government or party post 
the moscow meeting will coincide with kaifus visits to poland 
and hungary at the end of his current tour of europe widely seen 
as the prime ministers attempt to demonstrate expertise in foreign 
affairs before the crucial parliamentary elections in midfebruary 
abe 65 seems to be putting himself firmly in the running if 
the governing liberal democratic party fares poorly in the 
elections but does not lose its majority and kaifu is shouldered 
aside 
he abe had been planning this for a long time and clearly 
hopes to use it as a steppingstone to the top post said 
political analyst asao yamaguchi 
igor latsyshev tokyo bureau chief for the soviet newspaper 
pravda said abe is a very wellknown person in the soviet union 
and has met with mr gorbachev before it is only to be 
expected that he could meet mr gorbachev 
major newspapers have reported that the government is 
considering sending abe to china in march to resume normal 
relations which were cooled after the bloody suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement last year 
the diplomatic drive marks a strong comeback for abe who 
analysts say was to succeed former prime minister noboru takeshita 
until the recruit scandal last year shook the foundations of 
japanese politics 
abe and takeshita were among many top politicians tainted by 
donations from the recruit co conglomerate which is accused of 
bribing other politicians and bureaucrats with bargainpriced share 
deals takeshita resigned as prime minister last april and abe 
relinquished the partys no 2 post but they maintain control of 
party factions 
they agreed on naming kaifu to replace takeshitas hapless 
successor sousuke uno who was embroiled in a sex scandal and 
resigned after the party lost badly in an election last summer for 
the upper house of parliament 
kaifu a member of a small party faction has no personal power 
base yamaguchi said kaifu has been reduced to little more than a 
spokesman while party power brokers such as abe takeshita and 
former deputy prime minister shin kanemaru run things 
they have ignored him for most of the past year the analyst 
said all he can really hope to do is wait for their decisions 
and then try to modify them to include his own ideas 
yamaguchi said kaifus weakness has become more apparent 
recently because the party elders desire to shape election 
strategy has drawn them out of the shadows 
scandaltainted leaders like abe and former finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa apparently hope their being reelected will bury 
the recruit issue and give them a mandate to return to the 
political forefront 
next months election is expected to be an uphill battle for the 
longgoverning party which has seen its popularity plunge because 
of the recruit scandal a sales tax it forced through parliament 
and agricultural policies that have alienated farmers 
kaifu said his goal is to maintain a simple majority or 257 of 
the 512 lower house seats 
analysts point out that just winning a simple majority would be 
little cause for the liberal democrats to celebrate since it would 
actually mean a loss of 37 seats and kaifu could be sacrificed to 
atone for such a poor showing 
abe a canny politician whose father was a lawmaker and whose 
fatherinlaw was the late prime minister nobusuke kishi will try 
to gain attention in moscow by telling the soviet leader its time 
for moscow to resolve a territorial dispute with japan and agree on 
a peace treaty to officially end world war ii 
abes backers portray him as the man who will be prime minister 
when gorbachev visits japan in 1991 my feeling is that gorbachev 
thinks abe is most likely to be japans prime minister when he is 
to visit japan next year said lawmaker toshio yamaguchi who 
will travel with abe to moscow 
all this planning depends on whether japanese voters are willing 
to forgive abe and other party leaders for their links to the 
recruit scandal

syria gave saudi arabia and other arab states 
an unpublicized written pledge to negotiate a timetable for 
withdrawing all of its 40000 troops from lebanon as part of an 
overall political accord reached with legislators of that country 
last october the washington post reported today 
the paper cited unidentified diplomatic sources in damascus and 
in other arab capitals 
the paper said its sources said the secret commitment was signed 
by syrian foreign minister farouk charaa during an oct 20 visit to 
damascus by his saudi counterpart prince saud faisal 
the sources said the document reflects what is already publicly 
stated in the taif accords that within two years of the formation 
of a national unity government and the initiation of political 
reforms syria will redeploy it troops from beirut to the western 
bekaa valley and then negotiate with the new government on a 
timetable for full withdrawal from lebanon 
the paper said syrian officials would not comment when asked 
about the secret pledge 
it said diplomats speculate that syria fears disclosure would be 
widely viewed as a victory for gen michel aoun the lebanese 
strongman who has marshaled christian opposition to the taif 
agreement on grounds it does not lay out a public timetable for 
withdrawal of the syrian military from lebanon

the government plans to spend about 1 million for the lavish 
ceremony and receptions afterward 
it will be the first royal marriage since 1984 and is expected 
to be a welcome respite after a year of mourning emperor hirohitos 
death last january 
todays ceremony which lasted less than one hour was to be 
followed later in the day by courtesy calls on the emperor empress 
michiko and aya by top government officials including heads of the 
legislature and supreme court 
shigeta clad in a black morning coat and carrying a silk top 
hat arrived at the kawashima in a limousine

the government of turkey is suing an american 
millionaire and his partners for the return of a 10 million 
collection of ancient silver coins that were allegedly dug up 
illegally and smuggled out of turkey 
about 1900 silver coins were excavated in the region of 
anatolia in 1984 and smuggled to dealers in west germany according 
to the complaint filed in federal court dec 29 
the coins which date to the 5th century bc are from the 
ancient greek and lycian cultures they include a number of 
decadrahms a rare group of athenian coins 
the complaint seeks return of the coins or payment of damages in 
excess of 10 million said lawrence kaye a lawyer with the new 
york firm representing turkey 
those named in the complaint include william koch of west palm 
beach fla his dedham business oxbow corp and oks partners a 
firm which includes koch 
carey ramos a lawyer for oxbow said the coins had been 
obtained from a munich dealer who documented his legal ownership 
the turks have no legal right to the coins he said 
athenians traveled throughout the mediterranean world who do 
the coins belong to if you want to get into a philosphical 
debate i suppose youd say they belong to somebody in athens 2500 
years ago said ramos 
but the turkish government has laid claim to all antiquities 
found on turkish soil since the beginning of the century kaye said 
the coins are a unique and invaluable collection theyre a 
part of the turkish heritage kaye said 
turkish law prohibits excavation without a license said harry 
i rand another attorney representing turkey 
the group that excavated the coins has been prosecuted and some 
members are serving prison sentences in turkey kaye said 
whether or not koch knew the coins were smuggled out of turkey 
under spurious circumstances is not the point rand said adding 
its a question of who has a superior right of possession 
without regard as to whether people acquired them in good faith 
ramos would not disclose how many of the coins were in the 
possession of his clients but connoisseur magazine in an article 
last year said the oks partnership had bought about 1650 coins 
for 27 million in 1984 koch later sold about 60 of the coins 
the magazine said 
john klarfeld an oxbow spokesman identified the dealers as a 
turkish family named telligaoglis and said they had obtained a 
legal bill of sale for some of the coins in massachusetts courts 
the turks are the ones that say these things we havent said 
anything where they came from is germany where before that no

one of the first single men to 
adopt children in florida pleaded guilty to sexually abusing three 
of his adoptive sons and another boy and got a 15year prison term 
one of the three adoptive sons supported the plea arrangement 
and said he was relieved the 2yearold case would not go to 
trial but another told the judge at thursdays hearing the 
sentence was too lenient 
david lindsey sr 45 had eight other adoptive sons not 
involved in the case and four of them were at the hearing and 
continued to support him 
lindsey declined to comment on his plea as he was fingerprinted 
in the courtroom handcuffed and led away to a courthouse holding 
cell 
but defense lawyer richard lubin said afterward that despite the 
formal acknowledgement of guilt lindsey maintained his innocence 
on all charges 
it was a pragmatic decision that he made lubin said 
lindsey had been convicted on sept 28 of lewd assault on a 
14yearold boy and lubin said he learned at his last trial 
that whether theres reasonable doubt or not you can easily be 
convicted of child abuse 
lindsey was sentenced nov 11 on the previous conviction to 5 
years in prison and three years of probation and was forbidden to 
have contact with children younger than 16 
he first sought permission to adopt a son in 1969 when 
singleparent adoptions were a rarity after two years of volunteer 
work at an orphanage he was given his first son he eventually 
adopted 11 boys 
in 1987 one of the boys went to authorities with allegations of 
sexual abuse after he had a series of quarrels with his adoptive 
father 
that boy supported the plea arrangement 
its been a longawaited day and im glad its here and we 
dont have to go through a trial he said i think it serves 
the interests of all of us in the long run 
but another of the adoptive sons lindsey pleaded guilty to 
abusing said at the hearing the 15year prison sentence was 
insufficient 
i dont agree because ive had some real problems with this 
man said the youth now 15 im having a real crisis 
palm beach county circuit judge thomas sholts said he understood 
the boys fears but said a plea would be better for him in the 
long run 
supporters of lindsey attending the hearing included his wife 
whom he married after adopting the boys his mother his two 
sisters and four of his other adopted sons who have backed lindsey 
since his arrest in june 1987 
lindsey had faced 17 sexrelated charges all involving three of 
his adopted sons and a fourth boy a friend of one of the sons 
lindsey agreed to plea guilty to one charge each against the four 
boys and the remaining 13 charges were dropped 
one of the charges lindsey pleaded guilty to involved a boy 
under 12 and carried a mandatory 25year sentence but that term 
was reduced under the agreement 
in addition lindsey cannot be prosecuted for any illegal sexual 
activity occurring before the plea whether prosecutors know about 
it or not 
lindseys sentence also includes psychiatric treatment and 
prohibits any contact with children under age 16 during his 
probation lindsey agreed under the plan to drop his appeal of the 
earlier conviction 
the judge also extended lindseys probation on the earlier 
lewdassault conviction from three to 10 years

china and the soviet union which support 
opposing sides in cambodias 11yearold civil war agree that the 
united nations should help settle the conflict a senior soviet 
official said today 
we in general are of the same opinion with our chinese 
colleagues that the un should play a very major role in the 
process of a settlement deputy foreign minister igor rogachev 
said at the end of a fourday visit 
actually i dont know who can deny the role of the united 
nations rogachev told reporters when asked about an australian 
proposal calling for a un trusteeship to administer cambodia 
until general elections are held 
the australian proposal is to be discussed at a meeting of the 
five permanent members of the un security council in paris 
starting monday rogachev said he will attend for the soviet side 
the other members of the security council are china the united 
states britain and france 
moscow has provided financial support for vietnams invasion of 
cambodia that installed a government in phnom penh china is the 
main backer of the antivietnam resistance in particular the khmer 
rouge guerrillas 
china has welcomed the australian plan but said there is no 
change in its support for resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouks plan calling for a fourparty coalition government 
including the three factions of the resistance and the 
vietnambacked hun sen government 
sihanouk himself has said he would back the un trusteeship 
idea if his proposal proves unworkable hun sen has voiced 
opposition to the sihanouk plan saying he does not want the khmer 
rouge included 
the khmer rouge held power from 1975 to 1978 and were blamed for 
the deaths of up to 1 million cambodians 
rogachev in a meeting with hun sen in phnom penh last month 
expressed firm support for hun sens position that he was 
willing to discuss setting up a un interim authority he said 
rogachev also denied that chinesesoviet relations have 
deteriorated because chinas hardline leadership blames soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev for the ouster of hardline leaders 
in eastern europe 
after these consultations im sure everything will go smoothly 
in our bilateral relations he said 
rogachev said chinese premier li peng will visit the soviet 
union very soon lis visit which follows gorbachevs trip to 
beijing last may is likely to be sometime this spring soviet 
sources have said 
during his stay rogachev held talks with foreign minister qian 
qichen vice foreign minister tian zengpei and liu shuqing

cambodian guerrillas claimed today that 
they struck the crosscountry route 5 hampering government 
transport and seized outposts near the fabled temples of angkor 
neither claim could be verified by sources in thailand and the 
media of the vietnameseinstalled government have claimed the 
guerrillas have been routed in recent fighting 
on the diplomatic front a soviet envoy visiting beijing said 
today that china and the soviet union which support opposing 
sides in cambodias 11year civil war agree the united nations 
should play a major role in settling the conflict a un security 
council meeting on cambodia begins in paris on monday 
the radio of the chinesesupported khmer rouge said the 
guerrillas cut three bridges in the latest attack on route 5 on 
jan 7 the 11th anniversary of the downfall of the communist khmer 
rouge government 
the attacks have nearly choked government transport on the 
road and strikes on an adjoining railway line have completely 
interrupted transport there it said 
route 5 runs from the thai border in the northwest to the 
national capital of phnom penh about 220 miles away 
khmer rouge radio claims often have exaggerated the success of 
the guerrilla strikes 
the group led by pol pot killed hundreds of thousands of people 
during its 3year rule of terror and famine before sovietbacked 
vietnam invaded in late 1978 and installed another communist 
government 
the noncommunist forces of prince norodom sihanouk allies of 
the khmer rouge said they seized four outposts 25 miles north of 
angkor wat in simultaneous attacks on jan 7 a statement said the 
outposts in varin district had been defending the capital of 
western siem reap province 
angkor wat an architectural wonder just outside the provincial 
capital was the capital of a large cambodian empire that reached 
its peak in the 12th and 13th centuries 
western diplomats said the khmer rouge appeared to be waging 
mainly psychological warfare by timing an increase in attacks with 
the jan 7 anniversary 
official reports from phnom penh have confirmed that there have 
been several explosions in the capital and that the khmer rouge had 
struck in the area of battambang the secondlargest city 
the guerrilla radio said thursday that after smashing strategic 
positions there jan 5 and 6 the guerrillas continued attacks 
along the sangke river in the east battambang town battlefield 
it claimed the guerrillas liberated 38 villages killed or 
wounded government soldiers and freed commune and village 
officials 
igor rogachev soviet deputy foreign minister said in beijing 
at the end of a fourday visit that moscow officials in general 
are of the same opinion with our chinese colleagues that the un 
should play a very major role in the process of a settlement 
an australian proposal which calls for a un trusteeship to 
administer cambodia until general elections are held is to be

californias civilrights agency said the 
federal immigration and naturalization service isnt doing enough 
to stop discrimination against foreignlooking jobseekers 
the state fair employment and housing commission said the 
federal agency has not educated employers adequately about an 
antidiscrimination provision in a 1986 immigration law leaving 
many of them afraid to hire hispanics and other ethnic applicants 
despite proof of legal residency 
the state commission in a report issued thursday called for a 
suspension of penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens 
until the ins improves its educational efforts and clears up its 
backlog of applications for workauthorization documents 
motivated by ignorance confusion and fear of sanctions some 
employers have engaged in citizenship status discrimination the 
commission said 
for example it said employers have rejected some types of 
valid workauthorization documents demanded documents only from 
applicants who appeared foreign or sought authorization documents 
from employees hired before 1986 whom the law exempted 
in addition the report said in its educational contacts with 
employers the ins places undue emphasis on employer sanctions for 
knowingly hiring undocumented workers and gives little or no 
attention to the antidiscrimination obligations of employers 
the report accused the ins of inactivity in filing 
discrimination complaints many immigrants and refugees are 
discouraged from filing such complaints by lack of knowledge 
fear of governmental authorities and fear of employer 
retaliation it said 
testimony cited by the commission indicated the ins appears to 
be targeting hispanic and other ethnic employers particularly in 
the restaurant industry for investigations and penalties 
the commission took testimony from employers workers unions 
and government officials last year at hearings in oakland fresno 
and los angeles 
its report follows other critical studies of the law by a new 
york state agency and a task force of the american civil liberties 
union and the mexicanamerican legal defense and educational fund 
ins spokeswoman virginia kice defended the agencys performance 
noting that it had spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours 
in educating employers about the immigration reform and control act 
of 1986 or irca 
the ins has done an excellent job of implementing this law 
ms kice said i dont think anyone can classify employer 
sanctions or irca as a failure 
but the california commission whose seven members were 
appointed by gov george deukmejian reported widespread ignorance 
of the laws requirements and its antidiscrimination provisions 
the 1986 law allowed aliens living in the united states since 
jan 1 1982 to seek legal residency provided fines of up to 
10000 for knowingly hiring undocumented aliens and prohibited 
job discrimination against those seeking legalization 
the commission called for changes in the law including a ban on 
discriminatory treatment of immigrant farm workers some of whom 
are being paid below the minimum wage 
at a news conference commission members said the laws touted 
goal of allowing the united states to regain control of its borders 
had led the ins to give the ban on job discrimination a low 
priority 
the purpose was supposed to be to stem the flow of illegals 
said commissioner osias goren discrimination became a secondary 
thing 
the california study has been submitted to the general 
accounting office a congressional staff agency which is scheduled 
to report to congress on the law this month 
if the gao finds widespread and pervasive discrimination 
congress will have 30 days to decide whether to repeal employer 
sanctions the gao did not make such a finding in a november 1988 
report despite concluding that about 528000 employers nationwide 
were hiring only us citizens or asking only foreignlooking 
workers for documentation

a federal court blocked principal 
sections of pennsylvanias 1989 abortion law the most stringent in 
the nation but abortion foes claimed victory because other 
sections were left intact 
the injunction was issued thursday just five days before the 
abortion law takes effect it struck down requirements that women 
notify their husbands before having an abortion and wait 24 hours 
for the procedure after requesting it 
attorneys representing the american civil liberties union 
planned parenthoodpennsylvania affiliates and the womens law 
project said the injunction would preserve womens rights to legal 
abortion 
the ruling is an important first step in the battle to 
preserve womens rights to choose abortion in pennsylvania said 
lawyer thomas e zemaitis speaking on behalf of the womens law 
project 
but abortion opponents noted that sections banning abortions 
because of a fetus sex and prohibiting most abortions after 24 
weeks of pregnancy were not challenged they said the injunction 
could be counted as a victory for their cause 
the real story today is not what was challenged in court but 
rather what was not said mary beliveau of the pennsylvania 
prolife federation this is good news for the prolife movement 
in pennsylvania 
the laws author republican state rep stephen freind said 
its a big step forward for the prolife side two great 
provisions go into effect next week 
judge daniel h huyett iii issued the decision only hours after 
lawyers for the state and prochoice advocates met in his chambers 
in reading pa a complaint challenging provisions in the law was 
filed by planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania and other 
clinics as an amendment to a pending case against the states 1988 
abortion law 
freind said he expected the case to go to trial by the middle of 
the year 
pennsylvania was the first state to take advantage of broader 
authority to restrict abortion granted under last years supreme 
court ruling in webster vs reproductive health services 
in that missouri case the court upheld a law that banned the 
use of public funds or facilities for abortion and required tests 
after 24 weeks of pregnancy to determine if the fetus could survive 
outside the womb 
antiabortion advocates have maintained the pennsylvania law 
could present the court with another avenue to reconsider the 
landmark roe vs wade decision which established abortion as a 
constitutional right in 1973 
but the two provisions most frequently cited as conflicting with 
roe vs wade the ban against sexselection abortions and a 
prohibition on most abortions after 24 weeks were not challenged 
prochoice attorneys said pennsylvania women were not seeking 
abortions after 24 weeks and that abortions to select the sex of a 
fetus have not occured in the state 
moreover they said abortions have effectively been banned after 
24 weeks except to save the life of the mother since 1974 
we are not scared of stephen freind or other legislators 
who continue to interfere with the private lives of the women in 
this state said kathryn kolbert an attorney for the american 
civil liberties union 
in april 1988 a federal judge blocked provisions in the states 
1988 abortion law that required teenagers to obtain the consent of 
at least one parent or a court order for an abortion and set up 
reporting requirements for clinics in 1986 the us supreme court 
stuck down key sections of the states 1982 law

the philippines says the united 
states has failed to live up to its commitments under a pact that 
allows washington to maintain military bases in the country 
a senior foreign department official said thursday that a list 
of the alleged violations of the accord signed by the countries in 
1988 would be delivered to the us embassy within a few days 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
philippine ambassador to the united states emmanuel pelaez will 
deliver a similar list to us secretary of state james baker iii 
under the accord the united states would give 962 million to 
the philippines in exchange for using clark air base subic bay 
naval station and four smaller bases during the last two years of 
the 1947 military bases agreement which expires in 1991 
a lease extension requires a new treaty to be approved by the 
23member senate where there is strong sentiment against the bases 
but several provisions of the current accord have not been 
fulfilled the foreign official said 
they include the united states converting 295 million of 
accumulated foreign military sales credits into grants providing 
8 million over two years to help philippine troops in improving 
base security and providing 10 million over two years to relocate 
squatters living near the bases 
we assumed good faith the foreign official said we dont 
want to quarrel with the americans we just want to get the money 
he said the philippines assumed that the united states would do 
all it could to fulfill the demands our understanding of best 
efforts is that they will exhaust all channels he added 
on tuesday foreign secretary raul manglapus said us budget 
cuts might reduce washingtons rental payments for its military 
bases 
president corazon aquino said monday that negotiations on the 
future of the bases might begin in march or april she has refused 
to say publicly how she feels about the issue

a small band of antinoriega 
guerrillas ruled this western border post for more than two weeks 
after us troops toppled gen manuel antonio noriega but the 
group is now disbanding its leader says 
jose echever said thursday he led a small band of men into 
panama from costa rica on dec 21 the day after the us invasion 
they controlled the border post 230 miles west of panama city until 
last sunday he said 
officials of us southern command wanted us to join the 
public security force but we werent interested echever said in 
an interview with the associated press 
the new government has dismantled noriegas defense forces and 
is creating a new force made up largely of former members but 
echever said he never wanted to wear a police uniform 
echever said he formed the hugo spadafora liberation battalion 
in 1987 naming it in honor of a noriega opponent who was killed in 
september 1985 spadaforas mangled body was found in a us 
mailbag in costa rica 
my idea was to free panama of noriega of his crimes and end 
all persecution said echever who dubbed himself commander 
junior 
echever said his group consisted of about 200 men 60 of them 
nicaraguan contra guerrillas who had previously been fighting 
nicaraguas leftist government he said the group was based in the 
mountains along the panamacosta rica frontier 
echever refused to say how many men took part in the dec 21 
operation but reporters who passed through this border post after 
christmas never saw more than 20 men in his group 
echever who is using a local restaurant as a command post said 
that as of thursday he was down to 11 men 
theyre trying to figure out where to go next echever said 
he said he himself would probably head for panama city 
he said members of the ussupported contra movement had 
provided training but that he had paid for the equipment and 
sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifles his men carried 
nobody gave us a single peso he said 
echever looking more like a pudgy businessman than a guerrilla 
despite his soldier of fortune baseball cap said he owns a 
coffee processing factory 10 miles to the west in costa rica and 
also owns businesses in miami and the panamanian port at colon 
his group may have been the source of rumors and unconfirmed 
published reports that a usfunded group of contras was operating 
against noriega 
echever said only five nicaraguans came along when he moved his 
men to the border post on the panamerican highway

a parliamentary commission is 
investigating allegations that ousted communist leader todor 
zhivkov violated the rights of ethnic turks and embezzled millions 
of dollars to build villas 
petar beron a commission member and prodemocracy activist 
said thursday that zhivkov will be charged and brought to trial 
after the panel completes its investigation probably by the end of 
january 
we think the charges will be abuse of power fraud 
crimes against the constitution depriving the whole people of 
their rights beron said 
zhivkov who ruled bulgaria for 35 years has not been seen in 
public since his ouster nov 10 government officials have denied 
he is under house arrest 
beron a member of the influential independent environmental 
group ecoglasnost said zhivkov was being protected from the 
wrath of the people at his residence at boyana near sofia 
beron said zhivkov would likely face charges of depriving the 
turkish minority of basic human rights he said zhivkovs campaign 
to assimilate the ethnic turks had provoked hatred on a racial 
ethnic and religious basis 
beron said the commission was looking into the drainage of 
public money by zhivkov who he said siphoned millions from 
governmentrun foundations promoting arts and education in order to 
build more than 30 villas and luxurious residences around the 
country 
lyuben kolishev a leader of the commission said tuesday that 
enough evidence had already been gathered on zhivkov to open 
criminal proceedings on charges of embezzlement of state funds 
kolishev said he had evidence that zhivkov had swiss bank 
accounts he gave no further details 
beron said the government asked swiss authorities to open the 
accounts but noted this would only be agreed to once a legal case 
was opened for crimes that would also be punishable under swiss law 
the former foreign minister petar mladenov replaced zhivkov as 
party leader nov 10 he has promised democratic reforms including 
the removal of the communists constitutionally guaranteed leading 
role in society and free elections expected before june 
the investigative commission led by the no 2 party leader 
andrey lukanov originally was formed by the communist party but 
was later replaced by a parliamentary commission that includes 
members of the opposition 
government officials began talks this week with nationalist 
leaders opposition figures and representatives of the ethnic 
turkish minority on how to defuse an outbreak of antiturkish 
sentiment that followed the communist leaderships decision dec 29 
to restore ethnic rights 
parliament president stanko todorov proposed thursday that a 
commission be established to review national policy he said it 
should be headed by mladenov the state bta news agency reported 
the commission is likely to be set up when parliament meets monday

the scientists who first posed the nuclear 
winter theory say a new study concludes the aftermath of an 
atomic war would be even worse than previously believed 
rp turco coauthor of a study appearing today in science 
magazine said the study shows that even a modest exchange of 
nuclear weapons could so fill the sky with smoke and soot that 
agriculture would be virtually wiped out for one season and could 
be severely affected the second year after such a war 
starvation would be widespread he said even in third world 
nations that are not likely to be hit by bombs 
it looks like most of the human population would be in 
jeopardy from a nuclear exchange turco said in an interview 
the basic physical principles have been confirmed by detailed 
research in the five years since we first proposed the theory 
the new findings concentrate on changes in rainfall patterns on 
the effects of black soot arising from atomic bombignited fires 
and on the creation of a vast ozone hole over the northern 
hemisphere 
turco said the study assumes that in even a small nuclear 
exchange the primary target would be oil and gas storage areas 
because such material is vital to military defense he said 
igniting those stores at once would put enough soot into the 
atmosphere to block the sun and even in july cause widespread 
freezing and destroy food crops for the year 
we need agriculture every year he said millions and 
millions would die 
smoke would eventually dim the sun all over the globe reducing 
solar intensities on a hemispheric scale by up to 50 percent the 
study estimates 
turco said the new studies also suggest that smoke in the upper 
atmosphere would cook away up to 50 percent the normal ozone 
layer creating an ozone hole over much of the northern hemisphere 
this he said would further cripple agriculture because of the 
effect of intense ultraviolet rays on plants ozone normally 
shields the earth from high levels of ultraviolet radiation 
this could be extremely significant and is something that 
hasnt been considered before turco said 
turco said the new studies also suggest the nuclear exchange 
would disrupt normal rainfall patterns summer monsoons essential 
to agriculture in parts of asia would be wiped out he said 
causing massive crop failures in china india and southeast asia 
predictions are less precise into the second year after an 
atomic war he said but some effects could continue for two or 
three years this could be enough to further disrupt agriculture 
which is quite sensitive 
coauthors with turco in the study were ob toon and jb 
pollack of nasas ames research center in california tp ackerman 
of pennsylvania state university and carl sagan of cornell 
university

heavy fog hampered the search today for a 
plane that disappeared with five people aboard including two us 
food and drug administration officials who were inspecting chiles 
agricultural exports 
the search for the twoengine cessna 206 began at 8 am near 
copiapo the desert city 500 miles north of santiago where the 
plane took off wednesday 
the aircraft was scheduled to arrive in santiago on wednesday 
night 
heavy fog and cloudy skies grounded some search planes during 
the morning but weather conditions cleared later and the operation 
resumed at full strength an official at the copiapo airport said 
in a telephone interview 
a daylong search thursday involving at least 21 planes and 
helicopters and land patrols turned up no sign of the plane 
authorities have said there was no indication of sabotage and 
that no guerrillas are believed to operate in the areas the plane 
was to fly over 
the americans fda officials john harty jr of silver spring 
md and patrick pouzar of nashville tenn arrived in chile on 
saturday 
they were checking security procedures in the harvesting 
packing and transport of chilean fruits being exported to the 
united states 
last year two grapes laced with cyanide were found in 
philadelphia in a shipment of fruit from chile the finding 
prompted a temporary suspension of the sale of all chilean fruits 
in the united states 
the chileans aboard the missing plane are oscar badilla a 
government agricultural official sergio lazcano an executive of 
the fruit exporters association and an unidentified pilot police 
officer german fuentes said 
police said the search was covering the 500milelong route 
between santiago and copiapo but rescue workers were concentrating 
on the copiapo area because the cessnas last radio contact 
occurred only 15 minutes after it took off from that city at 510

the vestiges of gen manual antonio noriegas militarism 
a contingent of 2200 troops of the 82nd airborne returned to 
their base at fort bragg nc today cheered by hundreds of 
friends and relatives 
in their stead are 4400 engineers and civil affairs troops who 
have arrived in panama in recent days to help rebuild areas 
destroyed in the us invasion dec 20 army lt col james swank 
said thursday 
theyre nationbuilding types of soldiers he said

panama swank said 
on thursday president guillermo endara and vice president 
ricardo arias calderon began demolishing panamas old defense 
forces headquarters 
from the ashes of militarism a new era is born in which the 
state is for the wellbeing of the people endara said as he 
swung a sledgehammer at what had been the heart of noriegas 
sixyear dictatorship 
in another sign that the old order had crumbled the leader of 
noriegas paramilitary troops the dignity battalions surrendered 
to us troops benjamin colamarco an economist had been in 
hiding since the invasion

surrounding defense forces headquarters and sparking some of the 
looting that devastated panama city after the invasion more than 
20000 residents in the chorrillo neighborhood were left homeless 
panamas new government plans to rebuild the area and replace 
the headquarters with a democracy plaza the us government 
has said it will donate 35 million to the project

to stand trial on drugtrafficking charges 
noriegas wife and children have taken refuge in the cuban 
embassy arias who also is foreign minister said they will not be 
given safe conduct to go to the dominican republic where another 
daughter lives 
he said felicidad noriegas wife and their daughters sandra 
lorena and thais are accused of covering up a crime and using goods 
obtained illegally 
she is a citizen if there are complaints against her her 
fate is that of any citizen arias said 
rey sierra goitia a private lawyer filed the complaint against 
mrs noriega according to sources at the attorney generals 
office the government must investigate the charges

britains foreign secretary will begin a 
fourday visit saturday with the difficult mission of reassuring 
residents of british support as china prepares to assume control of 
this crown colony 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said this week that hong kongs 
prosperity is in danger as apprehension increases about 1997 when 
china takes over 
beijings communist government has agreed to maintain hong 
kongs capitalist economy for 50 years 
hong kong is suffering a hemorrhage of talent and professional 
skills hurd wrote in londons daily telegraph we have a duty 
to provide additional reassurance and persuade people to remain in 
the territory 
because of chinas june 34 crackdown of its prodemocracy 
movement relations between hong kong and china have hit their 
lowest point since chinas cultural revolution 
the basic law the blueprint for chinese rule after 1997 will 
be completed by march the last phase in the critical negotiations 
began this week when hong kongs governor sir david wilson went 
to beijing for the first time since june 4 
wilson said today that he and chinese officials explained their 
positions on the colonys political future but neither side 
reported concrete agreements in three days of talks 
there is still discussion to take place on how the political 
model evolves wilson said at the airport before flying home 
we have made considerable progress in trying to explain sensibly 
and clearly what the problems are on both sides and trying to reach 
understanding about them i think its been a useful visit in that 
context 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted premier li peng as 
telling wilson he was glad to see that on some issues the two 
sides are drawing closer but he did not elaborate 
sharp exchanges were reported thursday between wilson and deputy 
foreign minister zhou nan a hardline official tapped to become 
chinas senior representative to hong kong 
londons position in the colony is strained by a widespread 
feeling that it has abandoned hong kongs 57 million people to the 
chinese government protests are expected during hurds visit 
each attempt by london at a confidencerestoring measure has 
sparked a strong negative reaction from beijing in hong kong 
britains moves are criticized as being too little too late 
further complicating the issue is the widely condemned forced 
repatriation of vietnamese boat people which began in december 
political analysts business leaders and intellectuals say 
hurds visit his first to the colony as foreign secretary will do 
little to restore confidence among the people 
we listen much more to what china says than to what britain 
says said simon murray group managing director of hutchinson 
whampoa ltd which runs the colonys port and other key businesses 
five years ago britain agreed to return hong kong to chinese 
rule in 1997 in return for beijings promise not to touch the 
colonys freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years 
but confidence in beijings agreement evaporated after it 
crushed chinas studentled prodemocracy movement in june about 
1000 people emigrate every week and the number is believed to be 
rising 
britain announced last month that it would give about 50000 
british passports to key officials and professionals with the aim 
of encouraging them to stay in the colony after 1997 but china 
accused britain of breaking their agreement and hinted it would not 
recognize the passports 
in hong kong businessmen and activists criticized the move as 
not going far enough to give the colonys scared citizens a 
security net they said the government should hand out at least 
250000 passports which would place about 1 million people under 
the british flag 
the establishment of democracy in hong kong is another hot topic 
china wants only 30 percent of the legislature elected after 
1997 but britain has been pushing for about 50 percent and for 
expanded elections in 1991

abortion for his comatose wife saying it might help her recover

i hate to say i told you so but it helps to confirm in my 
mind that i made the correct decision martin klein told the new 
york times for a story published today 
klein told wcbstv on thursday that his wife nancy who 
regained consciousness in june is making slow but steady progress 
talking slowly and learning to feed herself 
mrs klein who was 18 weeks pregnant lapsed into a coma after 
a car accident on dec 13 1988 although her chances of emerging 
from the coma were slim doctors told her husband that her chances 
would improve slightly if she had an abortion 
but when he sought to have the abortion performed he was 
challenged by antiabortion factions and a legal battle ensued that 
eventually was resolved by the us supreme court 
the abortion 11 months ago made it safer for mrs klein to 
receive medication said dr caroline o mccagg medical director 
of the center for head injuries at the robert wood johnson jr 
rehabilitation institute in edison nj 
the times reported in its friday editions that mrs klein is 
able to talk is slowly regaining her memory and wants to go home

thousands of moslem women calling 
themselves the vanguard of chastity paraded through irans capital 
today in a campaign against moral decadence which they said is 
creeping into iranian society 
the demonstration was part of a fundamentalist backlash against 
the more liberal attitudes that have emerged in the islamic 
republic since the august 1988 ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
president hashemi rafsanjani is seeking to improve ties with the 
west to secure badly needed foreign investment for postwar 
reconstruction iranian hardliners oppose closer western ties 
the protesting women wore black chadors the cloaklike 
headtotoe robes that islamic teachings dictate they wear in 
public the official islamic republic news agency said they marched 
through tehran and to tehran university campus where rafsanjani 
was delivering his weekly prayer session 
the demonstrators expressed support for the government formed 
in august after a presidential election but demanded it do 
everything to counter the corrupt culture of the west 
hardliners fear that allowing western culture to flourish in 
iran as it did before the 1979 islamic revolution will undermine 
the revolution 
since the ceasefire and the june 3 death of irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini there has been a 
visible relaxation in observance of the islamic code that 
revolutionary zealots enforced with such severity in the first 10 
years after the revolution 
irna monitored in nicosia said todays demonstrators read a 
ninepoint resolution calling for women to be allowed more 
participation in political social and cultural life 
it also called on iranian women to avoid the vain luxurious 
mode of life and observe the islamic dress code it asked the 
state broadcasting authorities to clean up their programming 
eschew corrupt values and propagate islamic values 
the postwar period has seen many young women abandoning the 
chador for scarves and using cosmetics that have long been banned 
some men also have been dressing more stylishly turning their 
backs on the drab revolutionary garb many now wear ties 
considered a symbol of western decadence 
the radical publication jomhuri islami has condemned the trend 
and each day publishes letters calling for strict enforcement of 
islamic values 
one letter signed by qorban husseini of tehran complained 
it has been observed that tehran shops now sell neckties 
miniskirts a full span above the knee and so on when 
shopkeepers are asked why they try to promote corrupt western 
clothing they say that television is allowed to show them 
under a 1987 law the punishment for failing to observe the 
islamic dress code is 1020 lashes or a hefty fine the newspaper 
said that unfortunately the law has been put aside 
the magazine pasdare islam even criticized chess which 
khomeini decreed two years ago was religiously sanctioned and 
boxing one of the most barbaric manifestations of the deviant 
western culture 
which chess player has led or played an influential part in 
any revolution the magazine asked what scientist or inventor 
has used chess to develop his creativity

east germanys communist premier today bowed 
to opposition demands and dropped a plan to form a new secret 
police force before the nations first multiparty elections in may 
through may 6 no offices will be created in this area 
premier hans modrow said referring to election day and the 
controversial plan members of east germanys 500member parliament 
responded with a round of applause 
plans for a new national security agency including a secret 
police force had drawn bitter opposition from members of modrows 
coalition government as well as from the opposition 
the reformist communist government last month abolished the 
hated stasi secret police but modrow had said some kind of 
internal security force was needed to guard against alleged dangers 
from neonazis and others 
opposition leaders said decisions on the sensitive issues of 
internal security should wait until a democratically elected 
government takes over 
modrow still faces further challenges to his leadership before 
the elections including demands of proof that the old secret 
police apparatus has been fully dismantled 
in addition some of the noncommunist partners in the coalition 
government oppose election rules drawn up by the communists which 
they say could hurt the noncommunists chances of winning in the 
electon 
if the law is passed in its present form our party may not be 
able to stay in the govermnent christian democratic chairman 
lothar de maiziere said in an interview today with the west berlin 
radio station rias 
the liberal democrats another coalition partner also oppose 
the draft election law 
objections focus on a provision of the law that would ban 
campaign aid from outside the country the provision is aimed at 
west germans already gearing up to help the opposition and 
noncommunist parties 
as parliament met today to discuss the countrys woes more than 
200 east berlin taxi drivers drove in a line to the parliament 
building honking their horns to show their displeasure with the 
government 
disputes have been common in east germany since a prodemocracy 
movement ousted hardline communist leader erich honecker on oct 
18 touching off a wave of reforms that led to the formation of the 
coalition government 
thursday evening 3000 prodemocracy supporters staged a noisy 
protest outside parliament down with the communists and out 
with the stasi they chanted stasi a shortened form of 
staatssicherheit or state security is the popular name for 
the secret police force 
demonstrators lowered several east german flags from their poles 
and ripped out the communist hammerandcompass symbol from the 
center 
thursdays disclosure that the key figure in an east german 
financial scandal was a highranking secret police officer seemed 
likely to increase friction 
the man alexander schalckgolodkowski was a colonel in the 
east german secret police 
he is wanted in east germany on charges of embezzlement after 
reportedly absconding with tens of millions of dollars that ended 
up in swiss bank acounts says dietrich schultz west berlins 
prosecutor general 
schalckgolodowski had been the governments chief foreign 
trader and the official in charge of bringing in badly needed 
western currency 
schultz cited schalckgolodkowskis secret police role as the 
reason for the west berlin prosecutors refusal to extradite him 
back to east germany where treason charges and a death sentence 
are a possibility 
schalckgolodkowski who also allegedly ran a ring that 
illegally sold weapons to countries in africa south america and 
the middle east turned himself in to west berlin authorities on 
dec 6 he was freed on tuesday

fees for grazing livestock on public land 
administered by the forest service will be reduced slightly 
beginning march 1 the agriculture department agency said today 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said monthly 
fees for grazing stock on national forests in 15 western states 
will be lowered five cents to 181 per head month 
the decrease will apply to forests in arizona california 
colorado idaho montana nebraska nevada new mexico north 
dakota oklahoma oregon south dakota utah washington and 
wyoming 
a head month was defined as a months use and occupancy of 
public range by one weaned or adult cow bull steer heifer 
horse burro or mule or five sheep or goats 
the fee reduction is expected to apply to more than 9000 
livestock owners who hold grazing permits for national forest land 
more than 19 million animals mostly cattle are grazed on the 
ranges each year fees are expected to total about 102 million 
grazing fees are determined by a formula that takes into 
consideration the fair market value of forage involved along 
with changes in private gazing rates beef cattle prices and the 
costs of livestock production 
officials said the current reduction is based primarily on 
increases in cattle production costs which in 1989 exceeded gains 
in both beef cattle prices and the private grazing rates 
no fees were announced for 1990 grazing on national grasslands 
in nine states a forest service spokeswoman diane hitchings said 
those will be announced in a week or so

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said today the us invasion of panama was a military 
success but future incursions into third world nations may not be 
as easy 
looking at the military operation alone the men and women who 
planned and executed operation just cause can take justified pride 
it was a success rep les aspin dwis said in a report to 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
the committee chairman said us forces who invaded panama in 
the early hours of dec 20 were fortunate because the panamanian 
defense forces took few hostages and their leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega did not stay and fight 
we were just plain lucky aspin said later at a news 
conference where he disclosed that at the start of the invasion 
panamanian forces took control of 347 passengers aboard a brazilian 
airliner that had arrived at torrijos international airport 
the panamanians however were talked out of holding the 
passengers as hostages aspin said 
noriega who eluded us capture for several days sought asylum 
in the vatican embassy in panama city on christmas eve he turned 
himself over to us authorities last week and is being held in 
miami on drugtrafficking charges 
aspin said noriega had information ahead of time on the us 
invasion but evidence indicates he did not act upon it the 
lawmaker suggested that indications of an invasion had become so 
routine that noriega discounted them 
the very success of operation just cause will lead many i 
suspect to tout it as a model to be applied to other situations 
aspin said i believe however that there are several aspects of 
the panamanian operation that probably are unique and limit its 
applicability 
among the advantages according to aspin was the knowledge of 
panama and its people based on long us involvement there the 
presence of about 13000 us troops already stationed in the 
country and the lengthy time the united states had to practice for 
the invasion 
aspin who traveled to panama on jan 45 with a congressional 
delegation said that despite recent criticism there were no major 
failures of us intelligence 
the administration came under criticism shortly after the 
invasion and while noriega was still at large that intelligence 
efforts failed because the panamanian leader had not been captured 
aspin said these were not intelligence failures but rather 
they are typical of the risks associated with any military 
operation 
us military planners did not fail to anticipate their 
possible occurrence but proceeded with operation just cause 
hedging reasonably i believe against the risk they might 
occur he said 
however aspin said there were errors as us military planners 
underestimated the determination of the panamanian defense forces 
and the paramilitary dignity battalions 
he also said the us southern command in panama city should 
have anticipated that noriega would flee to the vatican embassy in 
light of the fact that 30 of his supporters had already done so 
despite the success militarily aspin said significant problems 
remain including reviving the panamanian economy creating a new 
security force ending panamas role in drug trafficking and 
establishing a stable democratic government 
obviously the united states must play a big part in making 
this happen otherwise its military intervention will have been in 
vain he said

wholesale prices jumped 07 percent in 
december to boost inflation for 1989 to 48 percent the worst 
showing in eight years the government said today 
the gain in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of retail topped last years rate 
of 40 percent and was more than double the 1987 rate of 22 
percent 
it marked the third consecutive year that price increases have 
accelerated and was the steepest rise since the index shot up 71 
percent in 1981 
for december and all of 1989 inflation was driven largely by 
steep gains in energy prices 
in advance of the report most analysts were expecting a more 
moderate gain of 05 percent stock prices unsettled by inflation 
worries and by market declines in tokyo and london dropped 
sharply with the dow jones industrial average tumbling 4373 
points to 271690 in the first 90 minutes of trading 
in a separate report the commerce department said retail sales 
rose a disappointing 02 percent in december producing an annual 
gain of 5 percent that was barely ahead of inflation and was the 
most lackluster showing in seven years 
were starting the year with the worst of both possible 
worlds inflation accelerating and growth slowing said economist 
david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co inc a government 
securities dealer in new york normally what you want is strong 
growth and low inflation if you can get it 
the wholesale price number for 1989 masked a rollercoaster ride 
that had prices rising at better than a 9 percent annual rate in 
the first five months of the year slowing to a 1 percent annual 
rate from june through november and then soaring again in december 
prices had fallen 01 percent in november and risen 04 percent 
in october 
energy prices increased 14 percent for the month and 96 
percent for the entire year compared with a 36 percent drop in 
1988 
the deep freeze that gripped much of the nation last month 
helped boost fuel oil prices 71 percent and natural gas costs 16 
percent gasoline prices were unchanged after falling 71 percent 
in november 
for the year fuel oil was up 339 percent the biggest rise 
since 1979 when fuel oil prices rose 705 percent gasoline rose 
92 percent for the year and natural gas 35 percent 
the cold also played a role in food costs last month which rose 
a moderate 05 percent overall prices for vegetables shot up 41 
percent and for eggs 47 percent but those gains were somewhat 
offset by substantial price drops for pasta pork turkey and 
shortening and cooking oil 
food inflation for the year was 50 percent an improvement over 
57 percent in 1988 when a summer drought seared the nations farm 
regions 
for the year egg prices were up 409 percent on top of a 421 
percent rise in 1988 pork prices rose 194 percent and dairy 
products 143 percent however fresh fruit declined 104 percent 
chicken 89 percent and fish 57 percent 
the inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors shot up 06 percent last month in large part because of a 
45 percent jump in tobacco prices auto prices rose a brisk 06 
percent but for the year were up only 21 percent because of weak 
sales 
economists often look to the prices of goods other than food and 
energy for an indication of underlying inflation pressures for the 
year that sector rose 42 percent down slightly from 43 percent 
in 1988 
economists attribute the stability outside food and energy to 
the policies of the federal reserve board which slowed the economy 
with higher interest rates until june since then the central bank 
has been allowing rates to fall in an effort to stop the country 
from toppling into a recession 
most analysts expect the sluggishness to persist well into the 
first half of this year taking the edge off price hikes 
the various changes in december left the price index for 
finished goods at 1153 percent of its 1982 base that meant that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost 11530 in december up 
from 110 a year earlier 
at earlier stages of the production process prices fell 01 
percent at the intermediate level rising 24 percent for the year 
at the crude level they shot up 18 percent last month the 
steepest rise since march and 69 percent for the year 
the annual increase at the crude level was supported largely by 
a 35 percent rise in petroleum prices the sharpest in 10 years 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods

a mistrial was declared in the case of a 
couple accused of kidnapping their adult daughter from a religious 
group because jurors couldnt resolve 13 counts against the 
parents and three others 
superior court judge david moon jr declared the mistrial 
thursday after the jury said it was deadlocked on kidnap false 
imprisonment and battery charges against the five defendants 
earle and dorothy brown both 58 of santa cruz were charged 
with abducting their daughter ginger from a northern san diego 
county parking lot in may 1988 and holding her for five days at an 
escondido home to try to deprogram her 
ginger brown then 22 had joined a small coronadobased 
religious group called great among nations which her parents say 
is a cult whose leader benjamin altschul brainwashes his 
followers 
also charged in the case were the browns other daughter holly 
25 of san francisco los angeles deprogrammer cliff daniels 35 
and his associate hank erler 23 of escondido 
all five were ordered to return to court today to face a 
possible second trial on additional charges of conspiracy 
kidnapping and false imprisonment 
a pretrial ruling by moon split charges against the defendants 
three of whom were acquitted wednesday of seven other charges 
creating the need for two trials 
prosecutor gary rempel said he didnt know whether district 
attorney ed miller intends to press forward with the second trial 
or seek to try the defendants again on the charges jurors were 
unable to decide 
im incredibly happy that even though weve had every 
roadblock put up against us they still were unable to find 12 
people who would convict us holly brown said 
earle and dorothy brown said the mistrial was a hollow victory 
because their daughter remains lost to them 
we loved her in the past we love her now and well never 
stop loving her said earle brown who recently began treatment 
for cancer 
ginger brown said she would continue her activities with the 
group and hoped her parents would understand 
i am continually hoping for reconciliation its up to them 
ive told them how i felt she said 
she also said she had been upset with media coverage of the case 
put this story right show my pastor show his wife show my 
dog show what i am not what cliff daniels and his cult awareness 
network wants us to be painted as she said 
the defendants admitted they took ginger brown but contended 
they did so to prevent greater harm to her 
jurors split evenly on kidnapping and battery charges against 
daniels and deadlocked 84 to acquit him of false imprisonment 
the panel voted 75 to acquit earle brown of kidnapping and 84 
to acquit him of battery while splitting evenly on a false 
imprisonment charge against him 
the jury also voted 102 to acquit holly brown of kidnapping and 
93 to acquit her mother of the same charge 
holly and dorothy brown each were acquitted wednesday of false 
imprisonment and battery while erler was acquitted then of 
kidnapping false imprisonment and battery

an fbi agent says investigators now believe that 
the ku klux klan or other organized white supremacists were not 
involved in last months series of racially motivated mail bombs 
that killed two people 
fbi special agent charles archer of mobile ala said thursday 
that investigators have characterized the likely bomber as a man in 
his 50s who is independent of any supremacist group 
we feel he is 50 or older is a loner and someone not known to 
associate with any of the white hate groups archer told the 
montgomery ala advertiser we have no information that the 
klan or any similar groups are involved in any of the bombings 
in another development the atlanta constitution reported today 
that the type of string used to tie the bomb packages was made by a 
textile mill that stopped making the product seven years ago a 
fact that could help investigators narrow their search for the 
bomber 
authorities previously had indicated that white supremacists 
might be behind the bombs sent to alabama georgia and florida a 
group or person using the name americans for a competent federal 
judicial system claimed responsibility for the bombs that killed 
us circuit judge robert vance and savannah ga attorney robert 
robinson last month and made reference to racial motivations 
bombs also were intercepted safely at the 11th us circuit 
court offices in atlanta and an naacp office in jacksonville fla 
william hinshaw the fbi agent coordinating the investigation in 
atlanta cautioned against placing too much credence in any suspect 
profile at this point there are suspects all over the place 
he said 
the birmingham ala news quoted unidentified sources as saying 
federal authorities have investigated and rejected about a dozen 
suspects since the first pipe bomb exploded dec 16 killing vance 
at his mountain brook ala home 
the constitution said investigators are looking for retail 
outlets that carry the cottonandrayon string 
the newspaper also said investigators believe the string was 
tied around the packages by an automatic stringtying machine such 
as ones found in textile printing and mailing facilities 
agents are examining machines throughout the state in hopes of 
finding one with remnants of the string used on the bombs the 
newspaper said 
meanwhile the fbi confirmed today that threatening letters were 
sent to at least five judges or courts in ohio 
douglass ogden senior supervisor in charge of the fbis 
columbus office said the agency was investigating letters sent to 
the ohio supreme court in columbus to common pleas court judges in 
crawford and wyandot counties and to the 3rd and 5th ohio district 
courts of appeals in lima and canton respectively 
the fbi would not say whether the letters contained death 
threats 
the mail bombings will not intimidate black leaders said rosa 
parks the black woman whose refusal in 1955 to give up her seat on 
a bus to a white man sparked what became the civil rights movement 
of the 1960s 
i wont enslave myself to fear mrs parks said thursday in 
tallahassee fla 
mrs parks 76 said the bombings reminded her of the very 
serious threats of lynching in her younger days 
we had no protection whatsoever and i lived through 
that said mrs parks who was to speak today at florida state 
universitys annual convocation commemorating the birthday of 
martin luther king jr

laos will allow the united states to 
search for the remains of its servicemen from the vietnam war in 
its country in all areas except those along the border with 
vietnam a us congressman said friday 
nouhak phoumsavan president of the laotian parliament made the 
comment in a meeting thursday with six visiting us congressmen 
said rep james inhofe rokla 
inhofe said there would be no restrictions on the methods used 
to search for the missing servicemen 
the words he used were a free hand to come in and pursue 
excavations and search in any area that they had 
jurisdiction he said 
we can go virtually at will from the commitment he made 
yesterday he said 
he opened up he said we will allow you to go anywhere 
except for the border of vietnam over which we dont have 
jurisdiction inhofe said 
us military experts went to laos this month to excavate two 
crash sites in southern laos inhofe said one of the sites appeared 
to hold the wreckage of a large aircraft 
he said it was unlikely any missing soldiers were still alive in 
laos but at least we have the door open for the first time to go 
and look 
about 2300 americans are listed missing from the vietnam war 
of whom about 545 are believed to be in laos

the parish about 180 miles up the mississippi river from new 
orleans 
nevertheless as of thursday the parish had 22000 less in 
federal money to deal with its problems 
madison was one of 126 us counties cut from the emergency food

see stories about people in san francisco getting help after the 
earthquake and people who were hit by hurricane hugo getting help 
well let me tell you something those tragedies only hit every 20 
years or so mine stays here forever 
the parish lost its eligibility because it had fewer than the 
required 1000 unemployed people according to the programs 
figures 
the figures showed 883 jobless people wyche said he was sure 
the figures were wrong 
were going to protest were going to try to get a survey to 
prove its wrong we dont have people sleeping in vacant buildings 
or cardboard boxes but weve got a lot of poor people barely 
getting by he said 
counties dont apply for grants rather they are told if a 
formula qualifies them for money and then must come up with a 
spending plan the grant money may be used to buy and distribute 
food run homeless shelters assist with mortgages or help the poor 
pay energy bills 
we have a good need in this parish said pierre a scott 
president of the council on aging madison parish can use any

bills dollar store or drive to vicksburg and thats 20 miles away 
the kids are all moving out of town theres not even a picture 
show the closest one is 20 miles to the east or 65 miles to the

a state appeals court says a legal doctrine that 
let victims recover stolen property forcibly should be buried with 
the rest of the old wests frontier justice 
but a lawyer whose client was convicted of armed robbery says 
her client was just doing what police are too busy to do when he 
grabbed a bicycle he claims had been stolen from him two years 
before 
it isnt the old west thats dying here says the attorney 
carol carrigan its common sense 
the case arose in 1987 when dale ira schaefer then a 
32yearold landscape worker with a record of petty thefts 
burglary and assaults spotted a bicycle at a convenience store in 
phoenix 
schaefer claimed the bicycle had been stolen from him two years 
before displayed a pistol and took the bicycle from charles 
milton according to trial testimony 
milton said the bicycle originally worth about 200 had been 
purchased by a relative at a yard sale for 25 about two years 
earlier 
a jury convicted schaefer of armed robbery and judge armando de 
leon sentenced him to 10 years in prison 
schaefer appealed saying de leon should have instructed the 
jury on the claim of right defense an old doctrine that says 
the owner of property can take it back by force if it is stolen 
court of appeals judge rudolph gerber said thursday in a 
decision upholding de leon that the claim of right defense was 
recognized more that a halfcentury ago when selfhelp remedies 
were an accepted part of arizonas frontier history and culture 
revisions to the states criminal code since then suggest that 
the doctrine is outdated gerber said 
from a public policy standpoint the claim of right defense 
remains anachronistic it encourages disputants to resolve disputes 
on the streets through violence instead of through the judicial 
system he added 
i just dont think the authorities are available on a 24hour 
oncall basis for this type of situation ms carrigan replied 
gerbers decision means you have to find your nearest police 
officer and hope to heck it property hasnt walked away in the 
meantime she said as a taxpayer i find it rather offensive 
paying 30000 a year to keep in prison a person a citizen who 
takes back his own property

a new highway sign proclaiming minnesota 
the brainpower state insults tourists the senate majority 
leader said 
its as if we said to them welcome to minnesota too bad 
youre not smart enough to live here roger moe said thursday in 
a letter to gov rudy perpich 
transportation commissioner len levine said only one sign on 
interstate 94 near hudson wis has the slogan it was added about 
three weeks ago to the minnesotashaped welcome sign which also 
contains the traditional reference to minnesota as the land of 
10000 lakes levine said 
perpich who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term often 
refers to minnesota as the brainpower state to tout its 
educational achievements moe is expected to announce he is 
challenging perpich later this month 
moe said that when he first heard about the sign idea he thought 
it was a joke now he wonders what visitors will think 
do they think were so arrogant we have to brag about how 
smart we are or do they think its just a public relations gimmick 
by people pretending to be better than they really are in either 
case its silly a waste of taxpayers money and an insult to 
tourists from other states we want to see return to minnesota 
moe asked perpich to order levine to remove the sign before 
our neighboring states demand proof of your claim 
perpich had no immediate comment ray bohn perpichs spokesman 
said 
levine said the suggestion to advertise the states educational 
status was made a few months ago by a transportation official from 
another state levine sent the idea along to officials of his 
department who oversee highway signs and they recommended the 
brainpower slogan be tested on one sign he said 
motorists are being surveyed about their reaction to the sign 
levine said after a few days of getting the reaction we will 
then be able to decide whether that slogan should stay up whether 
another should be added whether the shape of the sign should be 
changed whether it should remain the same or whether land of 
10000 lakes should be changed levine said

portugals prime minister anibal cavaco silva 
said friday he suggested to president bush that portugal assume an 
active role in reviving usbacked peacemaking efforts in angola 
cavaco silva also said he had told bush it was completely 
unrealistic for the united states to refuse to recognize the 
government of angolas president jose eduardo dos santos the 
united states is one of only three countries along with israel and 
south africa which have withheld recognition of angolas 
sovietbacked government he said 
talking with reporters over breakfast cavaco silva said he had 
told bush at their two meetings thursday that portugal favors 
direct negotiations between the angolan government and the 
usarmed unita rebels 
we dont believe too much in mediation he said although 
portugal had supported the usbacked initiative that appointed 
zaires president mobutu sese seko as a mediator between the 
warring angolan parties last june 
mobutus mediation efforts have stalled repeatedly while a 
ceasefire agreed to by the sides last summer broke down 
government troops last month launched a military offensive against 
unita forces in southern angola and a meeting of eight african 
leaders scheduled this week in luanda to discuss the peace talks 
was canceled 
both dos santos and unita leader jonas savimbi have apparently 
lost confidence in mobutus neutrality and ability to bridge their 
differences 
cavaco silva said portugal knows the area best having ruled 
it as part of its network of african colonies for 500 years we 
can help were accepted by both sides 
the united states too can help the process along by adopting a 
less partisan stand the portuguese leader said dos santos asked 
that cavaco silva urge bush to be more neutral the prime 
minister said 
dos santos is expected here next month at the invitation of 
several dozen members of congress critical of the administrations 
support for savimbi we cant ignore dos santos its totally 
unrealistic cavaco silva said 
he said there didnt seem to be much difference between 
portugals views and those expressed by bush although a us 
official told reporters thursday that the two leaders did not 
agreed on everything in discussing angola 
the administration under pressure from conservatives in 
congress has been funneling at least 40 million in covert aid to 
savimbis forces annually in recent years mostly through zaire 
cavaco silva said he told bush that in order to bring the sides 
to the negotiating table it is necessary to reduce all 
interference from abroad 
the united states contends the soviet union continues to arm the 
angolan military and to maintain advisers there to train government 
forces earlier this week the state department criticized the 
soviets for their support of the latest military offensive 
but cavaco silva said the soviets have reduced their presence in 
angola along with the pullout of the estimated 50000 cuban troops 
that began last year and is advancing ahead of schedule toward its 
completion later this year 
the portuguese leader left washington friday to meet with un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar before heading home

a report on hospital mortality rates doesnt take 
into account how sick people are when theyre admitted and 
therefore high rates may unnecessarily scare patients say 
researchers who analyzed the study 
the widely used federal report published by the health care 
financing administration uses a computer analysis of medicare 
claims at each of the nations nearly 6000 hospitals the results 
compare the mortality rates of each institution 
researchers publishing in todays journal of the american 
medical association say the hcfa results are misleading 
without knowing that the severity of illness no physician 
could make a good judgment about that patients prognosis lead 
researcher jesse green said thursday if a physician cant do it 
theres no way a computer can do it 
greens study said the report may also have an inherent bias 
against public and teaching hospitals since those hospitals treat 
more severely ill patients 
the federal report called medicare hospital mortality 
information has been compiled for the past three years by the 
hcfa an arm of the us department of health and human services 
it uses statistical techniques to compare predicted hospital 
mortality rates with the actual number of deaths 
the most recent 14volume report published last month 
indicated that 34 percent of the nations hospitals or 196 
hospitals had higherthanexpected death rates in 1988 
federal officials have cautioned each year that the report 
should not be used as the sole measure of a hospitals quality the 
latest report used revised calculations including such factors as 
whether a patient was admitted through a hospitals emergency room 
to more accurately account for the severity of illness 
but green and his colleagues at new york university medical 
center said the report is still seriously misleading 
the improvements are worthwhile but they should not be called 
severity of illness adjustments because they are not based on 
clinical information about how sick the patient was said green 
who heads the medical centers department of health policy research 
louis b hays acting hcfa administrator on thursday disputed 
greens study saying the report is not perfect but it reflects 
frankly the best opinions of the community out there of health 
care statisticians and researchers 
the study published in jama is of little value to us he 
said 
hays said refinements in the morbidity report have made it an 
increasingly reliable tool for consumers 
greens study examined the admission records of 34252 medicare 
patients discharged from 13 hospitals nationwide in 1986 the 
patients were divided into five diagnostic categories and 
classified according to how seriously ill they were at the time of 
admission 
the number of instances of a mortality rate above the hcfas 
predicted range were reduced to chance levels when patient severity 
of illness was taken into account the authors wrote 
hays said backup studies his agency have conducted which 
include measures for severity of illness confirm the findings in 
the federal report 
but green said the governments report should not be used by 
patients to decide where they should be hospitalized because the 
effect of severity of illness is much larger than the effect of 
quality i think that it unnecessarily creates fear in the mind of 
consumers

president mikhail s gorbachev promised 
a national vote on republics right to secede but lithuanian 
leaders today rejected it as a trap and said gorbachev had 
underestimated their republics desire for freedom 
gorbachev meanwhile traveled to the lithuanian countryside in 
an effort to stop lithuanias independence campaign 
the president his voice cracking with emotion at times 
predicted on thursday night that lithuanians would opt to stay in 
the soviet union once they realized the difficulty of secession and 
the hardships it would place on ethnic groups in their republic 
now people dont know what awaits them he said theyve 
been told fairy tales russian fairy tales and lithuanian fairy 
tales 
his comments were broadcast today on lithuanian television 
the kremlin leader is in the middle of what so far has been a 
futile campaign to stop the secession movement probably the worst 
political crisis gorbachev has faced in his nearly five years in 
office 
gorbachev noted the soviet constitution guarantees each of the 
countrys 15 republics the right to secede and disclosed that the 
first draft of a law detailing the process of secession has been 
written 
the leader of lithuanias proindependence sajudis movement 
vytautas landsbergis today said of the announcement its a 
propaganda trap 
if we get entangled in the mechanism of seceding from the 
soviet union we automatically act as if we were a legal part of 
the soviet union 
his group maintains that lithuanias incorporation into the 
soviet union in 1940 was illegal lithuanias communist party 
already has declared itself independent from the central communist 
party 
gorbachev promised a national discussion and referendum on the 
law which would require republics to hold their own votes on 
breaking away 
i favor the existence of a mechanism to secede to stop this 
speculation let there be a choice by the people gorbachev 
said 
the audience broke into applause and broad smiles 
he gave no clear details about the draft law but implied it 
would require a republic considering secession to make detailed 
plans set out the exact costs both financial and in terms of 
human dislocation and then hold an election 
you have relations with all the republics with all states 
you must resolve all the problems such as what to do with the 
people who want to leave and who will get the homes and the jobs 
they leave behind gorbachev said 
instead of euphoric calls for freedom gorbachev said people 
should be given concrete information on how secession would take 
place and what they have to live through 
they have to know what secession is then let them decide 
he added 
he predicted lithuanians would reject secession in favor of a 
loose soviet federation saying they would never feel free if their 
lives improved at the expense of ethnic russians poles and other 
nonlithuanians who live in the republic 
when the audience objected gorbachevs voice rose it will 
never happen he nearly shouted you are a civilized people 
your conscience wont let you 
kazimieras motieka a sajudis leader said gorbachev had badly 
miscalculated lithuanians 
no economic blockades no threats no gloomy predictions will 
stop the lithuanian people motieka told a news conference 
soviet dictator josef stalin absorbed lithuania latvia and 
estonia in 1940 under a secret agreement with nazi germany 
the main goal of gorbachevs threeday visit is to reverse the 
lithuanian communist partys decision last month to break with the 
national party 
he began thursday by plunging into crowds in vilnius the 
capital and debating lithuanians one on one 
most lithuanians greeted their president with warm smiles and 
handshakes but they appeared unmoved by his plea about 300000 
jammed the central square of vilnius late thursday in a candlelight 
demonstration for independence 
gorbachev today went to siauliai 125 miles northwest of 
vilnius to visit a collective farm and a television parts factory 
the official tass news agency said 
siauliai home to a large concentration of soviet armed forces 
personnel is closed to foreigners including reporters 
gorbachev also planned to meet with a rival communist party 
organization created by mostly ethnic nonlithuanians who profess 
loyalty to moscow and the soviet communist party that gorbachev 
heads 
gorbachev appeared to be in good spirits when he arrived 
thursday but he grew increasingly somber as the day wore on 
lithuanian television showed gorbachev in a confrontation with 
an elderly worker at a vilnius factory who wore a sign saying 
not more rights but full independence 
gorbachev told the man lithuania was provincial before it became 
part of the soviet union and since then has become a developed 
country 
the worker replied and do you know how many lithuanians were 
deported in the 1940s and how many died 
a visibly exasperated gorbachev said i dont want to talk 
anymore with this old man if such attitudes and slogans exist in 
lithuania then very hard times are coming 
there were signs of local defiance toward centralized soviet 
rule elsewhere thursday 
in armenia the legislature amended the republics constitution 
to give itself veto over national laws it sees as conflicting with 
armenias interests said yerevan activist rafael popoyan 
in latvia lawmakers followed the lead of their lithuanian 
colleagues and amended the constitution to create a multiparty 
system the evening tv news program vremya reported the 
amendments end the communist partys constitutional guarantee of 
political power and allow latvians to form rival parties that do 
not advocate overthrowing the existing state system or other 
anticonstitutional goals the report said

the new provisional government today 
held a memorial for those who died in the revolution and thousands 
of protesters shouted kill the communists and booed romanias 
new leaders at a rally 
on thursday french foreign minister roland dumas became the 
first highranking western official to visit since communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescus ouster and he discussed plans to help 
romanias new government 
interim president ion iliescu declared a day of mourning for 
those who died in the armybacked popular revolution that toppled 
ceausescu last month 
this is the friday of our mourning and national liberty a 
priest at the patriarhie orthodox cathedral told worshipers packing 
the 300yearold church in downtown bucharest friday will be 
from now on a sacred and blessed day for the romanian people 
iliescu premier petre roman and other leaders of the 
provisional government attended the solemn service which was 
broadcast live on state radio and television it was conducted by 
patriarch teoctist the spiritual leader of the romanian orthodox 
church 
later in the day 5000 demonstrators mostly young people 
gathered outside the headquarters of the interim government and 
shouted slogans such as down with communism and kill the 
communists 
the protesters booed iliescu a former communist and other 
government leaders who tried to address the crowd and burned a 
communist flag and party identification papers at the emotional 
demonstration witnesses said 
government critics have said too many people who belonged to the 
communist party are now serving in the new government 
the daily romania libera carried an appeal from members of the 
dissolved romanian communist party calling on members to burn their 
party cards at places where martyrs of the revolution died as a 
public condemnation of any idea of recreating a new communist 
party 
after ceausescus ouster officials said the romanian communist 
party which was totally discredited by the former leaders harsh 
rule had automatically ceased to exist 
the news agency rompres quoted silviu brucan a senior member of 
the ruling national salvation front as saying that 10000 people 
died in the revolt 
dumas conveyed a message from president francois mitterrand 
pledging support for the consolidation of the conquests of the 
popular revolution and for political stability the official 
rompres news agency said 
dumas later told a news conference that projects under 
discussion included a development bank and healthrelated programs 
but he declined to elaborate 
iliescu thanked france for its offer of aid 
france and romania have historically strong ties before world 
war ii many romanians went to france to study and french was the 
main foreign language spoken in the country 
official bucharest radio said some people stole and sold for 
profit goods received as aid from abroad following the uprising 
and said the national salvation front decreed prison terms of three 
to 10 years for the offenders 
the broadcast did not say how many speculators were caught but 
newspapers have been increasingly critical of dubious people 
handling distribution of medicine food and clothing from some 
centers in bucharest 
some of them pretending to help in unpacking the foreign 
goods just waited for the right moment when they could steal 
something the daily adevarul said 
the decree signed by iliescu also provides for confiscation of 
private property of the thieves attempts to steal or sell such 
goods for profit are also punishable 
rompres said the front also reduced the punishment for illegally 
crossing the border under new regulations illegally entering or 
leaving romania is punishable by a 15 to 30day jail sentence or a 
fine formerly people caught trying to cross the border illegally 
drew lengthy prison terms or were beaten 
ceausescu was toppled on dec 22 he and his politically 
powerful wife elena were executed on dec 25 after a secret trial 
in which they were convicted of crimes against the state

hollands approach to drugs which treats an 
abuser not as a criminal but as an unfortunate with health and 
social problems could teach something to the united states say 
american diplomats in the hague 
dutch policy is often mistranslated and misinterpreted as 
indulgent or permissive in fact in this society it operates 
as a powerful social control according to a report from the us 
embassy 
drugs are illegal in the netherlands but possession of an ounce 
or less of any drug including hard drugs such as cocaine heroin 
lsd and amphetamine generally is not prosecuted and marijuana 
cases are seldom prosecuted unless very large quantities are 
involved the report said 
marijuana and hashish are sold openly at an estimated 650 night 
clubs and coffee shops throughout the netherlands the sales are 
tolerated if the buyer is at least 18 years old and there are no 
harddrug sales publicity or advertising and the amounts sold 
must be no larger than 30 grams 
in light of our own problems a goal for us 
policymakers might be an educational approach said the report 
dated may 26 and made available this week to the associated press 
eddy engelsman the dutch director of drug policy said he found 
the embassy reports views rather surprising because we do know 
that the official opinion of the united states is not very 
positive 
decriminalization of some drugs has been a growing issue in the 
united states as the drug market thrives and spawns violence 
former secretary of state george shultz and us district judge 
robert w sweet of new york are among prominent officials who have 
said the idea should be seriously studied 
but william j bennett the us drug policy coordinator 
adamantly opposes any move toward decriminalization calling it 
stupid and morally atrocious he says providing clean needles 
to addicts the practice in holland muddies the message even 
though medical experts have said the sharing of dirty needles has 
contributed greatly to the spread of aids 
italy recently reversed its 15year experiment with drug 
legalization noted bennett spokesman don hamilton saying former 
prime minister bettino craxi told bennett the experience was a 
disaster 
the european experience as a whole as opposed to the 
reportedly good results in holland dont give us reason to think 
legalization or decriminalization of possession is likely to 
produce any good results in the united states hamilton said 
and catherine shaw spokeswoman for the state departments 
office of international narcotics matters said thursday that the 
department has not officially endorsed the report 
theres no shift in policy from what i can tell that would 
look more favorably on a lenient drug policy she said i cant 
say that study reflects a us government position 
shaw said she was unsure who wrote the report the copy obtained 
by the associated press was unsigned 
the report said dutch policy focuses on the drug abuser it 
views him primarily as an unfortunate with health and social 
problems rather than primarily as a criminal it attempts to keep 
him above ground and it wants him within reach of medical 
authority the policy attempts to stabilize his life and to limit 
the damage he causes to society to family and to himself it 
encourages and provides immediate therapy 
it is unlikely that many elements of dutch drug policy 
successfully could be wrenched out of their social and cultural 
contexts the report said however certain of the mechanics 
such as lowthreshhold therapy mobile treatment units and needle 
exchange might well be adaptable to the american reality 
dutch policy has resulted in low levels of drug abuse and 
virtually no crack market 
a study done in december 1988 showed that in the 10to18 age 
bracket only 18 percent said they had used cannabis in the 
previous month said engelsman who heads the dutch ministry of 
healths alcohol drugs and tobacco branch 
by contrast a recent survey of almost 400000 us students in 
grades six through 12 by the national parents resource institute 
for drug education inc found 91 percent of students said they had 
smoked marijuana at least once in the previous month 
we just dont push people underground engelsman said in a 
telephone interview thursday we think the drug problem is a 
normal problem like a lot of other social and health problems 
thats why im also responsible for alcohol and tobacco policy 
the embassy report said the dutch contrast their own drug 
situation with the growing drugrelated violence wracking some 
areas of the united states and conclude that their national 
policy to confront it was on a true course 
the netherlands has only 60 to 80 drug abuserelated deaths per 
year in a population of nearly 15 million the report says an 
average of about one per 214000 people 
there were some 6756 drug abuserelated deaths reported in 1988 
to the us drug abuse warning network by medical examiners in 27 
areas of the nation that sample works out to about one drug death 
per 37000 people 
holland also has about 800 aids cases about 65 of them drug 
abusers giving the netherlands about one aids case per 18750 
people in the united states the centers for disease control says 
that as of nov 30 aids had been diagnosed in 115158 americans 
or about one aids case per 2167 people

republic peretz said 
a crowd of several hundred people blockaded the communist party 
and government headquarters and took over the radio station to 
broadcast their opinions about the armenian move he said no one 
was injured and the protest ended peacefully after a few hours 
with no arrests peretz said 
unrest in azerbaijan also occurred earlier this month on the 
border with iran azerbaijanis who wanted to be united with their 
ethnic brethren across the frontier rampaged for several days 
around new years tearing down border fences and putting guard 
towers and communication lines out of commission 
the soviet foreign ministry says restrictions on border crossing 
will be eased and it is working with iran to accomplish that and 
keep the area calm 
the armenian measure that caused the lenkoran unrest also was 
condemned by president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet 
leaders on wednesday 
they also criticized an azerbaijani bill that put forth a claim 
to nagornokarabakh the officials said both measures were void 
the latest unrest comes as gorbachev is touring lithuania in a 
bid to persuade the restive baltic republic to drop its demands for 
independence 
azerbaijanis who are predominantly shiite moslem have been 
holding mass rallies to protest the armenian legislatures action 
and have resumed a railroad blockade of armenia which mostly 
christian 
the national legislature in moscow in november disbanded a 
commission that had imposed direct kremlin rule on 
nagornokarabakhs 160000 people the resolution said the area is 
part of azerbaijan and will be controlled by local government 
bodies under the supervision of a national commission

charles stuart tried to enlist two of his brothers 
in the plot to murder his pregnant wife and one became at least an 
unwitting partner and the other begged off of any sort of crazy 
thing a lawyer said 
attorney richard clayman told reporters thursday that his 
client michael stuart and another brother matthew were the only 
family members who knew of charles involvement in the crime before 
jan 1 
but he also revealed that michael stuart had been approached by 
charles weeks before the oct 23 slaying but did not realize the 
significance of the overture 
a grand jury met today to hear testimony in the stuart case 
three days after the shooting that his brother claimed had been 
at the hands of a mugger matthew stuart told michael stuart that 
he had disposed of the suspected murder weapon at his brothers 
request matthew and michael stuart did not share their knowledge 
with the rest of the family until shortly before charles stuart 
committed suicide jan 4 clayman said 
the appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that some 
type of conspiratorial scenario existed by and between all of these 
family members sitting around talking about keeping something 
hidden that is not true said clayman 
accompanying clayman at a news conference were michael and mark 
stuart and two sisters shelley yandoli and neysa porter matthew 
stuart did not attend 
the boston globe reported today that charles stuart had asked a 
truck driver for help in killing his wife but the man refused 
stuart told the man his wife refused to get an abortion the paper 
said citing investigative sources 
investigators found a third bullet in the car in which the 
shootings occurred the boston herald and the globe reported today 
the bullet reportedly was either in the roof liner or the left 
visor 
the herald said investigators were trying to determine if the 
bullet had been fired by a third person in the back seat but the 
globe said authorities believe stuart fired the shot to back up a 
story that the robber fired at his head missed and fired again 
stuart was shot in the stomach his wife in the head 
the herald also reported being told by an unidentified family 
source that matthew told family members the gun believed used in 
the shootings was passed to him by charles over the body of his 
dying wife 
matthew who was in another car reportedly told police he had 
seen something in the passenger seat of his brothers car but did 
not know it was carol 
clayman was asked if charles stuart ever asked michael stuart 
for assistance in killing his wife 
there may have been an early disjointed vague conversation 
by and between charles stuart and my client michael stuart weeks 
before oct 23 the day of the homicide which at that time had no 
significance to mike clayman said 
clayman who declined to elaborate on the contents of the 
discussion said michael stuarts response was a definitive i 
dont know exactly what youre talking about but im not getting 
involved in any sort of crazy thing youre talking about 
clayman said matthew stuart had told michael stuart of the 
homicide within three days of the crime he said his client would 
tell a grand jury investigating the incident anything they want to 
know 
i am comfortable that there is no violation of law that 
his hands are legally clean clayman said 
law experts say there is no legal requirement in massachusetts 
for someone to come forward with knowledge of a crime 
clayman also said the stuart family wanted people to know they 
loved carol stuart and that their family and her parents had 
suffered greatly 
stuart told police after the shooting that he and his wife were 
attacked by a black mugger as they left a birthing class at a city 
hospital but last week matthew stuart told authorities he met his 
brother at the crime scene without realizing a shooting had 
occurred and retrieved mrs stuarts handbag which contained 
personal items and the gun 
meanwhile divers searched the pines river again for a gold 
watch and a ruby ring items stuart reportedly said were stolen 
when he and his wife were shot a snubnosed 38caliber revolver 
believed used in the crime was recovered tuesday 
in another development black state legislators met with 
democratic house speaker george keverian on thursday to ask for a 
special legislative commission to look into the dragnet police 
conducted in black neighborhoods for the suspect 
gov michael dukakis said the commission would be a good idea as 
long as it did not interfere with the investigation 
investigators have yet to disclose a convincing motive for the 
crime dismissing earlier reports involving drug use or an 
extramarital affair 
one theory is that stuart wanted to leave the fur store where he 
worked and open his own restaurant but felt his wife and a baby 
would be a nuisance

pope john paul ii on friday lauded the 
collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe saying they had 
been tragic utopias which brought an unprecedented regression in 
the tormented history of humanity 
in a speech to a meeting of the pontifical council for culture 
the pope gave his most extensive comments to date on the changes 
sweeping eastern europe although he did not mention any specific 
countries 
a great hope has been raised for freedom responsibility 
solidarity spirituality the polishborn pontiff said referring 
to this privileged hour we are now living 
the great ideologies have shown their failure in the face of 
the difficult challenge of events the socalled scientific systems 
of social renewal have revealed themselves in the eyes of the 
world for what they really were tragic utopias which brought an 
unprecedented regression in the tormented history of humanity 
john paul praised the heroic resistance of the christian 
communities against inhuman totalaritarianism 
todays world rediscovers that far from being the opium of 
the peoples faith in christ is the best guarantee and stimulant of 
their freedom he said 
much still needs to be done he said 
walls have crumbled he said frontiers have opened but 
huge barriers still stand between hopes for justice and their 
realization between opulence and misery 
the society of tomorrow should be different in a world that no 
longer tolerates inhuman static structures from east to west 
north to south the history in progress puts in question an order 
which was based before on force and fear he said 
all of europe wonders about its future while the collapse of 
totalitarian systems calls for a deep renewal of politics and 
provokes a vigorous return to the spiritual aspirations of peoples 
by necessity europe seeks to redefine its own idenity beyond 
political systems and military alliances 
the pope also referred to the changes in eastern europe in 
separate remarks to a delegation of austrians and west germans 
the extraordinary developments of recent months have 
demonstrated in an impressive way how great the significance of 
faith and religion is for change of political and social 
situations

catawba county got only one bid for the 
rights to its safesex poster that urges if you cant keep it 
zipped keep it covered 
the bid came from the same hickory advertising firm that 
designed and printed 2500 copies of the poster 
the san francisco aids foundation has enough posters of its own 
while the national lesbian and gay health foundation likes the 
concept but has no use for it and the sign is too tame for the 
gay mens health crisis in new york where condom use is promoted 
by such posters as a rubber is a friend in your pocket 
the county health department developed the poster of an unzipped 
pair of blue jeans which advertises free condoms at local health 
departments 
in october ministers parents and others protested saying the 
poster was vulgar catawba commissioners responded by voting to 
sell the copyright 
health officials estimating the poster cost 6000 hoped a 
nationally recognized health group would buy it and promote it 
i was disappointed catawba health educator tamara 
dempseytanner said 
dempseytanner said she contacted 36 aids adolescent pregnancy 
and healthrelated organizations she thought might be interested 
it was a good poster i think it will be effective the rev 
michael weeks weeks administrative director for the national 
lesbian and gay health foundation in washington said thursday 
if youve created controversy you probably have a winning piece 
of educational material 
weeks said his organization sponsors conferences and answers 
peoples concerns but doesnt produce and distribute posters 
in new york the gay mens health crisis wants harderhitting 
messages 
we have our own posters promoting condoms and we distribute 
them ourselves said spokesman carisa cunningham ours are 
pretty explicit pretty explicitly gayoriented 
barringer amp associates offered 2500 for the poster copyright 
county commissioners are expected to approve the sale tuesday night 
barringers bid is 1500 less than the county paid the 
advertising firm to produce the poster phil barringer president 
of the firm said he plans to market the poster to other 
organizationsm 
his wife barbara barringer a nurse at valdese general 
hospital helped develop the poster and won a north carolina nurses

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will hold talks in 
moscow feb 67 to make preparations for a june superpower summit 
in washington the two governments announced friday 
bakers agenda includes arms control issues human rights and 
regional conflicts state department spokesman richard boucher said 
in moscow vadim p perfiliev a spokesman for the soviet 
foreign ministry said discussion of a new treaty to reduce 
strategic nuclear weapons was expected to dominate the 
bakershevardnadze talks 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
isolated three treaty problems for the moscow talks 
the most complex concerns how longrange airlaunched cruise 
missiles carried by bombers should be counted against a treaty 
limit of 6000 strategic warheads 
the two other issues are the kind of data from missile tests 
that could be encrypted or disguised and where surplus or 
nondeployed missiles would be stored 
even settling these three problems would not wrap up the new 
strategic arms reduction treaty start which bush and gorbachev 
would like to sign at their june summit in washington 
for instance the two sides are in sharp disagreement over 
sealaunched cruise missiles 
perfiliev said questions of a militarypolitical nature will 
be especially deeply discussed and first of all those connected 
with the completion this year of work on a treaty on a 50percent 
cut in strategic offensive weapons 
boucher responding to questions said baker was also likely to 
discuss with shevardnadze developments in lithuania and latvia he 
reitered us policy is to support selfdetermination 
asked if this meant the bush administration supports 
independence for the baltic republics the spokesman said i 
would not want to draw a distinction 
gorbachev is on a threeday visit to lithuania appealing to the 
35 million people there to remain in the soviet union he said 
thursday his program for economic rehabilitation of the country 
depends on what happens in lithuania

jurors who acquitted a woman in a stabbing 
case have taken the unusual step of telling the mayor police chief 
and others that the woman should never have been charged and that a 
policeman should be suspended 
we believe it was because of cursory indifferent and racially 
biased police work that betty burns one of our native american 
citizens was maltreated even incarcerated unjustifiably for over 
four months the jurors said in a letter to mayor don fraser 
police chief john laux and others 
the letter signed by all 12 jurors and an alternate accused 
sgt robert nelson of badgering burns with various forms of 
mental cruelty lies blame guilt threats of physical violence 
assertions of white dominance and the threat of a lengthy jail term 
until he got her to confess to something she never did 
nelson a 20year veteran of the department said thursday that 
the allegations are unfounded 
part of what grabbed me was this could happen to any one of us 
at any time and how are we going to get out of this fix that betty 
burns was in juror carla rohwedder said thursday 
the jurors acquitted burns last november and their letter was 
sent this week rohwedder said friday it took time for all 13 jury 
members to reach a consensus phoning each other and rewriting the 
letter 
laux said thursday that he has turned over the jurys 
accusations to the police internal affairs division 
deputy chief dave dobrotka who will conduct the investigation 
said some of the allegations specifically that nelson coerced 
burns into confessing to the assault involve possible criminal 
violations the investigation also will look into whether burns 
civil rights were violated he said 
laux would not comment on the allegations except to say that 
nelson has an outstanding record in this department 
fraser said he is taking the jurys letter very very 
seriously 
i think the way the letter is written and the amount of detail 
thats provided all demand a thorough investigation and thats what 
will happen he said 
burns 31 who turned down a plea bargain at the start of her 
trial said she is grateful and surprised by the jurys action 
judge roland amundson who presided over the trial said many 
of us see things that are unjust but we rarely act upon them 
because we have so many other things to care about or concern 
ourselves about 
burns was accused of stabbing her boyfriend sheldon geshick in 
an alley on june 23 
geshick had a deep gash that went into his brain and several 
other wounds and suffered expressive aphasia which made him 
unable to say what he wanted to say 
nelson said he eventually was able to make out geshick saying 
betty stabbed me he later got a confession from burns in 
which she admitted stabbing geshick five or six times 
the jurors letter said nelson used bullying and coercive 
tactics to extract the confession from burns a mildnatured 
quiet and timid person 
in an interview thursday burns said she started to tell nelson 
what she had told police earlier that she had gone home ahead of 
geshick but nelson slammed his fist and hollered at her to 
tell the truth 
i was afraid i thought he was going to hurt me she said 
nelson defended his interrogation a confession obtained that 
way wouldnt be worth the paper it was written on slamming your 
fist on the table just dont work

more than 200 scientists are eager 
to examine the bussized experimentladen space lab retrieved 
friday by columbias astronauts 
the information theyll get should tell much about how various 
materials and systems withstood nearly six years of being pounded 
by micrometeoroids blasted by cosmic rays and corroded by atomic 
oxygen 
knowing this scientists and engineers will be better able to 
design americas space station freedom and other longterm 
spacecraft such as those planned for the star wars missile 
defense system 
the long duration exposure facility or ldef has 57 experiments 
aboard including one to collect interplanetary dust and more than 
12 million tomato seeds that will be subjected to student testing 
after an initial survey of the recovered satellite the 
astronauts reported some corrosion damage to a few of the 
experiments and said the foil covering a heavy ion collector had 
been torn away 
but shuttle flight director al pennington said an initial 
television look at ldef indicates minimal damage 
its a goodlooking spacecraft he said the scientists 
ive talked with are very very pleased it looks like we have a 
very valuable piece of science in our grasp 
mission specialist bonnie dunbar snared the lab with columbias 
50foot robot arm then held it above the shuttles cargo bay for 
an exhaustive photo survey of each of the experiments 
some might have become so eroded or weakened by the long 
exposure to space and bombardment by micrometeoroids and atomic 
oxygen that they could fall apart during the stress of atmospheric 
reentry or a return to earths gravity dunbar explained so 
we want good documentary photos in case that happens 
had the astronauts failed to rescue ldef the slowly falling 
satellite would have reentered earths atmosphere about march 9 
and burned up 
when the shuttle lands jan 19 the satellite will be taken to a 
building at the kennedy space center here for analysis by four 
teams experts in materials spacecraft systems radiation and 
space debris then the experiments will be distributed to their 
designers 
most scientists will reap a big bonus because the satellite has 
been in space five years longer than intended it was to have been 
retrieved 10 months after another shuttle crew put it in orbit in 
april 1984 but scheduling problems and the 1986 challenger 
explosion delayed the pickup until now 
ldef is invaluable to us said pennington it is chock 
full of every material we use in space flight metals graphite 
epoxies antenna designs polymers resins thermal coatings major 
optics have been sitting up there in orbit for six years being 
bombarded by atomic oxygen radiation micrometeoroids and other 
things that come in from outer space 
the satellite carries 21 materials coating and thermal systems 
experiments five power and propulsion experiments 17 science 
experiments and 14 electronics and optics experiments 
the experiments represent more than 200 investigators 33 
private companies 21 universities 7 nasa centers and 8 foreign 
countries 
one experiment was designed to capture tiny particles of 
interplanetary dust which give scientists insight about the origin 
of the sun and planets 
also aboard are 125 million tomato seeds which will be 
distributed to american students in grades 5 through university 
level 
kits of 50 ldef seeds and 50 control seeds those kept sealed on 
the ground throughout the flight will be made available to 
teachers and students for research into such things as germination 
rates chromosome and population genetics studies and full tomato 
growth 
because this is the first opportunity for longduration space 
exposure of living tissues every classroom experiment will be 
significant said nasa administrator richard h truly

the governor of hong kong said friday he and 
chinese officials explained their positions on the colonys 
political future but neither side reported concrete agreements in 
three days of talks 
there is still discussion to take place on how the political 
model evolves sir david wilson said at the airport before flying 
home we have made considerable progress in trying to explain 
sensibly and clearly what the problems are on both sides and trying 
to reach understanding about them i think its been a useful visit 
in that context 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted premier li peng as 
telling wilson that he was glad to see that on some issues the 
two sides are drawing closer but did not elaborate 
it was wilsons first visit to beijing since china violently 
crushed prodemocracy protests in june badly shaking the 
confidence of hong kong residents about their future after britain 
hands the colony back to china in 1997 
hong kong activists have pressed for more guarantees from china 
about their future and a speedier evolution of democratic processes 
in their local government before 1997 china has opposed both 
demands and moved to put clauses outlawing subversion in hong 
kongs post1997 basic law 
both sides commented only generally on the content of wilsons 
meetings but described them as frank which in diplomatic 
parlance generally means they disagreed 
at times they seemed unable to agree even about the weather 
used repeatedly as an analogy for the political climate 
on arrival in hong kong wilson described the trip as 
roadbuilding and the main achievement was to be able to 
reestablish a dialogue talk about problems in a straightforward 
way 
emerging from a 90minute meeting with wilson on friday li 
entertained hong kong reporters with a sometimes confusing weather 
report 
the weather is a bit chilly but i hope the atmosphere is still 
warm he said its cold outside but the sky is blue and it 
feels very comfortable 
when wilson said he had come because recently the political 
climate has been getting difficult li answered bluntly maybe 
thats your feeling but i feel fine 
on thursday li hou deputy director of chinas hong kong and 
macao affairs office told wilson that some hong kong residents 
were trying to bring wind and rain into the relationship he 
noted a recent hong kong demonstration calling for the overthrow of 
the ceausescus of china a reference to ousted romanian 
communist party leader nicolae ceausescu 
wilson said distinctions should be made between small showers 
and typhoons but li responded if small showers are not looked 
after they can turn into typhoons 
at the airport wilson said he briefed chinese officials about 
the spectrum of opinions in hong kong on how much democracy should 
be introduced into local government before and after 1997 
he said he explained the colonys plan to insert a bill of 
rights into its legal code and its position on allowing hong kong 
residents to speak out about mainland politics china has denounced 
hong kong criticism of its human rights record as subversion 
we in hong kong have no intention that hong kong should be 
used as a base for subversion wilson said particularly we 
dont want people from outside hong kong to come to hong kong and 
try to use it as a battlefield against china 
at the same time we treasure our own liberties and freedoms 
under the law in hong kong and i was explaining that we apply the 
law equally that no one has more rights or less under the law 
he said 
guo fengmin to be appointed shortly as ambassador to the 
chinesebritish joint liaison group on hong kong refused to 
respond to a question about whether china would guarantee hong kong 
residents right to political dissent 
li asked after his meeting with wilson how it went said 
your governor can take the message to the hong kong people but 
wilson said li gave him no special message only expressed concern 
that the hong kong and chinese economies should help each other 
develop 
wilson said in hong kong that li was very interested in the 
whole concept of the interrelationship of economy between hong kong 
and china

a federal magistrate set 1 million bond for a 
codefendant of deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega today 
and attorneys huddled for discussions about noriegas detention in 
the courthouse basement 
us magistrate peter palermo set the 1 million bail for daniel 
miranda who is charged with flying from fort lauderdale to panama 
with 800000 in laundered drug money but prosecutors appealed the 
bail meaning that miranda 36 could not immediately be released 
mirandas attorney michael okane was late to court because he 
was attacked near his home by a masked man with a footlong 
crowbar police arrested a suspect but would give no details 
i cant think of anybody who would do this okane said 
maybe it has to do with the case maybe not 
okane said his attacker offered to tell who sent him only if 
assault charges were dropped but the attorney said he did not plan 
to drop the charges 
okanes head was bandaged but still bleeding when he arrived in 
court his report of the attack prompted federal marshals to 
increase security for palmermo 
attorneys met privately with us district judge william 
hoeveler for what the miami herald reported would be discussions of 
efforts to move noriega to more secure quarters until his trial on 
drug trafficking charges 
participants said they were under strict orders not to discuss 
any transfer plans publicly speculation has centered on federal 
prisons in atlanta and marion ill as possible destinations 
a justice department security team sent from washington to 
protect classified information in the noriega trial has told 
defense attorneys they may have to pass security clearances before 
gaining access to the documents they need 
the justice department is not only deciding which documents are 
accessible but through the us attorneys office is playing the 
role of prosecutor of noriega who assisted the cia from the 1970s 
until 1985 
it is pretty odd that theyre both from the department of 
justice and yet these people court security claim that theyre 
neutral said steven kreisberg who represents noriega 
codefendant william saldarriaga of colombia an alleged cocaine 
trafficker when they all work in the same department i question 
that 
as a sign of the extra security surrounding the case documents 
are being sealed on arrival at federal court for transfer to 
hoeveler 
okane charged us attorney dexter lehtinen was misapplying 
security guidelines and contended he was threatened by government 
officials in the name of security 
okane as part of a defense motion this week asked the 
government to examine intelligence information collected at a us 
military telecommunications listening post dubbed the tunnel in 
panama city 
he attached a map copied from the panama city telephone book to 
specify its location and was contacted by a member of the security 
team and then by a prosecutor in lehtinens office who tells me 
they are very upset in washington with what ive been filing and if 
i dont get on board it will be bad for my client and bad for me 
personally 
reacting to okanes comments lehtinen spokeswoman diane cossin 
said defense counsel should abide by ethical standards and not 
try this case in the news media or comment on any discussions with 
the us attorneys office 
okane met on security issues thursday with hoeveler and justice 
officials and the judge laughed when okane explained the source 
of the map 
another security provision is that no classified information 
be discussed even over the telephone because of the danger of 
interception of these transmissions by the russians or whoever 
said kreisberg 
meanwhile the arrival of noriega in miami on jan 4 to face the 
drug indictment has fueled speculation that codefendants may 
pursue plea bargains to avoid sitting through a bombardment of 
allegations aimed largely at noriega 
the indictment issued in february 1988 accuses noriega of 
protecting cocaine shipments heading north and coca processing 
chemicals and drug money headed south 
samuel burstyn who represents former noriega intelligence chief 
luis del cid said the thought of going to trial in a joint 
trial with mr noriega with the prospects of that being a real 
dogandpony show are not very appealing to us so to a certain 
extent we are motivated to forgo a lengthy and difficult trial 
both burstyn and kreisberg are seeking separate trials for their 
clients

requests all of a sudden from these areas to remove the service 
said doug bierschbach manager of satellite cable tv systems 
last month the company stopped offering mtv in parkston or 
freeman towns of about 1300 each

office has since received about a dozen complaints from young 
viewers 
missy stork a parkston high school senior said she wrote the 
company protesting the change

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said friday that the defense departments use of the 
hightech stealth f117a fighterbomber in the us invasion of 
panama was show biz 
rep les aspin dwis in releasing a report on the dec 20 
incursion to oust panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega had 
nothing but praise for the overall military operation saying the 
armed forces clearly deserved an a for the effort 
but the wisconsin democrat was highly critical of the pentagons 
decision to deploy the f117a stealth fighter to drop two 
2000pound bombs near infantry barracks at rio hato to stun 
disorient and confuse troops loyal to noriega 
use of the aircraft with its radarevading capabilities against 
a nation that lacks the sophisticated detection technology has been 
viewed by some as merely a pentagon ploy to win support for the 
aircraft in congress 
the fighter geared more for use against the soviet union in a 
nuclear war than against countries fighting a conventional battle 
faces an uphill battle for support on capitol hill in light of the 
lessening soviet threat and diminishing military budgets 
published reports indicate that the top secret plane costs 
somewhat under 50 million apiece 
the military justification was that it was an extremely 
accurate weapon aspin told reporters it looks to me like its 
show biz we were trying to miss the building we have lots of 
plane that miss them i think that the issue here was that there 
could have been other planes chosen 
shortly after aspins comments sen john warner of virginia 
the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee 
defended the pentagons decision to use the f117a in the invasion 
we are told this piece of equipment is the best warner told 
a news conference perhaps another piece could have done a fair 
job but we did not want to take the risk of collateral damage 
the military made the right decision warner said 
aspin in his report on panama to house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash and comments to reporters also said 
the united states was lucky in the invasion because the 
panamanian defense forces took few hostages and there was a lack 
of fighting spirit in mr noriega aspin revealed that at the 
start of the invasion panamanian forces took control of 347 
passengers aboard a brazilian jetliner that had arrived at torrijos 
international airport the panamanians however were talked out of 
holding the passengers as hostages 
noriega had enough information ahead of time on the us 
invasion but evidence indicates the panamanian leader did not act 
upon it aspin believes indications of a us invasion had become 
so routine that noriega discounted the latest incident the 
panamanian dictator eluded us forces for several days before 
seeking asylum in the vatican embassy on christmas eve he turned 
himself in to us authorities last week and is being held in miami 
on drugtrafficking charges 
the bush administration neglected the political aspects of the 
operation aspin cited the swearing in of the endara government on 
a military base and the panamanian letter to the organization of 
american states advising of a new ambassador using paper carrying 
the us southern command label clearly there was a lack of 
sensitivity with the need to build the endara government build 
democracy aspin said 
warner suggested that members of congress reserve comment until 
after the secretaries of state and defense publicly discuss the 
joint effort on the operation until theyve been given an 
opportunity to explain the steps they took to coordinate i think 
its in fairness not wise to criticize warner said

a former boeing co marketing executive 
was sentenced on friday to two years in prison for passing 
classified pentagon budget documents to the aerospace giant and 
other defense firms 
richard lee fowler 64 a onetime civilian air force budget 
analyst who worked for boeing from 1978 to 1986 contended he 
didnt know he was breaking the law when he obtained more than 100 
classified documents 
among the items fowler passed to boeing was a fiveyear pentagon 
budget projection and a national security council study of the 
strategic defense initiative popularly known as star wars 
i am here today for doing a job i was hired to do by one of 
the fortune 500 companies fowler told us district judge albert 
v bryan jr 
they were not aware it was criminal i was not aware it was 
criminal said fowler who was held in civil contempt and jailed 
earlier in the week for refusing to identify his accomplices during 
grand jury testimony 
boeing pleaded guilty nov 13 to illegally obtaining two secret 
pentagon documents and agreed to pay 52 million in fines and 
penalties 
prosecutors charged the company sought the documents to plan 
budgets for future defense contracts 
bryan rejected fowlers argument saying evidence at the trial 
indicates to me he knew what he was doing with these documents 
these offenses are serious and they warrant incarceration 
bryan said 
fowler convicted last month of 39 felony counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy and unlawful conveyance of government documents could 
have been sentenced up to 310 years in prison and fined 225000 
bryan said fowlers sentence would not start until he purges 
himself of civil contempt for refusing to tell a grand jury who 
gave him the documents 
fowler of springfield va was jailed wednesday on the 
contempt citation after refusing to name his sources of pentagon 
documents 
defense attorney john bray said fowler could be held for 
contempt as long as nine months the unexpired portion of the 
grand jurys term 
i think its fair to say he is not likely to change his mind 
about testifying in the grand jury bray told reporters outside the 
us courthouse 
us attorney henry hudson said prosecutors could convene a 
second grand jury in nine months to try to elicit answers from 
fowler 
during the sentencing hearing prosecutor randy bellows said 
that fowler deserved imprisonment because he corrupted pentagon 
officials whom he asked to provide secret documents 
for six years mr fowler had people in the pentagon slipping 
and leaking documents to him these individuals were breaching the 
trust of the government bellows said 
bellows cited evidence produced at trial that fowler caused 
the dissemination of these documents throughout the industry 
bellows suggested that in spreading the documents around fowler 
might have given a foreign power the opportunity to intercept 
secret information there was a total lack of control of these 
documents who knows where they ended up the prosecutor said 
eight other companies were identified during trial testimony as 
being part of a network of defense firms that traded pentagon 
budget documents in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
the other companies were honeywell bendix ibm rca which 
since merged with general electric grumman raytheon rockwell 
and martin marietta 
defense attorney cary feldman said that fowler believed all 
along that what he was doing was legal 
i dont think there is any question notwithstanding the 
nature of the charges that mr fowler is loyal to this country 
the lawyer said 
outside the courthouse feldman said fowler would appeal the 
conviction 
the key issue feldman said is did he know what he was doing 
constituted crimes against the united states 
his position is and our position has always been he did not 
hudson hailed the sentence saying i hope it sends a message 
to people in the defense consulting industry that the illegal 
procurement of classified documents will not be tolerated 
anytime someone illegally obtains classified information and 
distributes it there is a cost to national security hudson said

the navy has refused to halt tomahawk 
cruise missile flights over maine in spite of a statewide 
nonbinding referendum calling for a ban on the tests 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii said in a letter to 
maines congressional delegation that three test flights are 
planned this year despite last novembers election 
cruise missile test flights over maine at least for the 
foreseeable future are absolutely vital to maintaining the 
readiness and effectiveness of this important weapons system 
garrett wrote 
the navys going to do exactly what they intended all along 
eric johnson spokesman for the coalition for the cruise missile 
referendum said thursday 
gov john r mckernan said he would be deciding what further 
actions my administration should pursue to ensure that our views on 
this matter are heard in washington 
after the referendum mckernan and members of the congressional 
delegation all asked the navy to halt the flights the delegation 
also asked the navy to consider at least limiting the number of 
flights and confining them to coldweather months 
the navy has said it wanted to fly the missiles over maine in 
order to test them in cold weather over terrain like maines 
according to kirk walder spokesman for rep olympia j snowe 
rmaine 
the missiles are launched from submarines at undisclosed 
locations and fly a curving path over sparsely populated northern 
maine and southwestward to a navy survival school near saddleback 
mountain northwest of augusta where they parachute to the ground 
in his letter dated monday garrett told the delegation that 
the navy will take very practical steps to limit the number of 
flights over maine and make every effort to conduct these 
flights only during the period of november to may 
that is not business as usual said bob holsapple spokesman 
for the navys cruise missile project 
the navy will not say when the missile flights are scheduled 
said holsapple 
but garretts letter to the delegation said two flights are 
planned during a single sixday launch window in the near future

socialist leader takako doi says she never aspired 
to be the countrys first female premier but the idea of fixing 
defects left by decades of conservative rule is becoming more 
appealing as elections draw near 
there are so many things i would love to change if i were 
prime minister the socialist party chairwoman said in an 
interview friday i would love to go to washington and moscow and 
take new initiatives in this drastically changing world 
ms doi 61 has a chance to make history in this maledominated 
society which votes next month for the crucial lower house of 
parliament which elects the prime minister 
ms doi insists she never even held the ambition to be her 
partys leader much less prime minister 
but as one of only 27 women against 737 men in the two houses of 
parliament ms doi is a highly visible politician in addition to 
her popularity among women ms dois former position as a 
university law professor has made her popular among liberal 
intellectuals 
if she becomes prime minister it would be on the strength of 
her popularity combined with the weakness of the scandalplagued 
liberal democratic party 
the election expected feb 18 is the most critical in japans 
recent history because it is a onceinalifetime chance for 
opposition parties and people to end the 34year rule by the 
liberal democratic party ms doi said speaking in her tokyo 
office between a string of visitors from companies and media 
organizations 
ms doi offers few specifics on what initiatives she might 
propose a sign of the political education she has gained since 
1986 when she became the first woman to lead a major japanese 
party 
but she has harsh criticism for the current leaderships 
policies which she said threaten to make japan a money 
spreader without principles 
ms dois personal popularity led her party to an unprecedented 
gain in the upper house election last july forcing the liberal 
democrats into a minority in the chamber for the first time 
the lower house is more powerful and ms dois socialists now 
have only 85 of the 512 seats in it the liberal democrats hold 295 
the socialists so far are fielding only 145 candidates meaning 
ms doi would have to persuade other opposition parties to form a 
coalition and back her to be prime minister ideological divides so 
far have prevented agreement between centrist parties and the 
socialists 
to attract public support and coalition partners the socialists 
have given up some radicalleftist policy stances last week the 
party decided to withdraw its call for revolution from its 
platform it has also acknowledged japans armed forces and its 
security treaty with the united states 
ms doi said she would strictly enforce japans nonnuclear 
principles which forbid nuclear weapons coming into the country 
it is widely believed us warships with nuclear weapons move in 
and out of naval bases in japan but the united states refuses to 
confirm or deny the presence of such weapons 
we will probably have to reexamine how the principle is 
carried out now and if there is a suspicion that us forces are 
bringing in nuclear arms even for transit purposes we have to 
demand confirmation she said 
she said she would not seek drastic changes in domestic and 
foreign policies but she has harsh words for the current 
leadership 
the long rule by a single party has left us many defects and 
we will have to correct them somehowshe said but trying to 
change everything overnight is not something we want 
prime minister toshiki kaifu on a european trip where he 
announced a sizable aid package to east european countries is 
only spreading money around with no principle ms doi said 
i feel japan is left out of decisionmaking in the rapidly 
changing world because of a lack of principle in our foreign 
policy she said it is pitiful for the secondlargest economy 
not to be part of the decisionmaking of the world when it seeks 
new directions 
it is time for us to restart with mutual understanding between 
the people of japan and foreign countries before we simply throw 
money at them or we will be always regarded only as a money 
spreader she added 
japan needs to prove to the world it is a democratic nation 
and our democracy is fair and trustworthy by realizing a transition 
of power in government for the first time in three decades she 
said i have long said that transition of power is a proof of 
democracy 
ms doi a 20year veteran of parliament became socialist 
leader in 1986 after the party was crushed in the lower house 
election and her predecessor resigned the left and right wings of 
the party could not agree on a successor and ms doi who avoided 
taking sides was chosen

cape codders pleas for someone to rein in 
development on their fragile sandy peninsula were officially 
answered friday with a new law creating the cape cod commission 
in 1991 1992 at the latest we are going to face a lot of 
very very tough growth pressures gov michael dukakis said at a 
statehouse news conference before heading south to the ceremonial 
signing of the cape cod commission act 
establishing a regulatory commission gives everybody a chance 
to do it right he said 
environmentalists regular vacationers and homeowners have 
worried about the future of the cape especially as condominiums 
and shopping malls began springing up in profusion 
the push for a way to regulate it all was led by paul tsongas 
after he left the us senate now chairman of the board of regents 
of higher education tsongas said friday that the campaign for 
regulation of development was an almost evangelical effort to 
give this place a sense of difference from every other place 
in november 1988 barnstable county voters approved a referendum 
calling for an agency to regulate development the legislature 
later passed the law creating the commission 
the panel will include 15 representatives appointed by boards of 
selectmen in each of capes 15 towns three appointees by cape 
county commissioners and one gubernatorial appointee 
the panel will have authority to reject development projects and 
designate environmentally and historically sensitive areas any 
appeals of its actions would go through the courts 
backers of the measure said that about half the capes 140000 
acres suitable for construction was already used up and predicted 
the rest would be occupied in three decades

president vaclav havel said 
friday the speedy withdrawal of soviet troops is only one of a 
large package of ideas hell take to moscow on his first 
official visit next month 
at a news conference during his first presidential visit to the 
slovak captial of bratislava havel declined to be more specific on 
his agenda saying he prefered to tell soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev his ideas personally 
foreign ministry spokesman lubos dobrovsky an old friend of 
havels in the charter 77 human rights organization said tuesday 
that czechoslovakias new coalition government wants the estimated 
70000 soviet troops in the country to leave by the end of 1990 
the soviet troops entered czechoslovakia with the warsaw pact 
invasion that crushed reform in 1968 and stayed under two 
agreements the new prague government has declared null and void 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from czechoslovakia is part of 
a large package of interrelated topics and themes to be taken to 
moscow in february havel said unfortunately this is all i can 
tell you now 
havel said a forthcoming oneday visit to poland will take him 
to warsaw and gdansk and that he would discuss with the poles the 
return of the nations of the socalled soviet bloc to europe 
havel and other former dissidents elevated to state and 
government positions by czechoslovakias peaceful revolution have 
moved swiftly to try to dismantle or alter structures imposed on 
their nation by four decades of oneparty rule and to take a 
different line in foreign policy 
havels first visit abroad after his dec 29 inauguration took 
him to east germany and west germany rather than the soviet union 
for his communist predecessors a trip to moscow usually took 
precedence 
a new freer atmosphere has pervaded the government and media in 
czechoslovakia 
asked by a czechoslovak journalist what guarantees existed 
against a return to totalitarian rule havel answered the 
guarantees are in yourselves you are free citizens you have to 
defend the freedom you have won 
havel struck a personal tone throughout the news conference one 
of his first in czechoslovakia since becoming president 
answering a question about his personal life for example he 
spoke freely of a long struggle he had to wage to get free of a 
dominant mother at another point he joked about being banned from 
bratislava during his dissident years 
bratislava was forbidden for me for many years havel said 
if i came here it was really illegal here they even caught me 
once and put me in jail for two days i liked the jail very much in 
comparison with the prague detention cells i was very sorry 
they let us go because they fed us slovak dumplings 
the same jocular tone rang through his remarks to about 10000 
people who gathered in freezing temperatures to welcome him on the 
bratislava square where many of the anticommunist demonstrations 
took place during the revolution 
the crowd laughed along with havel as he and slovak opposition 
leader milan knazko joked about his transformation from jailed 
dissident to head of state

a colorful easytoread version of the koran in 
comic book form has won approval from some islamic authorities but 
one scholar has condemned it calling the author a new salman 
rushdie 
si le coran metait conte if the koran were told to 
me is geared to readers aged 12 to 16 said its author youssef 
seddik 
the koran is the sacred book of islam according to islamic 
belief it contains the words of god as revealed to the prophet 
mohammed 
the comic books which cost about 10 each have been approved 
and even encouraged by some religious authorities such as ayatollah 
mehdi rouhani spiritual leader of the shiite moslem community in 
europe 
i dont see any problem with the comic books as long as you 
know there is a precedent an illustrated version of the koran 
published in iran 15 years ago rouhani said in an interview at 
his paris home 
rouhani called comic books the language of the 20th century 
im all for comic books and would encourage them if they do 
in fact get across the idea of god to young people he said 
but mohammed faidallah head of islamic jurisprudence at kuwait 
universitys islamic studies faculty was quoted friday as saying 
the comic books could spark a furor like that over rushdies novel 
the satanic verses 
in february 1989 ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said rushdie 
should die because his novel blasphemed islam rushdie has been in 
hiding ever since 
faidallah said the comic books constituted a criminal act that 
ridicules the sanctity of the holy koran and called for their 
condemnation the kuwait newspaper alqabas reported 
he was quoted as calling seddik a new salman rushdie recruited 
to carry out this ugly task faidallah urged arab and islamic 
embassies in paris to pressure official bodies there with a view 
to halting such violation of islamic values the daily said 
seddik a tunisianborn journalist who has written extensively 
on arab culture said friday he was deeply saddened by 
faidallahs reaction and disputed the scholars right to judge the 
issue 
islam is my emotional and spiritual roots nothing no one can 
ever take it away from me he said 
im deeply attached to the principle that distinguishes islam 
from judaiism and christianity that it does not accept the idea of 
the clergy only the knowledge competence and good intentions of 
the humblest moslem can judge our actions 
in an earlier interview seddik said he was motivated to adapt 
the koran because of his frustration from studying the text as a 
child 
i remember feeling very sad that we had to learn the text by 
heart without any comprehension or understanding of what it 
meant said seddik 46 i was one of the lucky ones my father 
was a learned man and he would explain things to me at home 
seddik said the drawings and simple language can help young 
readers follow the narrative development of the korans many 
episodes while avoiding its inextricable forest of syntactic 
lexical and theological difficulties 
volume one the cursed peoples contains vivid pictures of 
dessert peoples worshiping idols living in sin and deaf to pleas 
of the prophets to change their ways and worship a single god 
the drawings which rouhani described as naive and 
simplistic are accompanied by exact quotations from the koran 
complete with chapter and verse references the prophets are not 
represented but evoked by flashes of light 
seddik said he was careful not to offend or blaspheme in any 
way and even destroyed 10000 copies of a 1986 edition that 
displeased religious leaders 
the new version he said got the ok from religious bodies in 
algeria and tunisia 
a spokesman for the rector of the grand mosque in paris was less 
enthusiastic comic books dealing with transcendental issues have 
no instructive value and in fact frustrate the development of the 
adolescent imagination said jhaothy hadjeddine sari 
imposing an image of the transcendental on a young person is 
tantamount to castration he said i cant see teaching the 
koran in comic books any more than i can imagine teaching 
philospohy or math 
seddik said his desire to publish the comic books was 
politically motivated 
the rise of arab fundamentalism is partly a result of the way 
the koran is being taught as something opaque and incantatory 
understood by the elite few who run islam like a secret society to 
which only they have access he said 
seddik said the wisdom of the koran should be available to 
everyone so people can draw their own conclusions and decide how 
to live their lives 
seddik admits that comic books violate one of the key tenants of 
islam the reproduction of images of course its a taboo but 
im willing to assume full responsibility he said 
seddik says he respects the sacredness of islam 
i dont blaspheme i dont portray aicha as a prostitute he 
said referring to a passage in the satanic verses about 
mohammeds child bride that offended many moslems 
seddik said the sevenvolume project was financed by hocine 
meddahi an algerian industrialist who lives in paris three 
volumes have already appeared in french and arabic and an english 
translation is in progress

would have been very proud of your soldiers no one has ever been 
more disciplined under fire or more mature in carrying out their 
duties

packs and rifles on a line to lighten the load of the landing 
stiner said the troopers backpacks weighed 100 pounds when fully 
loaded with ammunition as they were during the invasion 
the soldiers wearing battle gear gathered their parachutes 
after landing and got into military formation 
four soldiers received minor injuries in the jump master sgt

the yugoslav news agency tanjug 
reported friday that albanian authorities had imposed extremely 
strict security measures in their isolated communist country 
albanian tv monitored in belgrade did not mention any special 
measures 
milisav milic a reporter for belgrade tv from yugoslavias 
kosovo province that borders albania told the associated press 
that frequent sound of firearms was heard friday from the 
direction of albania 
tanjug and belgrade tv said that something is apparently 
happening in albania and that rare travelers from that country 
report of brutal measures against dissent there 
albanian authorities in an effort to prevent unrest against 
the regime have imposed extremely strict control measures in the 
country tanjug said 
it said the security measures can be termed a state of 
emergency but did not say when they were were imposed 
tanjug gave no sourcing for its information but belgrade tv 
said its information came from unconfirmed reports from diplomats 
and travelers 
as the last bastion of stalinism in eastern europe albania is 
viewed by some western analysts as the next country to experience 
radical change but its isolation and small population of 3 million 
are among the factors that make albania different from other 
communist countries in the region 
the balkan nations borders are virtually closed to foreign 
travelers although in recent months some closely supervised tour 
groups have been allowed in 
albanian media has been silent about reports of possible popular 
unrest that have been carried in the past few days in yugoslav and 
greek media 
petrag simo an albanian diplomat in belgrade on friday strongly 
denied such reports 
all these are regretable rumors which have absolutely no 
substance simo told the ap 
the nightly news program of albanian state tv monitored in 
belgrade made no mention of any disturbances or special security 
measures having been imposed 
but milic said a telephone interview that an ethnic albanian 
returning home to kosovo from albania told of demonstrations in the 
towns of durres shkoder and korcha in the last couple of days 
the albanian also told milic that leaflets by dissatisfied 
albanian military officers had appeared in the capital of tirana 
no details of their contents were available 
the yugoslav newspaper politika reported thursday that a state 
of emergency had been delcared in shkoder albanias second largest 
city it said that shkoder 60 miles northwest of tirana on the 
yugoslav border is the center of dissent in albania and that 
several protests were reported in the city over the past three 
years 
on wednesday the albanian daily zeri i popullit accused emigres 
of trying to foment unrest saying they wanted to restore the 
preworld war ii monarchy and vowing albania would never abandon 
communism 
albania is the last country in eastern europe to revere josef 
stalin whose giant statue stands in tirana

vice president dan quayle worked friday to 
firm up an itinerary for his fencemending trip to latin america 
but many diplomats from the region remained unconvinced that his 
personal touch would soothe their governments ire over the us 
invasion of panama 
some speaking on condition of anonymity said president bush 
would accomplish more by withdrawing invasion troops from panama 
than by dispatching his vice president on a friendship tour 
sentiment ran particularly strong in venezuela where some 
officials said it was inappropriate that quayle be sent to 
proffer explanations before the invasion forces leave and a head of 
state is installed through elections or congressional appointment 
the current president guillermo endara whose previous election 
was voided by gen manuel noriega was installed by the united 
states the day of the invasion 
one venezuelan diplomat said bush should wait more time in 
order that the situation in panama gets better and then begin new 
conversations about the relations between the united states and 
latin americans but not now 
it was not clear if quayle will visit caracas or simply meet 
with the venezuelan president carlos andres perez at one of the 
upcoming presidential inaugurations in uruguay brazil or chile 
all are to take place in march 
administration officials on friday were working on the 
itinerary only quayles previously scheduled trip to the jan 27 
inauguration in honduras was announced 
no country has refused to talk to the vice president quayles 
press secretary david beckwith insisted 
no country will refuse to say welcome the venezuelan source 
concurred but maybe they say you are welcome but not today 
maybe tomorrow never never will any country of latin america say 
you are not welcome its not polite 
some countries said quayles visits at least would show that 
wants to take the sting out of what many latins viewed as a 
violation of panamas sovereignty 
but others said quayle can expect a cool reaction 
it wont be easy said an uruguayan diplomatic source 
people are very skeptical about it you invade and then you 
try to convince us that an invasion is not an invasion he tries to 
patronize us said a costa rican official referring to president 
bush 
the official said that costa rica a strongly prous country 
will welcome quayle nonetheless the official predicted south 
american reaction will be very very cold probably they will 
tell him that was an invasion and we dont need any explanation 
another latin diplomatic source said the people of latin 
america will be more comfortable if the united states gets its 
troops home as soon as possible and helps panama carry out an 
election 
something had to be done with noriega but that doesnt mean 
an invasion an uninvited invasion said a bolivian diplomat 
the source said it was hoped that quayle would have something 
significant to say beyond already voiced rationales 
bush announced last week that he was dispatching quayle to try 
to convince latin neighbors of the truth and that is that we 
are not just reverting to just a willful use of force that has 
no rationale 
while the latin countries shared bushs disdain for noriega now 
held on federal drug charges in miami they were virtually 
unanimous in publicly deploring the use of military force to topple 
him 
venezuela urged members of the organization of american states 
to withhold their recognition of the endara government until the 
us invasion troops are withdrawn the oas didnt go that far but 
nonetheless denounced the us operation 
in 1958 vice president richard nixon was confronted by a 
rockthrowing mob in caracas during a goodwill tour to latin 
america rioters shattered windows in his limousine and tried to 
drag him and his wife pat from the car before the motorcade 
escaped 
but one administration official who also declined 
identification said that just as were always happy to 
accommodate the visits by caribbean and latin leaders im sure 
they will be pleased to welcome the vice president

the united states is coming under attack from 
some church groups in latin america for its dec 20 invasion of 
panama 
the latin american council of churches in a letter addressed to 
us christians decried the invasion as a terrorist action 
that violated panamas right to control its own destiny 
in a separate statement the ecumenical committee in panama a 
2yearold coalition of methodists episcopalians lutherans and 
baptists said the us invasion was not the most competent way to 
solve the crisis and that it represents a threat to the 
sovereignty of the panamanian nation 
the letters were released friday by the national council of 
churches the nations largest ecumenical organization with 
membership including most major protestant denominations a council 
delegation is to visit panama on tuesday at the request of the 
ecumenical committee in panama 
the invasion also has been criticized by some us church groups 
james a hamilton general secretary of the council said in a 
letter to president bush that the action risked pointless losses 
of panamanian and american lives as well as the isolation of our 
nation from a world gradually turning its back on the use of 
military might as a means of settling disputes 
the rev thom white wolfe fassett general secretary of the 
board of church and society for the united methodist church said 
unilateral intervention no matter its validity can never be 
supported 
archbishop roger m mahony of los angeles chairman of the 
international policy committee of the united states catholic 
conference said us bishops support the plea by panamas catholic 
bishops for the us government to withdraw its forces from panama 
as soon as possible and to help rebuild the panamanian economy 
us officials have said their objectives in the invasion were 
to oust panamanian dictator gen manuel antonio noriega protect 
american lives safeguard the panama canal treaties and restore 
democracy to panama 
the official death toll by us count is 314 members of the 
panamanian defense forces 220 civilians 23 american soldiers and 
three us civilians us forces suffered 324 wounded while 124 
panamanian soldiers are listed as wounded

us auction houses sold more than 15 billion 
worth of art last year and chalked up their bestselling season 
ever thanks to a broader more educated audience art dealers said 
two pablo picasso paintings sold for more than 40 million each 
to become the third and fourthmost expensive paintings ever but 
the notsowealthy art lover also contributed to the record sales 
by buying works that cost thousands rather than than millions 
when the final bang of the gavel sounded on us art auction 
sales for the season the total came to 153 billion nearly 
double last years total leonards annual price index of art 
auctions reported this week 
the total number of art lots sold was 33000 in 1989 down by 
more than 5000 from the previous year experts said both the 
limited art supply and increased consumer interest stoked the 
seasons recordbreaking sales 
when my grandfather ran the business his clientele was the 
very top 5 percent of the upper class said abbot william vose 
president of vose gallery which opened in providence ri in 
1841 and relocated to boston 40 years later 
the clientele is very broadbased now with even the lower 
middleclass buying art he said art education in even grade 
schools up through high schools has played a good part in 
focusing attention on american art and other arts and has made a 
difference in attendance at museums and art shows 
sothebys holdings inc in new york last year sold the thirdand 
fourthtop moneymakers ever with yo picasso a selfportrait of 
the artist that earned 4785 million and his au lapin agile 
which went for 407 million said robin rileyahrens the houses 
spokesman 
picassos pierrettes wedding went for 489 million in 
november to earn the title of the secondmost expensive painting 
ever but it was sold at the drouotmontaigne auction house in 
paris and thus not included in the us figures 
the worlds most expensive painting vincent van goghs 
irises was sold by sothebys in 1987 for 539 million the 
auction house disclosed thursday however that it lent australian 
tycoon alan bond 27 million to buy the 1889 painting that as 
collateral bond posted the picture he was going to buy and that 
bond has not paid off the loan sothebys said it was abandoning 
the loan policy which many critics say artificially inflates 
artwork prices 
about 20 percent of the art sold at auction went for below 
1000 said susan theran publisher of leonards annual price 
index an industry database that provides information annually on 
art auction prices 
art is affordable and people are finding that out she 
said people are developing their tastes and buying books on how 
to purchase art 
however sales were still chiefly pushed to their record heights 
by purchases in the 1 millionplus market theran said 
final tally for the 1989 selling season showed 240 lots of 
artworks worth more than 1 million were sold compared with 84 
similarly priced lots in the previous year theran said sales for 
the 240 lots was 779 million more than triple the 1988 figure of 
2135 million for the 84 lots

columbias astronauts salvaged a 
valuable space laboratory today snaring it with a 50foot robot 
arm and saving it from a fiery doom in the atmosphere 
youve made several scientists quite happy mission control 
told the space shuttle crew ldef is finally coming home 
the astronauts rescued the long duration exposure facility by 
steering columbia alongside it and having mission specialist bonnie 
dunbar reach out and grab it with the wire fingers of the 
spaceships mechanical arm 
the capture occurred 201 miles above the earth as the two 
spacecraft raced in formation at more than 17400 mph 
while commander dan brandenstein held the shuttle steady dunbar 
used a television camera on the end of the robot to gingerly guide 
the fingers to a grappling device on the side of the bussized 
satellite 
the television pictures beamed to earth showed the tense final 
minutes but columbias position kept it from showing the actual 
capture 
after snaring ldef dunbar slowly turned the satellite on the 
arm for nearly four hours so all of its exterior experiments could 
be photographed she then used the arm to gently lower the 
satellite into the cargo bay this afternoon 
at 350 pm est mission control reported that all five latches 
in the cargo bay used to hold ldef had been secured 
astronauts have recovered orbiting satellites before but never 
one as big as ldef which is 30 feet long and weighs 11 tons 
had they failed to rescue ldef trackers said the 57 experiments 
on board would have been lost as gravity pulled the satellite to a 
flaming reentry into earths atmosphere about march 9 
dunbar reported that some experiments had suffered wear and tear 
from their six years in space being pounded by micrometeoroids 
blasted by cosmic rays and corroded by atomic oxygen 
looks like a couple panels have some loose foil loose foil 
pulled away from the side she said a lot of coatings look 
like they may be gone 
brandenstein later reported weve got a whole lot of little 
specks of foil coming at us from ldef 
thats exactly what scientists and engineers want to know how 
many of the materials and experiments withstood the long exposure 
will help them design americas space station freedom and other 
future longduration spacecraft 
at the control center flight director al pennington said the 
loose foil over an experiment to measure heavy ions in space 
appeared to be the only damage based on a preliminary look at the 
tv pictures 
its a goodlooking spacecraft he said the scientists 
ive talked with are very very pleased it looks like we have a 
very valuable piece of science there in our grasp 
the successful retrieval ended a celestial chase that began with 
columbias launch on tuesday and covered 13 million miles during 
which the astronauts circled the globe 50 times 
ldef had traveled 854 million miles since it was launched by 
another shuttle crew in 1984 
television beamed from the shuttle during the approach showed a 
stable ldef silhouetted strikingly against a blue earth and looming 
ever larger as brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee made the final 
maneuvers sunlight gleamed off its trays of science and technology 
experiments 
we have a tallyho on ldef mission control told the crew 
when the closeup view of the satellite first appeared on the screen 
dunbar initially held the satellite on the end of the arm 
poised above the cargo bay so it could be photographed extensively 
after catching up about an hour before the retrieval 
brandenstein had maneuvered the spaceship to a position about 400 
feet directly above the target with the shuttle flying upside 
down its open cargo bay facing the satellite 
brandenstein and wetherbee then pulsed their steering jets to 
gingerly approach the ldef as dunbar flexed the arm 
before tucking the huge payload into the cargo bay dunbar was 
to hold it on the end of the robot arm for more than four hours 
twisting it slowly while mission specialists marsha ivins and 
david low photographed the experiments from every angle 
brandenstein reported the astronauts first spotted ldef thursday 
night it was glinting in the sunlight nearly 200 miles away he 
said and was as bright as could be 
when the crew awakened early today ldef was 108 miles in front 
of them and brandenstein and wetherbee gradually narrowed the gap 
with a series of intricate enginefiring maneuvers 
shortly before 7 am observers at cape canaveral watched for 
about two minutes as columbia and ldef passed directly overhead 
both shining brightly in the reflective rays of the rising sun 
they were about 14 miles apart 
two miles out the astronauts sent to earth the first television 
pictures of the target 
early today a chorus of space center workers sang bring it 
home bring it home bring it home to the tune of let it 
snow to waken the space travelers early today 
it was a reminder that columbia originally was to have been in 
orbit at christmastime and that the astronauts had promised to 
bring the satellite back as a holiday gift to all those with 
experiments on board 
launched in april 1984 by another shuttle crew it was to have 
been retrieved 10 months later but scheduling problems and the 
1986 challenger disaster combined to delay the rescue 
the five astronauts were to spend a week processing medical 
materials observing earth and conducting other experiments before 
returning home jan 19 when a landing in darkness was scheduled 
for 257 am pst at edwards air force base calif

the new government of prime minister 
vp singh said friday it will support petitioners challenging the 
previous leaderships 470 million settlement with union carbide 
for the 1984 bhopal gas disaster 
law and justice minister dinesh goswami said the former 
government of prime minister rajiv gandhi had no authority or 
right to arrive at a settlement which extinguishes all rights of 
the affected victims in respect of criminal liability 
the government is also of the view that human life in india is 
not so cheap that the worst industrial disaster in the world 
could be compensated by an amount of 470 million he said 
the feb 15 1989 settlement before indias supreme court was 
accepted as full and final from the us multinational for the 
gas leak that killed at least 3598 people and injured 20000 
others in the central city of bhopal 
the settlement absolved the danbury connbased company of 
further civil or criminal liability under indian law however it 
is subject to review by the court if challenged 
gas victims and activists groups challenged the settlement on 
two grounds that the gandhi government had no right to declare 
itself the sole representative of all claims arising from the 
disaster and the settlement itself was unfair 
on dec 22 20 days after singh took office the supreme court 
ruled the government did indeed have the right to be the claimants 
sole representative 
goswami said the government will support the victims in the 
other challenge to the settlement which is pending before the 
court 
the government is of the considered view that the 
constitutional and legal rights of victims to seek such judicial 
remedies as are available to them under the law of the land 
cannot be bartered away he said 
neither the union of india nor a settlement arrived at between 
the union of india and any other party could extinguish this 
inalienable right of the victims he said 
goswami however refused to comment on whether the settlement 
would be scrapped saying that the case was before the supreme 
court 
an attorney whose firm represented union carbide in the 
prolonged legal maneuvering after the disaster said he had no 
immediate comment 
i have to communicate the governments statement to my clients 
and i am in no position to say anything said the attorney who 
spoke on condition of not being identified further 
robert berzok union carbides chief spokesman in danbury said 
the company had only seen news reports of the governments 
statements and was not prepared to comment in detail 
all i can tell you is there is no information that suggests 
that the assumptions made in ordering the settlement were 
incorrect he said 
the indian government acting under a 1985 law making it the 
sole representative of the bhopal victims originally sued union 
carbide for 3 billion in damages 
it also filed charges of criminal negligence against top 
executives of the usbased union carbide corp and of its local 
subsidiary union carbide of india ltd for allegedly causing the 
leak 
the multinational company said the leak was the result of 
sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
suits and countersuits ensued in several indian courts until the 
nations supreme court in new delhi took jurisdiction of the case 
and the criminal charges were eventually dropped the gandhi 
government and union carbide agreed on the 470 million settlement 
which the supreme court accepted 11 months ago 
union carbide deposited the full settlement with the court but 
distribution of the money was delayed because of the various 
challenges and the bureaucracy involved in deciding who was 
entitled to the money 
at least 500000 people have asked for compensation according 
to madhya pradesh state officials processing the claims in bhopal 
a city of one million 
goswami said the government would pay interim compensation to 
victims in areas near the pesticide plant from where the toxic gas 
leaked the amount he said would be independent of the amount 
deposited by union carbide with the supreme court 
some of the claimants lived thousands of miles from bhopal but 
claimed they suffered mental anguish over the disaster 
most of the undisputed sufferers are the poor shantytown 
dwellers who live in mud and burlap huts across the street from the 
nowclosed union carbide plant

retail sales increased just 5 percent in 1989 
the slowest gain in seven years and holiday spending was the 
weakest since 1985 the government reported friday 
analysts said the figures reflected a steepening slide in 
consumer spending once an area of strength in last years economy 
it seems that consumer spending is dead in the water said 
samuel d kahan chief economist at fuji securities inc in 
chicago 
the consumer basically is in hiding said walter loeb 
retail analyst at morgan stanley amp co in new york who credited 
bargain promotions for most of the consumer spending which did 
occur 
the commerce department said retail sales totaled 171 trillion 
last year the 5 percent gain compared with 71 percent in 1988 
and was the slowest since the 29 percent rise in the recession 
year of 1982 
december sales rose only 02 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
1444 billion after rising 05 percent in november 
because many consumers now begin their christmas shopping just 
after thanksgiving many analysts combine sales in both months to 
assess holiday spending half or more of retail profits come from 
business done between thanksgiving and christmas 
the combined novemberdecember sales were just 38 percent above 
the same period of 1988 which posted a 66 percent jump over the 
same months of 1987 the 1989 holiday gain was the most sluggish 
since the 29 percent rise in 1985 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
government securities dealer said consumers are spending only when 
they get a bargain 
thats obvious in the case of auto incentives and all of the 
discounts at christmas jones saidconsumers did come out of 
their shell and spend at christmas but only because department 
stores offered them discounts 
many analysts said consumer spending will continue on that 
track at least through the first half of the year 
sales of durable goods bigticket items such as cars and 
household appliances expected to last more than three years fell 
06 percent in december after edging up 01 percent in november 
durable goods which often are financed by loans have been 
particularly affected by tighter federal reserve credit policies 
and were the subject of vast promotions especially in the 
automobile sector 
but most auto incentives ended with the introduction of 1990 
models in october and motor vehicle sales dropped 07 percent in 
december on top of a 04 percent decline in november 
auto sales which represent about 22 percent of retail sales 
ended the year up just 22 percent compared to a 103 percent gain 
in 1988 it was the lowest since sales actually declined 81 
percent in 1980 
excluding autos overall sales in december were up 04 percent 
sales of durable building materials rose 01 percent on top of a 
07 percent rise in november while furniture and other home 
furnishings declined 1 percent after a 07 percent increase a month 
earlier 
sales of nondurable goods rose 06 percent after gaining 08 
percent in november 
sales were up 06 percent at grocery stores and 13 percent at 
gasoline stations both due in part to higher prices apparel sales 
advanced 01 percent 
but despite the holiday season department store sales were down 
04 percent in december sales at restaurants and bars were down 
09 percent and at drug stores down 1 percent 
for the three months from october through december overall 
retail sales were up 36 percent

parish offices and two chapels complete with altars and pews for 
425 worshipers but in place of the traditional spire the complex 
would have parking for 805 vehicles 
an ersatz bell tower topped with a stainless steel cross 
actually will contain the elevator to the 10 openair parking 
floors 
the building will look like a church said william mcbride 
the projects architect we want the parking garage to look 
secondary 
but the economics of highpriced downtown real estate played 
more of a role in the creation than did divine inspiration 
church officials and their consultants came to standard parking 
corp with the idea for the development to get more value out of 
their land 
under the deal standard parking and the developer stein amp co 
get a prime downtown site in a growing market for offstreet 
parking the parishioners of old st marys would get a new church 
worth 55 million essentially for free 
its a winwin situation said rev thomas j dove the 
pastor 
the diocese retains ownership of the property and the first two 
floors of the development while standard parking and stein own the 
parking deck 
besides the free church the parish would get a 25 percent 
share of the parking receipts and free parking for churchgoers on 
sunday and selected holy days said constance k dickinson vice 
president of marketing for stein 
two of the developers other parking decks play on themes one 
in the theater district has floors named after musicals with tunes 
from the shows playing on each level another has floors with city 
names and theme songs to identify them 
the collaboration prompted many religious references for floors 
but the developers decided to use titles from famous books to 
identify the floors ms dickinson said 
we gave up on finding 10 saints in chicago dove said 
the need for parking space thwarted another of doves 
toungeincheek suggestions three parking levels named heaven 
purgatory and hell 
warshauer said the developers held several meetings with 
parishioners to make sure the creation would be acceptable 
dove told uncertain parishioners that it would be difficult to 
raise the 3 million or 4 million needed to rebuild the old church 
already on the lot which consists of two old commercial buildings 
that were converted beginning in 1961 
the parish itself founded in 1833 is the oldest roman catholic 
parish in the city 
if the city council approves the plan demolition of the old 
structure could begin by summer and the church would be ready about 
18 months later

president mikhail s gorbachev told 
lithuanian farmers friday they would be better off if their 
republic stayed in the soviet union but proindependence 
protesters again confronted him and local leaders accused him of 
laying a propaganda trap 
gorbachev made the pitch at a collective farm in siauliai 125 
miles northwest of vilnius a day after promising a national vote 
on secession but predicting lithuanians would choose to remain in 
the soviet union once they understood the difficulties involved in 
seceding after 50 years 
the soviet leader arrived in the tiny baltic republic of 37 
million people thursday for a threeday mission to try to solve one 
the biggest crises of his tenure the swelling tide of independence 
and its potential effects nationwide 
there were signs lithuanians were not listening to his appeals 
to seek a solution not by seceding but by remaining in the union 
gorbachev was greeted at the bridai farm by protesters carrying 
banners that read we are for an independent lithuania and 
our aim is the independence of lithuania 
after an exasperating day of trying to get his message across 
gorbachev showed his sense of humor was intact telling the 
demonstrators ok i have read them all take a rest 
the crowd interrupted him frequently and by the end of the 
discussion his smile had disappeared and his face was grim the 
scene was broadcast by staterun tv 
foreign reporters were not permitted to accompany gorbachev in 
siauliai because it is a military region closed to foreigners 
later as the president arrived at the taulus tv factory in 
siauliai a crowd shouting freedom to lithuania greeted him 
he shrugged and told them sarcastically and you say you are not 
free 
lithuanian activists who have wide popular support say they 
want to restore the independence their homeland enjoyed between the 
world wars in 1940 dictator josef stalin absorbed lithuania and 
the two other baltic states estonia and latvia under a secret 
deal with nazi germany 
vytautas landsbergis head of the proindependence sajudis 
political movement on friday dismissed gorbachevs announcement of 
a day earlier that a secession law was being prepared 
its a propaganda trap landsbergis who is also a member of 
the congress of peoples deputies parliament in moscow told a news 
conference if we get entangled in the mechanism of seceding from 
the soviet union we automatically act as if we were now a legal 
part of the soviet union 
gorbachev noted thursday that the soviet constitution guarantees 
each of the countrys 15 republics the right to secede and 
revealed that the first draft of a law detailing the process of 
secession has been written he promised a national discussion and a 
referendum on the proposal 
on friday he warned the farmers huddled around him on a 
street to think about the consequences of secession 
it will be written in the soviet constitution that there are 
14 not 15 union republics this will mean a split and there will 
be no place for you in that union he said as his wife raisa 
and lithuanian communist party chief algirdas brazauskas stood 
beside him 
he then cited economic factors that he implied would make it 
better for lithuanians to remain in the union 
our ties within the country are very close he said this 
cannot be compared with what they have in the european market we 
have a colossal division of labor 
lithuania receives 70 percent to 100 percent of its energy oil 
and metals from the russian federation gorbachev told the farmers 
brazauskas who supports the drive for independence chimed in that 
the prices lithuania receives are far below world levels 
gorbachev said he favors restoring the republics sovereignty 
and economic independence but warned that if lithuania secedes 
not only lithuania will suffer 
if you think i want to frighten lithuania then you are 
mistaken gorbachev said russia byelorussia everybody will 
suffer 
on thursday night gorbachevs announcement to lithuanian 
intellectuals that the law on secession was being drafted was met 
with applause and broad smiles 
i favor the existence of a mechanism to secede to stop this 
speculation let there be a choice by the people gorbachev 
said in comments broadcast on lithuanian tv 
he gave no details of the law but implied it would require a 
republic contemplating secession to make detailed plans set out 
the exact costs both financial and in terms of human dislocation 
and then hold an election 
his voice cracking with emotion gorbachev told the 
intellectuals you have relations with all the republics with 
all states you must resolve all the problems such as what to do 
with the people who want to leave and who will get the homes and 
the jobs they leave behind 
now people dont know what awaits them he said theyve 
been told fairy tales russian fairy tales and lithuanian fairy 
tales 
instead of euphoric calls for freedom gorbachev said people 
should be given concrete information on how secession would take 
place and what they have to live through 
he predicted lithuanians would reject secession in favor of his 
proposal for a loose soviet federation he said lithuanians would 
never feel free if their lives improved at the cost of harming 
ethnic russians poles and other nonlithuanians in the republic 
when his audience objected gorbachevs voice rose it will 
never happen he nearly shouted you are a civilized people 
your conscience wont let you 
but kazimieras motieka a sajudis leader and member of the 
supreme soviet legislature said gorbachev had badly miscalculated 
no economic blockades no threats no gloomy predictions will 
stop the lithuanian people motieka told a news conference 
gorbachevs announcement is likely to encourage independence 
movements in latvia estonia georgia and other nonrussian 
republics in addition to lithuania 
by going to lithuania gorbachev put his personal prestige on 
the line as never before in nearly five years in power appearing 
in a republic that openly disagrees with him and is unlikely to be 
moved by his appeals he was sent to the republic by the 
moscowbased central committee to seek reversal of the lithuanian 
communist partys decision last month to split off from the 
national party

us delegates met behind closed 
doors with their counterparts from three cocaineproducing 
countries friday to craft a tough antinarcotics resolution for a 
february summit 
representatives from bolivia peru and colombia presented the 
americans who arrived thursday night in this semitropical city in 
the midsection of south america with a draft document that calls 
for more us aid as well as a steppedup battle against 
trafficking conference sources said 
work on a final text was expected to be completed on saturday 
according to delegates 
the resolution was to remain confidential until it is formally 
signed at the feb 15 oneday summit in cartagena colombia by 
presidents bush virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia 
peruvian president alan garcia has said he will attend only if 
us occupying troops are withdrawn from panama 
but the chief of the peruvian delegation in santa cruz foreign 
ministry subsecretary armando lecaro played down garcias 
ultimatum he said his country would send a highlevel delegation 
to the summit in any case and planned to fully participate 
the presummit meeting was being held under strict security at a 
hotel in this cocainetrafficking city 350 miles from la paz the 
capital of landlocked bolivia 
michael skol the state departments assistant undersecretary 
for interamerican affairs headed the us delegation he declined 
any comment to reporters and the us ambassador to bolivia robert 
gelbard said only that he was optimistic about the outcome of the 
conference 
the three south american countries representatives have been 
gathered since wednesday making changes in an original resolution 
drawn up by the united states 
the original document recognized the need for more us aid but 
tied it to each countrys performance in battling trafficking 
according to a copy obtained by the associated press 
the document also stressed the need for a militarization of the 
war on drugs saying each country must commit armed forces to the 
antinarcotics campaign 
some cocaineproducing countries have been reluctant to involve 
their military in the battle against traffickers fearing the 
corruption of top officers in bolivia army leaders seized power 
in 1980 with the backing of wealthy cocaine dealers and ruled for a 
year 
according to us and bolivian delegates speaking on condition 
they not be identified the three south american countries made 
several major changes in the us proposal weakening the link 
between economic aid and performance and watering down references 
to militarization 
informed of the changes us officials in washington made an 
urgent appeal through the bolivian embassy for the south 
americans to restore the bulk of the original document and this 
was done late thursday according to the delegates 
bolivia and peru impoverished nations where most of the worlds 
coca leaf is grown are emphasizing the need for money to develop 
their countries and offer growers profitable alternatives 
colombia a richer country that serves as a center for smuggling 
and processing is pushing for more funds for interdiction 
all three countries maintain the united states must make a 
concerted effort to control domestic consumption of cocaine

a tribal leader fighting for a homeland 
in northeastern india said friday his followers will raise a 
500000member volunteer force to make the state government cave in 
to their demands 
we will not compromise for anything less than a separate 
homeland said upendra kumar bharma who heads the homeland 
movement of the predominantly animist bobo tribes 
bharma and 15 other bodo leaders met government officials in new 
delhi on thursday and demanded a separate state in the indian 
nation the demand was turned down and the tribal leaders vowed to 
resume their fight 
the bodo tribes have been waging a 2yearold bush war with the 
government of indias assam state for a homeland to preserve their 
ancient culture their campaign has left 5000 people dead 3000 
bodos behind bars and more than 100000 homeless according to 
bharma 
however an assam government official said only 513 people had 
been killed since the homeland campaign turned violent in march 
1987 
the allegations are not only baseless but deliberately being 
spread to defame the assam government said jyotsna kumar das 
the state governments chief spokesman in new delhi 
bharma said the proposed 500000member volunteer force would be 
trained with the sole aim of winning a homeland for the bodos we 
will make the assam government surrender before us he said 
he did not explicitly say the force would be armed or outline 
how it would be trained but he said it will be a very powerful 
force 
bharma said the campaign would not lack funds we collect two 
rupees 12 cents from each bodo family every month for the cause 
and that is a lot of money there about 800000 bodo families 
making up a population of about 4 million 
bharma said he has agreed to meet assam and national government 
officials in february for another round of talks 
if that fails we will resume a more vigorous agitation for 
which we will not be responsible 
the bodo issue is one of the problems inherited by the new 
government of prime minister vp singh who succeeded rajiv gandhi 
six weeks ago 
assam leaders have told us that there is no way they can 
accept our separate homeland demand bharma said but we are 
hopeful that mr vp singh will understand our problem and will do 
something 
the bodos mostly farmers of mongol origin have been demanding 
a separate homeland in a hilly area on the northern bank of the 
brahmaputra river in assam which borders bangladesh and bhutan 
according to bodo leaders 98 percent of their fellow tribesmen 
practice the bathou religion which honors spirits believed to be 
embodied in trees and rocks they claim they suffer discrimination 
by the assamese mostly hindus

a judge placed the financially troubled 
city of east st louis on one years probation friday for 
potentially endangering its police officers by not repairing their 
squad car radios 
the city was convicted jan 4 of reckless conduct that was the 
citys second reckless conduct conviction in three months and only 
the third known to have occurred against a city in illinois in more 
than 75 years said st clair county states attorney john 
baricevic 
the city has made a minor effort to improve the situation 
baricevic said i do not know that everybody has a radio i do 
know that many police officers have bought their own radios 
the city had also been charged with reckless conduct for 
allowing police cars to fall into disrepair but was not found 
guilty on that charge baricevic originally filed the charges 
against the city in february 1988 
since the city could not be given a jail term it faced a 
maximum fine of 1000 on the reckless conduct charge baricevic 
recommended a token 1 fine because of the citys huge debt 
estimated at 40 million 
instead st clair county associate judge robert p lechien 
placed the city on probation for one year he said the city should 
be checked regularly to ensure that it is keeping its radios and 
patrol cars in good condition the city also was assessed court and 
probation costs 
lechien said the evidence showed there is pervasive potential 
for danger to police officers due to faulty equipment 
i find in aggravation that the city has not met the 
obligation of protecting its citizens lechien said 
the city has 30 days to appeal lechien said the citys 
attorney irvin williamson said that was being considered 
the judge went as far as he could baricevic said after the 
hearing the city deserves to go to jail but that is physically 
impossible 
sgt joseph mccaskill vice president of the citys police 
union declined to comment on the sentence until it could be 
discussed with other union officers 
some new patrol cars have been bought but the city still fails 
to keep gas in them and the tires repaired baricevic noted but 
the mayor carl officer still gets tiptop dollar for operation 
for his car 
east st louis was convicted in october of reckless conduct for 
a sewer system failure that flooded a high school with raw sewage 
in that case associate judge c glenn stevens waived the fine 
because of the citys debt 
the last known case in which a city was found guilty on a 
similar charge was in 1912 when chicago was convicted of reckless 
conduct for improper operation of a municipal hospital

for years the klarsfelds have been tracking alois brunner 
regarded as the most wanted nazi criminal the austrianborn 
brunner was once an associate of adolf eichmann who headed the 
jewish section of the gestapo 
brunner was sentenced to death in france in absentia in 1954 for

poland 
klarsfeld was expelled from syria in 1982 and his wife was not 
allowed to enter the country in 1986

help 
the klarsfelds accomplishments include tracking down klaus 
barbie the former gestapo chief of lyon who was tried and 
sentenced to life in prison in 1986

in damascus and delivered to the presidential palace and foreign 
affairs ministry by an embassy messenger she said it was refused

price increases of energy and food to try to bring down inflation 
the senate session was interrupted briefly when one of the 
windows was broken

communist party located several blocks away and set a small fire 
in front of one of the entrances 
they then walked to the victoria intercontintal hotel and

the department of housing and urban 
development on friday raised the ceiling on singlefamily mortgages 
backed by its federal housing administration from 101250 to 
124875 in a number of areas with high housing costs 
the increase in the cap which mostly affects communities on the 
east and west coasts was called for in recently enacted 
legislation as part of an effort by congress to make fha loans 
available to middle and moderateincome families in highcost 
housing areas 
the increase will remain in effect only through oct 1 unless 
congress acts to extend the legislation requiring the boost fha 
loans generally carry a more favorable interest rate than 
marketrate bank mortgages and often also require a smaller down 
payment than market loans 
the standard fha mortgage limit is 67500 the new 124875 is 
185 percent of the standard cap the maximum allowed under the 
legislation for highcost areas 
the new ceiling applies immediately to fha loans issued for 
parts of new hampshire and all of connecticut massachusetts and 
rhode island also covered by the higher cap are portions of new 
york and new jersey the philadelphia area baltimore washington 
and many of its maryland and virginia suburbs 
singlefamily homes in lake county ill also qualify for the 
new cap as do singlefamily homes in much of california st croix 
in the virginia islands also was approved for the new cap 
dozens of other highcost communities nationwide were granted 
increases that place the maximum fha loans for that jurisdiction 
above the old 101250 cap but below the new maximum

the countrys top opposition leader 
said friday he may visit north korea to discuss reunification and 
ways to ease tension on the divided peninsula 
if kim daejung makes the visit he would be the first south 
korean political leader to visit the communist country since the 
195053 korean war 
the visit will be by myself or a party delegation kim said 
kim head of the largest opposition political group the party 
for peace and democracy said the visit would be arranged with 
government approval 
an unauthorized visit would violate national security laws 
kim declined to elaborate on his plans and said he would 
announce further details next week 
the opposition leader said he raised the possibility of a trip 
in talks with president roh taewoo on thursday and said roh 
responded favorably there was no comment friday from rohs office 
if kim visits the north korean capital of pyongyang party 
officials said he would expect to contact communist officials 
officials of kims party said the visit may take place in the first 
half of the year 
aides to kim said the primary purpose would be to meet north 
korean president kim il sung and help create a good atmosphere for 
an interkorea summit 
roh has proposed a meeting with the north korean president 
several times in the past two years but his proposal has not been 
addressed specifically by the north koreans two days ago roh told 
a nationally televised news conference that he wanted to meet kim 
il sung to discuss possible free travel between the two nations 
in a new years speech the north korean leader invited roh and 
south korean opposition leaders to the north for unification talks 
government officials said the invitation was a ploy to lump roh and 
opposition leaders in the same category thus undermining rohs 
leadership 
government officials said the opposition leaders indictment on 
charges related to the other lawmakers secret trip to north korea 
would not pose a problem for his own trip 
the 64yearold opposition leader was indicted last summer for 
allegedly failing to report to authorities the 1988 secret trip to 
north korea of one of his partys lawmakers kim has denied the 
charge 
several dissident leaders are in jail for making unauthorized 
trips to north korea 
vice unification minister song hanho said south korea would 
propose creating a hot line with pyongyang so military leaders can 
communicate in an emergency 
song also said his government plans to propose peaceful uses for 
the demilitarized zone between the two countries exchanges of 
military personnel prior notification of major military exercises 
and invitations for delegates to observe such maneuvers 
the two nations have opened several channels of talks on 
personnel economic parliamentary and political exchanges since 
the early 1970s but have made little progress 
reunification is a frequent demand of antigovernment protesters

irancontra prosecutors have expressed an 
interest in documents seized from the headquarters of fallen 
panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega the justice department 
said friday 
the office of independent counsel lawrence e walsh inquired 
thursday about the documents that were found in noriegas

house aide oliver l north and john m poindexter who was national 
security adviser under president reagan 
poindexter is awaiting trial on charges of lying to congress

charges once offered to assassinate sandinista leaders according 
to an uncontested statement known as a stipulation filed during 
norths irancontra trial last year poindexter and north spurned 
the offer but the national security adviser expressed an interest 
in noriega directing sabotage against nicaraguan facilities the 
stipulation said 
the documents seized at the panamanian defense forces 
headquarters might shed light on panamanianbased companies used to 
funnel covert us assistance to the nicaraguan rebels 
a team of a dozen justice department attorneys and investigators 
are combing through the documents to determine if they contain 
evidence of violations of federal law by noriega or others 
some of the material has already been brought to this country 
for further review by prosecutors runkel said 
the stipulation agreed to by the government and filed at norths 
trial outlines some assistance noriega gave the contras it says 
noriega helped the contras destroy a sandinista arsenal in 1985 
it also states that in 1986 a noriega representative told north 
that panamanians would assassinate sandinista leaders in return for 
a us promise to improve panamas image and lift a ban on military 
sales 
north according to the court statement responded that us law 
barred assassinations and noriegas representative said the general 
had numerous assets in place in nicaragua and could accomplish 
many essential things 
north reported the conversation to poindexter who responded 
that if noriega had assets inside nicaragua he could be 
helpful 
while assassination was illegal poindexter said sabotage 
would be another story the document said poindexter 
recommended that north speak with noriega 
north met with noriega in september 1986 in london where 
noriega offered to take action against the sandinistas the 
document said 
the document stated that noriega offered a list of possible 
sabotage targets including an oil refinery an airport and an 
offloading facility 
jose i blandon a former noriega confidante who defected in 
1988 told a senate subcommittee that the panamanian leader and 
north met in june 1985 on a boat anchored off panama city to 
discuss what noriega could do to help the contras 
blandon who is expected to testify at noriegas drug 
trafficking trial in miami said his former boss agreed to help 
train the contras and allow the rebel leaders safe passage in and 
out of panama

a proiranian fundamentalist group 
claimed friday it is under siege by a syrianbacked militia because 
that force wants to prevent it from attacking israeli occupiers 
an estimated 10000 backers of the fundamentalist hezbollah 
demonstrated in south beiruts suburb of bir elabed to protest 
what they called the amal militias siege on the fundamentalists in 
southern iqlim altuffah province 
the protesters including women in black chadors also chanted 
slogans against the united states france and israel 
what is happening today in iqlim altuffah is a big conspiracy 
aiming at totally terminating the islamic resistance and making us 
pay the price for confronting the israeli occupying force in the 
region said a hezbollah statement distributed to reporters at 
the demonstration 
amal had no comment on the charges by hezbollah 
the secular amal militia and the hezbollah are vying for control 
of lebanons 12 million shiite moslems they have been fighting 
each other since dec 23 in iqlim altuffah 
by police count more than 97 people have been killed and 277 
wounded in the current round of fighting 
police reported friday intermittent clashes with 
rocketpropelled grenades and machine gun fire with no casualties 
reported 
but tehran radio monitored in cyprus reported that an iranian 
delegation in lebanon trying to mediate a peace accord released a 
statement saying presently a ceasefire is being completely 
respected by both sides 
both sides have expressed a readiness to withdraw their 
fighters to preconflict borders the statement said it 
predicted such a withdrawal was imminent 
hezbollah or party of god is the largest group in the islamic 
resistance a coalition of extremist moslem factions fighting 
israeli troops in the selfdeclared israeli security zone in 
the south 
israel carved the security zone up to 10 miles deep into lebanon 
in june 1985 when it withdrew most of its invasion army from 
lebanon after a threeyear occupation 
the zone jointly patrolled by 1500 israeli troops and about 
2500 allied militiamen serves as a buffer against crossborder 
guerrilla infiltrations into northern israeli settlements 
amal has launched the war in iqlim altuffah imposed a siege 
on our mujahedeen fighters who confront the israeli enemy 
despite the cold and has blocked their supply routes the 
hezbollah statement charged 
it urged lebanese leaders to work on ending amals attacks and 
to pressure the secular faction into opening roads so hezbollah can 
continue liberating all israelioccupied territories

the police dispatcher hailed as a hero when the 
charles stuart case broke testified friday before a grand jury 
looking into evidence implicating stuart in his pregnant wifes 
shooting death 
gary mclaughlin refused to discuss what he said or even how long 
his appearance lasted he did say that since charles stuarts 
suicide last week he had reviewed the transcript of the oct 23 
call 
when asked if he found anything suspicious he said not 
really but he wouldnt elaborate mclaughlin added on a 
personal level i think the country was duped 
its a bizarre and twisted case he said 
carol stuart 30 who was seven months pregnant died hours 
after the shooting and her premature baby christopher died 17 
days later until stuarts jan 4 suicide most people believed 
stuarts account that he and his wife were victims of a mugger 
the case drew attention because of a dramatic conversation 
between mclaughlin and the wounded stuart using his car telephone 
to eventually direct police to him and his wife 
investigators learned of the hoax when a younger brother 
matthew stuart told authorities jan 3 that he met charles at the 
murder scene and retrieved mrs stuarts handbag which contained a 
gun and some personal items 
matthew stuart 23 said he was not aware mrs stuart was shot 
when his brother passed him the bag but prosecutors declined to 
say whether he or anyone else might face charges 
suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan said this week 
that no one was granted immunity to testify before the grand jury 
which was hearing evidence off and on since shortly after the 
shooting occurred 
district attorney spokesman john julian declined to say how many 
witnesses would be called and he said the panel could conclude 
that no one other than charles stuart committed any crime 
were just trying to get at the true story he said 
while the stuarts were described as a loving couple by many of 
their friends and relatives reports have surfaced that charles 
stuart was unhappy with his wifes pregnancy and believed a baby 
would interfere with his ambitions 
also statements by attorneys indicate that stuart not only 
enlisted the help of his brother matthew in the scheme but also 
made overtures to another brother michael weeks before the crime 
a critical piece of evidence the 38caliber revolver believed 
to be the murder weapon was recovered this week from the pines 
river in revere where matthew stuart said the gun was thrown 
authorities were waiting for test results to confirm whether the 
gun was used in the shooting

the judge in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial said he wants to unseal 52 verdicts to avoid a 
mistrial but attorneys insisted that none be unsealed until all 65 
verdicts are rendered 
superior court judge william pounders abruptly canceled a 
hearing scheduled for friday to confront the question of reading 
partial verdicts after defense and prosecution lawyers telephoned 
him to express adamant opposition to a piecemeal return of verdicts 
the panelists are considering 65 charges including child 
molestation and conspiracy in the case of raymond buckey 31 and 
his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 they are accused of abusing 
11 children at their nowdefunct mcmartin preschool in suburban 
manhattan beach 
the 2yearold mcmartin trial is the longest and costliest 
criminal proceeding in us history with no alternates left to 
replace any ailing juror the absence of even one jury member would 
cause a mistrial 
my feeling is i want to take those verdicts pounders said 
thursday after the panel returned 13 more decisions bringing their 
total to 52 but thats not necessarily the right decision if 
the attorneys are unanimously against it that could end it 
the jurors are making great progress he said we have 
over 78 percent of the verdicts in but if i lose one juror i lose 
all 52 verdicts which is why im on the razors edge 
none of the verdicts is final until jurors affirm in open court 
that each was their decision 
my position is what it has always been leave the jury 
alone said attorney dean gits who represents mrs buckey 
unsealing verdicts now will only put undue pressure on them we 
have no indication they are deadlocked and until we do lets leave 
them alone 
sandi gibbons spokesperson for district attorney ira reiner 
said prosecutors opposed pounders plan as well 
the position of this office has always been that we oppose 
reading partial verdicts she said 
pounders said he decided to await further word from the jury 
jurors deliberated only a half day friday because one of them had a 
doctors appointment and they chose to take the day off monday 
because of martin luther kings birthday a court holiday 
shortly after the jurors resumed their talks friday the judge 
warned them not to watch monday nights scheduled abctv show about 
child molestation called unspeakable acts

the maid made out when a judge ruled finders 
keepers on a 30000 stash of 100 bills she found stuffed behind 
a dresser in hotel room 
the verdict in fulton county superior court on thursday ended a 
6year battle over the fistfuls of bills that diana m 
merriweather discovered in a room at the tower place hotel in 1983 
i guess im a bit surprised ms merriweather said she said 
she hopes to open a small business with the money 
but a jeweler who contended the money was his said he was even 
more surprised 
william mackley 41 of paris texas said the verdict was 
unbelievable and that he would appeal 
he said he and an associate casey strickland who couldnt be 
located for the trial each thought the other had used the money to 
buy antique jewelry 
the room was registered to strickland and jurors were told that 
when he was reached by telephone after several weeks had passed he 
denied having left anything behind 
hotel attorney robert d wildstein told jurors that mackley said 
the bills were crisp and new when they were actually old and he 
misidentified the color of the wrappers 
judge leah searscollins ordered the court to hold the money

a comatose woman who had an abortion after 
her husband battled abortion opponents is recovering well through 
rehabilitation that would have been impossible if she remained 
pregnant her doctor said friday 
nancy kleins recovery has been spurred by her determination to 
get home to her husband martin and their 4yearold daughter 
arielle 
she likes seeing arielle that really perks her up said her 
physician caroline o mccagg who described mrs kleins therapy 
as a boot camp regimen from 7 am to 4 pm daily 
mrs klein 33 doesnt remember the dec 13 1988 car 
collision that put her in a coma when she was 18 weeks pregnant 
but she is remembering some things daytoday and from before the 
accident and she has learned to speak feed herself and use a 
wheelchair to get around the robert wood johnson jr rehabilitation 
institute about 20 miles southwest of new york city 
doctors initially believed her recovery prospects were slim but 
told her husband that chances would improve slightly if she had an 
abortion doctors performed the operation 11 months ago after klein 
fought abortion foes all the way to the us supreme court 
we are all very pleased about nancys recovery to date and we 
remain hopeful that shell continue to recover as well in the 
future klein said in a telephone interview from his new york 
home we just want people to know that this is one step in a very 
long road ahead 
we think its a miracle said nancys mother anne zusselman 
in a telephone interview from another daughters home in new jersey 
nancy has been working so hard at therapy said mrs 
zusselman of delray beach fla she goes slowly but doesnt stop 
doesnt plateau 
mrs zusselman said her daughter has made two weekend visits to 
her upper brookville home on new yorks long island and has gone on 
day visits to her sisters home in new jersey 
mccagg medical director of the institutes center for head 
injuries said mrs klein is able to make it through the tough 
therapeutic program when hospital workers tell her this is going 
to get you home 
mccagg said the pregnancy would have blocked the use of 
antibiotics and antiseizure medicines necessary for mrs kleins 
recovery 
john short one of the activists who tried to stop the abortion 
said from his farmingdale ny home naturally im happy for 
nancy klein i just feel sad the child wont be there to help her 
in her recovery 
i hope she doesnt have to go through the trauma of asking 
where is my child and having to be told it was killed he said 
mrs klein was admitted to the institute in march her eyes were 
open but she could not communicate she began answering yesandno 
questions by pressing a button early last summer three months ago 
she began using a wheelchair and began talking as long as two 
months ago said mccagg 
the doctor said complete recovery is unusual in cases involving 
such severe head injuries but added that mrs klein will be able 
to become pregnant again and is expected to remain in the hospital 
for at least six more months

president bush warned congress on friday not 
to look for big savings from pentagon spending and complained that 
his key domestic initiatives were mired in the jungles on capitol 
hill 
while applauding the dramatic changes in eastern europe bush 
cautioned against expectations of any peace dividend in the 
military budget saying that is not money in the bank it is more 
like a possible future inheritance 
meanwhile he said its impossible today to know what will 
unfold in the next six months let alone the next six years 
bush said the us invasion of panama was proof that america 
must have a ready and highly effective defense force 
the president spoke to about 1500 people at a gathering of the 
greater cincinnati chamber of commerce 
later he met privately with the family of army pfc james 
markwell a ranger medic killed by gunfire in his drop zone in the 
panama invasion 
the white house said bush expressed his personal sympathy and 
gratitude for the sacrifice that markwell made for his country 
press secretary marlin fitzwater speaking with reporters later 
said the presidents talk with the family of the dead soldier was 
a pretty emotional meeting 
fitzwater said that we were all pretty broken up about it 
referring to the president as well as several aides and secret 
service agents 
fitzwater said that the soldiers mother mrs william rouse 
showed the president a poem that her son had written when he was 15 
years old about being in the military as well as a death 
message that he had written before going into combat 
fitzwater said that in that message her son was proud of what 
he was doing it was a little message for each of the people he 
knew in life 
that was really tough fitzwater said 
bush also has sent letters of condolence to the families of all 
those killed in panama officials said 
the presidents combative stand toward congress sets the tone 
for legislative battles likely to erupt after lawmakers return to 
work jan 23 bush will send his budget to congress on jan 29 and 
deliver his state of the union address on jan 30 
he said the democraticcontrolled congress had stalled action on 
his plans to lower capital gains taxes beef up education programs 
strengthen cleanair regulations and fight crime 
and these four issues are bogged down in the jungles on 
capitol hill bush said 
the clock is running and americas patience is running out 
bush said 
while saying he was not trying to assign any blame bush said 
america wants it done right america wants it done responsibly 
and america wants it done now 
the fall of hardline communist governments in eastern europe has 
prompted calls in congress and elsewhere for lowering defense 
spending and targeting the money for other purposes 
thats like the nextofkin who spend the inheritance before 
the will is read bush said 
of course whenever a potential inheritance looms he said 
there are those eager to rush out and squander it to buy new 
things to spend to spend to spend spending funds they dont 
yet have 
then the bills start coming and the inheritance may not 
bush said and what was promised as a bonus becomes a burden 
he won applause by saying most americans know we not only 
must maintain our defenses but still must reduce the deficit 
bush also paid a visit to predominantly black taft high school 
where he hailed a program of business leaders government officials 
and educators to reduce dropouts and improve academic performance 
several speakers told bush there was a sense of hopelessness 
among innercity youths and asked what he could do about it 
he said the best answer was encouraging the strength of the 
family 
bush said federal resources for education were limited but that 
he would call for some increases in overall school spending when he 
presents his fiscal 1991 budget to congress on jan 23 including 
expanding the head start program for disadvantaged preschool 
children 
but the president added i dont think you can design a 
curriculum to lift the selfesteem of a kid its got to come from 
peers its got to come from family its got to come from 
dedicated volunteers or workers who are saying hey you are 
somebody you can amount to something

air pollution data from scores of industrial 
plants show high levels of cancercausing chemicals still are being 
released raising health concerns for those living nearby the 
environmental protection agency said 
the agency cautioned that the toxic releases should not be 
considered a clear measure of an individuals lifetime risk of 
getting cancer because the analysis reflects a worstcase situation 
nevertheless the estimates for some of the facilities on the 
list continue to be of serious concern epa administrator william 
reilly said in a letter to rep henry waxman dcalif whose 
office made public the data 
epa spokesman david cohen said friday auditors have been sent to 
a number of plants for close examination of high toxic release 
levels 
the statistics covered toxic chemical releases into the air at 
149 operating industrial plants pulp mills and other facilities in 
34 states 
the findings showed toxic release levels at 52 plants were high 
enough that persons living closest to the plant could be exposed to 
a lifetime cancer risk of at least 1 in 1000 the potential risk 
was as great as 1 in 10 at the texaco butadiene plant in port 
neches texas and 1 in 100 at 6 other plants the epa said the 
risk was 1 in 10000 at 97 other plants 
the government in many cases considers a maximum cancer risk of 
1 in 1 million to be unacceptable 
chemical industry spokesmen acknowleged that at some plants too 
many toxic chemcials are being released but said the latest figures 
confirm that the trend of air emission releases from chemical 
plants is heading down 
we are convinced that releases of emissions from chemical 
plants are not harmful to residents nearby said the chemical 
manufacturers association an industry trade group in a statement 
responding to the epa figures 
the epa cautioned the cancer risk assessments were in many cases 
based on mathematical models and were not intended to reflect the 
actual cancer risk to particular individuals in the risk 
assessment for example it is presumed a person resides about 200 
feet from the source of the release and is exposed over a lifetime 
the data should raise a red warning flag in communities where 
these facilities are located and spur prompt action to investigate 
the plants further said waxman it shows that a great number 
of plants potentially pose extremely high cancer risks to the 
public 
waxman said the data confirms preliminary findings made 
available by the epa last may those findings were criticized by 
industry after it was found that some of the data had been up to 
six years old and included some plants that were no longer 
operating 
the disclosure prompted the epa to review toxic releases at the 
plants and led to the development of the latest figures which the 
agency said reflects releases in 1988 or 1989 
reilly in his letter to waxman said the agency was taking very 
seriously the potential problems these emissions could present 
and that the epa was working with corporate executives to reduce 
the toxic emissions at some of the plants 
i also intend to examine options available to realize other 
emission reductions as soon as possible including use of existing 
enforcement authorities to reduce risks associated with toxic air 
emissions continued reilly he did not elaborate on the 
enforcement action 
in addition to the texaco chemical co plant in port neches 
the facilities where toxic releases posed the highest potential 
cancer risk all a risk of 1 in 100 were an asarco inc lead 
smelting plant in east helena mont a mobil chemical co plant 
in beaumont texas a shell oil co plant in deer park texas a 
uniroyal rubber processing plant in port neches texas a goodyear 
plant in calhoun ga and an american chrome chemical plant in 
corpus christi texas

interim president ion iliescu told 
thousands of anticommunist demonstrators friday that romanias 
communist party has been outlawed 
victory victory shouted the crowd of 5000 after iliescus 
announcement the front is with us they yelled referring to 
the national salvation front the countrys interim leadership 
iliescus announcement was broadcast live on state radio and 
television 
the announcement came hours after the crowd had shouted down 
iliescu and other leaders who tried to speak demonstrators yelled 
down with communism kill the communists they burned a 
romanian communist flag and communist identification papers 
friday was a national day of mourning with religious ceremonies 
held across the country in memory of the victims of the violent 
revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu three 
weeks ago 
iliescu himself a former communist made the announcement from 
the window of the building where the interim government has its 
headquarters on the victoria square 
the romanian communist party is outlawed considering that it 
is against the national spirit and our ancestors law he said 
iliescu however did not say what the decision would mean for 
current members of the party much of romanias new leadership is 
composed of communists 
before the communists took power in 1948 romania was ruled by a 
constitutional monarchy 
romanias newly appointed general prosecutor gheorghe robu told 
romanian tv friday all leading members of the romanian communist 
party were under arrest and their role in the ceausescu regime was 
under investigation he said the trials would begin within 10 days 
he said ceausescus children and brothers who were arrested in 
the first days of the revolt would be brought to trial soon 
iliescu also told the crowd that a national referendum would be 
held jan 28 on whether the death sentence should be reinstated for 
members of ceausescus hated security police 
the feared securitate continued to battle the army even after 
ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 by popular revolt 
ceausescu was executed with his wife elena considered no 2 in 
the party on dec 25 the front then abolished the death penalty 
and said members of the security forces convicted by military 
tribunals would be sentenced to lengthy prison terms 
death to the securitate and death for death the crowd 
chanted referring to the estimated 10000 who died in the clashes 
between security forces and the army during the revolution 
iliescu said the referendum on the death penalty was necessary 
for the adequate punishment of those guilty of crimes against the 
people 
earlier in an effort to appease the crowd iliescu said security 
officials would be tried and sentenced according to the laws 
he said the trials would be public and even shown on television 
the daily romania libera carried an appeal friday from communist 
party members calling on all the honest members to burn their 
party cards at places where martyrs of the revolution died as a 
public condemnation of any idea of recreating a new communist 
party 
iliescu was repeatedly confronted by angry people in the crowd 
who grabbed the microphone to question him 
do you agree with me that the front should represent all the 
parties and that they should all have at least three members 
asked painter augustin pora who said he was a leader of an 
anticommunist alliance 
i agree i agree iliescu responded the front is the 
representative of all the democratic forces in the country he 
said at another point 
an unidentified woman screamed into the microphone who is mr 
iliescu and what has he been doing in the last five years 
i have been head of the national council for water iliescu 
said i am the son of a worker i have been in prison in 1971 i 
was fired from the leadership of the party i have spoken out 
against communism 
iliescu was demoted after criticizing ceausescus autocratic 
rule 
fridays demonstration was the largest anticommunist protest 
since ceausescu was ousted under his ironfisted 24year rule any 
form of protest or criticism of the leadership or communist party 
was nipped in the bud 
the front comprises former communist party members former 
dissidents and intellectuals it says its main purpose is to lead 
the country until the elections promised as early as april 
premier petre roman addressing the crowd friday said it is 
still a question if the front will participate in the 
elections 
iliescu declared friday the day of national mourning for all 
those who gave their lives in the fight against the dictatorial 
regime however most stores remained open 
iliescu and other leaders went out to speak with the protesters 
after attending a solemn service at the patriarhie orthodox 
cathedral in downtown bucharest for the victims 
the service was conducted by patriarch teoctist spiritual 
leader of the romanian orthodox church under ceausescu religious 
practices were greatly suppressed

sarishvili said many businesses and most forms of mass transit 
were on strike in tbilisi in support of independence 
kapanadze said transit was interrupted only in the morning 
because demonstrators blocked roads he said some businesses closed 
not because of a strike but because low water levels at 
hydroelectric stations caused an electricity shortage

power has fully gone over into the hands of the representatives 
of the peoples front a grassroots political group in 
azerbaijan it said protesters blocked government and party 
workers military officers and police from going to work and formed

the state department responded friday to 
chinas lifting of martial law in beijing by issuing a notice to

beforehand are no longer in effect 
prior to chinas announcement thursday the department had

a white expoliceman claims 
security forces battling unrest were told to kill antigovernment 
activists and routinely tortured and assaulted blacks at random 
according to documents 
sgt barney horn who quit the force in october after 13 years 
detailed alleged police misdeeds in a 25page affidavit obtained by 
the associated press friday after his story appeared in the 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper free weekly 
he is the fourth former policeman in recent months to speak out 
about alleged police abuses 
horn said that when he was battling unrest near the southern 
city of port elizabeth in 1984 members of the police security 
branch circulated pictures of local antiapartheid activists 
we were told that these people had been identified as 
instigators and if we saw them we had to take them out horn 
said everyone present understood that to mean kill them 
in recent months three former policemen one white and two 
black have said they were part of police hit squads that 
assassinated antiapartheid activists on orders from superiors 
one of the men butana nofomela has pleaded guilty to killing 
an antiapartheid attorney in 1981 the two other men who say they 
were part of the same killing have fled south africa 
opposition groups say there have been more than 60 unsolved 
killings of activists the past decade the opposition has long 
accused the security force of killing antigovernment activists 
president fw de klerk said last month he would not appoint a 
judicial commission to investigate the alleged police deaths 
squads a decision that has drawn widespread criticism 
horn alleged that when he worked in boksburg east of 
johannesburg 90 percent of police interrogators tortured black 
suspects one of the most common methods was to place a wet bag 
over the suspects head so he could not breathe 
it also was common practice to attach electrodes to suspects 
genitals and administer electric shocks during interrogation horn 
said 
when patrolling the townships he said blacks would be 
attacked by the police members at random hit with the long 
thick batons kicked punched riflebutted 
the members would jump into the vehicle the vehicle would go 
to another road and the same process would be repeated he said 
plenty of people were injured this way we were never ordered to 
stop doing this 
police headquarters in pretoria said horns allegations would be 
investigated at a high level without delay 
horn left south africa on a flight thursday and fears his former 
colleagues may try to harm him said a source who has been in 
contact with horn 
horn said he spoke out because to continue a christian life 
i cannot have these skeletons hanging in my cupboard 
in a related development a british citizen told the free weekly 
newspaper that he bombed the london offices of the african national 
congress guerrilla movement in 1982 while working for the south 
african police 
free weekly said it interviewed peter casselton in pretoria 
where he is in hiding and attempting to leave south africa 
police have denied involvement in the bombing of the anc office

defense secretary dick cheney ordered a freeze 
on hiring civilians at the defense department for the rest of this 
fiscal year the pentagon announced on friday 
cheney said in a statement he was forced to take the step to cut 
costs and because of the sweeping international changes that are 
forcing limits on the department 
as the armed forces are reduced over the long term in light of 
limited budgets a changing world situation and future negotiated 
agreements the department must make corresponding reductions in 
the size of the civilian work force that supports the armed 
forces cheney said 
but the release announcing the step cautioned that department 
officials do not know how much the work force will be reduced by 
the freeze 
the hiring freeze which will be in effect from now until sept 
30 1991 applies to all department of defense civilians 
worldwide including parttime and temporary employees the 
department currently employs 927000 civilians on a fulltime bases 
and another 123000 on a temporary or parttime basis the pentagon 
said 
as many as 80000 workers normally retire or otherwise leave 
that work force each year the statement said 
there are 21 million armed forces personnel in uniform 
the hiring freeze came one day after cheney announced his 
program for trimming the pentagons huge purchasing bureaucracy 
which he predicted would cut 42000 military and civilian job slots 
and save 39 billion over a fiveyear period 
that step is aimed specifically at reducing the complex system 
of civlian and military officials who buy equipment and supplies 
for the department 
the prohibition on the hiring of civilians is directed at 
cutting the departmentwide civilian work force by attrition 
rather than reductionsinforce thereby minimizing economic 
dislocation of civilian employees the statement said 
the statement noted that there are exceptions to the freeze 
such as hiring commitments made by appointed officials prior to the 
announcement of the freeze those positions deemed by top dod 
officials to be essential to maintain an important national 
defense capability and those positions essential to meet 
medical safety or security requirements 
the secretary or deputy secretary of defense must personally 
authorize all political appointements the statement added

the federal communications commission must 
reconsider its decision to allow the 1986 sale of six 
spanishlanguage television stations to a division of hallmark 
cards a federal appeals court said friday 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals in washington 
said the commission apparently violated its own rules for license 
transfers when it allowed the sale to take place before it had 
concluded an investigation into claims that foreigners had 
excessive influence over the stations 
spanish international communications corp and bahia de san 
francisco sold the stations to univision holdings a subsidiary of 
kansas city mobased hallmark in 1986 for 3096 million after 
an fcc administrative law judge denied sicc and bahias license 
renewal applications 
the judge found that foreign interests wielded too much 
influence over the stations financing programming and management 
the appeals court said 
the fcc judge said the azcarraga family which owns a mexican 
media conglomerate exerted excessive control over sicc through its 
president reynald v anselmo anselmo also was a principal in 
bahia 
but an fcc review board later approved the renewal applications 
of sicc and bahia subject to the prompt transfer of the licenses 
to univision the selection of the hallmark division arose from the 
settlement of an unrelated stockholders suit against sicc 
the 9th us district court in california which oversaw the 
stockholders suit subsequently accepted univisions offer over a 
bid from tvl corp a party in the suit 
hallmark spokesman charles hucker on friday said the case was a 
procedural matter and we anticipate no impact on us univision 
continues to operate the stations 
univision has no plans for selling the six stations which 
hallmark spokesman steve doyal said comprised the nations leading 
spanishlanguage tv network 
univision paid 286 million for sicc stations kmextv los 
angeles wltv miami kwextv san antonio wxtv paterson nj 
and kftv hanford calif 
univision paid 236 million for bahias kdtv san francisco 
doyal said 
hispanic broadcasting limited partnership and hispanic 
broadcasting system had challenged the license transfers and asked 
the fcc to consider their competing applications for the stations 
the fcc refused 
tvl also challenged saying the commission had violated its 
rules prohibiting a sale of a station at full value while the 
stations licensee is under investigation 
appeals court judge abner j mikva writing for the majority 
friday agreed he said the fcc had made an exception to its 
transfer policy without articulating a clear rationale for this 
departure 
tvl also said the commission shortcircuited its distress 
sale policy which allows a broadcaster in danger of losing its 
license to sell the station quickly to a minorityowned company for 
75 percent of the stations fairmarket value 
the commission ruled that the sale would not unacceptably 
diminish the deterrence of licensee wrongdoing and that it also 
should not intervene in the california courts decision 
the appeals court panel upheld the commissions decision to 
decline to accept the competing applications or to review the 
actions of the california court but it said the fcc had departed 
from its license transfer policy 
it remanded the case to the fcc to either complete the license 
renewal proceedings or explain a new policy that would modify its 
license transfer rules 
mikva was joined by judge harry t edwards but judge stephen f 
williams dissented in part saying hispanic broadcasting system and 
hispanic broadcasting limited had not shown they suffered material 
injury

a military tribunal friday convicted a 
police major of attempted murder and sentenced him to 19 years in 
prison for shooting protesters who toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
defense counsel lica magdea said in an interview that hundreds 
of other loyalists are awaiting trial or preliminary hearings under 
armed guard confined to a large unfilled army swimming pool the 
military prison the only one large enough for all the suspects 
was destroyed during fighting 
the panel reached its verdict following two days of sometimes 
emotional proceedings after police maj ioan botarel was identified 
by two witnesses as having fired the shots dec 22 that wounded 
three demonstrators 
it was the fifth trial of ceausescu loyalists since last week 
the feared secret police or securitate are accused of crimes 
against the people during the 24year ceausescu rule and the 
violent revolt that ended it 
magdea said some of those detained have been confined to the 
pool for nearly 24 hours a day for up to two weeks 
his client who broke a foot after leaping from a secondstory 
window during the fighting had been detained at an infirmary said 
magdea 
military officials did not allow reporters to see the detained 
suspects saying they were not authorized to issue such orders 
security was high inside the courtroom with about 10 soldiers 
leaning on submachine guns keeping a watchful eye on the crowd 
about 1500 townspeople crowded into the gloomy and curtained 
auditorium of sibius infantry officers academy booed and jeered 
as botarel insisted he had only been following orders 
his passionate statement ended with long live free romania 
long live the truth 
as botarel 45 fumbled with the microphone at one point an 
audience member hissed whats the matter you dont know how to 
handle it because it isnt a gun 
immediately after being sentenced botarel announced he would 
appeal the tribunal presided over by judge mircea badila and 
another civilian judge gave him one year less than the minimum 
term for murder 20 years 
romania abolished the death sentence following the executions of 
ceausescu and his wife elena dec 25 for genocide and other crimes 
but some of those in attendance said capital punishment was the 
only just penalty for ceausescus securitate henchmen who last 
month killed thousands of civilians and soldiers fighting for 
democracy 
late friday in bucharest the capital interim president ion 
iliescu told thousands of anticommunist demonstrators that a 
referendum would be held jan 28 on whether the death penalty 
should be reinstated for securitate members 
these people must be destroyed because they are tyrants 
shooting against unarmed children exclaimed laurean hagdea who 
attended fridays trial they dont have the right to defend 
themselves they are dirt 
hagdea 47 said his 26yearold daughter was among those 
wounded by gunfire from the nearby securitate headquarters where 
botarel and others shot at demonstrators 
initial euphoria in the wake of the revolution has been tempered 
by growing concern that many relatively senior ceausescu loylists 
who switched sides in the first days of the turmoil would never be 
tried for earlier crimes 
in his closing statement magdea the defendants 
courtappointed lawyer argued along those lines we should first 
try to judge those who gave them the orders and then those who 
carried them out because in our opinion those who gave the orders 
are the most guilty he said 
he suggested those who fired from the windows of the securitate 
building now a burnedout hulk were not local police but 
specialists brought in from bucharest by nicu ceausescu son 
of the dictator and former communist party head of sibiu district 
now awaiting trial in the capital 
we want the terrorists to be judged he exclaimed those 
are the guilty ones 
he was alluding to ceausescu bodyguards elite units thought to 
have been about 2000 strong many of them remained loyal to the 
dictator and his family even after the elder ceausescus were 
executed and continued fighting army troops into early this month 
col anton socaciu the military prosecutor asked for a harsh 
sentence dismissing the defendants argument that he shot at gaps 
in the crowd instead of into the demonstrators 
the people in this hall will rise in revolt when they hear 
such explanations from the defense he proclaimed to applause 
from the crowd 
the gun is made for killing people and not for writing 
letters he exclaimed when you shoot you shoot to kill 
in a separate trial expected to extend into saturday 46year 
old constantin bosotenau chief administrator of the sibiu 
communist party pleaded innocent to charges of attempting to 
embezzle part of the party payroll as the revolution broke out and 
aiding the younger ceausescu by providing him with false license 
plates to escape 
sibiu 150 miles nortwest of bucharest was the site of some of 
the fiercest fighting during the revolt and the army warned friday 
of the possibility that snipers remain at large

for the second time in recent weeks the bush 
administration put off issuing an interagency agreement friday 
aimed at more clearly establishing guildelines for protecting 
wetlands prompting criticism from environmentalists 
the environmental protection agency said in a statement that it 
was approving a 15day extension for further discussions over the 
final wording of an agreement between the epa and the us army 
corps of engineers last month a decision was posponed for 30 days 
the memorandum of agreement has been the subject of weeks of 
discussions within the administration after members of alaskas 
congressional delegation complained to the white house that it 
threatens oil and gas development in the state 
the epa and corps of engineers tentatively agreed last november 
on the memorandum which outlines specific actions and procedures a 
developer must take in a wetland area including actions to 
mitigate environmental damages to the wetlands and a requirement 
for compensation possibly by developing other wetlands if 
mitigation is inadequate 
environmentalists argue that the alaskans concerns are 
unfounded and that the actual opposition is coming from the oil 
industry which sees the agreement as making it more expensive to 
explore for oil in wetland areas especially over vast areas across 
northern alaska 
sen ted stevens ralaska intervened last month with white 
house chief of staff john sununu to try to reach an accommodation 
according to sources who spoke under the condition that they not 
be identified by name 
the epa said in a statement friday that the 15day extension of 
deliberations stemmed from the high level of interest in the 
agreement 
environmentalists immediately criticized the delay suggesting 
that bush was reneging on promises to do everything possible to 
stop the dramatic disappearance of wetlands in the country in 
recent years 
we can only assume that the delay is intended to give the oil 
industry more time to sink the presidents clear commitment to a 
national policy of no net loss of wetlands complained jay hair 
president of the wildlife federation in a statement responding to 
the continuing delays in approving the agreement 
epa spokesman david cohen said the agencys does not consider 
the continuing deliberation over the memorandum of agreement with 
the corps of engineers as central to the administrations overall 
wetlands policy 
although bush repeatedly has said he is committed to a goal of 
taking actions to halt the decline of wetlands specifics on how to 
achieve that goal have yet to be developed

a senate committee chairman has asked for an 
investigation of the food and drug administrations review of a 
milk cow hormone alleged to have been inadequate by a fired fda 
veterinarian it was learned friday 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the agriculture 
committee asked the general accounting office the investigative 
arm of congress to look into allegations made by a dr richard 
burroughs about genetically engineered bovine somatotropin a 
hormone that boosts a cows milk production 
the hormone also is produces naturally in the cows body 
leahy also asked the gao to look into 
the adequacy of fda risk assessment for genetically engineered 
products 
the process used to evaluate outside comments about the safety 
of a product 
whether congress should be concerned about the overall approach 
fda is taking 
the congress is being asked with increasing frequency to reach 
conclusions about whether particular products of biotechnology have 
been adequately reviewed and whether use of these products may 
present unacceptable risks to human health animal health or the 
environment leahy said in his letter to the gao which was 
provided to the associated press on friday 
burroughs met with agriculture committee staff in november and 
has said in interviews that the fda has been so eager to approve 
the growth hormone that it has ignored flaws in safety studies 
he said that in 1986 through 1988 when he was assigned to 
review private research on the hormone he noticed problems with 
reproduction and mastitis inflamed udders among the cows injected 
with the hormone 
although the fda has approved milk for human consumption from 
cows treated with the hormone it has not yet given its ok to 
commercial use of the drug which is manufactured by monsanto eli 
lilly upjohn and american cyanamid 
burroughs has accused the fda of toning down criticism of 
research on the hormone at the request of the chemical companies 
richard lehmann director of the division of production drugs at 
fda said studies by the drug companies had at times been rejected 
and that research was conducted into whether cows suffered from the 
problems burroughs raised 
lehmann said the hormone could delay breeding but that is 
common among cows that produce a lot of milk he said that drug 
company findings of mastitis were the result of the conditions 
under which the studies were performed 
manufacturers of the drug say the fda review has been the most 
thorough of any study of animal drugs 
but leahy said we must take extraordinary steps to guarantee 
the safety of this product 
he has written three letters to the fda saying that an 
independent scientific body should review the bovine hormone in 
order to allay public concern 
i am particularly concerned that human health issues raised by 
bovine somatotropin be evaluated thoroughly leahy said in a 
sept 7 letter the public concern already expressed about this 
product makes imperative additional review and additional 
understanding of the risks to human health and safety 
normal milk contains small amounts of bovine somatotropin 
produced naturally by the cow the fda says milk from cows given 
the genetically engineered version of the hormone contains no more 
than normal amounts and is safe to drink

communist premier hans modrow on friday 
scrapped bitterly opposed plans to form a new secret police force 
an effort to hold together his coalition government until elections 
in may 
he also promised the old security agency would be dismantled by 
june 30 and announced he would fire peter koch who was named to 
oversee the dissolution 
lawmakers cleared the way for joint ventures with western 
companies for the first time and the adn news agency said the 
financially scrapped government would close some foreign diplomatic 
missions to save money 
modrow is struggling to keep four increasingly assertive 
noncommunist parties in his coalition and head off severe 
opposition criticism 
late friday he said he could imagine giving to the opposition 
deputy ministerial posts in areas such as health or the environment 
his remarks in an interview on west germanys zdf tv network 
elaborated on a broadly worded offer thursday to bring reform 
groups into a government coalition 
but fridays announcements appeared to give modrow only a 
breathing space 
threats came of further strikes and his government partners and 
the opposition demanded proof the old state security agency is 
being dismantled and attacked a new draft election law 
as parliament convened taxi drivers honking their horns drove 
by to press demands ranging from more democracy to scrapping the 
staterun labor union 
modrow told legislators through may 6 no offices will be 
created in this area east germanys first free elections are 
scheduled may 6 
members of the 500member parliament responded with applause 
the premiers plans to create a new security agency to replace 
the hated stasi force led to a protest around parliament on 
thursday and two noncommunist parties in the coalition government 
threatened to quit 
for decades east germanys hardline leaders used the secret 
police to spy on citizens crush dissent and catch those who dared 
to step out of line 
the agency was dissolved after the fall prodemocracy movement 
that led to the ousters of hardline party leader erich honecker 
and his cronies 
modrow said some kind of internal security force was needed to 
guard against neonazis and others but opponents said decisions on 
internal security should wait until a democratically elected 
government takes over 
parliament on friday also passed a constitutional change that 
will allow joint ventures with foreign companies but officials 
later said foreign shareholding in most cases would be limited to 
49 percent 
east germany is seeking more foreign capital to help boost its 
sagging economy and adn said several diplomatic missions abroad 
would be closed to help save money 
later the government announced price increases for childrens 
clothes whose production is heavily subsidized by the state 
east germans will receive higher child support payments from the 
government to compensate for the price increases which are aimed 
at foreigners seeking bargains 
the government also wiped out state subsidies for flowers 
christmas trees and other plants the subsidies amounting to 73 
million at the official exchange rate had become symbolic of the 
countrys economic imbalances 
the country is facing a budget deficit of up to 7 billion marks 
nearly 13 billion at the official rate 
also friday legislators voted to open disciplinary proceedings 
against supreme court chief judge guenter sarge and harry harland 
the nations no 2 prosecutor they are accused of dragging their 
feet in prosecuting corruption cases against former leaders 
noncommunist partners in the coalition government in addition 
to opposition parties still are at odds with modrow over a draft 
election law that would ban campaign aid from abroad this would be 
a slap in the face to west germans eager to support the 
noncommunists 
an election law in this form is not acceptable to us said 
lothar de maiziere chairman of the christian democrats on friday 
the christian democrats and liberal democrats hold seven seats 
in the 28member cabinet 
lothar pawliczek a spokesman for the opposition social 
democrats called the draft law a scandal 
opposition sources said a massive strike was being prepared in 
gera karlmarxstadt and other southern cities if a stalemate in 
negotiations between communists and opposition continues at the 
next session monday

despite harsh mexican criticism of an nbctv 
series on the killing of us drug agent enrique camarena the 
controversy will not affect working relations between the united 
states and mexico a government spokesman said friday 
now more than ever the relationship between our nations is 
friendly particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug 
trafficking said fernando arias chief spokesman for federal 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo 
the criticism erupted following the sundaytotuesday broadcast 
of drug wars based on the 1985 murder of drug enforcement 
administration agent camarena 
the controversy reached a new pitch friday when the government 
newspaper el nacional published a frontpage story accusing 
camarena of being corrupt allegations heated denied by us 
officials 
there is not a scintilla of evidence whatsoever that enrique 
camarena was involved with the traffickers in any way other than an 
adversarial role dea spokesman frank shults said in washington 
this isnt the first time that mexican officials have tried to 
squelch controversy over the camarena case by asserting that 
camarena was corrupt said elaine shannon author of the book 
desperados on which the miniseries was based 
this is just a sort of desperate and rather pathetic effort to 
try to appease the mexican public shannon told the associated 
press in washington 
arias said he did not know anything about the report but said 
the series unfairly portrayed the mexican criminal justice system 
as corrupt from top to bottom he stressed that president carlos 
salinas de gortaris administration has made great strides against 
corruption and narcotics trafficking 
the mexican government on wednesday officially protested 
statements made on nbc news segments broadcast after the show and 
politicians and newspapers here chimed in 
comments about a possible invasion of mexico coming after the 
dec 20 invasion of panama to arrest gen manuel antonio noriega on 
drug trafficking charges drew particular anger 
mexico should not accept pressure on our sovereignty under 
the pretext of fighting drugs or under any other said sen 
porfirio munoz ledo leader of the leftwing opposition in the 
mexican senate 
lloyd siegel executive producer for special broadcasts at nbc 
news said the network took pains to see that mexicos point of 
view was represented and we do not accept the charge that there 
were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in its reporting 
us ambassador john negroponte speaking in los angeles drew a 
distinction between what happened in 1985 and the current situation 
arias in an interview noted mexican authorities have seized 
more than 36 tons of cocaine base since salinas took office 13 
months ago surpassing the total seized in the previous 10 years 
mexican law enforcement sources said out of about 1000 federal 
narcotics agents at the end of 1988 about 300 have been jailed on 
corruption narcotics and other charges 
salinas has shown a great deal of political courage 
commented shannon but she said the political and legal system 
hasnt changed and mexico remains an extremely dangerous place 
for dea agents 
in mexico opposition politicians attacked the salinas 
administration for failing to respond stiffly enough to the 
insult to mexicos integrity and sovereignty 
in what one mexican source admitted was a reply to the 
camarena series the government news agency notimex transmitted an 
unbylined story attributed to authoritative sources saying 
camarena had actually been killed because he betrayed the drug 
traffickers he was working for 
the report also appeared on the frontpage of el nacional and 
other newspapers us officials noted the rumor was an old one 
that had never been supported by evidence 
rafael caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrilla have been 
sentenced to 40 years in prison in the camarena killing twentysix 
others were also convicted and sentenced to lesser terms there is 
no parole in mexico for drugrelated offenses

a top aide to mayor marion barry allegedly 
promised to deliver a city contract to an undercover fbi agent 
posing as a private contractor if the man first contributed to 
barrys 1986 reelection effort according to court documents 
unsealed friday 
the official former city human services head david e rivers 
allegedly told an undercover fbi agent during an october 1986 
meeting that he would be awarded a contract if he contributed money 
to a barry reelection fundraising effort rivers was organizing in 
atlanta 
according to the court records rivers said yall just do 
this gesturing to invitations to the fundraiser its the 
contract done right now 
the court records were unsealed after a hearing in which a 
federal judge denied a request by rivers and prominent city 
contractor john clyburn that wiretap evidence gathered against them 
be suppressed in their trial on bribery and conspiracy charges 
the accusations against rivers and clyburn are the latest in a 
long string that have been lodged against people close to the 
mayor two deputy mayors and a dozen other officials have been 
found guilty of various financial crimes committed in office during 
barrys 11year administration 
according to the documents the fbi agent gave three separate 
500 donations to the atlanta event 
in addition the fbi agents dummy corporation gave 2000 to 
another fundraising effort after prominent contractor john clyburn 
informed the agent that contributing to and attending the event 
would be essential to making this connection with the mayor 
in return for these awards rivers promised that the undercover 
agents company would be given a contract to conduct energy audits 
at saint elizabeths hospital a cityrun mental health hospital 
rivers set the contract amount at just under 25000 the 
threshold for extensive review of proposed contracts the documents 
reveal 
the governments account of the meeting was summarized in an 
affidavit in support of a search warrant for a may 1987 search of 
rivers home that was unsealed friday 
im sure it is the mayors position that he would never have 
been aware of anything illegal and never would have condoned it 
said barry spokeswoman lurma rackley he never has condoned any 
illegal use of office 
us district judge joyce hens green ruled that the trials of 
rivers and clyburn would start on march 20 
the judge ruled they had no cause to dispute the validity of 
wiretap evidence gathered during a 17month undercover fbi probe 
into city contracting practices that ended in may 1987 
rivers and clyburn were indicted in may in connection with their 
alleged scheme to steer more than 3 million worth of city 
contracts from 1983 to 1987 to a firm headed by undercover fbi 
agents they could be sentenced to 50 years in prison 
neither would comment after fridays hearing 
rivers who left his job as secretary of the city when the probe 
was revealed was given a 79500peryear position last year 
reviewing capital projects for the citys public works department

attorneys for manuel noriega huddled with his trial 
judge friday amid rumblings that the deposed panamanian dictator 
may be moved and a federal magistrate set 1 million bail for a 
codefendant 
us district judge william hoeveler met with noriegas 
attorneys in a closeddoor session the miami herald reported 
friday that they were expected to discuss moving the former 
panamanian dictator to a more secure federal facility until his 
trial on drug trafficking charges 
miami attorney frank rubino has said he would fight efforts to 
move noriega because it would make it difficult to meet with him 
rubino said the judge has precluded him from even using the word 
transfer in his public discussions because of security concerns 
speculation has centered on federal prisons in atlanta and 
marion ill as possible destinations 
hoeveler said through his staff that he cannot discuss efforts 
to transfer noriega who is accused in a february 1988 indictment 
of using panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and 
drugprocessing chemicals and drug money headed south 
meanwhile us magistrate peter palermo agreed to 1 million 
bail for daniel miranda 36 who is charged with flying 800000 in 
laundered drug money from fort lauderdale to panama the decision 
was immediately appealed by prosecutors blocking mirandas release 
mirandas attorney michael okane arrived in court with his 
head swathed in a large white bandage after he was attacked by a 
masked man with a crowbar 
police identified okanes alleged attacker as someone hired by 
a former client a suspect was in custody but no details were 
released on the arrest 
in another development friday rubino said he and cocounsel 
steven kollin have added david lewis of new york city to the 
defense team lewis was an attorney in the pizza connection mob 
case and is considered an expert on the federal classified 
information protection act which is expected to come into play 
because of noriegas longtime cia association 
new york attorney barry slotnik who represented subway gunman 
bernhard goetz and houston attorney richard racehorse haynes 
have mentioned their possible interest in the case but slotnick 
said friday hes no longer interested in the noriega case 
rubino however told the associated press on friday that he 
mentioned their names to noriega but he told me he has not called 
them 
he told me that he is satisfied with our representation and 
whoever we get said rubino david lewis is the first weve 
added but were going to get four or six more from all over the 
country the best in their fields in their specialties

the violence of early star formation in 
new galaxies may be a major source of cosmic xrays a mysterious 
radiation that has puzzled astronomers for decades two columbia 
university scientists said friday 
astrophysicists david helfand and thomas hamilton said they have 
found seven galaxies reasonably near the earths own milky way 
galaxy that are spewing out xrays at a hotter rate than the 
socalled background xrays detectable all over the universe 
though they only found seven such galaxies the scientists said 
that further searches may reveal many more showing perhaps that 
such galaxies provide a high percentage of the cosmic xrays in the 
universe 
these galaxies are representative of a larger population at a 
greater distance that makes up or emits the bulk of the xray 
background said hamilton these that we see are only the 
nearest neighbors 
the galaxies are called neighbors said helfand because 
they are relatively nearby only a couple of billion light 
years away 
this is considered close astronomically 
a light year is the distance that light travels in space in a 
year about 6 trillion miles 
the discovery of xray emitting galaxies so close and seemingly 
undergoing star formation helfand said suggests that in the 
history of the universe star formation continued up until 
relatively recently most astronomers believe that star formation 
took place in the early part of the 15 to 20 billionyearold 
universe and then tailed off 
these galaxies may be bright xray sources because they are 
undergoing an early stage of their evolution and still forming 
massive stars said helfand they may be a key link in being 
able to study the evolution of galaxies 
xrays are thought to be generated naturally in the universe 
when interstellar gas is heated to millions of degrees such 
heating can occur during the course of star formation when vast 
amounts of matter are attracted to a core by gravitational force 
black holes bodies massive enough to create a gravitational field 
that keeps even light from escaping can also generate xrays by 
pulling material from nearby stars helfand said 
xrays cannot be detected on earth which is shielded by the 
atmosphere but satellites orbiting above the atmosphere can 
measure the radiation 
to find the xray emitters helfand and hamilton gathered data 
on 100 faint radio sources in a region of the sky about the size of 
the full moon these sources were then checked to see if they 
coincided with xray hot spots that had been discovered by 
satellites seven of the radio emitters were found to be bright in 
xrays and these later were found by optical telescopes to be very 
faint galaxies 
helfand and hamilton presented their study at the 175th national 
meeting of the american astronomical society

information about the battle

because the army had cordoned it off gomez said the official 
civilian death toll is sure to rise when rights officials and 
doctors are allowed into the zone

leftist party demanded a government commission be allowed to visit 
the area but the military still had not responded to the demand

a couple of the boys took a sawedoff shotgun and 
tried to whack butchy doe again as usual the charlestown 
districts most famous hoodlum got a couple of holes put in him 
and as usual he survived 
butchy also known as arthur l doe jr age 30 is a 
convicted bank robber police say hes a suspect in three murders 
apparently somebody is very upset with him too because theyve 
tried three times to kill him in the past year 
in may he stopped three bullets when gunmen stormed his 
girlfriends apartment in charlestown a tough mostly irish 
mostly workingclass district surrounding bunker hill his 
girlfriend was killed 
in august he was shot once in the chest outside a neighborhood 
deli at least three shots were fired but the people working in 
the store say theyve never heard of butchy doe 
just after midnight thursday butchy doe was leaving the 
horseshoe tavern getting into a cab with a girlfriend when two men 
came at him with the sawedoff shotgun 
the girl was slightly wounded by the pellets and the taxis rear 
window was shattered butchy doe was hit in his left arm and chest 
at massachusetts general hospital theyll tell you doe is 
alive but they wont say anything else and most definitely wont 
put your call through 
we dont do this in all cases not even in many a 
spokeswoman said friday but we do it in certain cases and this 
is one of them 
doe was allowed to receive calls while in the hospital last 
august and no one was the better for it an unidentified man 
called to say dont bother stitching him up because when he gets 
out were gonna shoot him again 
the locals along bunker hill street figure does luck wont hold 
out forever either doe will end up in the wrong place at the wrong 
time or his foes will develop better aim they said friday 
police say theyve got plenty on does wouldbe assassins but 
no one to testify the whole town knows whos shooting at whom but 
no one wants to say charlestowns residents have always been 
tightlipped but these days its a matter of more than a community 
code of silence its a code of fear the days when no one locked 
their doors and most of the men earned their living down at the 
navy yard are gone 
these days everyone is fair game 
this is a new generation of drugs and i resent it in a way 
but if you talk you could get killed said a woman who lives in 
one of the lopsided houses along bunker hill street they go 
knocking doortodoor 
locals talk about how doe was stabbed as a 14yearold and shot 
a year later but they dont talk about much else 
store owners dont want him in their stores said a lifelong 
townie who like just about everyone wants to remain anonymous 
but people are quiet about it they have to be because guys like 
this one are animals and theyll come looking for you 
theres a great deal of speculation on just why butchy doe is so 
unpopular 
there are different people trying to shoot him a whole 
group said boston police sgt robert thompson hes made a lot 
of enemies 
one theory is that butchy doe was involved in the may 1989 armed 
robbery of 254000 from a bank inside mass general that he drove 
away in the getaway car and refused to share the loot the robbery 
has not been solved and doe has not been charged in it 
another theory is that butchy is the target of a vendetta for a 
murder committed a decade ago 
police say theyre sure it wont be long before doe is back on 
the street the only thing more certain they said is that his 
enemies will be out there too

the search for an airplane carrying two 
us fda officials centered friday on a remote mountain in northern 
chile after a mule herder reported seeing what looked like a 
crashed aircraft police said 
but the search was suspended friday evening after a rescue plane 
flew over el toro mountain 586 miles northeast of santiago and 
found nothing police said they said they had dismissed the mule 
herders report

jampacked roads in 29 us cities cost drivers 
2425 billion in 1986 through traffic delays wasted fuel and 
higher insurance premiums according to a study by the texas 
transportation institute 
los angeles was the most congested city in the survey which did 
not look at such notoriously jammed cities as new york chicago or 
boston 
the study also concluded that congestion is getting worse 
instead of better in all but two of the cities studied 
a companion survey of business leaders in 13 of the cities found 
51 percent who said traffic affected their business and of those 
88 percent said the effect had been negative 
traffic congestion expected during the rush hour can now 
be encountered much of the day on one or more major freeways in 
almost all large urban areas said the study funded by state and 
federal highway departments 
the survey by the institute based at texas aampm university 
reviewed existing traffic data for 1982 through 1986 in seven texas 
cities and 22 outside the state 
new york chicago boston and washington were left out because 
researchers were looking for automobilebased cities comparable 
to those in texas 
mobility for almost all americans is defined by the 
automobile the study said in many cities with significant 
population growth since 1950 interstate freeway construction and 
other federal and state projects provided excellent urban mobility 
during the 1960s and 1970s 
many urban areas can attribute the rapid increase in 
population and economic development in part to the good 
transportation system provided in newer less dense cities 
it said a relative slowdown in road construction in the 1970s 
did not allow streets and freeways to keep pace with demand 
los angeles got a 142 congestion rating the rating is the 
result of a mathematical formula taking into account such things as 
miles traveled daily and available freeway and arterial miles a 
rating of 10 or higher is considered to be congested 
other cities with a rating of 10 or higher were san 
franciscooakland 124 houston 121 phoenix 118 atlanta 
115 miami 110 seattleeverett wash 109 dallas 105 
denver 101 and san diego 100 
the least congested cities were kansas city mo 06 oklahoma 
city okla and corpus christi texas 071 el paso texas 075 
and memphis tenn and salt lake city both 077 
a separate congestion cost index figured in such things as 
delays based on 820 an hour in salary plus increased fuel 
costs and higher insurance costs in the congested areas 
again los angeles topped the list costing 944 billion more 
than a third of it in higher insurance premiums next came san 
franciscooakland 269 billion houston 167 billion miami 
13 billion and dallas 111 billion 
at the bottom were corpus christi 20 million el paso 40 
million indianapolis 65 million salt lake city 70 million 
and albuquerque nm 105 million 
the study was performed in order to help planners and city 
administrators to give them some information they can use said 
researcher diane bullard its easy to talk about congestion but 
if you dont have any hard figures it is more difficult to do 
something about it 
congestion has worsened over the years ms bullard said as 
work centers have dispersed and automobile trips have become more 
than just a simple ride to work 
within the last five to 10 years we have seen increased 
suburb to suburb commuting patterns she said making it more 
difficult to alleviate congestion with mass transit in addition 
people driving to multiple destinations such as stopping by the 
bank and laundry on the way to work increase the difficulty of a 
solution 
overall congestion in the cities worsened by 12 percent from 
1982 to 1986 the researchers said led by atlanta whose index 
went from 089 to 115 a 29 percent increase 
louisville and oklahoma city were the only cities that saw 
improvements during the period

the government has appointed a new 
interim director of state television after weeks of bitter internal 
struggle the newspaper lidova demokracie reported friday 
the czechoslovak government recalled miroslav pavel from the 
position of director general of czechoslovak television and 
entrusted jindrich fairaizl with interim leadership of czechoslovak 
television it said 
it was not clear who requested pavels replacement but 
fairaizl 57 enjoys broad support from the civic forum 
czechoslovakias loosely shaped opposition group which is now in 
the coalition government with the communists 
the appointment appeared to put an end to uncertainty as to 
whether reformists wield enough influence to bring about changes at 
the top 
fairaizl lost his job at czecholsovak tv 20 years ago after the 
prague spring reforms were crushed and worked after that mostly 
under an assumed name before getting a job as a film director in 
the kratky film studios 
pavel a career journalist was expelled from the communist 
party after soviet tanks ended the shortlived reforms of alexander 
dubcek in 1968 he resurfaced as government spokesman for premier 
ladislav adamec in 1988 
adamec chose pavel to head state tv less than two months ago 
after revolutionary changes swept into power a new coalition 
government not dominated by communists but then adamec resigned as 
head of government and pavels job security appeared tenuous 
some within czechoslovak televison viewed pavel as an able 
professional unjustly forced out and others as a discredited 
communist affiliate 
his main mistake was he did not communicate with any of the 
newborn opposition groups inside television and tried to do 
everything on his own was tv editor alena pavlouskovas comment 
about pavel to the associated press 
i have a feeling at least one third of the current tv staff 
will have to go now the situation is intolerable as it is 
vit spanhel a tv writer said the situation inside 
television is that of small isolated groups expressing mistrust 
to one another

president hosni mubarak on friday fired his 
controversial interior minister who has ordered harsh crackdowns 
on islamic militants and was recently quoted as saying they should 
be killed 
interior minister zaki badr lost his job less than a month after 
surviving an apparent assassination attempt blamed on members of 
the extremist groups 
mubarak replaced him with mohammed abdelhalim moussa a career 
police officer who had been serving as a provincial governor 
badrs sharp tongue and harsh security operations drew criticism 
from the militants and from the nations opposition political 
parties 
on dec 16 a truck bomb went off in suburban cairo only seconds 
before badrs motorcade arrived at his sports club a medical 
student from assiut university was arrested at the site and about 
300 people were rounded up later 
almost 500 had been detained in assiut the week before the 
explosion after a provincewide security sweep typical of badrs 
methods 
it began during an antigovernment demonstration by religious 
militants who sought refuge in a mosque police moved in and began 
arresting the fundamentalists in the ensuing street battle 10 
policemen and 30 militants were wounded many by gunfire 
at one point last year 6000 alleged moslem militants were held 
in prison after being arrested during raids on areas considered 
militant strongholds many militant leaders used their publications 
to attack him 
mubarak last year praised the interior ministrys performance in 
fighting extremists and maintaining public order but the 
president a moderate and careful politician apparently lost 
patience after badr reportedly insulted opposition groups lawyers 
journalists and even his own cabinet colleagues last weekend 
badr was quoted as saying in a freewheeling speech at a rally 
in the nile delta town of benha that he wanted to kill all members 
of the moslem brotherhood a fundamentalist group with a national 
following of hundreds of thousands though outlawed some of its 
members serve in parliament under the umbrella of the opposition 
socialist labor party 
reports of badrs comments were published on tuesday and 
wednesday by the socialist labor partys weekly newspaper alshaab 
and the weekly alahali organ of the opposition national unionist 
progressive party 
alshaab said it had a tape recording of the speech 
the minister reportedly cited a saying by imam shafei a leading 
moslem scholar to the effect that he would not mind killing 
onethird of a nation if this ensured the security of the other 
twothirds 
i want to kill only 1 percent of egypts population badr 
was quoted as saying this would mean about half a million people 
apparently badrs estimate of fundamentalist strength 
islamic militancy has been a leading cause of domestic unrest 
since even before the country became a republic in 1952

new jersey environmental officials thursday 
asked the state attorney general to sue exxon corp for spilling 
more than a half million gallons of fuel in a waterway separating 
new york and new jersey 
the request came a day after new york gave the oil giant until 
friday evening to admit liability for cleanup and damages to the 
environment of the arthur kill between new jersey and staten 
island or face legal action 
also thursday exxon officials retreated from earlier claims 
that a faulty alarm system in its underwater pipeline was 
responsible for the magnitude of the jan 2 leak 
the new jersey lawsuit would charge exxon with violating the 
clean water control act and the new jersey spill act the dep also 
requested that attorney general peter perretti consider suing exxon 
to recover state money spent on the cleanup and for damage to the 
environment department spokesman john hagerty said 
exxon was not forthcoming or candid or timely in very basic 
questions that the dep had questions such as how much and 
how hagerty said it took them close to a week to come up 
with very basic answers to our primary questions 
new jerseys response to those answers was to ask the attorney 
general to file a lawsuit 
a spokesman for the attorney general said perretti had received 
the deps request and could make a decision friday 
exxon spokesman bill young said the company would not comment on 
the deps requested lawsuit nor on the threatened lawsuit by new 
york attorney general robert abrams 
abrams likened the waterway separating new york and new jersey 
to a minialaska referring to the exxon valdez spill of 11 
million gallons of crude oil off that states coast 
it is imperative that exxon immediately accept its liability 
not only to clean up its spill but also to fully compensate the 
state financially for the damage to new york states natural 
resources which has and will occur abrams wrote in a letter to 
exxon president lee r raymond 
if by friday evening exxon does not agree to pay for a study to 
determine the damage and to restore natural resources new york 
will file suit in federal court abrams said 
when the leak was discovered the coast guard using information 
provided by exxon estimated the spill at only 5000 gallons that 
has since been revised to 567000 gallons 
exxon officials originally blamed a faulty leakdetection alarm 
for allowing so much oil to spill saying workers did not 
investigate the alarm thoroughly because it had been issuing wrong 
signals for a year they revised that tuesday saying the device 
was oversensitive but not faulty 
on thursday exxon said the press misunderstood both 
explanations and that company attorneys advised the company not to 
comment further 
all we have to say is that workers responded to the 
leakdetection system young said were not going to say 
anything more about it

an environmental protection agency review of 
toxic industrial releases is reviving concerns that persons who 
live near scores of chemical or industrial plants may be exposed to 
high cancer risks 
the epa in providing toxic chemical release data for nearly 150 
industrial plants in 34 states cautioned it should not be 
considered a clear measure of actual cancer risk because it 
reflects a worstcase level of exposure over a lifetime 
but the findings caused the agency to pursue field checks at 
some of the plants with the highest release levels and prompted 
discussions with industry executives including some operators of 
the plants involved about voluntary cuts in toxic emissions 
according to epa officials 
the epa also indicated it is considering enforcement action 
against some of the worst polluters although no targets of such an 
action were disclosed

like an immense gravitational magnet a 
vast celestial structure nicknamed the great attractor is 
pulling powerfully at the milky way and more than 100 other 
galaxies causing a dramatic distortion in the normal expansion of 
the nearby universe 
the structure has been shown in new studies to be pulling on 
galaxies from across more than 100 million light years of space 
astronomer alan dressler said thursday at a meeting of the american 
astronomical society 
dressler with the carnegie institution of washington said he 
and sandra faber of the university of california at santa cruz have 
confirmed the influence of the great attractor by measuring the 
movements of about 400 galaxies and comparing that motion with what 
is considered normal for an expanding universe 
more than 100 galaxies were found to have a peculiar motion 
that pointed toward the center of what dressler labeled the great 
attractor

nine months after a ruling required states 
to tax federal pensions the same as other public pensions few 
retired federal pensioners have collected their back taxes but 
states fear losing millions in revenues 
an associated press survey shows that only eight of the 24 
states affected by the ruling have agreed to give federal retirees 
the same tax break on their pensions that state retirees have 
enjoyed 
the remaining 16 have yet to act or chose to give all public 
retirees a minimal exemption rather than lose revenue by exempting 
federal pensions at least 17 states are being sued over the issue 
a chain reaction of legal and fiscal snarls has grown out of the 
lawsuit brought by paul s davis a retired attorney with the

prime minister vp singh following up 
on a campaign promise is preparing to loosen state controls on 
television and radio and end what critics called blatant government 
propaganda 
since singh took office dec 2 the nightly tv news has been 
showing the prime minister only about twice a week in sharp 
contrast to the lavish daily coverage accorded his predecessor 
rajiv gandhi 
singhs government has introduced legislation in parliament to 
set up a corporation for the stateowned radio and television 
stations to be headed by a chairman immune to government 
interference the chairman would be chosen from a list of three 
prospects submitted by a group made up of top government officials 
and people involved in the arts and culture 
the television network which was expanded to reach 75 percent 
of indias 880 million people during gandhis five years in office 
has been controlled by the government since its debut in 1965 all 
india radio since its founding in 1927 has been under similar 
constraints by british colonial administrators for the first 20 
years and then by the government of independent india 
under gandhi unabashedly progovernment programming reached a 
zenith on the doordarshan tv network gandhis close aides dictated 
editorial content over hotlines to tv officials and barked orders 
to cameramen accompanying the prime minister 
gandhi had to appear every day on the screen one way or the 
other said one reporter speaking only on condition of anonymity 
out of fear the new legislation might fail if he had no public 
engagements he would be shown meeting delegations at his house 
just before the november elections another reporter said a 
proposal by gandhi to transfer more power to village levels was 
given 12 minutes on the 20minute evening news program 
take away five minutes for the headlines the signature tune 
and the weather forecast and we were left with only three minutes 
for genuine indian news he said 
such instances were the rule said george verghese a media 
expert who was instrumental in framing the new legislation for 
doordarshan which means seeing from afar in hindi 
but now with gandhis congress party in the opposition the 
rajivdarshan seeing rajiv era is over and the new government 
is briskly undoing the damage said independent magazine sunday 
it was the biggest media heist in history the countrys sole 
television network hijacked by a handful of politically motivated 
bureaucrats entire ranks of doordarshan officials turned into 
unresisting yesmen and a heavy dose of programs aimed at 
controlling the minds of millions of indians 
doordarshan started operations in new delhi in 1965 with 
blackandwhite broadcasts the network expanded to other cities in 
1972 adding to the countrys rapid progress in technology color 
broadcasts started in 1982 
media watchers have concentrated on television in demanding 
autonomy for the media because of doordarshans omnipotence its 
500 transmitters can reach about 660 million people and 55 percent 
of the land area through 21 million television sets 
most indians are too poor to buy even blackandwhite television 
sets that cost the equivalent in rupeesa of about 250 but 
governmentowned community television sets are found in almost 
every village and draw large crowds 
the broadcasting autonomy proposed by singhs national front 
government has sparked debate many have welcomed the move but the 
congress party says autonomy will be meaningless if the corporation 
continues to be funded by the government 
the proposed legislation provides for complete financial aid by 
the government to the corporation 
parvathaneni upendra the information and broadcasting minister 
has said privatization of radio and television would lead to a 
different kind of control 
we are not going to throw it to the wolves nor are we going 
to ask it to fend for itself sunday magazine quoted him as 
saying in an interview if we do that big business or big 
industry will try to capture it we cannot allow that 
the bill is likely to become law by next jan 1 as an interim 
measure the government plans to set up a fivemember board to 
oversee the functioning of the two networks 
but even now we are not going allout in attacking the ruling 
politicians one of the doordarshan reporters said we will 
sniff before every step until autonomy is actually achieved

the news trickled down into the dim underground 
vaults and arcades where fans of beauty and the beast kept 
alive the darkly atmospheric cbs romanceadventure series finally 
the show had been canceled 
i think everybody is relieved we dont have to worry about 
cbs any more said stephanie wiltse publisher of pipeline a 
definitive newsletter on the realworld workings of beauty and 
the beast 
this is not to say that fans who call themselves beasties 
and beastfriends or just supporters of beauty and the 
beast will let the series die 
no when word leaked early this month that cbs had canceled the 
show fandom began to deluge fox broadcasting co with calls asking 
it to pick up the show 
now that cbs has canceled bampb outright and made it painfully 
clear that they want nothing more to do with it the fans are 
saying ok everybody write to fox said kimberly hartman 
ms hartman founded of helpers network a information 
clearinghouse on the show for the roughly 50 fan clubs and 100 fan 
periodicals that have sprung up in north america and europe since 
bampb made its debut in 1987 
foxs response ms hartman said was that we dont have any 
specific plans right now but the door is open 
in a prepared statement last week fox was not quite that 
optimistic referring to rumors it and the shows producers had 
been discussing a pickup of the series fox said this 
we dont know how the rumors got started thereve been no 
discussions between the two parties and at this point there is no 
plan for fox to pick up the show 
there also was speculation that cables usa network might pick 
up the series and keep it going but usa hasnt had any 
discussions about that with the producers says usa spokeswoman 
mary lou ocallaghan 
and she says with the show costing 1 million an episode 
its not very likely that the usa network would want to keep it 
in production 
beauty and the beast began as a love story between 
catherine a new york city prosecutor and vincent a literary 
leonine halfman who inhabits the citys subterranean world with a 
likeminded community of outcasts 
critics applauded the shows themes of responsibility and human 
kindness as well as its artistic and production values but they 
also noted that a shakespearequoting manbeast might not be 
everyones cup of tea 
low ratings plagued the witt thomas production from the start 
despite its winning five emmy awards in two years it couldnt find 
a mass audience but it fired the imaginations of people who 
previously had no use for mainstream tv 
i think in the very beginning we looked at it and thought 
this is too beautiful to survive ms hartman said 
fans were more than just enthusiastic they were intensely 
emotionally bound to the series something unseen in tv since 
star trek fans took a moribund science fiction series that 
ended in september 1969 and created a pop artifact that has spawned 
five feature films and yet another series 
its a very archetypal show ms hartman said noting that 
the basic theme of the show is a few thousand years old even when 
catherine was killed off and the romance theme was subordinated to 
crimebusting action fans still loved the shows writing music 
acting and willingness to tackle tough issues 
ms wiltse an albany ny graphic designer whos seen her 
life and livelihood gradually become a 1550subscriber newsletter 
and fulltime work on beauty and the beast projects agrees 
about the shows appeal 
people can watch bampb and see themselves reflected in it 
she said 
its stories about grief loneliness and loss tend to touch 
people intimately she said they take it very personally and 
they take that feeling out into the world 
that feeling also has inspired many fan clubs to get 
involved with local charities especially those for the homeless 
the abused and the outcast right now though beastfriends want 
their show to survive said debi tolleson president of 
jacksonville fla supporters of beauty and the beast 
weve started writing telegrams and letters and phone calls to 
the folks at fox she said the general feeling is that because 
fox is innovative and more apt to listen to their viewers than 
be strictly under control by the nielsens that we might do better 
there she said 
we even want a feature film one of these days 
ms wiltse allows herself to hope for a happy ending when 
interviewed recently she said shed been taking calls for two days 
and two nights from concerned fans these people arent going to 
let this thing die one way or another it will be with them

the annual corporate misgivers list is being 
readied for publication and as expected it will show that 
american companies have a tendency to support their ideological 
opponents 
each company on the list says the capital research center 
has been singled out for outstanding contributions to 
antibusiness lobbying and advocacy groups 
in the past however such corporate giving has been defended as 
being in the spirit of democracy and that no better commitment to 
it could be made than to support pluralistic opinions the better 
to clarify issues 
the list includes some of the big names in industry beginning 
with primerica corp of greenwich conn followed by dayton 
hudson corp and general mills inc of minneapolis and new 
yorkbased american express co and mobil oil corp 
primerica was assigned a 29 ranking the worst for any 
company based on a scale of one to nine the lowest reading a 
one is said to be radical left a five supposedly is center 
and a nine is radical right 
cited among primericas donations was one to the nowlegal 
defense and education fund an organization the center states has

first she said not enough thought is given to the matter by chief 
executives secondly corporate directors appear not to be involved 
in the giving process 
she cited shortterm or shortsighted thinking as another 
reason while conceding that some donations might be made in an 
effort to seek cooperation from the recipient 
finally she said a selfselection process is at work in 
the corporate areas responsible for financial grants asked to 
explain she said those who tend to seek such jobs are inclined 
toward personal rankings lower than 5

quakerelated calls to suicide hotlines have dropped to a 
fraction after three months but unsettling reminders of the 
earths fury remain a shopping mall in a seaside town resembles an 
abandoned movie set hundreds of people are still homeless and 
major sections of freeways are still closed or detoured 
aftershocks have subsided since the earthquake of 71 magnitude 
shook northern california on oct 17 but the recovery efforts 
expected to take years are apparent as hammering and the hum of 
heavy construction equipment fill the air from san francisco and 
downtown oakland to watsonville 
the 15second temblor injured 2500 people killed 67 and left 
10000 homeless 7 billion damage made it the nations costliest 
quake ever almost 70000 claims have been filed with the federal 
emergency management agency in the san francisco bay area for 
temporary housing help home and business loans grants and other 
aid the american red cross says 14000 families probably will have 
received temporary shelter clothes blankets food and other help 
the eyes of sports fans across the country were on candlestick 
park and a world series game between the san francisco giants and 
the oakland as when the quake hit the ballpark was in the 
limelight again this weekend as the 49ers played the los angeles 
rams in hopes of a super bowl berth 
life is not as anxious as it was for anyone but it isnt the 
same for anyone itll never be the same again said eve 
meyer executive director of the san francisco suicide prevention 
hotline which saw quakerelated calls drop from a peak of about 
200 a day to the current average two a day 
they say in about six months itll be back to normal and 
everyone will forget all about it said erik carlson of mahopac 
ny the quake damaged his spine and left him paralyzed from the 
waist down in the wreckage of the collapsed cypress section of the 
nimitz freeway in oakland 
how could i look at what it did to my body he said 
and while watsonvilles fox theater marquee wishes passersby 
happy new year in english and spanish that prospect remains 
dubious for many of the estimated 1000 people left homeless in the 
agricultural community 70 miles south of san francisco 
maria alvarez and her husband slept in a parking lot with their 
five children and several other families for four nights after the 
quake now they have a trailer supplied by the federal government 
for 18 months but after that she doesnt know if they can afford 
to rent a new home 
ive been living here for about 30 years now to move 
somewhere else i wouldnt feel right to start again its hard to 
do alvarez said standing in the 40trailer crestview camp one 
of a halfdozen in the watsonville area 
at least theyre secure now said mayor todd mc farren 
but they have a lot of fears about whats going to happen in 18 
months and i dont have an answer for them 
mc farren expressed concern for the future of the city that 
sustained 60 million in damage and lost 400000 in sales tax and 
200000 in property tax a lot of workers have left town and the 
canneries are concerned they wont come back in the spring the 
words out theres no place left to live 
the once quaint and tranquil pacific garden mall is the focal 
point for damage in neighboring santa cruz 60 miles from san 
francisco near the quakes loma prieta epicenter today it 
resembles an abandoned movie set or a ghost town most of the 
buildings with broken windows chipped walls and tilted frames 
are fenced off others have been demolished leaving huge holes 
around the malls fringe are vinyl pods where 45 businesses 
have set up temporary shop for what may be a twoyear stay one 
shop displayed leftover holiday tshirts proclaiming yes 
virginia there is a santa cruz 
in san franciscos marina district near the golden gate bridge 
for rent signs some vouching for the safety of the premises 
fill apartment windows and vacant lots abound where buildings were 
torn down the embarcadero freeway once a key entrance to the 
waterfront and chinatown is closed its future is uncertain as 
officials debate environmental economic and public safety 
implications of its repair 
a survey by the san francisco economic development corp shows 
the citys 34 billion tourism industry has been hard hit the 
number of spouses coming with conventioneers and the number of 
leisure travelers who account for half of all visitors from 
outside the region is down a third from a year ago 
its been hard to convince outsiders the city is safe that 
this isnt soviet armenia said san francisco visitors and 
convention bureau spokeswoman sharon rooney weve proven we can 
rebound from that the cable cars were running within 48 hours 
after the earthquake 
were a city probably better prepared than any other city for 
an earthquake 
across the bay in oakland where the cypress section of the 
nimitz freeway crumpled like a paper fan and killed 42 people all 
but a small portion of the roadway has been demolished a 1mile 
swath like a glaring scar divides the heavily damaged downtown 
and a neighborhood ravaged by drugrelated violence 
city hall has been vacated as authorities consider spending an 
estimated 40 million to 50 million for repairs and a major 
department store long vital to a struggling economy faces 8 
million to 10 million in renovation bills 
in addition alameda county needs 20 million to keep homeless 
shelters open and up to 100 million to repair residential hotels 
closed by the quake said county supervisors chairman don perata 
erik carlson for one will never be convinced of the regions 
safety i would come back but i wouldnt stay long he said 
shortly before leaving to return to new york live in california 
out completely no way

you know the voice of the grownup kevin 
arnold on abcs the wonder years but you probably dont know 
the man behind the voice is actordirector daniel stern 
stern gets no regular screen credit for the narration and when 
he auditioned he was known only as no 6 his name does appear 
when he directs an episode of the hit comedy that focuses on kevin 
as a 13yearold in the 1960s hes directed seven so far 
id never done voiceover before so ive had to learn as i went 
along said stern i like my part theres a lot of emotions 
and conflict to be acted out i think its good that the narrator 
is an adult it wouldnt be as effective if the narrator was 
kevins age its a good device that helps pull the stories 
together 
stern provides the ironic footnotes for the wonder years 
which won an emmy as best comedy series in 1988 after its premiere 
that january fred savage stars as 13yearold kevin 
the show wouldnt be nearly as funny nor as poignant without 
the acerbic comments from stern 
hes never appeared in the show i almost did once he said 
but i dont want to do that i dont want to goof around with it 
the show means something to a lot of people you dont want it to 
be too in or too jokey 
only once has his name been listed as narrator that came when 
he directed his first episode called pottery will get you 
nowhere it was about a year ago in the second season 
i did it for my mother he said i think it works out 
better not to have my name listed 
his brother david stern was the original story consultant for 
the wonder years but has since left 
at the time i was auditioning for the show i got my brother a 
job as a production assistant on born in east la he said 
i played a great sleazy character i showed david a copy of the 
pilot script and he wrote a script on speculation they hired him 
as a staff writer 
stern has played sleazy characters in other movie roles in 
leviathan he was a diver and crew member whose morals were 
also at the bottom of the ocean despite the numerous underwater 
sequences he said he never got his feet wet instead of water 
they made their way through smoke tinted by colored lights to look 
like water special air vents on their boots blew sand on the floor 
so that it appeared to be washed about 
stern mostly acts in feature motion pictures such as diner 
hannah and her sisters blue thunder the milagro 
beanfield war and onetrick pony his only television series 
was hometown on cbs five years ago 
hed hoped to reprise his character of shrevie from diner 
for barry levinsons latest movie avalon but the oneday role 
had to be filmed on thanksgiving day on location in baltimore 
stern had 10 relatives coming for thanksgiving dinner and had to 
turn it down 
when i was hired to narrate i said id like to direct he 
said i went to the set and met everyone i observed steve miner 
direct the pilot he sort of invented the style and directed a lot 
of the shows the first season 
i feel comfortable directing ive been in about 30 movies and 
the last 15 ive kept my eyes open to the process as opposed to 
just sitting in my trailer when i wasnt needed i took a role in 
my blue heaven just to watch herbert ross work i did that with 
sidney lumet and daniel and woody allen and hannah and her 
sisters and stardust memories 
his newest movie is coupe de ville due in march about 
three brothers who take an old car across country 
they sort of get to know each other on the trip stern said 
i was in that car forever i do all the driving 
stern lived for 12 years in new york before moving to los 
angeles he and his wife have three children

sporadic breaks are occurring in the longtime church positions 
against ordaining acknowledged active homosexuals theyre gaining 
their first footholds in the historic christian ministry 
its happening in isolated instances despite denominational 
policies and protests 
in the past there have been ordinations of some who affirm only 
homosexual orientation but the new cases involve not just that 
orientation but latitude to practice it 
its a historic breakthrough a new step said the rev john 
frykman pastor of first united lutheran church in san francisco 
concerning three scheduled lutheran ordinations there next week 
in another case episcopal bishop john spong of newark nj 
said his ordination last month of a gay man with an acknowleged 
male mate was a step into honesty and integrity for the church 
never before the record indicates had anyone professedly in a 
homosexual relationship been ordained into the mainline christian 
ministry although some already ordained have later told of 
homosexual partners 
studies indicate there are many closet homosexual ministers 
some sexually active in the historic churches protestant and 
roman catholic also ordination of those acknowledging only 
homosexual orientation is frequent 
but major denominations have drawn the line against ordaining 
ostensibly active homosexuals that is the barrier challenged in 
the lutheran ordinations in san francisco next saturday jan 20 
two congregations of the 53millionmember evangelical lutheran 
church in america are ordaining an openly committed lesbian couple 
and a male homosexual who declines to vow abstinence from 
homosexual activity 
it means fuller acceptance of them said the rev james 
delange pastor of st francis lutheran church in san francisco 
where the three will be a pastoral team leading a new ministry to 
lesbians and gays 
were saying that homosexuals are to be welcomed into the 
church in the fullest sense of the word that their relationships 
are to be honored and respected delange added 
delange 55 said gays make up about half his centrally located 
congregration where the lesbian couple ruth frost and phyllis 
zillhart of minneapolis and gay man jeff johnson of san 
francisco will serve 
johnsons ordination however was authorized by the first 
united lutheran congregation in the citys western part pastor 
frkyman 58 said it has no known gay members but supports more 
acceptance of them 
both congregations risk penalties ranging from censure to 
expulsion from it the denomination for defying church law 
frykman a pastor for 30 years said it wouldnt be the 
easiest thing to be driven out of the church ive given my life 
for the church but in this situation the church hierarchy is 
acting against gospel principle 
synod bishop lyle miller foresaw calling a disciplinary 
committee about the matter denominational policy like that of 
most major protestant bodies bars ordination of acknowledged 
active homosexuals 
however some denominations have no explicit national rule 
about it notably the united church of christ which leaves it up 
to regional units theyve ordained 10 acknowledged homosexuals 
since 1980 
regarding their behavior patterns that information was 
neither asked nor given says denominational news officer evan 
golder 
this also was the case when that church stemming from early 
american pilgrims ordained this countrys first publicly 
identified homosexual minister the rev william r johnson of san 
carlos calif in 1972 
many church people feel sexual orientation is not a moral 
issue golder said but that sex behavior is of moral 
significance 
when complaints were lodged in 1986 against a united methodist 
acknowledged homosexual the rev julian rush of denver he simply 
refused to answer questions about sexual activity thus not overtly 
outside church rules 
the behavioral factor also was not specified in 1977 when new 
yorks then episcopal bishop paul moore ordained the rev ellen 
barrett an acknowledged lesbian into the episcopal priesthood 
but it was specified in the episcopal ordination last dec 16 of 
the rev j robert williams to direct oasis a hoboken nj 
ministry to homosexuals his male mate read the litany as picketers 
protested 
that 3millionmember denomination like the lutheran body and 
other major denominations the united methodist church and 
presbyterian church usa have policies against ordaining 
acknowledged active homosexuals 
those denominations are pursuing extensive sexualty studies 
episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning said he hopes the 
williams ordination will encourage positive debate rather than 
polarization 
while ordaining professedly active homosexuals oversteps 
mainline church policies it now is formally accepted in the 
unitarian universalist association which doesnt identify itself 
as christian 
that 173000member liberal body ordained its first 
acknowledged homosexual in 1979 and now has about 50 of them among 
950 clergy says the rev scott alexander of boston its director 
of gaylesbian concerns 
many live with partners he said its part of human 
wholeness 
such arrangements also are fully accepted in another relatively 
small group the metropolitan community churches organized 
particularly for homosexuals in 1968 now with about 34000 members

leaders of 10 protestant denominations urge an 
end to polarization and sloganeering about abortion terming it a 
complex moral issue that cant be reduced to simple rights and 
wrongs pros and cons 
in a joint statement initiated by episcopal presiding bishop 
edmond l browning the church leaders said discussion of abortion 
should encourage sensitive listening to those on all sides of 
the issue 
we as religious leaders have the insights to offer from our 
various faith traditions about both the sacredness of life and the 
importance of informed personal conscience that have come out of 
years of prayer study and debate they said 
although the signers hold differing views of abortion they said 
they were united in a deep and abiding reverence for both the 
mystery of human life and the freedom of human conscience 
grounded in the nurture of churches

is it possible for a tv series to be too clever 
for its own good 
thats the question some british critics have been asking about 
frederic raphaels after the war the 10hour miniseries from 
granada tv that began jan 7 on pbs in the united states 
the 15 million show spans the years 194267 in the life of 
michael jordan an english jew first glimpsed at boarding school at 
the age of 12 during world war ii 
he goes on to work as a journalist playwright and documentary 
filmmaker all the while struggling to define his place in society 
as an artist a briton and a jew 
thirtytwoyearold english newcomer adrian lukis plays the 
wellbred wellheeled michael and clare higgins is his older 
sister rachel 
robert reynolds portrays michaels longtime friend joe hirsch 
a refugee from nazi germany anton rodgers denis quilley and 
susannah york head the supporting cast 
the series examines attitudes towards life love and politics in 
the quarter century following world war ii but many british 
observers thought the shows content secondary to form a 
ceaseless supply of swift sharp witticisms that exhilarated some 
and left others cold 
christopher dunkley in the financial times called the show 
entertaining engrossing often witty and lauded its huge 
cast of wonderful actors and actresses 
but thomas sutcliffe in the independent lamented the 
selfconsciously heightened quality of the writing much has 
been written about raphaels torrent of oneliners but not enough 
to prepare you for the real thing 
the 58yearold raphael explained his intentions in a telephone 
interview from his home in southwest france 
i like to be entertaining he said i like people to speak 
with clarity and elegance and wit if possible but constantly at 
the service of reminding people of what is dark 
id like to think not everybody in the show is witty in the 
same way said raphael whose sixpart 1976 series glittering 
prizes won acclaim in britain and the united states 
the point is that this series and the novel that goes with 
it are fiction and fictions are not extracted from life he 
said 
if people want to hear dialogue as it is actually spoken they 
could take down our conversations and after a very short while 
they would fall asleep i want them to wake up 
raphael said criticisms that his characters could be obnoxious 
missed the point about them 
i daresay michaels not very likable he said but i 
distrust books and films in which people wink at the reader 
raphael admired lukis for refusing to make michael a cutie 
he never tried to make him charming or smile away his 
surliness he said 
born in chicago raphael left the united states when he was 7 
years old he attended cambridge university and wrote three 
important films of the 1960s two for the road 1966 with 
audrey hepburn and albert finney far from the madding crowd 
1967 and darling 1965 both with julie christie he won an 
academy award for darling which also garnered an oscar for 
christie and he was nominated for the prize with two for the 
road 
and despite these three decidedly british vehicles he said the 
british misunderstand his sense of humor 
im actually quite american raphael said in impeccably 
accented british english thats part of the reason my dialogue 
is like it is they critics all think its a tribute to english 
wit but its very much to do with a new york way of speaking 
raphael considered after the war to be more like film than 
routine television he said it captures the essence of film 
writing and filmmaking in the way of both collapsing time and 
extending it we cover virtually a quarter of a century 
nevertheless we do not hurry we do not summarize 
after the war was made by the same company that backed 
brideshead revisited and the jewel in the crown two other 
elegantly produced literate sagas of the 1980s

wall street isnt making things easy this year 
for investors who want to take a cue from the stock markets 
performance in early january 
since new years the market has zigzagged through a pattern of 
almost daily course changes frustrating wouldbe bulls and bears 
alike 
in so doing it has clouded the picture for anyone trying to 
make sense of such traditional phenomena as the january barometer 
the january effect and the january early warning system 
the january barometer popularized by investment adviser yale 
hirsch holds that the trend of stock prices in the first month 
sets the tone for the rest of the year 
its final verdict wont be in for a while yet to date however 
it seems to have signaled only that stocks will fluctuate as 
1990 passes 
for those who cant bring themselves to sit on their hands until 
jan 31 hirsch also has published studies on a supposed 
earlywarning barometer that covers just the first five sessions of 
the year 
over that span this month the dow jones average of 30 
industrials gained 4117 points or 15 percent but that advance 
was more than wiped out in the next two trading days 
this erratic behavior also has confounded many followers of the 
socalled january effect a historical tendency toward 
betterthannormal performance in the first few weeks of the year 
for the market in general and small stocks in particular 
some observers think the january effect with all the widespread 
attention it gets these days has fallen victim to its own press 
clippings 
hirschs monthly letter smart money has itself been urging 
subscribers not to try to play it this time around on the 
rationale that if everyone knows about it it isnt worth 
knowing 
a good many analysts also arent professing much dismay over the 
absence of any decisive forecast so far from the traditional 
january indicators 
the earlywarning system in particular they say has been 
consistently inconsistent in its readings over the last few years 
in 1989 according to calculations by william lefevre at advest 
inc the dow average rose 142 percent over the first five 
sessions correctly portending an up year but the average was down 
142 percent in the first week of 1988 which also wound up a 
winner 
in 1987 it rose 561 percent in the first week by yearend the 
averages net gain had shrunk to 226 percent rendering the 
accurate forecast useless for any practical purpose 
the statistical evidence gives stronger support to the january 
effect which has been attributed to such influences as the 
endofdecember tax selling when new years arrives 
according to joanne hill and john kilgannon analysts at 
painewebber inc january has indeed been the best month of the 
year for total return dividends plus capital gains in the stock 
market in the 80s and over the past 22 years 
in the 22year span however it produced positive results only 
55 percent of the time so even with its historical edge hill and 
kilgannon concluded owning stocks in january is far from a sure 
thing

her head lolled sideways like that of a rag doll 
dark hair dangling over a contorted bloodied face an emergency 
breathing tube useless as it turned out protruded from her mouth 
who would not believe the anguished story of carol stuarts 
husband who sat next to his pregnant wife his shoulder cushioning 
her head his bloodsplattered shirt torn wide to expose the bullet 
hole in his belly 
chuck stuart teeth gritted with pain had barely been able to 
summon help on his car phone my wifes been shot ive been 
shot oh man it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling shes 
stopped breathing 
even carol stuarts family never doubted his story that a black 
gunman with a raspy voice had commandeered their car as they left a 
hospital birthing class then robbed and shot them 
never never said her brother carl dimaiti he seemed so 
believable there he was lying in a hospital with tubes and 
intravenous and thered never been any problem that anyone could 
see between him and carol so why would anyone doubt him 
now 10 days after stuarts terrible hoax was exposed with his 
suicide leap off a bridge authorities are sorting rumors and 
evidence both focusing on insurance money looking for a motive in 
carol stuarts murder and any partners in the plot 
one of the most fascinating and repellent aspects of the 
stuart case is the family involvement two of chucks younger 
brothers who stood at carols wake and carried her casket had 
suspected for 2 months their sisterinlaw had been the victim of 
a murder plot a third brother two halfsisters and their parents 
learned of the crime in the days just before chucks suicide 
in the first week of the new year matthew stuart 23 told his 
attorney hed suspected chuck had killed his wife ever since the 
oct 23 murder although matthew said he was not involved in the 
shooting 
on friday richard clayman attorney for michael stuart 27 
disclosed to reporters that matthew told michael about his 
suspicions on oct 26 
in addition clayman said chuck and michael had a disjointed 
vague conversation some weeks before the murder and michael told 
chuck i dont know exactly what youre talking about but im 
not getting involved with anything any sort of crazy thing youre 
talking about 
under massachusetts law no one can be charged with a crime for 
failing to report what they suspect but all over boston people are 
saying that matthew and michael had a moral obligation to come 
forward 
if they did know and they sat with us and cried then it is 
the ultimate hypocrisy said carl dimaiti 
details of the plot kept tumbling out last week stuart was the 
beneficiary of at least two insurance policies on his wife totaling 
182000 and authorities were said to be checking reports of at 
least one other policy worth more than twice that amount reports 
said stuart needed the money to realize a dream of starting his own 
restaurant but felt his wife and baby would be a hindrance 
a nickelplated 38caliber revolver pulled tuesday from the 
pines river in suburban revere where chuck stuart grew up appears 
to be the one stolen from the fur store he managed chuck and carol 
stuart were shot with a 38caliber gun although it has not been 
determined if the gun from the river was the weapon that shot 
either of them she was 30 when she died he turned 30 two weeks 
before his suicide 
a grand jury convened friday to investigate the evidence and 
rumors still flying around boston 
carl dimaiti has heard them all that some neighbors suspected 
chuck from the beginning that he stayed out on friday nights 
because he was having an affair that the couple was heard arguing 
loudly 
i would like one of them to come up to me and say that i 
would say oh really do you think you knew her better or you saw 
her more than her parents and her very close friends 
i hear she was upset because he went out on a friday night i

were outraged by the images of a woman in her death throes a woman 
expecting her first child at christmastime 
i was shocked out of my mind said rosemary leone an aunt 
i prayed that she didnt suffer 
but a tragedy that might have been treated as a routine urban 
crime story took on another dimension because of a dramatic 
taperecorded 10minute exchange between the wounded stuart and 
state police dispatcher gary mclaughlin who pleaded with stuart to 
hang on until patrol cars could find him 
you cant blank out on me i need you man chuck chuck 
chuck can you hear me chuck chuck pick up the phone i can 
hear you breathing there chuck come on buddy 
the drama which tore at hearts around the world and brought 
torrents of sympathy cards from as far away as italy remained 
riveting for weeks stuart wrote a poignant letter that was read at 
his wifes funeral i will never again know the feeling of your 
hand in mine but i will always feel you it read in part i 
miss you and i love you 
he asked forgiveness for her killer for us to truly believe 
we must know that gods will was done and that there was some 
right in this meanest of acts in our souls we must forgive this 
sinner because he would too

nobody talks 
in this tough workingclass city family and friends come first 
its a matter of honor to guard secrets so while family and 
friends of charles stuart knew the awful truth or had their 
suspicions no one talked at least not to outsiders 
not the brother who hid evidence including the alleged murder 
weapon not the friend stuart reportedly asked about arranging his 
wifes death not the others in stuarts hometown who gossiped for 
weeks adding to the buzz on the street that chuckie did it 
the police heard the buzz but couldnt crack the silence 
reporters who count on the human tendency to blab couldnt pry 
out the truth about charles stuarts life and carol dimaiti 
stuarts death 
its a very difficult situation to turn a relative in or a 
neighbor said a dimaiti family neighbor i would say do you 
know that i know what you did i wouldnt turn them in i would 
tell them that 
those who knew the secret kept it for 71 days from the night of 
oct 23 when carol stuart a lawyer seven months pregnant was 
shot in the back of the head until shortly before the chilly dawn 
of jan 4 when her husband leaped to his death from a bridge over 
the mystic river 
few doubted stuarts story that a mugger had shot him and his 
wife after they left a childbirth class at bostons brigham and 
womens hospital his corroboration was a near fatal bullet in his 
gut 
but stuarts terrible secret eventually unraveled 
matthew stuart went to police jan 3 telling detectives his big 
brother had him dispose of a gun and carol stuarts belongings 
charles stuart who knew of his brothers discussions with 
police threw himself off the bridge trying to take with him 
details of a plot to kill his wife perhaps for insurance money to 
start a restaurant 
but the secret wasnt just matts and chucks 
other family members knew chuck apparently approached another 
brother michael weeks before the murder but michael spurned a 
proposal made in a disjointed vague conversation according to 
family attorney richard clayman on oct 26 matthew shared with 
michael what had happened with chuck three days before 
and on jan 2 a firehouse recording system taped a telephone 
conversation between michael a firefighter and a halfsister 
shelley yandoli they decided to tell their parents that chuck was 
involved but not to say that they feared he had killed carol 
police quizzed a stuart friend about a conversation hed had 
with chuck a few months ago about taking care of carol but 
they said he refused to confirm the story until stuarts suicide 
and there was matthews friend who reportedly threw the gun into a 
revere river he too kept silent 
yet the secrets smoldering ember created a smoke of gossip that 
drifted through this city and others circling boston 
i heard maybe two weeks after it oh he killed her he 
killed her but it was brushed off said dede zorzy a waitress 
at snack time restaurant 
the rumors reached reporters in middecember a rumor that a 
radio station had reported stuart a suspect prompted a flood of 
calls to boston police who called the rumor absurd but in revere 
it persisted 
that was the talk in my beauty parlor weeks ago that he did 
it for the insurance money said one woman on her way out of a 
convenience store with a gallon of milk i said come on but 
the girls said it was true that they heard it 
like many people encountered in the area she wouldnt give her 
name 
revere has a long history of keeping secrets said the 
manager of a local shop the man a midwesterner who settled here 
more than 40 years ago still feels the outsider 
now a week and a half after the truth ricocheted around the 
nation people are more tightlipped than ever 
from the bars to the beauty parlors outoftown inquisitors 
meet opaque denials no comment they mostly say with a 
knowing lift of the eyebrow or an icy smile as they escort callers 
to the door 
children grow up in this city of 50000 learning that its best 
to keep what you know to yourself said jon cinelli who works in a 
video store 
this is a rough city a tough city cinelli said keeping 
your mouth shut he said thats the way to survive 
the bars have gotten so that the guys are playing 
ignorant said bobby a 31yearold revere native its more 
for the stuart family theyve been through enough 
this protectiveness helps explain why the horrible secret was 
kept so long the bluecollar communities north of boston are 
places where people marry high school sweethearts and never really 
leave a neighbor might well be a family member pretty soon 
everyone gets the same protection 
carol stuart came from that kind of place growing up in 
medford 10 miles to the northwest a neighbor said that in that 
tightknit community a person is judged by their trustworthiness 
we are all protective he said and if i knew my neighbor 
well i would do anything to help them

both the commercial and residential real estate 
markets will remain in the dumps in early part of this decade two 
economists told mortgage bankers 
home construction will be affected not only by the turmoil on 
the savings and loan industry but also by dramatic demographic 
changes as the baby boom generation ages into its prime homeowning 
years said lynn o michaelis chief economist at weyerhaeuser co 
michaelis said thursday that the baby boom generation is not 
experiencing the real income growth of the previous group of 
homeowners a decade earlier 
he predicted housing starts would drift to 126 million 
singleand multifamily units this year down from about 15 
million units built in 1988 but could rise to 131 million in 1991 
michaelis who spoke at the fifth annual economic outlook 
conference sponsored by the mortgage bankers association of 
america said the problem was more complex than simply slowing 
sales 
there is a dramatic shift in who is originating mortgages 
he said the upheaval in the savings and loan industry which had 
been the major originator of adjustable rate mortgages that made 
homebuying affordable for many will make purchasing a home a more 
difficult exercise 
rates and qualifying rules are getting tougher michaelis 
said as commercial banks eat into the mortgage turf that once 
belonged to the savings and loans in addition because single 
family homes are appreciating at roughly 36 percent a year 
potential buyers simply do not see their house as a great 
investment 
home sales suggest the industry is stable but it does not 
lead me to a bullish view that more than one million 
singlefamily homes will be built this year michaelis said 
on the commercial front prospects were considered gloomier 
although commercial construction has been in a steady decline since 
its 1985 peak there continues to be a big surplus of offices 
shopping centers apartments and hotels said george christie vice 
president and chief economist of mcgrawhill construction 
information group 
by the end of 1987 the surplus of aggregate commercial space 
was about 800 million square feet christie said of that 50 
percent represents office space 40 percent represents condominiums 
and apartments and 10 percent is in retail space and hotels 
despite the oversupply contracting for the building of even 
more commercial space had been running at just under 1 billion 
square feet a year even though demand was deteriorating 
the only implication is that more underbuilding is the 
prescription christie said were only beginning the process 
of cleaning up the excesses of the 1980s 
he predicted the industry would reach relative supplydemand 
equilibrium sometime between 1993 and 1994 if building continues to 
slow 
the good news is that the construction of public works which 
had been put on the back burner during the 1980s out of sheer 
necessity will see some reordering of priorities christie said 
he cited schools and healthcare facilities as likely areas of 
construction

directors of campeau corp have removed control 
of the companys us retailing operations from the parent company 
ending founder robert campeaus direction of the department stores 
in apparent bid to appease creditors 
in a statement issued thursday night from its toronto 
headquarters the company said it was transferring majority control 
of the us retailers federated department stores inc allied 
stores corp and ralphs grocery co to a voting trust that 
eventually will appoint a separate board of directors for those 
businesses 
until the trustees are appointed the retailers daily 
operations and restructuring will be managed by campeaus six 
independent directors the company said 
robert campeau who led the company on an expansion strategy 
that analysts say caused its downfall stated he would be involved 
only in the management and development of the companys real estate 
the boards moves appeared to be further steps to assure 
creditors of federated and allied that the companies could work out 
their financial woes 
carol sanger a spokeswoman for campeau at the retailers 
cincinnati headquarters said she could not comment on why the 
board took its actions she also said she did not know whether 
robert campeau voluntarily removed himself from management of the 
us retailing divisions or had been asked to do so by the board 
there has been wide speculation in the retail trade that campeau 
might place federated and allied under bankruptcy court protection 
from creditors the divisions have been struggling to pay their 
bills under the weight of huge debts 
but on wednesday campeau said it was sending some 100 million 
in payments on schedule to numerous merchandise suppliers 
signaling its interest in maintaining good relations with 
manufacturers that do business with its nearly 260 us department 
stores 
also on wednesday the restructuring committee of the campeau 
board announced the appointment of a new chief financial officer to 
take charge of rebuilding campeaus us holdings which in 
addition to the retailing businesses include shopping malls and 
other commercial real estate 
campeaus financial problems were caused chiefly by the heavy 
debt it incurred when it bought federated in 1988 for 66 billion 
and allied two years earlier for 34 billion in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission this week campeau indicated the 
combined debts for federated and allied totaled about 8 billion 
that filing indicated that even if all the assets of the retail 
divisions were sold in a liquidation the debt may not be covered 
the canadian property company olympia amp york developments ltd 
provided a 250 million cash infusion last year to enable the 
company to meet its debt payments and campeau agreed to restructure 
its operations and attempt to reorganize its finances 
however problems have continued citibank and other members of 
a group owed 234 billion by allied and federated have indicated 
they believed the companies were in default on the loan and gave 
them until monday to give assurance that was not the case 
last week national bank of canada acquired a 29 percent stake 
in campeau after robert campeau defaulted on a bank loan to two of 
his private investment companies 
in its statement on thursday campeau corp said its board 
approved resolutions placing the responsibility for the management 
and financial restructuring of federated and allied with the 
yettobeappointed board of campeau us and a chief executive 
to be named by that board 
the new york times reported in todays editions that campeau 
approached the president and chief executive of neimanmarcus

campeau corp is telling its major lenders and 
creditors that it expects sales to drop for the next two years at 
its retailing businesses 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission also 
disclosed that a total liquidation of campeaus two major american 
retailing divisions allied stores corp and federated department 
stores inc might not be enough to pay off the two divisions 
combined debts of 8 billion 
the canadian corporation which amassed the huge debt in 
acquiring allied and federated disclosed its best and worsecase 
scenarios for the next five years in the sec filing which was 
released thursday 
campeau projected that allied and federated earnings could fall 
by up to 64 percent in the 1990 fiscal year 
the sec papers were peppered with disclaimers that the 
projections may or may not prove to be correct and had been 
prepared only to inform major creditors about possible 
restructuring 
both allied and federated face a monday deadline to renegotiate 
a 234 billion loan from a syndicate headed by citibank 
there was no mention in the documents of plans to seek us 
bankruptcy code protection from creditors however the document 
noted there can be no assurance that restructurings can be 
completed on satisfactory terms within a satisfactory time frame 
if at all 
on thursday campeaus board said it would transfer control of 
its us division to trustees it also said the division would 
appoint its own chairman and board of independent directors 
campeaus problems stem chiefly from the debt it acquired when 
it bought federated in 1988 for 66 billion and allied two years 
earlier for 34 billion 
in its filing campeau projected earnings for allied and 
federated would fall as much as 64 percent in fiscal year 1990 due 
to management distraction limitations on the companys ability 
to negotiate better prices with vendors and increased promotions 
needed to stimulate business it said earnings would recover in 
1991 
the corporation projected that it would return to a normal 
operating environment by the beginning of fiscal year 1992 
campeau projected federated would have operating earnings of 
483 million on sales of 492 billion for fiscal 1989 and allied 
would have operating earnings of 273 million on sales of 274 
billion 
campeau also stated that its projections had not been updated 
since it opened talks dec 13 with major creditors about possible 
financial restructurings 
the documents also stressed that the unusual operating problems 
facing the company made the projections highly uncertain 
another set of projections assumed that allied and federated 
might have to operate under increased restrictions imposed by 
suppliers and factors the middlemen who finance purchases which 
in turn could significantly impair their ability to obtain 
inventory 
inventory could be off by as much as 400 million retail 
compared to the projection for fiscal year 1990 
the sec document projected an aftertax price of 340 billion 
to 370 billion if all of federateds divisions were sold 
individually under the best circumstances the price would fall to 
255 billion to 270 billion if the divisions were sold under 
distressed circumstances such as in a bankruptcy 
reorganization 
a fire sale of allieds divisions would net 12 billion to 
135 billion campeau projected compared with 160 billion to 
180 billion in an orderly process 
according to the documents federated has a total debt and 
accrued interest of 519 billion while allieds debt with 
interest is 299 billion 
the documents projected an aftertax liquidation deficit of 
168 billion to 835 million for federated and 179 billion to 
139 billion for allied depending upon the circumstances of a 
selloff 
allied alone is expected to pay 113 million in debt service 
next year 106 million in 1991 379 million in 1992 6 million 
in 1993 and 4 million in 1994 assuming refinancing

general motors corp says it is in the final leg 
of talks with hungary to establish a joint venture possibly making 
it the first us carmaker to enter the recently liberalized 
markets of eastern europe 
if gm completes the deal which company spokesman john pekarek 
said thursday was in advanced stages it could represent one of 
the largest us projects in the eastern bloc 
pekarek declined to give details of the talks other than to say 
a decision about the project should be reached soon he would not 
confirm or deny a report from london in thursdays wall street 
journal saying the negotiations centered on a 180million project 
to build cars and engines in hungary 
pekarek said gm had no other negotiations under way involving 
any other eastern european project 
gm would not be the first automaker to announce a deal with 
hungary suzuki motor co of japan said tuesday it would build a 
1389million assembly plant near budapest the hungarian capital 
to make suzuki swift subcompact cars beginning in 1992 
a potential gmhungarian deal was news to auto analyst kathleen 
heaney of nikko securities co international inc of new york 
im just surprised at how quickly they gm moved because of 
their nature she said europe is a whole nother world for 
them their european products look good and theyre profitable 
however she said establishing a factory in hungary would be 
good for gm by giving it needed capacity 
gm and ford motor co each have profitable businesses in europe 
which recently have been bolstering sagging us operations 
chrysler corp markets some of its cars on the continent but has 
no independent manufacturing plants there 
last month gm agreed to acquire half of the car business of 
swedens saabscania ab for about 600 million that announcement 
came on the heels of fords acquisition of the british luxury 
carmaker jaguar plc for 25 billion 
gm already makes and sells opel and vauxhall vehicles in europe 
it also owns all of britains group lotus plc ford which has the 
largest european presence of any us automaker makes cars and 
vans there carrying the ford nameplate 
ford has no active negotiations involving eastern european 
production said spokeswoman lin cummins she said however that 
the worlds secondlargest automaker behind gm is watching 
developments closely 
there would seem to be a good chance that multinational 
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in 
the course of the next several years she said 
chrysler officials also have said they have been surprised at 
the speed of change in eastern europe and that later it would 
provide a large market for vehicles 
heaney speculated it would be five years before any us 
automaker could begin making cars in eastern europe partly because 
of difficulties in converting the communist nations currency into 
dollars and partly because of the lack of personal wealth in 
eastern europe 
the consumers just dont have the money she said 
other us corporations also have moved to take advantage of the 
rapid changes in eastern europe general electric co in november 
agreed to pay 150 million for a majority stake in tungsram 
hungarys stateowned lighting manufacturer

a senior bush administration official has 
suggested that the federal government may have to step in to ensure 
that margin requirements on stock index futures are set high enough 
to prevent a market free fall 
margins for stocks and stock options already are set by the 
government but private futures exchanges set their own margins a 
margin is the deposit required by a brokerage firm from an investor 
to buy a stock stock option or stock futures contract 
shouldnt futures margins bear the same public scrutiny 
treasury undersecretary robert r glauber asked thursday why 
should a handful of people be able to to drive the entire 
market into free fall 
the federal reserve requires professional securities traders to 
make a down payment of 20 percent to 25 percent of the amount of 
stock they purchase but futures markets speculators can control an 
equivalent stock position by putting up as little as 4 percent 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady and securities and exchange 
commission chairman richard breeden have called on the futures 
markets to raise their margins 
but glauber speaking at a seminar sponsored by the american 
legal instituteamerican bar association said we have seen 
little progress 
although he declined to endorse a specific level for futures 
margins glauber said the need for harmonized margins was 
critical to prevent the market system from generating 
excessive volatility 
members of congress have supported expanding the power of the 
federal reserve to stock index futures margins glauber said the 
working group on financial markets an interagency committee will 
examine the possibility of giving this authority to the fed the 
sec or the treasury 
the futures exchanges have vigorously defended their power to 
set their own margins arguing that the nature of futures trading 
requires a smaller margin than stock trading the exchanges also 
say higher margins would drive business to overseas markets 
glauber rejected that saying the key to preserving us 
leadership in global financial markets is effective regulation not 
competition in laxity 
on a related matter glauber said futures and stock exchanges 
needed to do a better job coordinating circuitbreakers which 
automatically halt trading for a brief time when prices fall 
precipitously 
he did not suggest government should take that role but he said 
the 190point stock slide last oct 13 pointed to the need for some 
changes in the private arrangement between the new york stock 
exchange and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the circuitbreaker in the chicago market kicked in when the 
futures market fell the equivalent of 100 points on the dow jones 
industrial average but the new york circuit breaker set to halt 
trading after a 250point fall never took effect 
that can permit selling pressure to be transferred from the 
closed futures markets to open stock markets glauber said

the government is seeking a court order to 
halt gillette cos acquisition of part of wilkinson swords 
worldwide razorblade business 
in asking thursday for a temporary restraining order in us 
district court the antitrust division of the justice department 
said gillette would sell more than 53 percent of razor blades sold 
in the united states if the deal were completed 
gillette is the dominant supplier of wet shaving razor blades in 
the united states and wilkinson sword usa is one of only four 
other significant competitors 
in announcing its intention tuesday to file suit the department 
said gillette had 65 percent of the personal shaving blade market 
and wilkinson had 3 percent and a combination posed the threat of 
lesser competition and significantly higher prices for us 
consumers there was no explanation given for the lower market 
share figure cited in thursdays petition to the court 
kenneth m frankel a justice department attorney disclosed at 
a court hearing that a memorandum written at one of the companies 
says wilkinsons european plant will cease production for the 
american market once the transaction is completed he did not say 
where the memo was written 
thomas cullen an attorney representing gillette said the 
document is a draft that is not final and he immediately asked 
that the document stamped confidential not be available for 
public inspection cullen said any decision to close the european 
plant would not be made by gillette but by a dutch concern 
operated by the current managers of wilkinson 
judge thomas hogan agreed to place the memo under seal he said 
he will rule next tuesday on the request for a temporary 
restraining order 
at a court hearing gillette asserted that no temporary 
restraining order is warranted because the deal with wilkinson 
wont be completed until midmarch leaving plenty of time for the 
government to seek a regular injunction against it 
frankel argued that the transaction could be accelerated 
the question regarding wilkinsons operations is will they 
wither under gillettes control and the answer is likely 
yes said frankel 
cullen disagreed saying the result will be us sales of the 
same product at the same stand

nine months after a ruling required states 
to tax federal pensions the same as other public pensions few 
retired federal pensioners have collected their back taxes but 
states fear losing millions in revenues 
an associated press survey shows that only eight of the 24 
states affected by the ruling have agreed to give federal retirees 
the same tax break on their pensions that state retirees have 
enjoyed 
the remaining 16 have yet to act or chose to give all public 
retirees a minimal exemption rather than lose revenue by exempting 
federal pensions at least 17 states are being sued over the issue 
a chain reaction of legal and fiscal snarls has grown out of the 
lawsuit brought by paul s davis a retired attorney with the 
securities and exchange commission who lives in east lansing 
the us supreme court ruled in march that states cant tax the 
pensions of retired federal workers while exempting some or all of 
the pensions of state and local retirees davis who represented 
himself won 4299 in back taxes from michigan 
states choices included giving federal retirees the same tax 
break as state and local ones or repealing the tax break for state 
and local retirees and taxing all public pensions equally 
in michigan where the suit originated the state court of 
appeals ordered the state to exempt all federal pensions from 
taxes a decision that will cost the michigan treasury about 6 
million a year and will affect about 24000 federal retirees 
tax breaks also were given to federal retirees in montana north 
dakota new mexico wisconsin new york west virginia and 
louisiana 
in 11 other states virginia arizona north carolina georgia 
oregon south carolina iowa colorado missouri oklahoma and utah 
lawmakers chose to provide the same limited tax exemption for all 
public pensions 
but in virginia which also gave the same 16000 exemption to 
private pensions the cost is pegged at 250 million over the next 
two years eating up the states 70 million reserve and 
complicating the budgetwriting process 
the issue has been forced onto the november ballot in oregon by 
federal retirees who call the states response a sham lawmakers 
agreed to tax state pensions equally with the federal ones but then 
voted a benefit increase to state retirees to make up the 
difference 
legislatures in alabama kentucky and mississippi have yet to 
decide what to do while arkansas and kansas argue the law doesnt 
apply to them and are being sued by federal retirees 
lawsuits have been filed in 17 states by chapters of the 
national association of retired federal employees seeking refunds 
of taxes paid as far back as 10 years said association spokesman 
denis harrington 
a pair of cases pending before the us supreme court could 
decide whether states must pay refunds if tax laws are declared 
unconstitutional 
if the refunds are approved thats going to be the thing that 
eats states alive said marcia howard research director for the 
national association of state budget officers 
figures from an august survey by the national conference of 
state legislatures said the hardesthit states will be those with 
large numbers of federal retirees such as virginia which could 
owe 370 million in tax refunds to its 200000 federal retirees 
in missouri lawmakers approved 120 million in temporary sales 
and corporate income tax increases to pay refunds to 65000 federal 
retirees ordered by the missouri supreme court 
processing those refunds would be a headache in itself said tim 
leathers arkansas state revenue commissioner who estimates the 
state could receive 100000 amended returns seeking 25 million if 
it agreed to the refunds 
the state normally processes 11000 amended returns he said 
were talking about eight years worth of extra work it may take 
a couple of years or so to get them done he said 
in georgia state retirees sued when their pensions were taxed 
arguing it was a breach of their contract with the state they 
vowed to appeal after losing the first round of the court battle 
in montana a group of private retirees went to court in 
november contending the states decision to treat government 
retirees differently from private retirees was inequitable and 
unconstitutional a similar lawsuit is pending in alabama

us automakers have announced another round of 
temporary layoffs scheduled to begin later this month and into 
february showing a continued downturn in the industry 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp each 
said thursday that slumping sales and high inventories were the 
reasons behind the temporary layoffs which affect about 56800 
workers 
in addition to those layoffs gm and chrysler plan to 
indefinitely idle entire plants or single shifts in twoshift 
operations beginning feb 2 the indefinite layoffs involve about 
13000 workers 
some workers will be part of a temporary layoff and then 
without going back to work be laid off indefinitely the 
distinction is important in the calculation of benefits 
during the first two weeks of january more than 127000 workers 
at the big three automakers were laid off for at least a week 
additional layoff time indicates that inventories still are too 
high and the sales rate still is too low to suit the automakers 
general motors corp said nine of its 31 us assembly plants 
will be down between jan 1622 affecting about 25500 workers 
ford motor co said four of its 15 assembly plants would be down 
in late january and early february affecting about 9700 employees 
and chrysler corp said six of its eight plants would not be 
making cars or trucks for at least a week apiece between monday and 
the first two weeks of next month about 21600 workers are 
affected 
all of the temporary plant idlings are due to inventory 
adjustment a chrysler news release said 
in the first indication that the industrys downturn may begin 
affecting a japaneseowned plant in the united states mazda motor 
corp said it would trim production at its factory in flat rock 
mich later this month 
mazda spokesman jim gill said wednesday line speed at the plant 
south of detroit would be reduced to 55 cars an hour from the 
current 62carsanhour rate 
gill said temporary jobs at the plant would be eliminated and 
assembly employees displaced by the production cut would be 
transferred to other departments or into training programs there 
are about 2800 employees at the factory 
car and truck sales began falling in october as the 1990 model 
year began but months before auto analysts had predicted 
production cuts in the first quarter of this year mainly because 
of continued high production levels in the face of slumping demand

retail sales reflecting a sluggish economy 
rose just 5 percent in 1989 the smallest gain in seven years the 
government said today 
the commerce department said sales for all of 1989 totaled 171 
trillion down from 1988s 71 percent gain it was the smallest 
advance since a 29 percent increase in 1982 
the economy was pinched through much of last year by high 
interest rates caused by the federal reserves tight credit 
policies designed to contain inflation 
retail sales account for about onethird of the nations 
economic activity and thus are one barometer of the extent to which 
the feds antiinflation policies have slowed the economy 
the commerce department said retail sales rose 02 percent in 
december to a seasonally adjusted 1444 billion after rising 05 
percent in november 
part of the november increase was attributed by analysts to the 
early start of the christmas shopping during the weekend after 
thanksgiving and raised expectations of many merchants and analysts 
but the december sales turned out to be modest and commerce said 
spending during the novemberdecember period rose only 38 percent 
over the same period in 1988 when sales were up 66 percent over 
the previous twomonth period it was the lowest novemberdecember 
gain since sales rose 29 percent in 1985 
half or more of retail profits come from business done between 
thaksgiving and christmas 
sales of durable goods bigticket items such as cars and 
household appliances expected to last more than three years fell 
06 percent after edging up 01 percent in november 
durable goods which often are financed by loans and thus are 
susceptible to interest rates have been hit hardest by fed 
policies 
auto sales which have been in the doldrums since the 1990 
models were introduced in october fell 07 percent in december 
after a 04 percent decline in november auto sales represent about 
22 percent of retail spending 
auto sales finished the year up just 22 percent compared to a 
103 percent gain in 1988 it was the lowest since sales declined 
81 percent in 1980 
excluding autos overall sales in december were up 04 percent 
among other durable sales building materials rose 01 percent 
on top of a 07 percent rise in november while furniture and other 
home furnishings declined 1 percent after a 07 percent increase a 
month earlier 
sales of nondurable goods rose 06 percent after gaining 08 
percent in november 
gains were posted in grocery stores up 06 percent and 
gasoline stations up 13 percent due in part to higher prices 
apparel sales advanced 01 percent 
declines were posted in department store sales down 04 
percent restaurants and bars down 09 percent and drug stores 
down 1 percent 
for the three months from october through december overall 
retail sales were up 36 percent

the nations two largest airlines are raising 
most cargo rates to help offset surging jet fuel costs and other 
big carriers say they are considering such a move 
american airlines and united airlines said thursday they are 
increasing airporttoairport cargo rates 5 percent in the 
continental united states and are making steeper hikes for hawaii 
puerto rico and the us virgin islands industry leader american 
and no 2 united also are applying for government approval to raise 
cargo rates for foreign countries 
rates for doortodoor cargo service in which the airlines 
compete with courier companies such as federal express wont 
change 
american and united blamed the increases on the rising cost of 
jet fuel which has jumped to nearly 1 a gallon from 64 cents at 
the end of october as oil prices have climbed 
because of the astonishing increase in fuel costs we have no 
other choice than to increase our cargo rates william r 
boesch americans vice president for cargo said in a statement 
last week many major airlines raised domestic passenger fares 4 
percent to cover fuel costs and some carriers added a special fuel 
surcharge ranging from 5 to 20 per ticket the surcharges were 
the first such levies since the 1970s oil crisis 
spokesmen for northwest airlines and delta air lines said 
thursday those carriers are weighing an increase in cargo rates 
we are reviewing that right now but we havent made a decision 
yet said delta spokeswoman jackie pate in atlanta 
americans domestic rate increases are effective feb 15 while 
uniteds are slated to begin march 1 
american is raising cargo rates 8 percent to and from puerto 
rico and the us virgin islands and 12 percent for hawaii 
american based in fort worth texas said it also has applied to 
the department of transportation for a 12 percent hike for the 
caribbean and mexico 8 percent for europe and asia and 5 percent

are the credit markets ready for a 40year 
government bond 
an indication could come wednesday when the agency established 
to fund the bailout of failed savings and loans is scheduled to 
announce details of its second bond offering 
the resolution funding corp or refcorp has said it is 
considering a 40year bond and many market watchers expect such an 
issue to be among the bond offerings it discloses wednesday 
some analysts are less than enthusiastic about the prospect of 
government bond that is 10 years longer in maturity than any 
current government issue 
given the problems that the 30year treasury bond is having 
there might be some doubt as to what type of reception this 
particular maturity will receive said john lonski senior 
economist for moodys investors service inc 
the 30year treasury called the long bond is considered the 
benchmark issue for the trend of longterm interest rates its 
yield is the figure most often quoted when someone asks how the 
bond market did on a particular day 
a 40year bond would be even more sensitive to changes in 
inflation since the investors money is tied up 10 years longer 
youre really locking yourself into a position where a 
disappointment regarding inflation will incur a greater loss 
lonski said 
he said a 40year bond would be almost as volatile in price as a 
zerocoupon bond zerocoupon bonds pay no interest until they 
reach maturity and because of the delayed payout they are 
extremely sensitive to inflation and changes in market interest 
rates 
lonski said there are a number of 40year telephone company 
bonds on the market and their prices are the most sensitive of 
any corporate bonds to interest rates 
despite the drawbacks lonksi said there might be demand for 
40year government bonds among such longterm investors as pension 
funds 
a 40year bond would have several advantages for refcorp 
chiefly it would allow the agency to get more bang for its bucks 
refcorp must back its own bonds with zerocoupon treasury bonds 
it buys in the market fortyyear bonds would cost about half as 
much to collateralize as 30year issues according to merrill lynch 
amp co inc 
the lower collateralization cost would allow refcorp to issue 
more bonds with the money available to it 
though investors would be tying up their money longer a 40year 
refcorp bond may yield less than the agencys 30year issue 
merrill lynch projects 
thats because of the market demand for zerocoupon bonds of 
greater than 30 years maturity which are not currently available 
zerocoupon bonds often are created by stripping the 
interestbearing coupon from an issue such as a refcorp and then 
selling the stripped bond and the coupons separately 
merrill lynch estimates a 40year refcorp would yield 2025 
basis points more than the benchmark 30year treasury while a 
30year refcorp would yield about 30 basis points more than the 
long bond a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
refcorp bonds yield more than treasuries because of their 
slightly greater risk treasuries are the standard for security 
because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the 
government 
salomon brothers inc for one thinks 40year bonds wouldnt be 
a good idea for refcorp it said in a recent commentary that they 
could cannibalize demand for 30year issues which would raise the 
yield of those bonds and thus make them more costly for the agency 
to sell that might eliminate any expected savings from the 40year 
issues 
in addition salomon said little evidence exists of a huge 
untapped pool of longduration demand 
the treasury also is exploring the possibility of a 40year bond 
of its own said art siddon the treasurys chief spokesman 
were discussing it with people in the market whether they 
think theres demand for it he said last week 
if the treasury goes ahead with a 40year issue it would not be 
breaking new ground the department issued 40year bonds until 
1955 when they were discontinued due to flagging demand siddon 
said 
in fact the government early in this century even issued a 
50year bond to fund the panama canal he added 
the duration of government securities in large part is 
determined by market demand he said for example he said the 
treasury stopped issuing 20year bonds four years ago when the 
market lost interest in them

grain and soybean futures opened sharply higher 
today on the chicago board of trade in reaction to the release 
thursday of the latest us department of agriculture crop report 
the report shows that the nations farmers planted less winter 
wheat and harvested less corn and fewer soybeans last fall 
farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for 
harvest this year up 3 percent from the previous crop according 
to the usda 
the department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 75 billion 
bushels and soybean production at 19 billion bushels 
analysts say the limited rise in winter wheat planting means the 
nations droughtdepleted wheat stockpile will remain low that 
could be bullish for wheat futures if the recent dry weather 
adversely affected wheat seedlings 
corn futures were higher due to strong demand amidst low stocks 
soybeans were higher despite what analysts called a relatively 
neutral usda report on the crop 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 406 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 4 cents higher with march at 243 a bushel oats were 1 
cent to 1 cents higher with march at 144 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cents to 4 cents higher with january at 574 cents a 
bushel 
livestock futures were higher and pork was mixed in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
followthrough buying from thursdays strong close supported 
cattle prices 
pork futures were pressured by profittaking 
live cattle were 03 cent to 28 cent higher with february at 
7757 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 15 cent higher 
with january at 8442 cents a pound hogs were 07 cent lower to 
18 cent higher with february at 5120 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 02 cent lower to 23 cent higher with february at 
5755 cents a pound

takeover forays became the latest bidder for koor industries on 
friday offering to purchase israels troubled industrial concern 
for 130 million

requires the finance ministry to provide 50 million it promised 
koor last year to reduce interest debt 
koor is owned by the histadrut israels largest trade unions 
federation and employs 11000 workers many of whom oppose a sale

however koor owes 950 million to creditors abroad it has 
received an extension to pay interest to bondholders until 
midjanuary any offer to purchase koor has to be approved by the 
government and by koors creditors 
an offer to purchase 51 percent of koors stocks had been made 
earlier by michael geiger on behalf of the usbased shamrock corp 
the company reportedly wants the finance ministry to guarantee 
80 percent of the price it is willing to pay for the ownership of 
koor and freedom to withdraw from the purchase and receive israeli 
government compensation within five years

the christmas freeze was even more 
devastating to floridas citrus crop than the freeze of 1983 
federal analysts have confirmed 
it is worse in terms of what we have left to work with said 
bill becker chairman of the florida citrus commission in 1983 
we started with a larger crop and salvaged more fruit 
the 198990 orange harvest projected before the december cold 
wave at only 130 million 90pound boxes has now been slashed 29 
percent to 92 million boxes the smallest estimated production 
since the 196465 season according to the us department of 
agricultures monthly crop forecast 
it was the first usda monthly report since the dec 2426 freeze 
that iced fruit throughout the 700000acre citrus belt 
gov bob martinez on thursday asked president bush to declare 
disaster areas in seven primarily vegetablegrowing counties and 
said he would seek the declaration for more counties once citrus 
and sugarcane salvage operations are complete 
the 198384 loss was set at 30 percent but the forecast had 
been 168 million boxes and final production was 1167 million the 
harvest after the 1985 freeze was 1039 million boxes of oranges 
we were just getting back on our feet since the last two 
freezes said john smoak president of smoak groves in lake 
placid 
usda analysts said thursday that the losses to the current crop 
may go higher because of heavy spoilage of early and midseason 
oranges still being harvested for processing and indications that 
the still immature valencia variety may have suffered extensive 
damage 
the full extent of the financial damage cannot be calculated for 
months until a full assessment is made of damage to trees 
officials say 
the states citrus crop was worth 14 billion last season 
the usdas monthly crop forecast also estimated that the 
grapefruit harvest would be down 14 percent from 44 million boxes 
to 38 million 
the orange crop last season was 146 million boxes and the 
grapefruit crop was almost 55 million boxes 
this probably will rank as one of the worst freezes of the 
century said robert r terry who heads the citrus section of 
the florida agricultural statistics service

the new government said today its 
predecessor was wrong to agree to absolve union carbide of criminal 
liability in the 1984 bhopal gas disaster and it called the 470 
million settlement inadequate 
justice minister dinesh goswami said the 6weekold government 
of prime minister vp singh would support gas victims and 
activists in supreme court petitions challenging the right of 
former prime minister rajiv gandhis government to settle the case 
however goswami did not say whether the government would try to 
reopen legal proceedings 
an important point made in the review petitions is that 
india has no authority or right to arrive at a settlement which 
extinguishes all rights of the affected victims in respect of 
criminal liability goswami said at his news conference 
the government is also of the view that human life in india is 
not so cheap that the worst industrial disaster of the world 
could be compensated by an amount of 470 million he added 
goswami said the new government would make an interim relief 
payment to gas victims from additional funds but he gave no amount 
or number of recipients 
robert berzok union carbides chief spokesman in connecticut 
said the company had only seen news reports of the new governments 
statements and was unprepared to comment in detail 
all i can tell you is there is no information that suggests 
that the assumptions made in ordering the settlement were 
incorrect he said 
the indian government has said union carbide was negligent in 
allowing the gas leak to happen the multinational said the leak 
was the result of sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
on feb 15 the supreme court accepted the 470 million 
settlement from the multinational union carbide as full and final 
compensation for the gas leak that killed at least 3598 people 
and injured 20000 in the central indian city of bhopal 
at the same time the court ruled the firm based in danbury 
conn was freed from all criminal liability and any future claims 
arising from the disaster on dec 3 1984 
gas victims and activist groups challenged the settlement 
claiming the gandhi government had no right to declare itself the 
sole representative of all claims arising from the disaster 
on dec 22 the supreme court ruled that the government did 
indeed have the right to be the claimants sole representative 
the indian government acting under a 1985 law making it the 
sole representative of the bhopal victims originally sued union 
carbide for 3 billion in damages 
it also filed charges of criminal negligence against top 
executives of the usbased union carbide corp and of its local 
subsidiary union carbide of india ltd those charges were 
eventually dropped 
union carbide has deposited the full settlement with the court 
but distribution of the money was delayed because of the challenges 
and decisions about who is entitled to the money 
at least 500000 people have submitted claims according to 
madhya pradesh state officials processing the claims in bhopal a 
city of 1 million some claimants lived thousands of miles away but 
said they suffered mental anguish 
most of the undisputed sufferers are poor shantytown dwellers 
who live in mud and burlap huts across the street from the 
nowclosed union carbide plant 
many of them inhaled the deadly methyl isocyanate gas as they 
slept or fled the choking white cloud that wafted over the teeming 
slums 
some survivors still suffer from eye and lung problems and say 
they no longer have the stamina to hold regular jobs

federal regulators say it may be time to 
provide more price regulation for local cable tv operators 
virtually all communities with cable tv have had essentially 
deregulated systems since 1985 because of a 1984 law that freed 
cable systems of rate regulation by local franchisers if there were 
three broadcast stations serving the locality 
but the federal communications commission said thursday that a 
review of effective competition for cable tv was needed because 
of changed circumstances in the video marketplace and that 
cables market power may have grown substantially since 1984 
fcc chairman alfred sikes said the inquiry was designed to 
stimulate a more competitive environment in the cable industry 
and provide some assurance some safeguard for the public 
the fcc said todays cable systems rather than merely 
retransmitting the signals of local stations offer a wide range of 
programming in their lowestpriced basic service and cable 
companies are charging more for the service 
the commission said recent rate hikes indicate cables market 
power may be greater than it was when the threesignal effective 
competition standard was adopted 
the national cable television association welcomed the new 
inquiry the association said it expected the study will 
reintroduce a note of reality into the debate over cable rates 
which during 1989 rose at a rate only about half of the overall 
consumer price index 
thursdays action was the second major cable regulatory 
initiative the fcc has launched in a month as pressure builds to 
rein in what cables harshest critics call an unregulated monopoly 
on dec 12 the commission began a study as required under the 
1984 cable act to determine how the law has affected competition 
sen john danforth rmo introduced a bill late last year that 
would give local authorities the right to regulate cable prices if 
there were only one cable provider in the community danforth would 
also make it easier for cities to revoke a cable franchise if the 
operator provides consistently poor service 
the commission said the new inquiry would consider among other 
questions 
should effective competition be redefined to mean four or more 
broadcast stations in a cable market instead of three 
do cable systems have competition from other systems such as 
satellites and microwave systems 
does high cable viewership mean undue market power or indicate 
on the other hand that a valuable service is being provided 
should viewers be allowed to order cable service on a 
perchannel basis 
the commission also said it would consider reimposing financial 
reporting requirements for cable operators that were discontinued 
in 1983 and require local authorities to use a specific ratemaking 
method 
the commission said it hoped to finish the inquiry by july when 
it said it will report to congress 
among other actions thursday the commission proposed easing 
application requirements to speed cellular phone service in areas 
not being served by a communitys two major cellular providers

the soviet union has bought an additional 
497750 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices for delivery 
next month under a longterm grain supply agreement the 
agriculture department said friday 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said nine private companies shared in 
the sales 
the wheat was sold under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep which provides subsidies to exporters selling us 
commodities to designated foreign markets 
dickerson said 1036650 tons of wheat remain in the soviet 
unions current eep allocation about half of a new purchase line 
of 2 million tons was announced on dec 19 in addition to 14200 
tons remaining in a previous allocation 
only wheat has been approved for sale to the soviet union under 
the price subsidy program 
the seventh year of the ussoviet grain agreement began on 
oct 1 with the latest sales the soviet union has bought about 
18 million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and more than 11 
million tons of corn plus some soybeans and soybean meal all of 
the wheat was sold under eep arrangements 
in 198889 the sixth year of the agreement the soviet union 
bought about 54 million tons of wheat and more than 163 million 
tons of corn plus soybeans soybean meal and grain sorghums all 
but about 700000 tons of the wheat was bought under eep 
a metric tons is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 497750 tons are equal to 183 million bushels worth 
around 69 million at recent us farm prices 
dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of 2067 per 
ton or about 56 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices in order to meet foreign competition the exporters then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as 
bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by continental grain

air france said friday it has agreed to acquire a 
controlling interest in the privately held airline union de 
transports aeriens in a move that values uta at almost 7 billion 
french francs or around 12 billion 
air france the governmentowned airline said it will buy 
initially a block of 930000 uta shares representing 5458 percent 
of utas capital from chargeurs sa a holding company with 
transportation and textile interests 
air france said it will pay 4083 francs or 714 for each uta 
share trading in uta shares was suspended on the paris stock 
exchange friday at 2770 francs or 484 
the societe des bourses francaises which regulates securities 
trading announced the halt amid rumors that air france would be 
purchasing a major stake in uta frances biggest private airline 
air france said it is offering the same terms to utas minority 
shareholders 
chargeurs controls 829 percent of utas capital and air france 
will have first refusal rights if chargeurs decides on any future 
dilution of its stake in uta 
uta has a fleet of only 19 jets six of which are owned by its 
charter subsidiary aeromaritime uta operates on longhaul routes 
mainly to the pacific and africa 
chargeurs chairman jerome seydoux had said on several occasions 
that he would sell uta if the french government did not authorize 
it to operate on european and transatlantic routes 
in late 1988 the french government rejected utas request for 
new routes and said it was opposed to allowing uta to fly to 
newark nj although two years ago uta won the right to operate 
between paris and san francisco 
air france said the takeover will create an air transport group 
that will be able to compete on an even footing with big 
international competitors 
several of air frances european rivals notably british airways 
plc and klm royal dutch airlines have considered or made 
investments in foreign airlines as a way to position themselves to 
exploit the common market deregulation set to begin in 1992 
the deal also gives air france control of the french domestic 
airline air inter uta holds 358 percent of air inter stock and 
air france has 37 percent 
transport minister michel delebarre issued a statement praising 
the deal but the takeover could spark a political debate because 
socialist president francois mitterrand had promised there would be 
neither nationalizations nor privatizations during his current 
7year term 
as part of the deal uta will acquire the 49 percent minority 
stake in aeromaritime that is held by chargeurs giving uta full 
control of the charter operation 
financial analysts said air frances purchase of 546 percent of 
uta will give chargeurs an immediate cash injection of almost 38 
billion francs or 665 million 
chargeurs 1989 earnings were affected by a strike by uta pilots 
that lasted several months

art linkletter and actor robert cummings

walt disney and declared disneyland exemplifies the essence of 
the american spirit and continues to show us the way to follow our

the development has been characterized as disneylands first 
major expansion since 1972 although splash mountain star tours

in an interview following thursdays events eisner was asked 
whether there have been complaints about the increase in admission 
prices now 2550 for adults ticket prices have risen 10 times 
since 1982 
certainly we dont want to price ourselves out of a market but 
our research shows that the value people are getting today is 
greater than last year and the value last year was greater than the 
year before he said 
he added that increases were necessary to continue the high 
capital investment required for adding new attractions

the predictions of doom date to the start of 
robert campeaus attempt to build an american retailing empire and 
the prospects of its loss caused little mourning friday among 
canadians who long have said they told him so 
the flamboyant campeau was a celebrity among canadian 
businessmen in the united states the poor boy from decidedly 
unglamorous sudbury ontario who made his canadian fortune in real 
estate and then bought the parent of new yorkbased bloomingdales 
as the crown jewel of his new retailing strategy 
the 66 billion takeover of federated department stores inc in 
april 1988 was the biggest canadian acquisition ever in the united 
states it followed campeaus 1986 acquisition of new yorkbased 
allied stores corp for 36 billion 
on thursday night the directors of campeau corp announced they 
planned to give up control of their us retailing operations 
which are struggling to regroup under the mountain of debt incurred 
when campeau bought them 
robert campeau said he would be involved only in the companys 
real estate operations removing himself from leadership of the 260 
us department stores 
campeaus fall has not generated much evident sympathy in his 
native country 
canadians frequently tend to view with a certain amount of 
skepticism their countrymen who succeed too well especially if 
they make too much noise about it 
it gave me a great feeling as a canadian to reverse the fact 
americans have always bought a great deal of canada campeau said 
in an interview with the toronto star at the time of the federated 
takeover canada is still my favorite country its not canadas 
fault we have messed it up 
harold crookell a professor at the university of western 
ontarios business school said canadians seem to have less 
patience than americans for the donald trump syndrome of 
flaunting wealth and power 
americans tend to laugh it off but canadians see that as 
threatening to the poor threatening to those in need crookell 
said in a phone interview there is a somewhat more egalitarian 
feeling in canada than the united states 
but he said i dont think anyone particularly has strong 
positive emotions toward the multimillionaires in life i dont 
know that canada is unique 
financial analysts suggested for some time that campeau paid too 
much for federated and the extent of his difficulties surfaced in 
september when bloomingdales was put up for sale 
canadian business magazine dropped campeau from 12th to 36th 
place on its annual power list of the nations business leaders 
last fall after he started relinquishing control of the corporation 
and allowed a restructuring committee to take control of solving 
the financial crisis 
toronto canadas business center has a notably 
englishcanadian traditional elite campeau a frenchcanadian with 
an eighthgrade education moved here after spectacular success in 
real estate in ottawa the federal capital 
despite his 11000square foot mansion at torontos most 
prestigious address he never lost his image as an outsider 
campeau complained about it in what some said was a form of 
boasting 
yet the plans announced thursday night apparently intended to 
separate the us division from the torontobased parent let 
campeau retain a role in canadian business and few people of 
influence here are willing to speak publicly about him 
memories linger of his 1980 clash with the wasp elite of bay 
street canadas wall street which blocked him from taking over 
the financial institution royal trustco ltd campeau then went on 
to seek bigger targets in the united states 
i tend to think that privately they are gloating michael 
babad coauthor of a book published in canada last fall about 
campeau said friday he caused them a lot of trouble in 1980 
campeau came back from that and other setbacks leading to 
speculation that even the serious difficulties on his biggest deal 
might not be his finale 
if anyone can bounce back its bob campeau because his 
history has always shown that he can babad said in an interview 
canadian investment has increased sharply in the united states 
and is expected to grow more under the free trade agreement that 
took effect a year ago major successes can be tracked in real 
estate communications and other areas but campeaus difficulty is 
only the latest and biggest in a series of canadian misadventures 
in american retailing 
for example imasco ltd of montreal had problems with the 
peoples drug store chain in the united states and torontobased 
canadian tire ran into difficulty with an auto stores investment in 
the southwestern united states

that recently closed its 14 new york stores on friday blamed high 
security costs caused by drugrelated crime and said it would seek 
to reopen stores in safer malls instead 
the outlets have experienced increasing difficulties due in 
particular to drugrelated crime in new york which has 
necessitated substantial security costs the company said

high rents in the new york market 
sock shop said it it negotiating with a third party over what it 
called selective reopenings of its us outlets in secure 
regional malls 
it also said it was seeking a partner that would take a 
controlling stake in the us operation 
sock shop also said it was in talks that might lead to a 
refinancing of sock shop which would be used to cut debt and 
bolster expansion in europe it didnt elaborate 
it added that the restructuring of the us operations will 
result in an extraordinary charge for the year it didnt specify 
the amount 
although it is encouraging to note that the core uk business 
traded well before christmas trading suffered during 1989 as a 
result of a combination of high interest rates record hot weather 
and the british train and tube subway strikes sock shop said 
sock shop confirmed dec 29 that two days earlier it had closed 
its 17 us stores three of which are located in new jersey and 
pennsylvania 
sock shop operates 105 stores in britain and 15 in continental

president bush complained to a business group 
today that key parts of his legislative agenda remain bogged down 
in the jungles of capitol hill 
the clock is running americas patience is running out the 
president told the cincinnati chamber of commerce 
bush complained that the democraticcontrolled congress was 
dragging its feet on his plans to lower capital gains taxes beef 
up education programs strengthen cleanair regulations and fight 
crime 
the audience of several hundred applauded vigorously when he 
mentioned his proposal to cut capital gains taxes bush also said 
he would not allow reduced military tensions because of changes in 
eastern europe be an excuse to naively cut the muscle out of our 
defense posture 
the president did not mention a dispute with democrats over a 
proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to lower social 
security taxes a plan gaining support among conservative and 
business groups including the us chamber of commerce 
on capitol hill some important business remains unfinished 
promises have gone unfilled he said claiming his agenda was 
bogged down in the jungles of capital hill 
earlier bush told students at a cincinnati high school he was 
optimistic about the future but he said federal resources to give 
more to education were limited 
in a questionandanswer session in the library of taft high 
school the president said budget restraints would prevent him from 
proposing large increases in federal aid 
however he said he would call for some increases in overall 
school spending when he presents his fiscal 1991 budget to congress 
on jan 23 including expanding the head start program fo0r 
disadvantaged preschool children 
but the president added i dont think you can design a 
curriculum to lift the selfesteem of a kid its got to come from 
peers from family from dedicated volunteers who are saying 
you are somebody 
bush also met with members of the cincinnati youth 
collaborative a volunteer organization that tutors children and 
tries to keep students from dropping out of school 
in a speech to a school assembly he announced he was awarding 
the collaborative his 40th daily point of light award an honor 
he bestows on organizations and individuals that best exemplifying 
his thousand points of light theme 
the us chamber of commerce has been a longtime bush ally on 
the capital gains cut but the group said thursday that it would 
also welcome lower social security taxes despite the presidents 
objections 
don levin director of federal budget policy for the national 
business organization called the moynihan proposal a positive 
first step toward strengthening the social security system 
although the chamber has concerns about paying for such a tax 
cut levin said the administration and republicans in general 
would be missing a golden opportunity by not backing it 
how can you go against such a good idea its a populist idea 
and it will do a lot of good for economic growth levin said 
on thursday bush spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked about the 
moynihan proposal in light of bushs repeated opposition to 
higher taxes 
we dont anticipate any changes in social security democrats 
seem to want to fiddle around with the social security system we 
do not fitzwater said 
moynihan would cancel the jan 1 increase that raised the social 
security tax rate to 765 percent from 751 percent the tax covers 
both retirement and medicare programs 
the rate would then decrease even further to 655 percent on 
jan 1 1991 moynihan says large surpluses in the social security 
trust funds justify the rollback which he calls a 55 billion 
tax cut for working people 
moynihans proposal would reduce the rate paid by both employees 
and employers 
social security taxes jumped this year by as much as 320 the 
increase paid by americans with salaries of 51300 or more at 
48000 and below the increase is 014 percent or 67 for someone 
earning 48000 42 for someone earning 30000 28 for someone 
earning 20000 and so on 
ed lopez an aide to moynihan said the senator intends to 
introduce the legislation jan 23 when congress returns from its 
winter recess he said the measure is picking up wide support 
we expected it would have bipartisan support but its a bit 
surprising the extent to which the right wing has climbed all over 
it lopez said 
increases this year and next in social security taxes were 
mandated by 1983 legislation that carried out recommendations of a 
blueribbon commission headed by alan greenspan to overhaul the 
financing of the nations retirement program 
there is about a 65 billion surplus in social security trust 
funds this surplus kept in treasury securities tends to mask 
the size of the true us budget deficit making it easier for the 
administration to meet deficitreducing targets of the grammrudman 
budget balancing law

the prestigious porsche enters its 42nd year 
feeling a twinge of midlife crisis 
the 1987 stock market crash that alarmed affluent buyers the 
dollars weakness against the german mark and increased competition 
cut into sales of the pricey groundhugging roadster prompting the 
company to trim production in germany and slash exports to the 
united states 
in response to the cutbacks renobased porsche cars of north 
america inc has begun what it calls a unique campaign to inflame 
the desire of wouldbe porsche owners 
porsche is still very much a car of aspiration were trying 
to renew that interest said david w wager vice president and 
director of marketing for porsche cars of north america 
this company really produces nothing our function is sales 
and marketing we wanted a piece of creativity that would be really 
different get people involved he said 
the result was sixpage booklets inserted in 16 national 
magazines including the new yorker forbes yachting and esquire 
and twominute television commercials 
the campaign underscores the cars handling and reliability in 
auto racing and the research and development that go into the 
finished product 
many of the words in the brochures and commercials are those of 
80yearold ferdinand ferry porsche who in 1948 developed the 
car that bears his name 
if i build a car that gives me satisfaction then there must 
be others with the same sort of dreams who would be prepared to buy 
such a car he says the porsche is simply more than an 
automobile it embodies my philosophy of freedom of individual 
progression serving mankind without burdening it 
the television commercials also center on what porsche calls the 
philosophy of independence and timelessness that go into its cars 
which range in price from 42000 to 75000 
the company opted for the unusually long commercials produced 
like a piece of cinema so they would not look like other 
commercials said brian bowler president and chief executive 
officer of porsche cars of north america 
our customers are increasingly entrepreneurial that ties in 
because porsche is the product of ferry porsche an entrepreneur 
himself wager said 
in reality part of the rationale for doing this kind of 
campaign is not just to reach the target audience even the ones 
who cannot afford it now will dream and aspire to want to own a 
porsche as well he said 
in 1986 porsche shipped about twothirds of its 45000 cars to 
the united states 
since the stock crash of 1987 and the decline of the dollar 
against the mark porsche has trimmed overall production to 
3000040000 cars a year exporting about onethird of those to 
porsche na 
i suppose our us sales are going to be in the 1100012000 
range for the next couple of years wed like eventually to move 
sales up a little closer to 15000 but thats not going to come 
any time soon wager said 
bowler and wager brought an extensive marketing background to 
porsche bowler joined the company in december 1988 after 21 years 
association with volkswagen in europe and america wagers resume 
includes work with subaru and saabscandia before moving to reno in 
march 
wager said he and bowler immediately decided on a dramatic 
change in the companys direction focusing on sales and marketing 
advertising is consistency of message to change somebodys 
thought patterns or processes he said we think were in real 
danger of doing some pretty good advertising

east germanys parliament on friday cleared 
the way for joint ventures with western companies for the first 
time although officials said foreigners generally would be limited 
to minority shareholdings 
in a nearunanimous vote the 500seat peoples chamber passed a 
constitutional revision needed to allow private ownership 
including foreign shareholdings of east german companies 
the government also announced price hikes for several items to 
foil foreign bargain seekers and start cutting state supports that 
the strapped economy cant afford 
government officials said foreign ownership would be limited to 
49 percent to avoid a sellout of the countrys industry but that 
foreign companies could buy controlling stakes under special 
circumstances 
the communistled government plans to approve a detailed 
proposal on joint ventures on jan 25 and submit it to parliament 
in october 
east germany has been seeking injections of foreign capital to 
modernize its stalling economy foreign companies especially west 
german interests have expressed keen interest in moving into the 
new market 
economics minister christa luft told parliament that the 
constitutional change paves the way for new forms of property in 
east germany 
but she said it does not change the domination of public 
ownership of the key means of production 
finance minister uta nickel told her west german counterpart 
theo waigel at a meeting in east berlin that foreigners might be 
allowed at some point to hold a majority stake in certain ventures 
waigel who also met with east german prime minister hans 
modrow urged east germany to permit majority ownership if it wants 
private west german capital to flow in on a large scale 
the east german government announced it will raise prices for 
childrens clothes and shoes monday to prevent major buying by 
foreigners the hikes will be matched by a rise in state child 
support payments the government said 
prices of childrens items have been kept extremely cheap with 
government subsidies and were favored especially by bargainseeking 
polish buyers 
conversely the government ordered price cuts for sheer 
stockings saying production was efficient enough to allow the move 
subsidies were eliminated for flowers christmas trees and 
household plants the subsidies were a symbol of often wasteful 
state support of prices

grain futures prices closed mixed and soybeans 
were lower friday on the chicago board of trade as investors 
reacted to the release of an agriculture department crop report 
the report released thursday showed that the nations farmers 
planted less winter wheat and harvested less corn and fewer 
soybeans last fall 
farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for 
harvest this year up 3 percent from the previous crop according 
to the usda the department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 75 
billion bushels and soybean production at 19 billion bushels 
soybeans were sharply higher at the open but fell back because 
of weak cash prices and very good growing conditions in south 
america 
analyst william biedermann of allendale inc in chicago said the 
usda report on soybeans was neutral to friendly adding that 
traders hoped soybeans were rise on the backs of corn and wheat 
the smaller than expected corn harvest proved to be a boost to 
corn futures 
the reduced number of seedings sent wheat futures higher at the 
open but only the july newcrop contract sustained its advance due 
to somewhat dry condition in pockets of the winter wheat crop area 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to a cent higher with 
march at 402 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with 
march at 242 a bushel oats were cent lower to a cent higher 
with march at 142 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents lower to 1 
cent higher with january at 565 a bushel

a year ago the folks at automakers who deal with 
dealers tightened their seat belts ron tonkin was on the way 
after a year of rebuking manufacturers for handcuffing dealers 
with too many rebates mandatory advertising and subsidies tonkin 
is concluding his term as head of the national automobile dealers 
association 
he doesnt want to go 
im not ready yet said tonkin who owns several dealerships 
in his hometown of portland ore and elsewhere the job just 
isnt done thats my frustration 
tonkin may feel his chores are unfinished but automakers and 
dealers acknowledge that manufacturerretailer relationships 
changed during his tenure as president of the association 
hes certainly succeeded in bringing the level of awareness of 
dealer concerns up a notch or two chrysler corp marketing vice 
president john damoose said frankly thats good 
todays relationship can be called adversarial 
it is not a partnership tonkin said in a recent interview 
whatever may have once been a partnership unraveled long before 
my time 
tonkin said he hopes his blunt attitude continues when ray green 
of jacksonville ill takes over the presidency at the 
organizations annual convention next month in las vegas 
tonkin got off to a fast start as association president on the 
day he was installed in new orleans he formed the rough 
riders a group of 2000 dealers assigned to scrutinize 
manufacturers like watchdogs 
im more proud of the rough riders than anything else 
tonkin said they alert us to anything that we should be 
addressing on behalf of the dealers thats been accomplished 
other problems tonkin saw when he took office remain among them 
rebates tonkin said cashback offers cripple dealers chances 
to bargain with customers and erode the dealers profit margin and 
the consumers chance to get a car at the best price 
not only the dealers but the public is sick and tired of 
playing the games he said 
mandatory advertising associations tonkin decried automakers 
for imposing a system that required dealers to pay for regional 
advertising bmw recently dropped the requirement of its dealers 
who were paying 300 a car into advertising associations 
that was a small victory for us at nada but it is a 
victory tonkin said 
fleet subsidies dealers handling large fleet sales to 
corporations or rental car companies for example get subsidies 
from automakers because of the large orders tonkin claimed the 
manufacturers recover those costs by tacking hundreds of dollars 
onto the price of every new car 
we havent broken their will to maintain their fleet 
subsidies but were having some dialogue he said 
tonkin said he thinks his successor and others will keep the 
automakers feet to the fire otherwise he said hell run again 
on feb 1 less than two weeks before he leaves office tonkin 
will address the board of directors of chrysler corp the first 
dealer association president to directly meet with a big three 
board 
tonkin said he thinks the automakers will be seeing a lot of the 
nada in the years to come 
i think ray will end up being a very effective president he 
said and i think we have a very effective man following ray 
frank anderson of raleigh nc in 1991 and if i dont think 
theyre effective then ill run again 
and in three years manufacturers will have to look at me in 
detroit again the automakers dont want that so they sure better 
get along with these two

ford motor co said friday it plans to sell its 
ford aerospace corp subsidiary and concentrate on its core 
businesses attempting to divest the defense contractor at a time 
the pentagon is eyeing major spending cuts 
the decision to sell ford aerospace a 17000worker operation 
that gets about twothirds of its business from defense contracts 
marks the second recent move by a big three automaker to sell a 
major nonautomotive subsidiary 
chrysler corp put its chrysler technologies corp including 
gulfstream aerospace inc up for sale last month stating it 
wanted to concentrate on businesses linked directly to cars and 
trucks 
the decision to sell ford aerospace reflects the intention to 
concentrate our resources on our other businesses ford chairman 
donald petersen said in a news release 
ford aerospace is involved primarily in space and groundbased 
command control communications and intelligence systems tactical 
weapons systems and professional services 
ford aerospace built the johnson space center mission control 
center in houston first used for the 1969 moon landing it also 
built the mariner iv satellite which sent the first flyby pictures 
of mars back to earth 
currently the 34yearold company is involved in building the 
intelsat vii a communications satellite commissioned by a 
consortium of nations 
i think the philosophy of the business community today is that 
business strategies should be deeper and narrower than they were 
during the conglomerate days because its very difficult for 
management to stay close to a diverse group of businesses said 
ford spokesman bill peacock 
automotive and financial services is our heritage he said 
they require lots of resources to remain competitive in the sense 
of capital management attention and so forth 
analysts said ford may have to seek a lower price for the 
subsidiary than it might have a few months ago before eastwest 
tensions began easing dramatically and the government began talking 
about substantial cuts in defense spending 
sixtysix percent of ford aerospaces business last year came 
from defense contracts 15 percent in international business 14 
percent in civilian government contracts and the rest in us 
commercial operations said spokesman norman black 
ford declines to reveal earnings of the subsidiary but said 
ford aerospace signed 183 billion worth of contracts last year 
and that it has a 2 billion backlog some of which is included in 
new 1989 contracts 
ford aerospace has three large units the aeronutronics division 
in newport beach calif which builds tactical weapons systems a 
commercial communications satellite and telemetry systems division 
in palo alto and sunnyvale calif and bdm inc a washington 
dcarea defense consulting and engineering organization 
lawrence harris an aerospace analyst with the bateman eichler 
hill richards brokerage in los angeles speculated the company 
might be sold in parts because the operations are so different 
harris speculated that ford aerospace had about 17 billion in 
revenue last year using an aerospace industry rule of thumb that 
properties sell for 70 percent to 75 percent of revenue he 
estimated ford aerospace might fetch 12 billion to 13 billion 
in its entirety 
but that all depends on profits and theres no profit data 
here he said 
ford still retains a large nonautomotive operation first 
nationwide bank based in san francisco 
while chrysler is attempting to sell chrysler technologies 
there have been no indications the biggest of the big three 
general motors corp wants to sell its aerospace business 
gm owns hughes aircraft co as part of its gmhughes electronics 
corp subsidiary 
much of gmhughes electronics profits are tied up in automotive 
business in 1988 the latest annual figures available gmhughes 
made 1602 million on its defense business and 6187 million in 
its automotive operations 
ford aerospace dates to the creation of fords aeronutronic 
division in 1956 which was expanded with the acquisition of philco 
corp in 1961 it acquired bdm international inc in 1988 
ford aerospace is based in newport beach calif and has most 
of its operations in colorado pennsylvania texas california and 
the washington dc area

continental airlines is laying off about 150 
workers nationwide in what the carrier is calling a belttightening 
program 
the layoffs which began tuesday involve administrative 
employees but no passenger service workers said art kent a 
spokesman for continentals parent texas air corp 
there were no pilots no stewardesses no gate agents and 
certainly no mechanics he said thursday 
the whole point was to get more costefficient we have 
reached the point where it is obvious to us we are too fat in the 
middle the restructuring is minimal less than onehalf of 1 
percent of the total workforce were furloughed 
the airline employs about 35000 people including 11000 in 
houston 
i suppose the number is really so small compared with the size 
of our company kent said we didnt think it was significant 
enough that we make a public announcement about it 
continentals sister carrier eastern airlines has been 
restructured as a smaller airline in the wake of a crippling strike 
that started last march 4 eastern has about 20000 employees 
mostly nonunion replacement workers down from 32000 before the 
strike

general motors corp said friday it will offer 
early retirement incentives limit new hiring and reduce 
advertising spending in a sweeping costcutting plan tied to an 
industry slump 
the program has no target or deadline spokesman terry sullivan 
said it is separate from gms action plan of 1987 that aims to 
slash up to 13 billion in costs by the end of this year 
because of the increasing competitive nature of the automotive 
industry we are intensifying our costreduction activities 
throughout general motors he said 
the new costcutting is another sign of concern about the 
industry conditions car and truck sales have been slumping since 
october when the 1990 model year began and officials believe the 
downturn will last through the first half of the year 
i think its a classic reaction to structural change in the 
industry said auto analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co 
in new york referring to recent moves to trim costs and 
concentrate on car and truckmaking 
gm along with its big three cousins ford motor co and chrysler 
corp on thursday announced temporary plant closings for later 
this month and into february that will idle 58600 employees for at 
least a week 
the shutdowns resulted from swelling inventories of new cars and 
slow sales 
no 3 chrysler corp is trying to trim at least 1 billion from 
its 26billion annual budget by the end of 1990 ford motor co 
has no formal costcutting program but spokesman tom foote said 
the automaker is examining expenses and eliminating redundancies 
and excess 
gm already has cut more than 11 billion under its 
costreduction plan sullivan said 
under the new plan some employees younger than 53 will be 
offered bonuses to quit between march 1 and june 30 older workers 
will be offered early retirement packages between april 1 and sept 
30 spokeswoman patricia malloy said 
hiring will be limited to about 500 recent college graduates in 
technical fields during the first half of the year she said in 
1989 gm hired about 1700 college graduates and a smaller number 
of other workers malloy said 
right now it looks as if our recruiting on college campuses 
this year will definitely be more limited than it was last year 
she said 
gm the worlds largest automaker currently has 107000 
salaried and 345500 hourly workers in the united states and 
canada it has about 33000 salaried employees overseas 
malloy said either the company or an employee could refuse or 
accept the early buyouts 
advertising spending this year is likely to be lower than last 
year gm said but like other automakers it declind to release 
advertising figures 
sullivan said nothing is exempt in the latest costcutting wave 
but some essential newproduct programs will feel the sting less 
he denied a report in the wall street journal on friday that gm 
hopes to make 1 billion worth of cuts 
we are reemphasizing the activities and programs that are 
critical to the future competiveness of general motors he said 
thats to go in and make sure that they stay in existence 
but he added im not saying there are no product programs 
that arent being affected 
the bulk of the cuts are expected to be made in north america 
where gm does most of its business company profits have been 
buoyed by overseas earnings principally in europe 
the company declines to separate its north american earnings 
figures but analysts speculated gm lost money in north america 
during the third quarter of last year

soaring energy costs pushed wholesale prices 
up 07 percent in december bringing inflation in 1989 to an 
eightyear high of 48 percent the government said friday 
the sharp seasonally adjusted monthly rise helped spook 
financial markets which read it as a sign the federal reserve 
board would not lower interest rates anytime soon 
markets also were reacting to stock plunges earlier in london 
and tokyo by the close of trading the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks had tumbled 7146 points to 268921 
in a separate report the commerce department said retail sales 
in december rose a lackluster seasonallyadjusted 02 percent for 
the year sales rose 5 percent a sevenyear low and barely 
outpacing inflation 
were starting the year with the worst of both possible 
worlds inflation accelerating and growth slowing said economist 
david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co inc a government 
securities dealer in new york 
the 1989 gain in the labor departments producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of retail topped the previous 
years rate of 4 percent and was more than double the 1987 pace of 
22 percent 
it marked the third consecutive acceleration of wholesale 
inflation and was the steepest rise since a 71 percent rise in 
1981 
the primary factor driving prices higher in december and for all 
of 1989 was energy which climbed 14 percent for the month and 96 
percent for the year 
the deep freeze over much of the nation last month helped boost 
fuel oil prices 71 percent and natural gas costs 16 percent 
gasoline prices were unchanged after falling 77 percent in 
november 
for the year fuel oil climbed 339 percent the biggest jump 
since 1979 gasoline rose 92 percent and natural gas 35 percent 
analysts foresee energy prices increasing substantially again 
this month and perhaps in february but then subsiding with warmer 
temperatures in the spring 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
said prices also might retreat if the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries did not cut back on its recent heavy 
production 
food inflation rose at a 5 percent annual pace compared with 57 
percent in 1988 when a summer drought seared the nations 
midsection 
egg prices rose 409 percent on top of a 421 percent increase 
in 1988 pork prices jumped 194 percent and dairy products 143 
percent however fresh fruit declined 104 percent chicken 89 
percent and fish 57 percent 
december food prices which rose a moderate 05 percent did not 
reflect the full force of the cold snap vegetable prices shot up 
41 percent but fruit prices fell 17 percent 
watch out for next month said economist stacy kottman of 
georgia state university this is not a pretty report but it will 
look better than what we think is hitting us in january 
the inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors viewed as a good indicator of underlying inflation 
pressures shot up 06 percent last month 
but much of that was attributed to a 45 percent jump in tobacco 
prices auto prices rose a brisk 06 percent but for the year were 
up only 21 percent because of weak sales 
prices excluding food and energy rose 42 percent in 1989 down 
slightly from 43 percent in 1988 
economists attribute this stability to the policies of the 
federal reserve board which slowed the economy with higher 
interest rates until june since then the central bank has been 
allowing rates to fall in an effort to prevent a recession 
however the credit easing moves have been made cautiously and 
usually not while inflation signs were evident 
most analysts expect economic sluggishness to persist well into 
the first half of this year taking the edge off prices for many 
goods and commodities and offsetting problems in energy and food 
after a first quarter food and energy bubble i think you can 
find some hope we wont see a lot in the way of price 
appreciation kottman said 
the various changes in december left the price index for 
finished goods at 1153 percent of its 1982 base that meant a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost 11530 in december up 
from 110 a year earlier 
earlier in the production process prices fell 01 percent at 
the intermediate level rising 24 percent for the year 
at the crude level they rose 18 percent last month the 
steepest rise since march and 69 percent for the year the annual 
gain was supported largely by a 35 percent rise in petroleum 
prices the sharpest in 10 years 
an example of the three stages of production would be bread for 
finished goods flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude 
goods

campeau corps decision to give us operations 
more independence underscored a determination to prevent business 
from unraveling at its department stores attorneys and analysts 
said friday 
regardless whether campeau places its retailers under bankruptcy 
court protection the health of the stores could be crucial 
a falloff in sales could further dim creditors chances of 
getting anything close to what they are owed and possibly threaten 
the continued prominence of some prestigious names in retailing 
such as bloomingdales a chain put on the auction block to raise 
cash for its debtencumbered parent there were mixed reactions to 
a thursday announcement that allied stores corp federated 
department stores inc ralphs grocery co and the canadian 
companys other american holdings would be overseen by a new group 
of trustees composed mostly of independent us residents 
the campeau board of directors also announced in toronto that 
they recommended the appointment of a new chief executive officer 
for the us operations 
in addition the board said robert campeau the canadian 
entreprenuer who founded the company will no longer have any 
involvement in retailing limiting his role to real estate 
management and development 
until the trustees are designated campeaus us businesses 
will be run by the companys six independent directors a 
restructuring committee of four directors will be dissolved 
opinions differed on the implications of the moves 
an attorney representing a group of federated bondholders said 
the transfer of control plus the prompt payment on wednesday of 
about 100 million in bills for christmas merchandise indicated 
that campeau hasnt thrown in the towel yet by deciding to seek 
bankruptcy court protection for its retailers 
robert m miller a partner at the law firm berlack israels amp 
liberman said the company is trying to obtain an outofcourt 
settlement with its creditors 
he said as long as suppliers feel comfortable enough to ship 
spring goods when the time comes in a few weeks and as long as 
citibank and other bank lenders dont declare allied and federated 
in default on a 234 billion loan negotiations can continue 
between campeau and creditors 
herman gordon senior vice president and general counsel of 
leslie fay cos inc a large apparel maker said the news this 
past week from campeau suggests the company is trying to keep the 
stores intact and viable and thats good news for us 
like other merchandise suppliers leslie fay decided after being 
paid for late 1989 shipments to fill spot orders placed by 
campeaus stores while continuing to monitor developments 
a citibankled syndicate has given campeau until monday to prove 
that allied and federated are solvent and making progress in 
restructuring if they cannot give the assurance they could be 
declared in default and forced to file for protection from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
it is widely speculated however that the banking syndicate 
might be willing to wait longer having extended the deadline once 
already past the original dec 31 date 
a citibank spokeswoman declined to comment on the speculation 
geoffrey lurie a consultant with gdl management inc who has 
specialized in corporate turnarounds said he still believed that 
the bankruptcy route was best 
a chapter 11 filing would allow the retailers to keep their 
doors open while enabling them to get out of leases with 
unfavorable terms and close poorly performing stores

energy futures prices finished mostly lower 
friday after what analysts described as a volatile session 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the leading 
grade of us crude oil lost 1 cent to settle at 2313 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the february 
contract had risen 24 cents a barrel on thursday other contract 
months showed slight declines in fridays trading 
the february contract for no 2 heating oil which rose 244 
cents on thursday rose 033 cent to settle at 6965 cents a 
gallon but other contract months for heating oil posted declines 
the february contract for unleaded gasoline traded on the merc 
fell 041 cent to settle at 6509 cents a gallon after rising 117 
cents on thursday 
we ended basically nowhere after moving around all day said 
william byers who follows the oil futures market for the 
investment firm bear stearns amp co it was relatively volatile 
during the day 
he said prices rallied at midday but the rally fell apart and 
prices skidded toward the end of the trading day 
byers attributed the heating oil increase to anticipation of 
unusually cold weather in the northeast 
gasoline prices had surged earlier this week in reaction to a 
big decline in gasoline inventories and some analysts said 
fridays pullback may have simply reflected profittaking after the 
runup 
william randol who follows the oil futures market for first 
boston corp said the low inventory figure will likely continue to 
drive gasoline prices higher

fotomat corp the japaneseowned 
film processor known for its tiny parkinglot kiosks has 
announced plans to move its headquarters back to hartford conn 
the move is the latest in the decline of the company whose 
practice of processing film overnight at a central location was 
made nearly obsolete by the arrival of onehour processing labs 
fotomat at one time had nearly 3800 yellowandred parking lot 
kiosks and storefronts but that has dwindled to 800 outlets the 
payroll at its st petersburg headquarters has plummeted to about 
60 jobs from more than 200 
when fotomat moves to its new headquarters in hartford this 
spring it will have only 18 workers as part of a decentralized 
management structure 
fotomat moved to florida from connecticut in 1983 in 1986 
konica corp the japanese photography giant increased its 
minority ownership in fotomat and took the company private 
konicas management held out hope for a comeback but it could 
not compete with drug store chains and rapid processing technology 
most of fotomats business now comes from wholesale work done at 
seven regional photo labs

in over two decades the government has given 
nearly 7 billion condoms to third world countries the agency for 
international development reported 
the agency said that about threequarters of all the 
contraceptives donated to developing countries come from the united 
states 
since 1968 usaid has purchased 5677 million worth of 
contraceptives for distribution to 75 countries 69 billion 
condoms 16 billion cycles of oral contraceptives 497 
intrauterine devices iuds and 165 million vaginal foaming 
tablets it reported 
duff gillespie the agencys director for population said in an 
interview that its orders for condoms have risen from 535 million 
in the year ended sept 30 1988 to 735 million in the following 
year he added that the increase was due in part to the fight 
against aids the acquired immune deficiency syndrome but also to 
the expansion of the agencys population activities 
details of the population program appeared in the fall 1989 
edition of usaid highlights an agency publication distributed 
to reporters this week 
in the past many third world leaders were hostile to family 
planning they suspected a hidden policy of western countries to 
keep down their influence by reducing their population that has 
been largely overcome said gillespie 
these countries have had growth thats historically 
unprecedented he said in an interview 
he pointed out that in africa the population is expected to 
double in 24 years at the present rate of increase while in the 
united states it will take 97 years 
third world leaders have been driven to act by their economic 
situation and the realization of how much more they will need to 
spend on schools housing and social services 
in places like kenya the government is enthusiastic for family 
planning said agency spokesman jerry lipscomb 
kenya in east africa has one of the worlds highest birth 
rates the central intelligence agency estimated that its 
population of more than 23 million people is growing by 44 percent 
a year eight times as fast as the population of japan for 
example 
the agency cited one program in kenya that serves an area of 
350000 people it said 43 percent of the married women there now 
practice birth control compared with only 17 percent in the 
country as a whole and women there average only 52 children 
compared with 77 
it said that in 1959 india was the only third world country with 
a population policy today there are such policies in 63 
governments gillespie said that even governments with no official 
policy are now receptive to outside efforts to hold down the number 
of their citizens 
the publication noted that the us government does not support 
abortion or what it called coercive family planning 
since 1981 the agency has spent 29 billion on population 
activitiess they cover a range from research on a hormone called 
inhibin which could be the basis for a contraceptive for men to 
financing popular songs about the dangers of pregnancy 
in 1986 the first of the agencys six hits produced so far 
were number one in mexico and peru and reached the top 10 in nine 
other latin american countries the publication said 
it claimed success for the agencys efforts reporting that in 
20 countries where it spent the most money the average number of 
children per family has dropped from 61 in the 1960s to 45 today 
whether or not theyre absolutely responsible for bringing 
down the birth rate in those 20 countries they certainly can take 
some credit said alex de sherbinin of the population reference 
bureau 
the agency is the major factor in funding on the international 
scene and theyve been instrumental in bringing world population 
issues to the fore especially in the 1970s

penalized the former chairman of silverado banking savings and 
loan association of denver and confirmed they met this week with 
president bushs son who was a director of the thrift 
the office of thrift supervision barred michael r wise former 
chairman and chief executive officer of the sampl from working for 
any bank sampl or credit union without prior approval from

bush who served on silverados board from 1985 until august 1988 
met with the agencys enforcement officials on monday 
hes been here as have other associates of silverado

former directors and senior managers at silverado 
wise is the third of the sampls officers to accept a penalty from 
the thrift office on wednesday richard k vandapool formerly 
vice chairman and chief operating office of the thrift and robert 
m lewis formerly vice chairman and chief financial officer 
consented to similar orders 
wise in agreeing to the order denied any wrongdoing and said

grave conerns about silverados management which steered the 
thrift into risky commercial lending in the depressed denver market 
and permitted problem transactions with related parties such s 
shareholders officers and directors

subsidiary of ford motor co its name was changed to mile high

grain futures prices closed mixed and soybeans were lower friday 
on the chicago board of trade as investors reacted to the release 
of an agriculture department crop report 
on other markets orange juice was higher precious metals were 
mixed copper fell energy futures dropped and livestock and meat 
futures declined 
wheat settled 3 cents lower to cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in march at 401 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 4 
cents higher with march at 242 a bushel oats were a cent to 
cent lower with march at 143 a bushel soybeans were a cent to 
4 cents lower with january at 565 a bushel 
the usda report released thursday showed that the nations 
farmers planted less winter wheat and harvested less corn and fewer 
soybeans last fall 
farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for 
harvest this year up 3 percent from the previous crop the 
department estimated the 1989 corn crop at 75 billion bushels and 
soybean production at 19 billion bushels 
soybeans were sharply higher at the open but fell back because 
of weak cash prices and very good growing conditions in south 
america 
the smallerthanexpected corn harvest proved to be a boost to 
corn futures 
the reduced number of seedings sent wheat futures higher at the 
open but only the july newcrop contract ended on the plus side 
due to somewhat dry conditions in pockets of winter wheat 
orange juice futures were sharply higher on new yorks cotton 
exchange as the usdas first estimate on the orange juice crop 
since the december freeze indicated losses were as severe as 
anticipated 
the agriculture department projected a 198990 orange harvest of 
just 130 million 90pound boxes the estimate has been slashed 29 
percent to 92 million boxes the smallest estimated production 
since the 196465 season 
usda analysts said losses to the current crop may go higher 
because of heavy spoilage of early and midseason oranges still 
being harvested for processing there are indications that the 
stillimmature valencia variety may have suffered extensive damage 
frozen concentrated orange juice was 5 cents to 12 cents higher 
with january at 1975 a pound 
gold closed lower on new yorks commodity exchange falling back 
from when technical fund selling set in near the close 
gold had moved higher in response to the decline on the tokyo 
and london stock exchanges and a 7146point drop on the new york 
stock exchange said bette raptopoulos an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
but she said selling set in when the metal approached the 420 
resistance level 
gold was 70 cents to 90 cents lower with february at 41470 a 
troy ounce silver was 23 cents to 33 cents higher with march at 
5388 a troy ounce 
copper prices were off sharply on the comex as concerns about 
the economy and the slumping stock market triggered selling 
traders believe the decline of the stock market is an indication 
there will be less industrial demand for copper ms raptopoulos 
said adding to the pressure on the copper futures were forecasts 
of increased stocks in london metal exchangeapproved warehouses 
copper was 240 cents to 330 cents lower with february at 
1063 a pound 
energy futures were lower on the new york mercantile exchange

ual corp chairman stephen m wolf remains 
actively involved in talks with employee unions over a possible 
buyout the companys board said friday disputing reports wolf had 
been replaced in the discussions 
the board has not precluded and in fact continues to 
encourage mr wolf to lead an esop proposal and that process is 
continuing ual spokesman rob doughty said reading a prepared 
statement 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual tumbled 
475 a share to 15950 
the statement follows reports in fridays wall street journal 
that the board asked wolf to drop out of talks because of its 
concern over the lack of progress wolf has made in putting together 
a new offer it has been four months since an earlier employee 
buyout bid fell apart 
a securities analyst who follows the airline industry said 
friday the next major indicator for uals future should come after 
its scheduled jan 25 board meeting when a recapitalization plan 
is to be completed 
weve seen other deadlines come and go in this process 
though said robert decker an analyst for duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago 
the journal reported that the board told its legal advisers 
davis polk amp wardell of new york and its financial advisers first 
boston corp to take wolfs place in negotiations 
but in its statement friday the board said other parties have 
always been involved in the talks 
the fact that the boards representatives are also meeting 
with union representatives is not new and is consistent with the 
boards obligation to maximize shareholder value the board said 
the journal said wolf was believed to have had increasingly 
strained relations with the head of the pilots union frederick c 
dubinsky who had complained that the latest proposals to the union 
asked employees to overpay for the company 
meanwhile in a letter many of the companys 70000 workers 
received thursday wolf said an employee buyout would improve labor 
relations strengthen the company and end the recurring threat of a 
hostile takeover 
he contended in the letter that coniston partners the 
investment firm that owns 118 percent of ual is trying to force a 
recapitalization that could result in cutbacks in new aircraft 
spending and a loss of uniteds market share 
but paul tierney jr of coniston countered there is a lot of 
politics in this situation the letter is part of that 
he insisted thursday that coniston supports an employee buyout 
and considers a recapitalization a second choice 
at a meeting thursday at the companys headquarters wolf told 
about 100 management and nonunion employees that there was no new 
buyout offer ready to submit to uals board according to officials 
who attended the session 
wolf suggested that any new bid would probably be at a lower 
price than the 675 billion employee bid that failed in october 
for lack of financing said sean mcgrady an official who attended 
the meeting 
uals directors asked their advisers on monday to come up with a 
recapitalization plan to present at the boards jan 25 meeting

federal regulators on thursday seized atlantic 
financial federal pennsylvanias largest savings institution 
transferring control to a new agency created to handle failing or 
troubled thrifts 
a new federal mutual association was created to acquire all 
deposits and certain assets and liabilities of the bala cynwyd 
pa savings and loan which was one of nine thrifts seized 
thursday to bring the total under government control to 293 
atlantic financial will continue to maintain normal business 
hours while the resolution trust corp negotiates a permanent 
resolution the rtc was created last august to dispose of about 600 
failed thrifts 
the rtc will be the conservator of the new federal mutual 
assocation which will be called atlantic financial savings the 
association will inherit as assets three thrifts in california 
nevada and west virginia that had been held by atlantic financial 
federal 
the seizure follows by three days the resignation of atlantic 
financial president donald r caldwell his announcement came on 
the day atlantic was to submit a business plan showing federal 
regulators why they should let the thrift remain independent 
instead of being taken over by federal regulators 
atlantic financial had about 58 billion in assets and 37 
billion in 411780 deposit accounts according to the rtc deposits 
continue to be federally insured 
but the thrift was struggling to try to meet new financial 
requirements instituted by the federal government in december the 
standards require savings and loans to make hefty increases in 
capital or net worth capital is the cushion available to cover 
potential losses 
atlantic financials troubles stemmed partly from its 
acquisition of failing thrifts 
in the past months the thrift sought to raise the cash 
necessary to meet financial requirements including offering to 
sell six branch offices in southern california those sales were 
never consummated according to william eayre of the pittsburgh 
office of the office of thrift supervision 
the other thrifts seized on thursday were investment savings 
and loan association of chatsworth calif 2726 million in 
assets st charles savings and loan association st charles

the biggest decline in more than two years on the tokyo stock 
exchange sent a chill through london and wall street friday as 
investors reacted to growing concern about inflation and higher 
interest rates 
the chain reaction also demonstrated that tremors in tokyos 
financial markets can have big repercussions overseas especially 
in the united states because japan is the worlds largest 
creditor 
maybe this is the first example that our dependence of capital 
is making us catch cold when someone sneezes said robert brusca 
chief financial economist at nikko securities co international 
inc in new york 
a big drop in japanese government bond prices and weakness in 
the yen sent share prices tumbling in tokyo early friday the 
nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 65336 points the biggest 
oneday point decline since a loss of 73191 points on nov 10 
1987 
in the first seven sessions of the new year the index has lost 
almost 1400 points or 37 percent 
later stocks fell sharply in london with the ftse 100 share 
index falling 378 points to 23801 the biggest drop in seven 
weeks 
the selloff continued in new york where the dow jones 
industrial average plunged 7146 points or 259 percent to 
268921 it was the biggest point drop since last octobers 
minicrash which knocked 19058 points off the average and the 
13th biggest ever 
the weakness of the yen and expectations that japans interest 
rates will have to go still higher to make the currency more 
attractive have hurt bonds and stocks tokyo analysts said bank of 
japan governor yasushi mieno helped accelerate the fall friday by 
saying the yens weakness could boost inflation by raising the 
prices of imported fuel and raw materials 
the market started falling as players realized that a higher 
yen and lower interest rates the keys to last years booming 
market wont come true said hironobu hagio a securities 
analyst with nippon life insurance co in tokyo 
there was more bad inflation news in the united states friday 
with the report that the producer price index rose 07 percent in 
december that brought inflation at the wholesale level to 48 
percent in 1989 the highest since 1980 
david h resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international inc in new york said any rise in inflation should 
be shortlived stemming mainly from coldinduced runups in the 
price of oil and produce 
a more serious problem for the us stock and bond markets is 
that they are less attractive today to international investors 
resler said 
interest rates have risen recently in europe as well as japan 
because of a perception that inflation is increasing higher rates 
abroad could force a similar move in the united states because of 
the need to attract foreign capital to finance the countrys large 
deficits

bond prices fell sharply friday reflecting 
investor discouragement over a government report showing inflation 
at its worst level in eight years during 1989 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell 2132 point or 
656 for every 1000 in face value the bonds yield which rises 
when its price declines surged to 817 percent from 811 percent 
late thursday 
the governments report that producer prices rose 07 percent in 
december took a toll on the credit markets 
raymond stone a bond market analyst with stone amp mccarthy 
research associates inc said traders were particularly 
discouraged by the fact that prices exclusive of the volatile food 
and energy segments rose a sharp 06 percent 
it would reduce any inclination of the federal reserve 
toward easing credit stone said 
the fed generally tightens credit moving interest rates higher 
in the process to try to control inflation if interest rates 
move up bond prices fall higher inflation also is a negative sign 
for bond traders because it erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities 
the government also issued a report showing retail sales rose a 
sluggish 02 percent last month indicating a slowing of the 
economy but the news which ordinarily might be bullish for the 
bond market was not enough to offset the downbeat inflation report 
paul w boltz an economist with t rowe price associates a 
financial services firm in baltimore said inflation is generally 
expected to slow if other indicators show the economy is sluggish 
the wholesale price report helped send the stock market sharply 
lower with the dow jones industrial average falling 7146 to 
268921 but the bond market generally did not benefit as it 
sometimes does from losses on wall street 
when stocks are down bonds are sometimes seen as a safer haven 
and many investors pick up treasury issues in what is called a 
flight to quality 
prices fell in the junk bond market in response to the decline 
on wall street 
in the secondary market for treasury securities shortterm 
government issues were unchanged intermediate maturities fell 132 
point to 516 point and longterm issues dropped point according 
to figures provided by telerate inc a financial information 
service

price of a bond with a 1000 face value

measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 257 to 117939 
yields on threemonth treasury bills declined to 772 percent as

value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between
