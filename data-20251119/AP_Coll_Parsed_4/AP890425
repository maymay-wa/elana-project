fiftytwo students were arrested tuesday 
evening after occupying a university of massachusetts building 
overnight to protest defense departmentfunded research 
in new york city thousands of city college students got an 
unscheduled holiday after demonstrators occupied the campus 
administration building to protest possible tuition increases 
prompting officials to suspend classes 
about 60 police in riot gear arrived at the university of 
massachusetts around 5 pm about two hours later a bus drove away 
with 29 students who had camped inside memorial hall 
those students were charged with trespassing and another 23 
students were arrested for lying in front of the bus to prevent it 
from leaving police said 
about 300 students stood outside the building chanting and 
looking on as the students inside the hall were arrested 
about 35 students had occupied memorial hall since 1 pm 
monday they declined an offer to meet with administrators in the 
provosts office tuesday morning and instead presented a list of 
demands that included a halt to all defense department research at 
the 25000student campus 
about 40 students left the building tuesday morning after 
several university administrators told them they would be arrested 
after 5 pm said university spokeswoman jeanne hopkins 
the takeover was the second at the western massachusetts campus 
in a week seven protesters were arrested april 19 on charges of 
disorderly conduct and trespassing after also demonstrating against 
militaryfunded research on campus particularly research into 
anthrax 
all research at the university is nonclassified and researchers 
must make their work public under university rules about 116 
million or 22 percent of grant money received at the university 
came from the defense department in 1988 according to the school 
chancellor joseph d duffey issued a statement telling the 
students the research would continue on campus until school 
administrators decide differently 
the policy will not be negotiated with students duffey said 
the latest occupation began when students rallying monday at the 
student union against military research marched toward the 
administration building several then ducked into memorial hall en 
route and more followed 
members of the local chapter of the american friends service 
committee have contended that the research is dangerous to the 
town promotes militarism and should be banned 
the university has argued the purpose of the anthrax research is 
peaceful and the strain of bacteria used is nonvirulent and has 
been under study at the school for 23 years without incident 
the amherst health board has scheduled a hearing for wednesday 
on the question of the safety of the anthrax research 
tuesday was the first time since 1969 that classes at city 
college of new york have been canceled because of student protests 
said school spokesman charles deciccio 
protesters demanding a facetoface meeting with gov mario 
cuomo said they feared tuition at the college now 1250 a year 
would be increased and the college staff would be reduced because 
of state budget cuts 
the governor had no immediate comment 
tuition for next year has not been set deciccio said

the united states cannot wimp out on fraud in 
panamas upcoming presidential vote and still maintain credibility 
in central america four us senators said monday after touring 
the region 
us sens bob graham dfla john mccain rariz charles 
robb dva and connie mack rfla hopscotched through central 
america over the weekend visiting with us and local officials 
the scheduled may 7 election in panama which the senators said 
is widely expected to be stacked in favor of gen manuel antonio 
noriegas candidate is a test of us attitudes toward next years 
nicaraguan elections 
we cannot allow to go unchallenged what is obviously a 
massively fraudulent election in panama said mccain 
the senators called panama a test in us sincerity saying the 
nations actions will be used to judge attitudes toward next 
februarys elections in nicaragua which pit a leftist sandinista 
government against the usbacked contra rebels 
if we wimp out in panama and passively let a fraudulent 
election go forward i think our moral standing within nicaragua 
and our credibility to the world community will be seriously 
compromised graham said 
graham and mack said the united states must immediately focus 
world attention on panama persuading as many foreign observers as 
possible to oversee the vote even though noriega has sought to ban 
such activities 
one of the things we have failed to do is to bring 
international pressure with respect to panama mack said 
graham said reports that president bush had approved aid to the 
panamanian opposition were understandable because the united 
states has legitimate economic and military interests in the 
nation especially the panama canal 
but he said he was puzzled by the 10 million amount reported 
i was surpised because the people with whom we met indicated 
they were expecting to spend approximately 1 million on the 
oppsoition campaign and they had already raised a substantial 
amount of that the senator said i was unclear where the 
figure 10 million came from 
in nicaragua the senators said sandinista foreign ministry 
official victor tinoco met with the senators to discuss next years 
scheduled election in that country 
but tinoco refused to answer the senators when they asked 
pointblank if the sandinistas would peacefully transfer power to 
the winners of the february 1990 election graham said 
in a visit to the yamales contra camp in honduras graham said 
he found the rebels in high spirits he said they would prefer to 
be fighting but understood their role in pressuring the 
sandinistas to comply with their commitment to democratize 
nicaragua

exxon and alaskas top environmentalist 
squabbled over the pace of the oil spill cleanup monday as skimmers 
in the gulf of alaska sought refuge from rough seas for the second 
day in a row 
hatchery owners on prince william sound meanwhile announced 
that 24 million salmon fry have been released into the sound where 
they must swim through seas hit by the spill 
the salmon had to be released sunday and monday in conjunction 
with the bloom of plankton in the sound to enhance their rate of 
survival 
we really have no choice but to release them now said 
heather mccarty a spokeswoman for the nonprofit prince william 
sound aquaculture association which owns three hatcheries in the 
sound 
it is unclear what will happen to the fry as they migrate to the 
open sea if they encounter oil mccarty said 
as cleanup work continued in the sound gale warnings and seas 
swelling to 18 feet kept aircraft on the ground and skimmers close 
to shore monday said coordinators of the militarys role in the 
cleanup 
exxon however called a news conference to announce that the 
cleanup was ahead of the pace calculated in the oil companys 
federally approved plan which figures the cleanup will be done by 
sept 15 
kt koonce exxon usas vice president for exploration and 
production said 70 percent of the 101 milliongallon spill had 
evaporated dissipated or been recovered the company said 18 
gallons had been recovered an estimated 12 million gallons 
remains afloat 
the oil spilled march 24 from the exxon valdez a fully loaded 
tanker that ran aground on bligh reef as it steered from the valdez 
terminal through prince william sound 
dennis kelso commissioner of alaskas despartment of 
environmental conservation questioned exxons claim and said the 
oil companys efforts remain inadequate 
i would look carefully at the figure and not take it at face 
value said kelso adding that the estimate was based on exxons 
computer models and could be off by as much as 50 percent 
what i want to see is some results he said after exxons 
news conference 
while the rough seas kicked oil onto beaches that had previously 
been spared mondays weather also broke up oil and increased the 
likelihood that more crude will be carried to the open seas of the 
gulf of alaska 
we see this storm as a good thing said karen gleason a 
spokeswoman for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
fishermen from homer and other maritime communities south of 
anchorage have sewn absorbent material into nets and are picking up 
oil in much the same way they might be gathering herring this time 
of year 
a cleanup priority has been set for beaches where seals come out 
with their pups each summer thousands of sea birds and hundreds of 
otters already have been found dead 
state officials have canceled or postponed herring black cod 
and shrimp harvests in the sound and closed a portion of the 
kodiak herring fishing grounds 
fisheries officials in seattle were expected to decide wednesday 
whether to cancel the may 1516 halibut season heavy oil has been 
reported around the barren islands at the mouth of cook inlet where 
many large boats congregate for the 24hour open season 
in los angeles meanwhile vice president dan quayle warned oil 
companies not to use the nations worst oil spill as an excuse to 
raise gasoline prices 
if they are it is going to be a very difficult situation for 
them quayle who plans a firsthand look at the cleanup next 
month said in los angeles 
allegations have been made that a temporary shortage of oil 
caused by the spill was used a pretext for gas price hikes 
quayle made his comments after meeting with former president 
reagan and his wife nancy in los angeles as he left on a trip to 
australia and southeast asia he is scheduled to visit prince 
william sound on his way back may 4 
quayle said he would tour the area and collect information for 
president bush

the associated press will introduce three new 
services for readers this year to help meet the changing needs of 
the news industry ap president and general manager louis d 
boccardi said 
i want to reaffirm something that i think you know is true at 
least i hope you know is true boccardi told news executives at 
the ap annual meeting monday that is that i want quality service 
and responsiveness to be the twin themes of everything the ap 
does 
earlier monday president bush and vice president dan quayle 
both addressed the annual meeting and luncheon highlighting the 
start of the 103rd annual convention of the american newspaper 
publishers association 
bush reporting on his first 100 days in office listed among 
his accomplishments savings and loan legislation ethics proposals 
the beginning of a war on drugs and agreements with congress on the 
federal budget and contra aid 
in three short months weve made a good start coming to grips 
with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action he 
said 
at the same time defense and foreign policy reviews 
environmental legislation and a program to deal with homelessness 
are all on the near horizon bush added 
he also suggested his relationship with the media had matured 
after a sometimesrocky presidential campaign 
both of us government and the news media need one another 
and we owe each other a measure of respect honesty and integrity 
equal to the work were engaged in bush said 
the president also pledged continued administration efforts to 
win the release of terry anderson ap chief middle east 
corrrespondent who last month began his fifth year as a hostage in 
lebanon 
hours before departing on a trip along the pacific rim quayle 
addressed his remarks to the declinists both at home and abroad 
who have predicted a diminished standing for the united states as a 
global power 
the point that i will stress to my asian hosts is that when 
americans express doubts about the health of american society its 
usually a sign of renewal not of decline he said 
boccardi who followed bush at the luncheon told the ap annual 
meeting that improving technology was quickly changing the business 
of reporting and delivering news and that the pace would only 
accelerate 
as an example he noted that this year the ap was able for the 
first time to deliver a presidential inauguration picture in time 
for east coast afternoon newspapers by using direct transmission 
from a digital camera onto the ap photo network 
he said the news products to be introduced later this year are 
aimed at different sections of the newspaper new state weather 
maps a sports statistic page and a regular story package aimed at 
readers over age 50 
the state weather maps would compliment national and regional 
maps already provided the ap also will supply a national weather 
map in color via its graphicsnet system of computertocomputer 
transmission 
the fullpage layout of sports agate complete with graphic 
labels and headlines would be transmitted over the aps 
graphicsnet system and updated throughout the day 
the biweekly package of stories and columns aimed at americans 
age 50 and over dealing with such subjects as retirement planning 
health and legislation affecting the elderly an added staff member 
will be assigned to this package called prime time 
in his report card to the members boccardi also said the ap 
this year will complete the conversion to a 9000wordaminute 
highspeed transmission system for datastream and datafeature news 
copy after a delay caused by a worldwide shortage of advanced 
computer memory chips 
he also said a new highspeed photo service photostream will be 
running on a testbasis by midyear 
the aps annual report noted that 72 more daily newspapers 
joined the news cooperative in 1988 bringing total membership at 
the end of 1988 to 1483 dailies representing 95 percent of daily 
us newspaper circulation 
the meeting agenda also included election of seven members of 
the aps 21member board of directors including three new members

the xinghua clothing factory has abandoned plans 
to buy new machines from japan because it doesnt have the 
electricity to run them 
without the right connections it would take years to get 
approval for the extra power said man ying energy manager at 
the 250employee factory in beijing 
the factory also cant buy air conditioners for the sweltering 
summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a 
lack of coal 
we send out special teams to look for coal she said adding 
that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up 
to 130 yuan 35 a ton for it three times the stateset rate 
xinghua is forced to shut down once a sixday week every 
friday in the midst of the worst energy crisis in communist 
chinas 40year history 
but it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial 
cities of shanghai and shenyang which operate only three or four 
days of their usual sixday week in parts of jiangsu province 
another industrial center near shanghai up to a third of the 
factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had 
stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages 
in beijing 500 factories employing 100000 now operate only on 
night shifts because they have no power during the day 
not only factories are affected 
in beijing a city of 10 million people elevators in highrise 
buildings dont work new color televisions sit idle and people 
stock up on candles 
the official guangming daily noted that even the headquarters of 
the energy resources ministry has been ordered to shut off all 
electrical appliances every thursday 
china has been losing an average 200 billion yuan 54 billion 
a year during the 1980s due to power cuts last year the losses 
were believed to be double that as up to onethird of production 
capacity was unused 
the crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match 
the nations explosive industrial growth industrial output 
increased by more than 20 percent in 1988 but production of coal 
used for 70 percent of chinas energy was up only 4 percent 
energy supplies have also failed to cope with chinas newfound 
prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions 
refrigerators microwaves and other electrical appliances in 
beijing last year energy consumption by households jumped 29 
percent while power supply was up by only 3 percent 
the guangming daily noted that one large luxury hotel in beijing 
today consumes as much energy as all of beijing did in the early 
1950s 
another problem is that china although the worlds largest 
producer of coal with 970 million tons last year cant get the 
power to the places it is needed 
most of the nations coal is mined in the north but industry is 
centered mainly along the southern coast half the countrys badly 
overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted 
to carrying coal but that still wasnt enough last year about 8 
million tons or 35 percent of the state coal supply quota was 
not delivered 
according to a report in the weekly publication outlook 
liaowang one large coal mine in shanxi province in the heart of 
coal country had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked 
fuel to run its bulldozers 
low investment in energy industries inefficient small mines and 
artificially low stateset prices for energy have widened the gap 
between supply and demand profiteering by officials with access to 
coal supplies even in the army is pandemic 
coal should sell for the stateprice equivalent of 8 to 11 a 
ton but it goes for 54 to 80 after passing through the hands of 
various middlemen on its way to shanghai or canton 
the government is considering various possible solutions 
including more investment in energy production higher taxes for 
energy use and higher energy prices to achieve what appears to be 
an impossible goal of producing 15 billion tons of coal by the 
year 2000 
china now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along 
the southern coast and has plans for others 
as a stopgap measure the government is hoping that its harsh 
austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down 
enough to relieve the energy crisis 
if we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society 
the guangming daily said todays china can be compared to a 
patient suffering from anemia

when it withdraws from cambodia 
vietnam will be at peace for the first time since its war for 
independence began half a century ago against the french japanese 
and eventually the americans 
reformers now in control hope ending nearly 11 years of 
occupation will bring better relations with the outside world 
including the united states they believe vietnam risks economic 
disaster without expanded trade and assistance from abroad 
orders for vietnams invasion of neighboring cambodia in 
december 1978 came from founders of the communist party made 
inflexible by the long struggle several have resigned or died 
since and the reformers pledge to withdraw the remaining 
occupation forces by sept 30 
vietnam says 50000 of its soldiers remain in cambodia but 
foreign intelligence estimates put the number as high as 70000 
a new and bloodier round of civil war between the 
hanoisponsored cambodian government and the threeparty guerrilla 
groups opposing it may begin after the withdrawal but the 
departure will be a boon to vietnam 
its occupation aided by the soviet union angered nations on 
which vietnamese trade and economic development depend such as the 
united states china and members of the association of southeast 
asian nations thailand malaysia indonesia the philippines 
singapore and brunei 
vietnams invasion overthrew the brutal khmer rouge regime 
which was allied with china and the chinese army made a punitive 
strike into vietnam early in 1979 because of sanctions and its 
isolation vietnam soon found itself in worse shape economically 
than the devastated country it had occupied 
ngo dien vietnamese ambassador to cambodia says relations with 
thailand and the united states have improved and trade along the 
chinavietnam frontier has resumed after the withdrawal we will 
see even more changes he added 
washington says it will not consider aid or diplomatic relations 
until vietnamese military forces leave cambodia but hanois pledge 
and its efforts to account for americans still missing from the 
vietnam war have caused more us congressmen to recommend quicker 
reconciliation 
thailand talks of turning indochinas battlefields into 
markets 
as a condition for a return to normal relations with the soviet 
union china has demanded that moscow force vietnam to leave 
cambodia mikhail s gorbachev and deng xiaoping leaders of the 
two countries are to meet next month in beijing for the 
chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
asked whether vietnam made its decision under soviet pressure 
ngo dien said mr gorbachev of course welcomed the withdrawal 
because he has something in his hands for the summit 
some people may call it pressure some people may call it good 
coordination between close friends who have the same aim 
improving relations with vietnam might enable the noncommunist 
world to wean it from dependence on the soviet union and encourage 
the limited steps hanoi has taken toward a more open freer society 
for three centuries cambodia has found itself shrinking with 
vietnams steady territorial expansion 
communistled vietnamese guerrillas used cambodian and laotian 
territory as sanctuaries and supply routes for the war against the 
french and the americans and helped communist movements to victory 
in the two countries 
since economic reformer nguyen van linh became party chief in 
late 1986 however hanoi has taken steps to get out of cambodia 
and has withdrawn troops from laos 
a soviet diplomat based in phnom penh said privately that some 
vietnamese saw themselves as the rulers of this country but 
luckily the others got the upper hand 
uch kiman head of the foreign ministrys political department 
in the government installed by vietnam suggested greater 
independence for cambodia will accompany the end of occupation 
for the moment i think we have to stick together because of 
the political configuration in the region but i think in the 
future we dont want to wall ourselves in he said 
we certainly want to expand our relations to all neighboring 
countries especially the asean countries 
according to the soviet diplomat vietnams influence will 
remain after withdrawal but it will not be monopolistic 
ngo dien suggested vietnam would stop using military means to 
resolve problems and would fix its attention on economic 
development

genes may influence how satisfied one is at 
work according to a study 
but the study does not imply that people who dislike their jobs 
are genetically doomed to unhappiness at work 
the apparent impact of genes is quite modest suggesting were 
not totally hardwired for job satisfaction said industrial 
psychologist richard arvey 
besides he said just as nutrition can modify the genetic 
influence on a persons height the job setting may affect the 
hypothesized genetic contribution to job satisfaction 
the study suggests that genes may be one reason that some people 
seem happy no matter what they do while others have trouble 
finding a satisfying job arvey said 
the research is presented in this months issue of the journal 
of applied psychology by arvey a professor at the industrial 
relations center of the university of minnesotas carlson school of 
management and colleagues lauren abraham thomas bouchard jr 
and nancy segal 
arvey said the study does not prove genetic influence over job 
satisfaction but only supports the idea he also noted that the 
study was small and cautioned against applying the results to the 
general population 
two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personality 
said the study fits in with previous research john loehlin of the 
university of texas at austin said other research suggests genetic 
influence on personality and temperament and an effect on job 
satisfaction appears plausible 
richard rose of indiana university in bloomington said finnish 
studies of twins have found evidence that genes may influence a 
persons job choice satisfaction with life and frequency of 
changing jobs for such negative reasons as dissatisfaction or being 
fired 
but psychologist leon kamin of northeastern university in 
boston who has analyzed natureversusnurture research said 
monday he was skeptical 
the reason for studying identical twins reared apart is that 
since twins in a pair share identical genes but grow up in 
different environments some similarities between them may reflect 
genetic influence 
but kamin said previous studies showed twins reared apart tend 
to grow up in similar family environments which he said could 
explain such similarities as degree of job satisfaction 
the minnesota study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins who 
had been separated at an average age of less than 6 months they 
were not reunited until about age 32 on average twentyfive pairs 
were women 
each twin completed a 20item questionnaire about satisfaction 
with the major job in his or her life arvey said the job list 
was diverse including research chemist coal miner assembly line 
worker computer analyst machinist nurse and financial planner 
seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job 
when researchers analyzed the various levels of general job 
satisfaction reported by the 68 people about 30 percent of the 
differences appeared to be explained by genetic influence the rest 
was attributed other factors such as environment 
comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs researchers 
found evidence that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degrees 
of mental complexity physical demands and physical coordination 
requirements 
that finding supports the idea that genes also affect what jobs 
people seek researchers said but analysis showed it does not 
explain the apparent genetic influence on job satisfaction 
arvey said there are several possible ways genes could influence 
happiness in the workplace affecting personality is a very 
likely mechanism he said 
alternatively he said genes may influence what people pay 
attention to in their job environment such as supervision or may 
affect what people want from a job

thousands of grieving friends and relatives 
of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship uss iowa gathered 
quietly monday and heard president bush praise their loved ones as 
brothers in eternity 
we join today in mourning for the 47 who perished and in 
fact for the 11 who survived the president told a packed 
memorial service at norfolk naval air station they all were in 
the words of a poet the men behind the guns 
they came from hidalgo texas cleveland ohio tampa 
florida costa mesa california they came to the navy as 
strangers served the navy as shipmates and friends and left the 
navy as brothers in eternity in the finest navy tradition they 
served proudly on a great battleship the uss iowa 
the president a world war ii navy pilot said he was proud to 
recommission the iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle 
stars in two wars 
but with the stillunexplained fire and explosion last wednesday 
in the battleships no 2 gun turret he said fate has written a 
sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship 
the iowas commander capt fred p moosally said the turrets 
crew was the best gun crew on the ship and called its chief 
chief gunners mate reginald owen ziegler of port gibson ny 
my no 1 chief 
victims relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress 
blues were among the 6000 people crowded into a hangar for the 
service a bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium 
behind were an american flag and the battleships banners outside 
another 2000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers 
as many as 500 iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service 
because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to 
enter the hangar because of security measures to protect bush 
many were angry they could not attend said machinists mate 
david finn 38 it was very important to them finn said 
the service came a day after the world war iiera battleship 
eased into its home port its gun barrels scorched and its 1500 
crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory 
of their dead shipmates 
moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men 
of turret no 2 
i remember their faces as they toiled at their guns sweating 
an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great 
cause he said 
i remember as they talked among themselves looking so much 
like sailors of the past sharing the exuberance of the times and 
the dreams of the future he said 
they were the life the spirit and the soul of our ship 
they made the ultimate sacrifice for us the men of turret two 
will be part of the spirit of the iowa forever 
bush recounted seeing the iowa off the coast of the philippines 
as a naval aviator in world war ii and the great sense of 
confidence the big ship lent to the fleet 
addressing the children of the victims he said you must 
never forget that your father was americas pride 
at the end of the service while the navy hymn was played 
president and mrs bush greeted and consoled the families of the 
lost men after the 45minute service the families attended a 
private reception with moosally 
the navy said 45 victims families attended the service 
at a press briefing following the reception moosally praised 
the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage 
god gave birth to 500 heroes the captain said fire on a 
ship is the most terrifying fear you have nowhere to run 
our extensive training paid off he said besides the 
firefighting crews we had cooks engineers deck seamen marines 
all fighting to save the ship 
moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to vice 
adm jerome johnson commander of the 2nd fleet to tell him to 
watch the no 2 turret because it contained his best crew 
this was my best turret moosally said he said turret chief 
ziegler was the most meticulous of men he was my no 1 chief of 
the 84 chiefs aboard 
nobody in that turret did anything unless they were 
qualified moosally said 
moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters 
questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired 
saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary 
all but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last 
wednesday when the explosion ripped through it at the time the 
iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off puerto rico 
the navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing 
navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the 
explosion 
cmdr john p morse the iowas weapons officer said the guns 
were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident and moosally 
said he had no hesitation about the guns safety 
ill be in the turret for the first shot to go off the 
captain said 
one of the survivors gunners mate 3rd class kendall l truitt 
21 of tampa fla said that at first the men down in the powder 
magazine in the lowest level of the turret didnt know anything was 
wrong 
we were waiting for the gun to fire and we werent sure he 
said when the men discovered that no one was answering the 
interior turret communications link truitt ordered the powder 
returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated 
the sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through 
hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck 
truitt recalled 
my first thought was that id better get to a lifeboat 
station because if the fire got to the magazine things would be 
bad he said

years of war and defoliation in vietnam failed 
to eradicate a small population of the worlds rarest rhinoceroses 
near ho chi minh city wildlife officials say 
an american researcher said monday that he and a team of 
vietnamese biologists had found tracks of a population of perhaps 
10 to 15 javan rhinoceroses in the eastern part of vietnams song 
be province 
since the 1960s the rhinos had been thought extinct except for 
about 50 living on the western tip of java said george schaller 
director of wildlife conservation international a division of the 
new york zoological society 
it was suspected that some still survived in indochina but 
there was no definite evidence of them schaller said 
live animals were not sighted but a dead one was found and the 
animals tracks left no doubt about their identification he said 
the find is important not only because it improves the survival 
odds for the javan rhinoceros but also because the rhinos can be 
used to encourage preservation of wilderness in vietnam schaller 
said 
you may well say that the rhino is a national treasure of 
vietnam he said but the real treasure is the habitat there 
the forest 
many of these charismatic species are in effect symbols 
flagship species in that they arouse emotions they motivate a 
government to protect an area because they get popular support 
in vietnam as elsewhere in asia rhino horn is used as a 
constituent of many different medicines schaller said 
the dark gray javan rhinoceros is similar to the african black 
rhinoceros but is chunkier and has heavy skin folds that give it 
an armored look an adult weighs 3500 pounds stands 5 feet tall 
and is up to 11 feet long 
schaller who has tracked endangered animals around the globe 
most recently in china and tibet found the rhinos tracks during 
an expedition to vietnam in february and march 
he was there with vo thanh son of the university of hanoi and 
nguyen yuan dang and le dinh thuy of vietnams national research 
council to make the first wildlife survey of vietnams southern 
forests 
the tracks were found along the dong nai river 75 miles 
northeast of ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
the region where the rhinos were found is a hot humid patchwork 
of forest native tribesmens fields and huge expanses of bamboo up 
to 40 feet tall 
the vietnamese are real conscious of conservation and i think 
theyll make an effort to protect the rhinos schaller said 
he recommends stiff penalties for killing and selling rhinos 
and the enlargement of a wilderness reserve near where the 
rhinoceroses were found

the head of a commission appointed to rework the 
citys unconstitutional government proposed eliminating the 
powerful board of estimate on monday and expanding the city council 
to 50 members 
the mayor would take control of contracts a lightning rod in 
view of the city corruption scandals surrounding board of 
estimateawarded contracts that have resulted in criminal 
convictions however various bodies would have oversight 
responsibilities 
mayor edward i koch and city comptroller harrison goldin were 
generally pleased by the proposals made by frederick ao schwarz 
jr chairman of the charter revision commission 
the five borough presidents who sit on the board of estimate 
opposed them however with howard golden of brooklyn saying 
schwarz is telling the boroughs to drop dead 
at a public hearing schwarz also put forth the idea of a 
bicameral legislature but not as a formal proposal he said a new 
19member house would be the equal of the city council but that it 
would only work if it gave greater representation to blacks and 
hispanics 
the commission was created by the mayor to look into ways city 
government could restructure itself as court challenges to the 
board of estimate made their way through the legal system 
in march the us supreme court ruled that the board was 
unconstitutional because it violated the oneperson onevote 
doctrine by giving each borough equal weight even though they 
varied widely in population 
the commission which had been on hold pending the courts 
ruling then went into high gear with a selfimposed mandate to get 
its proposals on the november ballot 
the chairmans proposals are the first formal agenda around 
which the 15member commission can debate schwarz presented part 
of the proposals monday for discussion with the rest to be reviewed 
by the commission tuesday his proposals are not final 
under his proposals the powers of the board of estimate made 
up of the borough presidents the mayor the city council president 
and the comptroller would be dispersed 
the comptroller no longer would be involved in policy and would 
be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and audit functions on 
contracts 
i think it is a useful focus for reconstituting the city 
government comptroller goldin said the comptrollers role has 
always been overwhelmingly fiscal this recognizes that reality 
the city council would expand from 35 to 50 members with the 
districts to correspond as closely as possible to community board 
districts the city council president would continue as an 
ombudsman

police minister chaim barlev says he has 
ordered an investigation into press cards palestinians are issuing 
foreign journalists for the occupied lands where israeli police 
have posed as reporters 
many foreign reporters have acquired such cards since a scandal 
last month involving two police officers who were filmed using a 
press sign on their vehicle during a raid against arab rioters 
in east jerusalem 
police later imposed limitations on the practice but did not 
rule it out altogether saying it was a legitimate decoy method in 
dealing with the 16month palestinian uprising 
in addition jewish settlers living in the occupied lands have 
sometimes used press signs to pass unharmed through palestinian 
roadblocks where stonethrowers hurl rocks at cars with the yellow 
israeli license plates 
palestinians have alleged that israeli secret service agents 
were also presenting themselves as journalists masked palestinian 
activists have often stopped reporters to check their credentials 
barlev said on israel radio monday that police would look into 
the palestinianissued press cards 
those issuing these cards are an organization in jerusalem 
he said we will check if its against the law and what law and 
what steps can we take against people issuing these cards 
robert slater chairman of the foreign press association said 
foreign journalists had to use the palestinian cards because 
israeli security officials had posed as journalists 
after police were posing as journalists the palestinians saw 
the israeli press cards as identifying either a real journalist or 
a police agent he said on israel radio i can understand that 
the palestinians want to make our work easier and give us their 
cards 
it gives them some possibility to check if the man is really a 
reporter and we accept it it makes it easier for us said 
slater whose organization represents 200 to 300 foreign 
journalists posted in israel 
if a reporter has to get a card from some element its not a 
violation of some norm but a natural thing in every conflict in the 
world in lebanon in south america he added 
but yoram ettinger head of the government press office said 
that the very acceptance of a palestinian card in israel i 
think is a challenge to israels sovereignty 
as far as i know the card has a map of palestine from the 
jordan river to the sea which means the elimination of israel he 
said on israel radio 
neither slater nor ettinger identified the organization that 
produces the press cards the israeli news agency itim said it was 
a jerusalembased organization called palestinian press office 
radwan abu ayyash head of the arab journalists association 
based in east jerusalem said his office has been issuing cards for 
foreign journalists for the last two years there is no map on 
these cards 
the cards are not a challenge to anybody and have no political 
significance whatsoever abu ayyash said it has nothing to do 
with the uprising or an independent palestinian state moreover 
our association has a license from the israeli interior ministry 
he said the cards were issued upon request by foreign reporters 
who told us we are harmed by your people would you do something 
to help us and we did

will leave the welcoming ceremonies to the capable hands of his 
local embassy staff his wife angela and their 25yearold son 
mcdonald jr 
benjamin is the washington diplomatic representative of the 
86000 people of dominica pronounced domineeca a mountainous 
lushly forested island nestled between the french islands of 
guadeloupe and martinique in the eastern caribbean

suburban alexandria his wife says they have the best view of any 
embassy in washington 
the embassys only official decoration is the dominica national 
flag mounted on a sixfoot pole in the foyer 
dominica is too poor to furnish benjamin with a chauffeurdriven 
limousine so he drives to his diplomatic appointments in the 
familys 1987 plymouth sedan 
when the ambassador invites guests to an embassy dinner party 
his germanborn wife dons an apron and prepares the food i am 
what you call a gourmet cook says mrs benjamin i love to do 
my own cooking

international fund for agricultural and rural development a united 
nations agency has served without pay as dominicas ambassador to 
the united states italy and the food and agriculture organization

the island 29 miles long and 15 miles wide contains vast rain 
forests volcanic peaks waterfalls hot springs a cratered 
boiling lake and 365 rivers one for each day of the year it 
is the home of the worlds only sisserou parrots and the only

new highway network the doubling of dominicas production of 
bananas its main export an excellent debtpayment record and

says benjamin whenever i see the ambassador from the 
dominican republic i say wouldnt it be a good idea for us to 
merge our two embassies then we could share our secrets fully

the ethics case against house speaker jim 
wright dominates capitol hill conversation but lawmakers found out 
over the weekend that folks back home have other things on their 
minds 
wrights chief accuser rep newt gingrich rga used town 
meetings in his suburban atlanta district to cite repeatedly from 
the house ethics committee report charging wright with 69 
violations 
that was fine said bob norton a douglas county real estate 
broker but he was more concerned over sewage and other pollution 
in the chattahoochee river 
id be more enthusiastic about newt if hed get as much impact 
on the environment and our rivers as he did on jim wright he 
said 
politicians found reactions like that were commonplace last 
weekend in their first trips home since the ethics committee 
announced it had reason to believe wright had violated house rules 
the panel formally known as the committee on standards of 
official conduct issued its equivalent of an indictment of wright 
it will decide later whether to report actual violations to the 
full house for disciplinary action 
the charges center on allegations that wright used a sweetheart 
publishing deal and bulk book sales to evade house limits on 
outside income and that he accepted gifts from a friend who had an 
interest in legislation 
the committee is continuing to investigate an oil well deal that 
netted a big profit for the speaker even though the well was a dud 
and as a grassroots political topic many lawmakers are finding 
the wright case is a dud too 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash said only newspaper reporters 
asked her about wright during her district visit the freshman 
congresswoman handled questions from voters on topics including 
trade fishing and forestry 
apparently her tastes mirror her constituents she said she 
repeatedly fell asleep when she tried to read the ethics panel 
volume 
rep barney frank dmass who has made several television 
appearances on the wright case to take on the speakers accuser 
received only a single question on the topic at a wellesley college 
forum and that was from a professor 
paul barstow a professor of theater studies said he was 
concerned the wright case would lead to a general perception of 
corruption among the democrats 
political science major elizabeth rosenkrantz a senior who 
helped organize franks appearance at the school said the wright 
case was less important to her than issues such as abortion and the 
federal budget 
it doesnt affect me personally she said 
in fort worth wrights home district people probably do take 
his performance more personally there 79 percent gave him a job 
rating of good to outstanding according to a poll conducted by the 
fort worth star telegram in the days following the ethics committee 
report 
nationwide polls released today showed wright to be far from a 
frontburner issue 
a los angeles times poll found more than half the people 
responding were ignorant of the charges a washington post poll 
found that only a third said they were closely following news about 
wright and less than 40 percent knew his party 
however the same polls showed a strong majority 77 percent in 
the post survey believed he should resign if the charges against 
him are found to be true 
my reaction is to wait on any direct verdict until all the 
evidence is in said kenneth lakian a massachusetts college of 
law student who heard a speech there by frank i would hope the 
public would give jim wright his day in court 
hes guilty as hell was the early line from galen 
rottinghaus a farmer in democratic rep jim slatterys kansas 
district 
but a washington post reporter who spent two days with slattery 
found that the congressman only received a wright question at about 
every other meeting 
slattery says when the issue comes before the full house he 
wants to judge wright on the facts and not on public opinion but 
he acknowledged if the speaker loses the battle of public 
opinion that will significantly weaken his political position 
back home

a national transportation safety board staff 
report recommends several changes in air traffic control operations 
over southern california as a result of incidents of airplanes 
flying too close together a board source says 
the board was taking up the report at its public meeting today 
after its investigation into the loss of standard separation 
between a british airways jumbo jet and an american airlines 
jetliner on feb 13 over westminster calif 
the report recommends increases in staff and training at the 
coast terminal radar approach control facility in orange county 
calif some improvements and expansion of the facility itself and 
several technical changes the source said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the investigation of the british airwaysamerican incident was 
expanded to cover seven other operational errors over the past year 
at the facility just south of los angeles the traffic control 
operation handles about half a million flights a year in the skies 
between los angeles and san diego which is one of the busiest 
flight areas in the country outside major airport control zones 
the board meeting on southern california air traffic control 
problems comes two days after two reports of airliners nearly 
colliding in the new york area 
a twa jumbo jet coming in from london and a commuter plane flew 
about 100 feet apart as they approached kennedy international 
airport on sunday and 45 minutes later a pan am boeing 727 en 
route from laguardia airport to boston reported coming within 400 
yards of a small cessna plane near westchester county airport 
the two jetliners in the california incident flew within 19 
miles of each other both at 9000 feet and federal aviation 
administration officials at the time said the british airways pilot 
had to make a hasty turn to avoid a collision 
although the planes were not close enough for the incident to be 
considered a near miss faa rules say they should have been at 
least three miles apart horizontally and 1000 feet vertically 
the british boeing 747 was carrying 286 people from los angeles 
to london the american airlines plane a british aerospace 146 
with 70 people aboard was landing at ontario international airport 
after being diverted from john wayne airport whose runway had been 
closed due to a power failure 
the board inquiry is its first major investigation into an air 
traffic control operation since the board began recommending 
upgrading at chicagos ohare international airport after 
operational errors increased in 1986 ohare had more than 30 
flighthandling errors in 1988 and the faa has ordered several 
changes including the hiring of additional controllers

if youre waiting for a mail delivery of 
illegal drugs beware the postman he may be delivering your arrest 
warrant 
with president bush placing a high priority on eliminating the 
scourge of drugs even the postal inspection service is getting 
into the act 
the service is making arrests on narcotics distribution charges 
at more than twice the rate of last year says inspector tom 
mcclure 
in fiscal 1988 we arrested 425 people for distributing 
narcotics through the mail mcclure said in the first six 
months of this fiscal year we have arrested 440 people 
among their recent finds were 8000 worth of pcp packed in baby 
food jars and mailed from los angeles to broken arrow okla and 
illicit steroids being distributed by two men in miami who were 
arrested april 17 officials said that case the result of a 
twoyear investigation by postal inspectors and the fbi was the 
largest illicit steroid ring ever busted 
there are 1800 postal inspectors of whom 800 do criminal 
investigations including mail fraud child pornography and internal 
theft mcclure said 
about 50 are assigned to focus on drugs but when a case comes 
along we draw on all the other people in the office well 
even bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the 
case calls for that 
unlike many agencies that announce their seizures and annual 
haul of illegal drugs with great fanfare the postal inspection 
service has remained relatively low key a question about exactly 
how many seizures were made and how much in illegal drugs was 
seized nationwide in the last fiscal year for example was a 
stumper 
well weve had 440 arrests this year but we may have had 
more seizures such as something being sent to a po box and no one 
ever picking it up mcclure said 
he noted that the postal inspection service which for the most 
part works off tips provided by other agencies generally doesnt 
make large seizures compared with other agencies due to the nature 
of the mails 
in a boat or a container ship or an airliner they can move 
tons in those kind of things he said in the mail you cant do 
that at least not in an individual package 
often the mailing of narcotics is not for distribution just 
for the personal use of the recipient he said 
private mail services such as united parcel service and federal 
express are not under the same scrutiny as the us mail spokesmen 
for both companies said they cooperate with federal and local 
authorities on drug investigations but neither would indicate 
exactly how often this has occurred or whether they instigated any 
of the probes 
the customs service is cooperating with the postal service on a 
program in which mail from 29 highrisk drug source countries is 
cleared at the port of arrival according to dennis shimkoski of 
customs 
this will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations 
eliminates potention monkey business he said 
already customs has seized record quantities of drugs at 21 
international mail branches in fiscal 1988 customs seized 164 
pounds of heroin 1600 pounds of opium and 1310 pounds of 
marijuana there were no significant amounts of cocaine mailed 
shimkoski said 
in the first half of fiscal 1989 customs seized 65 pounds of 
heroin 216 pounds of opium 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds of 
marijuana at the mail branches he said the numbers may appear to 
be low compared with the previous year but there tends to be a 
pickup when you get into the warmer months

the nuclear regulatory commission wants to 
know why a warning siren blared for 50 minutes near the three mile 
island nuclear plant on st patricks day frightening residents 
enough that some began to pack their belongings 
the siren was heard by residents of york pa late in the 
evening of march 17 11 days before the 10th anniversary of the 
nations worst commercial accident at the plant during the 
accident pregnant women and preschoolers had been advised to 
evacuate within five miles of the two reactors 
james r sutton said he his wife and two children thought it 
was an odd time for a test when they were awakened by the siren 
last month at 1120 pm it lasted until 1210 am and the couple 
said they could get no information from neighbors television and 
radio stations or the police on the reason why 
unless you were involved you cannot realize the anxiety and 
concern for the health of your family while the siren was sounding 
nor can you share my anger at not being able to find out what was 
happening sutton said in a march 23 letter to the nrcs advisory 
committee on reactor safeguards 
those 50 minutes seemed like hours to me my family and our 
neighbors he said some of the neighbors began to pack up and 
leave the area even after the siren stopped we had no idea if 
there was a problem 
the advisory panel said it considered suttons letter serious 
enough to warrant an investigation by the nrc staff and gpu 
nuclear the plant operator 
events of the type described in mr suttons letter reflect 
poorly on the industrys emergency planning efforts forrest 
remick chairman of the advisory panel said in a letter to the nrc 
on april 13 
three mile island officials are not sure why the alarm was 
sounded the sirens are maintained by the utility but are also 
used by york county officials for other local emergencies not 
related to the plant 
once it began the siren is supposed to be able to be shut off 
by remote control but when that failed on march 17 the utility 
had to call a contractor to drive to the site and shut it off by 
hand according to gpu nuclear spokeswoman mary wells 
fifty minutes when youre listening in the middle of the night 
is a long time wells said when youre us and you have to find 
out what the problem is its not that long im sure it was for 
him sutton 
the most frustrating thing sutton said monday in a telephone 
interview is that he and his neighbors followed emergency 
procedures by tuning to designated television and radio stations 
but still could get no information 
an nrc official looking into the incident recently told suttons 
wife that information was indeed available from one radio station 
but i guess we dont listen to them he said

government will have to curtail domestic farm 
production if the united states falls behind in world agriculture 
markets says the dean of agriculture at purdue university 
if were not competitive were talking about downsizing 
agriculture dr robert thompson told congress joint economic 
committee on monday 
international trade has arisen as one of the most important 
considerations for lawmakers working on the 1990 farm bill which 
will decide government policies for years to come 
jb penn vice president of sparks commodities inc told the 
committee that technology which was the issue of previous decades 
has successfully increased farm production 
future domestic demand will grow only slightly creating a need 
to pursue foreign markets he said 
former agriculture secretary bob bergland who now heads the 
national rural electric cooperative association said farm yields 
are increasing all over the world making other countries less 
dependent on the united states 
were not the lowest cost producer bergland said he said 
brazil produces soybeans cheaper than the united states and new 
zealand is the worlds most efficient dairy producer 
lawmakers are also looking into the export enhancement program 
which provides subsidies for us farm exports to make them less 
expensive abroad 
on monday at a conference for agriculture reporters rep dan 
glickman dkan said he believes the the office of management and 
budget has put eep on hold 
he said omb has refused to give its consent to any new sales 
under the program since the end of february 
glickman who chairs the house agriculture soybean and wheat 
subcommittee said president bush defended the importance of the 
export subsidy program during his campaign and agriculture 
secretary yeutter also has supported it the omb appears to be in 
conflict with the rest of the administration the congressman said 
the omb has scheduled a meeting to review the program but 
denies that it has suspended it 
last week sen robert kerrey dneb raised the same concern 
voiced by glickman and sent a letter to the omb saying there should 
be no further delays in eep sales a spokesman for kerreys office 
said monday the budget office had not responded 
both kerrey and glickman said the export enhancement program is 
essential to us strength at trade talks in geneva where american 
negotiators are trying to get countries around the world to remove 
or reduce subsidies on agricultural products

the supreme court will decide whether a 
federal judge may order local taxes to be raised in order to pay 
for racially balanced schools in the first desegregation case the 
court has heard for years 
the justices announced on monday they will rule on tax increases 
ordered by us district judge russell clark in kansas city mo 
the increases are designed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars 
to improve decaying predominantly black schools in the city 
the last time the court heard arguments and ruled on 
desegregation efforts was in 1982 in cases from seattle and los 
angeles 
in the kansas city case the court will hear an appeal by state 
officials that clark exceeded his authority 
the citys schools were segregated by missouri state law until 
1954 from 1954 to 1984 the percentage of black students in the 
city climbed from 225 to 677 percent 
clark ruled in 1987 that the school facilities had literally 
rotted and ordered them upgraded 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld most of clarks 
ruling last august 
the appeals court said there are still vestiges of the dual 
school system lingering in the city school district and the 
district and the state have not met their obligations to 
disestablish that system 
clark ordered creation of socalled magnet schools providing 
that by the 199192 school year every high school and middle school 
in the city and about half the elementary schools will offer 
distinctive areas of concentration such as foreign languages 
performing arts or math and science 
the judge also called for capital improvements costing some 260 
million to be completed by the fall of 1990 
to enable the city school district to pay its share of the 
desegregation plans costs the judge imposed a 15 percent income 
tax surcharge and raised school district property taxes to 4 per 
100 assessed valuation through the 199192 fiscal year 
state officials said the 4 per 100 levy represented a doubling 
of the local property tax 
clark ordered the tax increases because no money was available 
to finance the construction of new schools between 1970 and 1983 
school district voters had turned down six proposals to increase 
taxes for education 
he also authorized the school district to issue 150 million in 
20year capital improvement bonds 
the 8th circuit court upheld the property tax increase but 
struck down the income tax surcharge which had raised some 30 
million before being invalidated 
the state was ordered to pay 75 percent of the desegregation 
costs and the school district the remainer 
in other action monday the supreme court 
refused to intervene in the controversy over alar rejecting 
attempts to revive a lawsuit aimed at banning the chemical some say 
makes eating apples a health hazard the justices without comment 
turned down an appeal by ralph nader environmentalists and others 
who want alar off the market 
refused to lift a freeze on the assets of deposed philippine 
president ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda the court left 
intact a ruling that requires the marcoses to defend themselves in 
a lawsuit by the philippine government while barring them from 
transferring most of their alleged vast wealth 
left intact a 101 million refund the nations telephone 
companies were ordered to pay customers for excessive charges in 
1978 the court without comment rejected arguments that the 
federal communications commission overstepped its authority in 
ordering the refunds 
agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a 
convicted oklahoma killer whose jury was told to avoid any 
sympathy for the defendant when sentencing him

some officials in the bush administration say 
public confidence in the nations food system needs a lift 
cooper evans white house special assistant for agricultural 
affairs says a new interagency task force has been formed to 
examine our policies in this whole area of food safety and make 
recommendations for changes if any are needed 
evans a former republican congressman from iowa told a meeting 
of farm journalists on monday that the task force includes 
representatives of the environmental protection agency the food 
and drug administration and the agriculture department 
were going to take a good look at what were doing now and 
what we might be doing in the future to increase public 
confidence and to ensure that our programs remain the best 
evans said 
speaking earlier to the same group the national association of 
agricultural journalists agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
said that sensationalism and misleading news stories about food 
safety can hurt consumers when accurate information is needed most 
yeutter cited recent cases involving potential food supply 
hazards one of those was about chemicals such as alar used in 
apple production 
a recent study by a private environmental group the natural 
resources defense council suggested that children may be exposed 
to dangerous levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruits and 
vegetables because they eat large amounts in proportion to their 
weight 
the councils study singled out alar and alarms were raised 
throughout the country about the possible hazards of eating apples 
government regulatory agencies including the environmental 
protection agency food and drug administration and the agriculture 
department said there was no need to panic and that there was no 
reason for parents to keep apples from children 
we need to make sure that these volatile issues are handled as 
well as possible from a communications standpoint he said 
obviously we have freedom of the press in this country and the 
media can do what it wishes in this area just as it does in other 
areas 
yeutter added and if folks choose to provide coverage for 
misleading research studies or choose to distort or sensationalize 
theyre privileged to do so thats the price we pay for a 
democratic society 
in the meantime yeutter said he hoped we can do an effective 
job of keeping these issues in proper balance 
one reporter asked what yeutter meant by proper balance in 
news reports 
that means making sure that the facts are out and not simply 
someones distorted interpretation of what they read see or 
hear he said 
the agriculture department which sometimes in the past has been 
accused of sticking up for farm interests at the expense of 
consumers and environmentalists needs to have a spotless 
reputation on such sensitive issues yeutter said 
were going to play it straight in the department in these 
areas and i hope we can establish a reputation for credibility on 
all fronts he said if we say something about an alar 
stituation or we say something about any other food safety 
question my intent is that we do it in such a way that it will 
command the respect of everyone who views that issue or evaluates 
it in any way 
yeutter said he wants usda to have the respect of both sides 
of an issue 
in the case of alar and the natural resource defense councils 
report which triggered the apple scare yeutter said that great 
attention in the media was given to a study that had not been 
subjected to peer review he said the study had been superseded 
by other research which had been subjected to review 
none of that seemed to emerge in the media treatment of that 
issue in its initial stages and the result he said was 
sensationalism and a distortion of the facts

a rising price for the yen and an increase in 
wages have driven the cost of labor in japanese industry to 95 
percent of the us cost last year when reckoned in dollars 
according to the latest figures from the us bureau of labor 
statistics 
the average cost per hour was 1390 in the united states and 
1314 in japan 
low wages in japan were often cited in the past as a reason for 
japans ability to sell its goods in dollar terms the average 
cost of a worker was only half the cost in the united states as 
recently as 1985 since then the price of the yen has risen fast 
it took 238 yen to buy a dollar in 1985 last year the average 
price was only 128 yen 
costs are put in dollar terms so that they can be compared from 
one country to the next when the dollar cost of a countrys goods 
goes up as japans cost has done its goods become more expensive 
and in theory at least harder to sell on world markets compared 
with the goods of its competitors 
the dollar cost is the only one that people use when figuring 
how competitive a country is robert m dunn jr professor of 
economics at george washington university said in an interview 
monday 
in practice japan still sold 77 billion worth of goods last 
year beyond what it bought the united states had the opposite 
situation a trade deficit of more than 152 billion 
michael evans of evans economics inc who makes weekly 
worldwide forecasts from washington cited other figures from the 
labor department to show that japanese labor cost in the auto 
industry as still only 75 percent of the cost in the united states 
he saw that as a major reason for continued high us imports and 
low exports 
it is almost certain that the 1989 figures will show a further 
deterioration in our trade deficit he wrote in a comment on the 
labor department figures 
the amounts japanese employers pay for labor have been steadily 
increasing in japanese terms as well from an average of 904 yen an 
hour in 1975 then equal to only 305 to 1685 yen last year or 
1314 this translates into even greater purchasing power for 
japanese wageearners since japanese price rises have been smaller 
than in any other big industrial country 
writers have been pointing out recently that these increases 
still leave the standard of living low for many japanese compared 
with the united states and west european countries 
in west germany norway and switzerland labor costs were 30 
percent to 40 percent higher last year than in the united states 
they were 10 percent to 20 percent higher in belgium denmark 
finland the netherlands and sweden 
that should mean more exports and fewer imports for the united 
states though the dollar has been going up again this year said 
art nees in charge of international comparisons at the bureau of 
labor statistics 
but it takes time for the effects to show

the united states has rejected a plea by west 
germany to hold negotiations with the soviet union on reducing 
battlefield nuclear missiles and instead will proceed with work to 
improve the weapons 
the dispute which is causing strains within the nato alliance 
was aired for nearly four hours monday by highlevel west german 
and american delegations 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg then headed back to bonn to bring the 
bad news to chancellor helmut kohl 
kohls political future could be clouded by failure to persuade 
the americans to open negotiations with moscow on the usbuilt 
lance missiles 
the west german electorate is turning more toward disarmament 
and the leftleaning social democrats and greens are gaining ground 
in the polls against kohls own christian democrats local 
elections are being held in june 
before leaving for bonn however genscher and stoltenberg told 
german reporters the talks were encouraging they did not 
elaborate 
kohls formal presentation will be made in his governmental 
declaration to the west german parliament on thursday 
among the americans at the meeting secretary of state james a 
baker iii secretary of defense dick cheney and brent scowcroft 
the presidents assistant for national security affairs 
cheney made it clear before the meeting that the united states 
would oppose reducing shortrange nuclear missile strength while 
the soviets hold an advantage in nonnuclear forces in europe 
baker said through a spokeswoman he understood the federal 
republics problem regarding the timing of any such decision to 
modernize kohl also was seeking a delay in plans to extend the 
range of the lance missiles 
the meeting was hastily arranged friday when kohl called bush 
unless the issue is resolved it could disrupt the summit 
meeting bush will attend at the end of may with the leaders of the 
15 other north atlantic treaty organization countries in brussels 
kohls domestic concerns conflict with the determined drive by 
the united states britain and france to keep the lances on west 
german soil 
genscher and stoltenberg gave no indication as they left the 
state department whether they had made any headway 
baker issued a brief statement that described the meeting as 
useful and friendly he said the discussions would be continued 
in an effort to reach an agreement within the alliance 
secretary baker has said many times that it would be 
preferable if we could move to modernize our shortrange nuclear 
weapons although we understand the federal republics problem 
regarding the timing of any such decision state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said as the parties met and he has 
said that we think it would be a mistake to engage in arms control 
negotiations on snf shortrange nuclear forces 
cheney speaking at the national defense university before the 
meeting said negotiating at this point with the soviets over the 
missiles would be a mistake because of their overwhelming 
superiority in nonnuclear forces 
for the foreseeable future certainly as long as there is 
overwhelming soviet conventional superiority the defense 
secretary said theres absolutely no rationale at all for us to 
talk about eliminating or significantly reducing those shortrange 
forces 
cheney said the united states would proceed with early work 
to improve the lance missile system it does not require a firm 
commitment now or a specific decision now by a specific 
government he said 
opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenal 
of lances is an incentive to use them and that any nuclear 
conflict between east and west would spread to a worldthreatening 
war 
british prime minister margaret thatcher will fly to bonn on 
sunday to try to persuade kohl to suspend his campaign for 
ussoviet negotiations on the issue 
kohl has support among several of the smaller nato countries 
including norway belgium the netherlands and denmark

carriage drivers are raising a stink over a city 
plan to clean up the streets by putting horses in diapers 
the people proposing this dont know one end of a horse from 
the other said driver alan nugent 
sitting behind a gray beauty named rover nugent was one of more 
than 30 drivers who rode their carriages monday to a hearing to 
protest the plan 
drivers say the diapers reusable vinyl sacks strapped to a 
horses rear leak smell bad attract flies and bees and can 
cause sores and infections they also say all mares would have to 
be replaced because their anatomy cannot tolerate the diapers 
we feel its inhumane said carriage owner randy grill who 
testified at the hearing while drivers chanted clean up crime 
not horse manure 
the new york horse and carriage association pays 2000 a month 
to a private sanitation service to remove manure from central 
parks carriage routes grill said drivers would be willing to pay 
to double the cleanup effort if the city dropped the diaper idea 
dr fay smimmo a veterinarian consulting for the department of 
parks and recreation said the diapers shouldnt bother horses if 
adjusted properly many of the diapers are made by amish 
communities where horses are used everyday she said and special 
models are available for mares 
smimmo said diapers are used successfully by horses in montreal 
atlanta denver philadelphia and new orleans 
when i first heard about the diaper idea i thought what a 
stupid thing but then when i started talking to drivers around the 
country they said it works fine she said 
the diapers are scheduled to go into use may 1

privacy was hard to come by in their parking 
lot home but a brown killdeer successfully hatched a family in 
front of a group of birdwatchers 
decoy tactics by her mate drew little attention as those who had 
marveled at the nest witnessed the hatching of four eggs friday 
last month the killdeer and her mate spent about 10 days 
digging out their nest in the mobile home parking lot 
oversized trucks and mobile homes moved within feet of the nest 
but the mother did not abandon her duty unless the male took over 
although both parents shooed away curious humans the first two 
plumsized baby birds sneaked out and on wobbly legs scampered 
inches toward an onlooker 
last week she took off and he sat on the eggs awhile said 
tommy karr a birdwatcher and employee at sonshine homes where 
the birds hatched 
coworker james weekley added shell be glad when the baby 
birds are gone ill bet shell never come here again 
after the chicks hatched the killdeer family escaped to the 
edge of the parking lot karr said monday he said he has seen the 
parents but the babies are nowhere to be found 
the brown killdeer has orange markings and typically is a shore 
bird about 10 inches long it runs on long spindly legs and often 
nests in gravel

a former cia agent was indicted anew on 
charges he lied about helping the nicaraguan contras but a 
conspiracy allegation was omitted for apparently the same reason 
such an accusation was dropped against oliver l north 
six months after charges against joseph f fernandez were 
dismissed on a legal technicality a new indictment against the 
former station chief in costa rica was returned monday missing was 
the charge that he conspired to deliver arms to the contras when 
such aid was banned by congress 
the original conspiracy charge alleged that fernandez worked 
with former national security council aide oliver l north and arms 
dealer richard v secord to set up the covert armssupply network 
the new indictment focused on charges that fernandez lied to 
obstruct inquiries of the cias inspector general and the 
presidential commission headed by former sen john tower rtexas 
that investigated the irancontra affair 
james wieghart a spokesman for prosecutor lawrence walsh 
refused to comment on why the conspiracy charge was not contained 
in the new indictment 
but it appeared that walsh decided not to pursue that 
armsresupply allegation because it was fraught with the same 
secrecy concerns that forced him to drop similar charges against 
north 
earlier this year walsh dropped charges that north conspired 
with others to divert 15 million in usiran armssale profits to 
the nicaraguan rebels when the government refused to release secret 
documents the trial judge ruled were needed for norths defense 
a federal court jury in washington is deliberating on 12 related 
charges against north including allegations he lied to congress 
about the irancontra affair 
legal observers have considered the fernandez case even more 
laden with secrecy problems because his lawyers are expected to 
seek court approval to disclose details of his cia activities in 
central america where he used the alias tomas castillo 
walsh avoided those issues by obtaining a narrow indictment 
charging that fernandez lied when he denied he helped set up the 
airstrip in northern costa rica for the resupply operation and said 
he did not know that north was involved in the effort 
fernandez is also accused of lying to the cia by stating that 
the airstrip was built by the costa rican government to train 
pilots for a possible nicaraguan invasion of costa rica 
each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum 
fiveyear sentence and a 250000 fine upon conviction 
the original fivecount indictment brought in washington was 
dismissed oct 19 after a judge ruled the charges should have been 
brought in virginia because fernandez was questioned at cia 
headquarters in langley va just across the potomac river 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr gave walsh the option 
of bringing the charges again in federal court in alexandria 
fernandez is to appear there may 1 for arraignment before us 
district judge albert v bryan jr

police arrested 58 flagwaving 
sloganchanting animal rights activists after they blocked traffic 
in a busy intersection and forced open a door at the national 
institutes of health 
this is the first step in voicing your opinion and letting it 
be known that people are opposed to this kind of cruelty to 
animals said zakki jewad 25 of silver spring md 
organizers said the aim of the demonstration in this washington 
dc suburb was to kick off a week of civil disobedience and 
rallies at research centers and universities nationwide 
were protesting the murders of millions of animals in 
research laboratories every year said lee warren 61 of 
baltimore who came to mondays rally toting a sign and dressed in 
a fulllength black cape and hood to represent death 
during the demonstration about 200 activists gathered on nihs 
grassy lawn for speeches and vegetarian lunches nih was targeted 
for the demonstration because it is the largest funding source for 
animal research protesters said 
police arrested 37 activists after they linked hands and blocked 
traffic on a busy street for about 30 minutes officers dragged 
many across the road to allow traffic to get by they were charged 
with disobeying a police officer and were released at the scene 
according to montgomery county police 
following the arrests the protesters proceeded to nihs main 
administration building where they began to pound on doors and 
windows of the facility one of the doors broke open and police 
arrested 21 of the protestors and charged them with trespassing 
some also were charged with breaking and entering according to nih 
officials 
i really feared for the safety of the building said dr 
william raub nih deputy director that group was absolutely out 
of control 
ginger redmon who said she had been arrested in two other 
animal rights protests said the civil disobedience shows we have 
a strong commitment 
raub denied that animals were mistreated at nih its a 
fabricated story from start to finish he said theres no 
basis for that claim 
to defend their research medical and scientific experimenters 
plan to use this week to speak out in support of the use of animals 
in medical research pointing to the medical breakthroughs such 
research has brought from coronary bypass surgery to cataract 
removal from vaccines to antibiotics 
theres no such thing as anybody not having received some 
benefit from animal research said frankie trull president of 
the foundation for biomedical research a nonprofit group that 
supports animal research 
animal research defenders also say most laboratory experiments 
arent painful and about 90 percent of the animals used in such 
research are rodents bred specifically for lab experimentation 
but ingrid newkirk director of people for the ethical treatment 
of animals said too much money goes toward unnecessary animal 
research 
she estimated that the federal government spends as much as 6 
billion a year on research using animals and said the same results 
could be derived in ways that dont harm or kill animals 
when it comes to feelings they scientists believe that a 
rat is nothing more than a test tube newkirk said

the social security old age and disability 
trust funds are financially sound and should be able to pay 
benefits until nearly the middle of the next century according to 
a report to congress 
the report by the trustees of the social security system 
projected that income to the old age and survivors and disability 
insurance trust funds will exceed benefits paid out for the next 
three decades 
after that the combined trust funds will run a deficit until 
funds are exhausted in 2046 
however the expected accumulation of the trust funds during 
the next 20 to 30 years provides ample time to monitor the 
financial status of the program and to take corrective action at 
some time in the future the report said 
the report was signed by members of social securitys board of 
trustees which includes treasury secretary nicholas brady labor 
secretary elizabeth dole health secretary louis sullivan and 
social security commissioner dorcas hardy 
in this calendar year the two funds combined will take in about 
294 billion and will pay out about 236 billion about 130 million 
workers will be covered by the program this year 
the assets of the funds increased by 41 billion in calendar 
year 1988 from the previous year in part because of the growth in 
the nations economy the report said 
based on intermediate economic and demographic assumptions the 
combined trust funds are expected to swell to a level about five or 
six times the annual amount paid in benefits in the next 20 to 30 
years the report said 
under the worst conditions combined funds would be expected to 
increase to about twoandahalf times annual payout during the 
next 20 to 25 years the report said however the report said 
financial problems could occur within the next 10 years in the 
disability insurance trust fund under these conditions 
the old age and survivors insurance program pays benefits after 
a worker retires and to survivors after a worker dies disability 
insurance pays benefits after a worker becomes disabled

president bush seems eager to look to the long 
road ahead as he rounds out 100 days in office pledging to use 
the next several weeks to complete a detailed foreign policy 
review draft environmental legislation and intensify his war on 
drugs 
in all that he does bush pledged monday in a speech at the 
annual meeting of the associated press he intends to work closely 
with congress i think the work weve done these past three 
months demonstrates the value of tough principled negotiation 
with the democratic majorities of the house and senate he told 
newspaper publishers gathered for the session 
bushs speech was the final act of rare backtoback appearances 
by the president and vice president 
vice president dan quayle who spoke to the ap meeting two hours 
earlier said the biggest surprise of his first 100 days in 
national office was the enjoyment he receives from foreign travel 
and participating in foreign policy discussions 
quayle who is off on a long trip to australia and asia noted 
that as a senator most of his travel was back and forth between 
washington and his home state of indiana 
in his remarks bush pledged he would follow every 
intelligence lead in attempts to secure freedom for ap middle 
eastern correspondent terry anderson anderson has been held 
captive for more than four years since being abducted in beirut 
the president told his audience he wasnt able to give you any 
good news about the prospects for andersons release but he 
said we will go the extra mile and do everything we can 
bush summarized his first 100 days in office which end on 
saturday by saying he is off to a good start and theres 
more to come 
so while im pleased with all weve accomplished in these 
three months theres a long road ahead of us he said 
im optimistic that our reforms will produce lasting results 
that the longrange planning we do today will pay off in the 
future 
bush identified several key issues as being on the near 
horizon 
they include completion of a defense and foreign policy review 
which will include decisions on arms control that presumably will 
pave the way for the next round of negotiations with the soviet 
union 
we are mapping strategies for a period of remarkable change in 
international affairs he said change more wideranging and 
rapid than at any time in the postwar period 
bush did not mention recent complaints from soviet officials 
that his new administration is missing an opportunity for progress 
by moving too slowly to address arms control and other ussoviet 
issues instead he said secretary of state james baker has met 
with soviet leader eduard shevardnadze and will do so again next 
month 
also on bushs list for the immediate future are legislation to 
strengthen the clean air act attack homelessness and curb the 
increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers he said 
summarizing his first 100 days as president bush cited 
agreements with congress on a deficitreduction package that avoids 
tax increases and on providing nonlethal aid to the contra rebels 
he also ticked off several proposals he has made including 
legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry and to 
strengthen ethics in government 
in addition he said his crackdown on drugs had begun with a 
firstofitskind attack on the problems in washington dc and the 
decision to ban the import of certain types of semiautomatic 
weapons 
he also took credit for legislation to restrict the export of 
hazardous wastes and said he has launched an initiative to deal 
with the debt owed to developed nations by the third world 
most of quayles ap speech was devoted to looking ahead to his 
asian and australian trip including a pledge to maintain the 
united states as a great pacific power 
the vice president fielded questions after his prepared speech 
and said his first three months in office have given him a closeup 
view of the office of the presidency 
i work every day in close quarters with president bush he 
said i see how he formulates his policies im there to give my 
opinion

a second effort to impose a youth curfew as 
part of an effort to curb the drug trade in the district of 
columbia again failed to pass constitutional muster in a federal 
court 
hours before it was to take effect late monday us district 
judge charles h richey blocked enforcement of the curfew for at 
least 10 days pending a further hearing 
there are serious first fourth and fifth amendment concerns 
raised in this issue richey said mentioning the constitutional 
safeguards of the right of assembly reasonable search and seizures 
and due process 
the bill which would have required people under age 18 to be 
off the citys streets sidewalks and other public spaces by 11 
pm sunday through thursday and midnight friday and saturday with 
some exceptions was to have taken effect for 90 days at 11 pm 
monday 
the dc council had approved the curfew april 4 amending a 
broader bill struck down by richey on march 20 
arthur b spitzer legal director for the american civil 
liberties union argued that no curfew could prevent youths from 
becoming involved with drugs and crime 
its absurd to think a youngster whos out dealing drugs and 
carrying a gun is going to go home and go to bed when the clock 
strikes 11 said spitzer who represents 15 plaintiffs 
spitzer said the curfew bill discriminates against poorer 
juveniles and defines the word parent too strictly ruling out 
other adult relatives or friends spitzer pointed out that 
employers not employees are required by law to possess youths 
work permits 
assistant corporation counsel victor long told richey the dc 
council adopted the least restrictive measure it could to 
tackle juvenile crime the law would not infringe on constitutional 
rights he said but rather would place reasonable restraints 
for a valid reason he said 
under the law police would take violators to the nearest police 
station and call their parents the first violation would not 
result in a fine but parents would be fined 100 for the second 
curfew violation and 300 for all subsequent violations 
the exceptions in the amended bill include minors accompanied by 
a parent returning home from an activity sponsored by a church 
school or nonprofit organization traveling in a motor vehicle 
employed during curfew hours or on an emergency errand 
only one federal court has upheld a curfew bill in middletown 
pa in 1975 according to spitzer since then federal courts have 
struck down curfew laws three times

the army has grounded its entire fleet of 
vietnam era uh1 huey transport helicopters for a safety inspection 
of main rotor bolts 
the service said the grounding order was issued late friday and 
was keeping about 3100 choppers on the ground 
lt col john reitz an army spokesman said the grounding order 
was prompted by an incident last week in which a huey was being 
moved manually across a tarmac and two of the bolts in the main 
rotor pillow block suddenly snapped 
he said that further inspection showed cracks and stress 
corrosion in the bolts 
in this case there was no accident and no loss of life 
reitz said but you would have a big problem if this happened in 
flight so a grounding order was issued immediately to ensure 
safety 
the bolts at issue sit atop the main rotor hub and help hold the 
main rotor blades to the shaft

acting president manuel solis palma 
has accused the united states of secretly giving 10 million to 
opponents of gen manuel antonio noriega as part of a plan to 
retain control of the panama canal 
solis palma said monday that panamanian traitors were 
conspiring to renege on the 1977 treaties under which control of 
the vital waterway is to be ceded to panama in the year 2000 
noriega head of the defense forces and panamas de facto ruler 
accused the united states of playing a dirty game he told a 
news conference that the men who speak of democracy have dirtied 
their hands 
the panamanian people and it is important that the united 
states know this and that president bush not be deceived are 
supremely angered 
the united states has been at odds with noriega once a strong 
ally since last year when a us grand jury indicted him on 
charges of drug trafficking and money laundering 
us news and world report said in its may 1 issue that 
president bush has signed a secret intelligence directive to give 
10 million to the panamanian opposition it says the money was to 
be used for printing advertising transportation and 
communications for opposition candidates in may 7 elections 
white house officials have refused to comment on the report 
saying it involves covert operations 
attorney guillermo endara who is running against noriegabacked 
presidential candidate carlos duque on monday denied receiving any 
campaign funds from the united states 
we havent asked for or received nor are we going to receive 
cent from foreigners nor from the united states nor from any other 
power endara said in a television appearance all the money we 
have used in this campaign has been panamanian money and we would 
not accept any foreign money

vote in which panamanians will choose a new president two vice 
presidents 67 legislators and 510 local representatives 
endara has called the election a plebiscite on noriegas de 
facto rule

last year the reagan administration set in motion a plan to 
oust noriega the new york times reported monday that if that 
approached failed the administration wanted to organize a coup 
the senate intelligence committee rejected the coup plan 
however on grounds that noriega might be assassinated the times

assassinations 
last spring the united states imposed economic sanctions 
against panama in an attempt to force out noriega 
bush this month extended the sanctions which include sharp 
restrictions on us companies that do business in panama a hold 
on assets of the panamanian government in the united states and a 
prohibition on tax payments by us organizations to panama

police chief maurice t turner is retiring 
amid growing notoriety of the district of columbia as a drug and 
murder capital as well as continuing conflict with mayor marion s 
barry published reports say 
turner a 32year veteran of the force whom barry had appointed 
chief in 1981 submitted his retirement papers and will step down 
july 31 the washington post and the washington times reported in 
todays editions 
ive been thinking about it a while turner told the times 
i guess youve got to go when the environment is right 
turner declined to comment on reports that he may take a 
position with the office of national drug policy director william 
j bennett the times said the post reported that asstistant chief 
isaac fulwood the departments secondranking official will be 
named to succeed turner in running the 3990member force 
the times said turner did not rule out the possibility he might 
run for mayor well im still playing it by ear he said 
some people are asking me to run for mayor but i just dont 
want to say publicly right now 
turner had been increasingly at odds with barry over the past 
few months according to the reports 
the times quoted a source close to turner as saying the chief 
feared his years of service would be tarnished by controversy 
surrounding barry 
one source of friction was barrys attempt to call police 
officials to learn the results of an internal department inquiry 
into the handling of barrys visit to a friend at a downtown hotel 
room the post said the friend charles lewis has since been 
indicted on drug charges 
a police investigation of a drug complaint at the hotel room 
last december was abruptly halted when police learned that barry 
was in the room according to reports 
the two also feuded over increasing the size of the force a 
move that barry opposed the post said 
in a statement issued by his office monday night barry praised 
turner for his illustrious and distinguished career and said he 
is respected both locally and nationally

afghanistans foreign minister has told 
the security council that his government will retaliate against 
pakistan unless that country stops supporting the guerrillas trying 
to overthrow the kabul regime 
if the security council fails to adopt necessary measures for 
defusing the present tense situation and if pakistani aggression 
and intervention against our contry is continued we will have no 
choice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country the 
envoy abdul wakil said monday 
in a 90minute speech the foreign minister said pakistan was as 
vulnerable to rocket attacks as afghanistan which has been 
bombarded by rockets transported across the afghanpakistan border 
he also charged that the guerrilla assault on the afghan city of 
jalalabad was being organized armed and financed by pakistan with 
help from the cia 
pakistan the united states saudi arabia and china are among 
major supporters and arms suppliers of the insurgents who began 
fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
pakistan also serves as headquarters for seven guerrilla groups 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to back the 
government and completed their withdrawal feb 15 under 
unmediated accords moscow continues to supply the afghan army 
in the un accords afghanistan and pakistan pledged not to 
intervene in each others affairs the kabul government and the 
soviet union insist that pakistan is violating the agreement and 
want the united nations to take measures to end the alleged 
violations 
the guerrillas laid siege to jalalabad on march 6 in their first 
major offensive following the soviet troop withdrawal capturing it 
would give them a base for the exile government they formed in 
pakistan two months ago and help them gain momentum for an attack 
on kabul the capital 75 miles to the east 
jalalabad is about 45 miles west of the pakistan frontier 
guerrilla leaders initially predicted jalalabad would fall 
within days but the afghan army is equipped with sophisticated 
soviet weapons and has repulsed the insurgents rocket and 
artillery attacks

when noboru takeshita took office as prime 
minister skeptics doubted that the man known for his cautious 
backroom political style would be able to create a commanding role 
for japan on the international stage 
ironically he proved successful at his diplomatic efforts but 
it was his main strength fundraising for the governing liberal 
democratic party that brought him down after only 18 months on 
the job 
in announcing today that he intended to resign as japans 46th 
prime minister takeshita took responsibility for a scandal that 
made the countrys japans least popular prime minister since world 
war ii according to polls 
takeshita 65 took over as prime minister from the charismatic 
yasuhiro nakasone in november 1987 
within two months of taking office he had visited the united 
states and established a firstname relationship with former 
president reagan he traveled frequently to other countries 
under takeshitas leadership japan surpassed the united states 
as the worlds biggest foreign aid donor to developing countries 
it also earned new respect as a contributor to diplomatic efforts 
takeshita also played busy host to dignitaries from 164 nations 
in february at the state funeral for emperor hirohito an 
unprecedented gathering of world leaders 
but his popularity sagged among the japanese with increasing 
revelations that he and members of his cabinet had accepted 
bargainpriced stocks and other donations from the recruit co an 
information conglomerate that allegedly attempted to buy government 
influence 
takeshita acknowledged receiving more than 1 million from 
recruit he also confirmed that he borrowed about 381700 from the 
company in 1987 and repaid the money a few months later 
recruit was a major donor to takeshitas fundraising parties 
party tickets are an important tool in raising the money needed to 
gain and maintain office in japan 
takeshita was partly motivated to resign out of fear his term 
would be remembered for nothing but the recruit scandal said 
yotaro konaka a political analyst 
konaka said the prime minister did not want to see the liberal 
democratic party lose its 35year hold on the nations parliament 
in summer elections or watch his newly implemented and highly 
unpopular tax reform program be canceled 
other than the emperors funeral he must have realized that 
the tax reform was his only domestic achievement konaka said 
if the tax reform is erased it will make him a prime minister 
with no achievement whatsoever 
the eldest son of a ricewine brewing family takeshita was born 
feb 26 1924 in a village in western japan after serving as a 
pilot trainee at the end of world war ii he completed his 
university studies taught english and social studies for several 
years and then turned to politics 
he was elected to his local state assembly at 27 and then won a 
seat in the powerful lower house of the parliament in 1958 at age 
34 
his political skills gained him key posts he became finance 
minister in 1979 under prime minister masayoshi ohira and continued 
to hold that high post under nakasones administration

two palestinians who are 
american citizens have become entangled in israels military 
justice system and one disappeared after answering a summons to an 
army headuarters 
relatives of jafer hamayel 25 said he complied with the army 
summons on april 13 and they have since been unable to locate him 
the other american 16yearold mansour abdallah was accused of 
throwing stones and has been held for three months without bail and 
without appearing in court his lawyer said 
human rights activists say hamayel and abdallah are among 
thousands of palestinians who are being denied basic legal rights 
under military justice in effect in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
army officials deny the allegations saying the military has set 
up a special office to help lawyers find clients and that bail has 
been granted in hundreds of cases 
we believe we have a liberal judicial system in the 
territories but we should not be judged in the same context as 
western countries that are not in a state of war an army 
official said earlier this year 
in the cases of hamayel and abdallah both of whom had lived in 
puerto rico the army was unable to locate either one even after 
being given details three days earlier by the associated press 
an army official who could not be identified under military 
regulations said he could not locate them because he did not have 
israeliissued identification numbers for them 
palestinian lawyer jonathan kuttab said abdallah has only a us 
passport and not an israeli identity card hamayels relatives said 
he had his israeli card with him when he disappeared and they did 
not know the number 
hamayel was born in kufr malik a mountain village known for its 
resistance to israeli occupation 
on a visit monday to the village 15 miles north of jerusalem 
palestine liberation organization slogans palestinian flags and a 
poster of plo chief yasser arafat adorned the main square 
hamayel left kufr malik in 1983 after being imprisoned for three 
months on charges of violating israeli law by raising palestinian 
flags said his uncle ata hamayel 39 
he said jafer hamayel then lived for six years in san juan 
puerto rico joining his parents who went to the caribbean island 
in 1966 and now own a clothing store 
the uncle said the young man had studied accounting at puerto 
ricos interamerican university 
ata hamayel gave this account of his nephews disappearance 
several months ago jafer hamayel became a us citizen on april 
4 he returned to kufr malik to renew his israeliissued identity 
card without the card he would lose the right to live in the west 
bank 
shortly after his arrival he was given a summons to appear at 
the military headquarters in ramallah and went there april 13 
later that day a ramallah man saw jafer hamayel being held in a 
tent jail at the headquarters but the family has not seen him since 
and has not been notified by the army of his fate 
ata hamayel said us consular officials were refused permission 
to see his nephew at the ramallah headquarters 
us consulate spokesman david good said efforts were made to 
find jafer hamayel but we havent been able to make contact with 
him yet good refused to discuss details of the case 
ahmed sayyad abdallahs lawyer said the youth was arrested 
jan 23 in his native west bank village of surda on charges of 
throwing stones and setting up road barricades 
sayyad said military officials failed to present abdallah at 
court hearings march 19 and march 30 and have not responded to a 
request that the youth be released on bail 
the lawyer said another court hearing is scheduled for sunday 
good said consular officials visited abdallah on march 24 and 
are trying to get him released on bail he said abdallah and 
hamayel are the only two palestinianamericans being held under 
military detention 
good said he did know how many american citizens have been 
arrested since the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 in 
the west bank and gaza strip but added we never had more than 
three or four at a time 
about 7000 palestinians with us passports live in the west 
bank and israeliannexed arab east jerusalem according to good he 
said only a few live in the gaza strip 
army officials say at least 20000 palestinians have been 
arrested during the uprising which has claimed the lives of 444 
palestinians and 18 israelis 
army figures showed 6650 palestinians were being detained as of 
early april with 3627 awaiting trial 1187 held under emergency 
laws that require no charges or trial 974 awaiting sentencing and 
862 serving sentences

richard m daley put a hand on an old family 
bible looked into the eyes of an old family friend and took the 
oath of mayor a job his late father held for 21 years 
but in orchestra hall surrounded by many state and local 
officials whose careers started with the blessing of chicago boss 
richard j daley the new mayor said his administration would not 
resemble his fathers vaunted army of loyal foot soldiers 
business as usual is a prescription for failure he said 
monday after he took the oath on his 47th birthday noting that his 
father instilled him with values but policies will be his own 
the old ways of doing business simply arent adequate to cope 
with the new challenges we face daley said 
daley said city hall will be open to all a pledge that 
produced optimism among his black election opponents and their 
supporters chicago is the largest us city to replace a black 
mayor with a white 
he appears to be using a reconciling approach as opposed to a 
polarizing approach and that is good said jesse jackson who 
supported two blacks and had warned during the campaign that 
chicago would return to the machine politics that marked the elder 
daleys reign 
daley was sworn in by us district judge abraham lincoln 
marovitz a family friend who presided at the elder daleys six 
inaugurations 
this is a sentimental journey for me said the 83yearold 
judge 
the new mayor delivered an upbeat speech mentioning few 
specific goals but acknowledging that the citys school system 
labeled the worst in the nation by president reagans education 
secretary william bennett needs an overhaul 
today our foundation is crumbling and nothing but genuine 
school reform will repair it daley said 
the former cook county prosecutor was elected april 4 to 
complete the last two years of the second term of the late harold 
washington chicagos first black mayor daley succeeds eugene 
sawyer who had been acting mayor since washingtons death 17 
months ago 
daley defeated sawyer who is black in the democratic primary 
feb 28 and then defeated black alderman timothy evans and 
republican edward vrdolyak in the general election 
washingtons first election in 1983 led to a few years of bitter 
debate in city council with a white majority blocking his 
programs evans predicted that black aldermen would not act as 
obstructionists during daleys term 
wherever he daley is correct were going to move right 
along with him evans said but if aldermen disagree with the 
mayor they will protect the gains of this community

a chunk of ice the size of a volleyball 
crashed through the roof of a house during a thunderstorm and a 
meteorologist said it may have come from an airplane 
you can safely say it was related to the thunderstorm but i 
dont think it fell out of the sky by itself said ted buehner 
meteorologist for the national weather service office at portland 
international airport it had to have some kind of assistance 
most likely the ice accumulated on the wing of a plane and then 
fell off buehner said but he checked with the control tower and 
was told there had been no reports of abnormal ice buildup 
the ice smashed through the roof into a bedroom of a house owned 
by duane and joan cline as cline was reading the newspaper in his 
living room monday night 
cline said when he first heard the noise he thought a car had 
crashed into his house as one did a few years ago 
but then he looked into the spare bedroom and saw a footlong 
hole in the ceiling with plaster wood and roof material scattered 
with ice on the floor the ice apparently had broken into about 20 
pieces with the largest about the size of a softball he said 
cline said he planned to store the ice in his freezer and may 
have it tested

henry g parks jr who founded parks sausage 
co the first blackowned business to raise money with a public 
sale of stock has died after a long illness he was 72 
parks who began to suffer from parkinsons disease in the 
mid1970s died early monday at the meridian multimedical nursing 
center in towson hospital officials said 
baltimorebased parks sausage makes scrapple sausage and other 
meat products for sale in stores from massachusetts to virginia 
the companys slogan more parks sausages mom is well known 
throughout the northeast 
parks founded the company in 1951 in an abandoned dairy in 
baltimore he took it public in 1969 
thats so significant said raymond v haysbert the current 
chairman of parks sausage public financing of companies is what 
america is all about underlining that achievement is that only 
three or four other black firms have followed parks into public 
financing since 1969 
parks sausage was one of the largest blackowned companies in 
the nation when parks sold his interest in it in 1977 for 158 
million 
parks also served on the baltimore city council from 1963 
through 1969 and pushed bills opening public accommodations to 
blacks and easing bail requirements for people accused of crimes 
he was not a civil rights person in the confrontational 
sense haysbert said but he worked behind the scenes to 
convince powerful people of the illogic of racism 
i think that i proved that black businessmen not only can be 
successful but that they can be successful on the same terms as 
anybody else parks once said 
parks was born in atlanta and grew up in dayton ohio he said 
he became interested in business while studying at ohio state 
university at the university he roomed with olympic sprinter 
jesse owens became the first black on the schools swim team and 
was the only black in his marketing classes 
parks also sat on the corporate boards of magnavox first penn 
corp warner lambert co wr grace co and others 
survivors include two daughters a sister and three

a pudgy superhacker who agreed to plead 
guilty and spend a year in prison for computer fraud must stand 
trial after all because a judge thinks the proposed sentence isnt 
harsh enough 
us district judge mariana pfaelzer surprised kevin david 
mitnick his defense attorney and a prosecutor by rejecting their 
plea agreement on monday and ordering mitnick to trial 
you have been engaged in this activity for far too long and no 
one has adequately punished you the judge told the defendant 
citing two previous convictions for computer fraud in 1981 and 1987 
this is the last time you are going to do this 
the judge suggested the 25yearold mitnick remains a danger and 
rejected a prosecutors belated claim that mitnick didnt destroy 
anything of value 
mitnick clad in a blue prison uniform appeared stunned by the 
rejection outside court defense lawyer alan rubin expressed 
disappointment and said the judges action took him by surprise 
she obviously considers him a far greater menace than i do or 
the government does he said rubin said it was unlikely mitnick 
would agree to any new bargain involving a longer sentence 
when the case began last december prosecutors portrayed mitnick 
as a brilliant youth obsessed with junk food and computers who used 
the code name condor to infiltrate computer systems in the 
united states and england 
they suggested he might have gained access to top secret 
national security agency computers but such charges were never 
brought last month they agreed to a plea bargain 
under his plea mitnick had admitted he infiltrated digital 
equipment corps computer system and stole one of its programs he 
also admitted stealing 16 mci telephone codes and using them to 
make longdistance calls for free 
the prosecution had agreed to dismiss two additional charges 
one of which alleged mitnick infiltrated the computer system of 
leeds university in england if mitnick stands trial those charges 
would be reinstated 
assistant us attorney james sanders told the judge he had 
thought long and hard before entering the agreement and 
concluded that mitnicks actions werent seriously destructive 
this is not a case where mr mitnick destroyed anyones 
computer or inserted viruses in a computer he told the judge 
he also noted that the government would have to grant immunity 
to an alleged coconspirator leonard dicicco to obtain his 
testimony against mitnick 
but pfaelzer was unmoved 
i dont think a year is long enough and im not going to 
honor the agreement she said a pretrial report recommended a 
higher sentence she noted

amnesty international which opposes capital 
punishment in all circumstances said today that the use of the 
death penalty in the united states appears arbitrary and biased 
against blacks and hispanics 
in a 268page worldwide report titled when the state kills 
the human rights group condemned the use of the death penalty as a 
judicial lottery that does not deter crime 
the united states and 99 other countries execute people for 
crimes 
despite a range of safeguards the use of the death penalty in 
the usa appears to be arbitrary and racially biased amnesty 
international said in the reports introduction 
the londonbased group which won the nobel peace prize in 1977 
criticized america for executing convicts for crimes committed when 
they were juveniles 
in june 1988 30 prisoners in 14 states were under sentence of 
death for crimes committed when they were under age 18 this is 
permitted by 25 states the report said 
as of may 1988 2048 prisoners were under the death sentence in 
35 states according to the report ninetyeight prisoners were 
executed from 1977 to may 31 1988 including three juveniles two 
in texas and one in south carolina 
the report mentioned the case of james terry roach he pleaded 
guilty in 1977 when he was 17 to two murders sexual assault 
kidnapping and other charges and was executed in south carolina on 
jan 10 1986 
amnesty said there are regional disparities in the numbers of 
death sentences four states florida georgia louisiana and 
texas have accounted for more than threequarters of all 
executions since 1977 the report said 
jury selection procedures in most states allow prosecutors to 
exclude committed opponents of the death penalty from sitting as 
jurors studies have indicated that this practice has created 
deathprone juries according to the report 
it said black defendants especially in southern states have 
often been convicted by allwhite juries after prosecutors have 
excluded black prospective jurors 
blacks comprise 12 percent of the national population but 41 
percent of prisoners under sentence of death the report said 
the evidence suggests that race especially that of the 
victim has an important bearing on the likelihood of a death 
sentence being imposed especially in the southern states although 
blacks and whites are the victims of homicide in almost equal 
numbers most offenders who are sentenced to death are convicted of 
murdering whites 
this was the case in 86 percent of trials in 1987 it said 
between january 1977 and may 1988 according to amnestys report 
45 of the 98 people executed were black or hispanic and 84 were 
convicted of killing white victims the report said 
it cited the cases of willie jasper darden in florida and edward 
earl johnson in mississippi as two since 1985 in which evidence 
emerged after the executions that strongly suggested innocence 
amnesty international also finds deficiencies in legal aid 
available to capital defendants the lawyers often are 
inexperienced illequipped to handle such cases and severely 
limited in their resources it said 
most states do not provide legal representation for capital 
defendants after appeal to state supreme courts so in order to 
file further appeals on constitutional grounds they must rely on 
volunteer lawyers working without payment the report said 
many prisoners awaiting execution may be mentally ill or 
mentally handicapped it argued and said at least six such 
prisoners have been executed since 1984 
the report cites a 1987 study saying 349 people convicted of 
capital offenses between 1900 and 1985 turned out to be innocent 
and 23 of those people were executed

a plan to make the citys government 
constitutional by expanding the city council and setting up a new 
commission drew good reviews from the mayor but was panned by 
presidents of the five boroughs 
frederick ao schwarz chairman of the charter revision 
commission outlined proposals monday that would give the mayor 
more direct control over awarding contracts previously the domain 
of the powerful board of estimate the mayor would be required to 
submit his plans to communities for review though 
the proposals also would increase the city council to 50 members 
from 35 and create a new commission to oversee cityowned land 
rule on zoning changes and award city franchises also currently 
the boards province 
the mayor would appoint four of the 11 commission members 
the plan comes one month after the us supreme court ruled that 
the board of estimate was unconstitutional because it violated the 
oneperson onevote doctrine schwarz said he hoped his plan would 
provide fair representation for all new yorkers 
staten island the citys smallest borough with about 400000 
residents has the same presence on the board as the other four 
boroughs including brooklyn with 22 million residents 
staten island borough president ralph lamberti said the 
proposals are a disaster for staten island and all local 
communities it makes the authority of the mayor almost czarlike 
brooklyn borough president howard golden said schwarz is 
telling the boroughs to drop dead 
but schwarz said the plan would give borough leaders more say 
over land use budget formulation and budget oversight 
mayor edward i koch and city comptroller harrison goldin were 
generally pleased by the proposals 
the principles that the chairman lays out in his report would 
seem to be quite positive said mayoral spokesman clifford chanin 
under the plan the comptroller no longer would be involved in 
policy and would be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and 
audit functions on contracts 
the comptrollers role has always been overwhelmingly 
fiscal goldin said this recognizes that reality 
the charter revision commission which was created by the mayor 
has set a goal of getting a proposal for governmental change on the 
november ballot 
the chairmans proposals are the first formal agenda on which 
the 15member commission can debate they arent final

today as a court sentenced her to death for the 1987 bombing of a 
south korean airliner in which 115 people were killed 
officials said they expect 27yearold kim hyon hui to be 
pardoned 
ms kim shook with grief as judge chung sanghwak pronounced her 
guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and 
sentenced her to die by hanging she said nothing before being 
whisked away by security agents 
relatives of the victims sat quietly as chung said there was no 
doubt that ms kim was guilty of planting a bomb aboard a korea air 
boeing 707 that disappeared on nov 29 1987 over the andaman sea 
as it approached the burmese coast the plane was en route to seoul 
from baghdad iraq 
ms kim confessed on south korean television in january 1988 
that she planted the bomb as part of a plot by senior leaders of 
communist north korea to disrupt the olympic games held 
successfully in seoul last summer 
she said at a hearing on april 4 that she wanted to die to atone 
for the deaths 
she has a week to appeal the sentence but defense lawyers said 
no decision had been made on the matter 
south korean officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
ms kim was expected to be pardoned on grounds she was duped by 
communist north korea and has repented 
north korea has denied it had anything to do with the plane 
bombing and has claimed it was engineered by south korea to 
embarrass the north 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the 
peninsula at the end of world war ii 
judge chung who headed the threejudge panel hearing the case 
said the destruction of the plane underlined the threat the north 
poses to south koreas freedom and survival 
we have an enemy which always tries to our destroy liberal 
democratic system we must face that reality with resolute 
determination he said in a 13minute statement 
the sentencing came after three hearings during which ms kim 
often sobbed into a hankerchief as she listened to testimony that 
the plane exploded in less than a second killing all aboard 
instantly the bodies were never recovered 
ms kim arrived at the courthouse today under heavy security and 
hundreds of police surrounded the building to prevent protests by 
angry relatives or a possible threat from north korean agents 
relatives of the victims disrupted the earlier proceedings and 
often yelled kill her 
they were silent today as chung read the verdict and gathered in 
small groups outside afterward some relatives expressed 
satisfaction with the death sentence but others urged mercy 
ms kim said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be 
japanese tourists planted the bomb disguised as a radio and a 
liquor bottle when they flew from baghdad to abu dhabi where they 
got off 
the pair were arrested a short time later in bahrain and 
attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes the other agent an

george bushs first major domestic trip 
as president is off to a rocky start and there are more pitfalls on 
the horizon of his hectic fourday journey across america 
the presidents travels through virginia illinois north 
dakota california texas and florida could end up as a melange of 
frenzied motion mixed messages and missed opportunities even his 
aides expressed private concern over some of the scheduling 
for example in norfolk va bush walked among the audience at 
a memorial service monday trying to console relatives of the 47 
sailors killed on the battleship iowa oddly he seemed to snub 
almost half the relatives ignoring the final three rows of 
griefstricken families 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater explained later 
that a military escort had steered bush away after he completed the 
first four rows incorrectly telling him he had met with all the 
immediate relatives 
fitzwater said bush thought it was really a tragedy that 
some relatives had been ignored 
if bushs journey embodies a particular theme its not obvious 
monday his main focus was a review of his first 100 days in 
office today bush delivers a speech in palo alto focusing on 
industrial competitiveness deficit reduction capitalgains tax 
cuts and other subjects 
then he jumps on air force one flies to a military depot in los 
angeles and hops a helicopter his destination is a 213acre ranch 
seized by the government from an alleged marijuana kingpin he 
spends the evening in los angeles at a hispanic salute to the 
president 
bushs trip underscores that he has adopted a different media 
strategy than ronald reagan who tried to shape news accounts by 
focusing on a single message each day and reinforcing it with 
colorful backdrops 
bush is all over the lot in terms of subjects and his staging is 
nothing spectacular 
privately some members of the white house staff are embarrassed 
by bushs scheduling it is rife with the kind of miscues that even 
a novice political candidate would avoid 
it reinforces criticism that bush has not been able to spell out 
in his first 100 days what he wants to do the vision he has for 
his presidency 
from the start of the trip things went awry at the norfolk 
memorial service 
despite the somber nature of the occasion bush flashed a bright 
smile at the end of his speech and held a fixed grin on his face as 
he met onebyone with the victims relatives his reaction was a 
nervous one clearly he had been moved by the ceremony he was seen 
with tears on his cheeks as he walked back to air force one 
explaining the contradiction between his smile and his sorrow 
the president said later the bush familys not very good at that 
kind of thing anyway but youve got to deal with it youve got 
to show them concern you know how you do it pray for strength 
next stop was chicago for an appearance before newspaper 
publishers at the annual meeting of the associated press 
white house aides had considered using the occasion for an 
announcement about how bush will deploy nuclear missiles however 
the news leaked out several days ago that he wants to proceed with 
a mix of mx missiles and singlewarhead weapons denying bush a 
headlinegrabbing pronouncement 
as a result bush merely ticked off the accomplishments of his 
first three months in office declaring weve made a good start 
and promising theres more to come then he hurried away 
without a question and answer session next stop was a 
treeplanting ceremony in bismarck nd 
from the medias standpoint the trip has major faults there 
was no time to file stories after events in norfolk or chicago the 
first filing stop was after 5 pm edt dangerously late to win a 
prime spot in east coast newspapers 
tv network correspondents had to drop off in chicago to get 
their spots on the air and then race across country to catch bush 
on wednesday bush will hold his first meeting with reagan since 
the inaugural it will be five hours before time is earmarked for 
reporters to send in stories after bush arrives in austin to 
address the texas state legislature that speech is to focus on 
energy issues competing with the stories about the reagan reunion 
on thursday bush attends an international drug enforcement 
conference in miami rushes off to dedicate a druginterdiction 
facility and then hurries off to dedicate an alzheimers center 
the trip concludes two days before the end of bushs first 100 
days in office a time for assessments and course corrections 
members of bushs white house staff say they expect the next 100 
days will be smoother

a union leader acquitted of 
charges he tried to take control of an impoverished black township 
says he will rebuild the community organizations that authorities 
alleged were subversive 
a judge on monday acquitted moses mayekiso head of the national 
union of metalworkers and four other black activists of subversion 
charges ad said the boycotts they organized were legal protests of 
poor living conditions 
happy supporters carried mayekiso on their shoulders from the 
supreme court to the nearby central methodist church after the 
verdict police ordered the crowd to stop singing and chanting and 
told reporters to leave 
mayekiso told a news conference later that he and the other 
defendants would resume their activities and rebuild the community 
organizations that authorities said were undermining the township 
government 
were going to start where we left mayekiso said the 
message we have been given is that the structures are legal 
mayekiso 48 was charged with attempting a political takeover 
in 198586 of alexandra an impoverished black township adjoining 
some of johannesburgs most luxurious white suburbs 
he had been jailed for 30 months until judge pj van der walt 
freed him on bail in december 
van der walt said monday the state presented no direct evidence 
that the defendants their alexandra action committee or the 
outlawed african national congress had planned unrest attacks on 
police the resignation of township council members or the 
establishment of peoples courts 
the judge said he had toured the township and seen the poor 
conditions he said the community had developed a lack of faith and 
trust in authorities 
according to van der walt the boycotts were intended to improve 
living conditions not make the township ungovernable 
the case attracted international attention in the united 
states united auto workers president owen bieber called the 
prosecution malicious and outrageous 
the south african authorities knew all along that mayekiso had 
committed no crime but they jailed him for 901 days and subjected 
him to a long and costly trial bieber said in a statement 
van der walt criticized the state for first charging the 
defendants with treason after acknowledging treason could not be 
proved prosecutors substituted the lesser charges of subversion 
and sedition 
in the trial van der walt asked the prosecutor whether rent and 
consumer boycotts were illegal in 19856 the prosecutor 
acknowledged they were not but the government has imposed 
emergency decrees since that outlaw the organization of boycotts 
during that period in alexandra dozens of people were killed in 
clashes with security forces and in attacks by crowds on township 
council members and black policemen the entire council resigned 
and most black policemen moved out of alexandra 
since then the government has detained or restricted leaders of 
the alexandra action committee and undertaken a 45 million 
redevelopment program to provide sewage electricity and paved 
streets to most of the 100000 residents 
those acquitted with mayekiso were paul tshabalala 38 obed 
bapela 30 richard mdakane 30 and mayekisos brother mzwanele

a lawyer for a 4yearold with severe birth 
defects said the child deserves to be compensated because a liquor 
company did not warn the boys mother of the dangers of drinking 
during pregnancy 
but a lawyer for the james b beam distillery co of deerfield 
ill said monday the mother had been repeatedly warned over a 
period of years about the risks of alcohol and she kept drinking up 
to a half of a fifth of bourbon per day no warning on the part of 
a manufacturer would have persuaded her to stop the attorney said 
michael thorp the 4yearold son of harold and candace thorp of 
seattle was born mentally retarded neurologically impaired 
developmentally stunted and malformed according to the lawsuit 
filed by his parents 
the thorps contend that the liquor company should have provided 
labels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects in court 
papers mrs thorp said she didnt know her drinking would damage 
her child 
the case focuses attention on a federal law taking effect in 
november that will require labels on all beer wine or hard liquor 
that alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects 
in his opening statement monday a lawyer for the boy and his 
parents barry m epstein said michael was the victim of fetal 
alcohol syndrome and deserves enough money to take care of him for 
the rest of his life 
epstein said beam knew about a link between alcohol and birth 
defects in 1978 but made no effort to inform the public beam 
decided along with 22 competitors not to place warnings on its 
beverages epstein said 
had warning labels existed and the information been out the 
thorps could have acted to see what could be done to safeguard 
this child he said 
in opening statements by the defense lawyer shannon stafford 
said family members and doctors tried for years to get candy to 
stop drinking she ignored every warning she got 
evidence will demonstrate that candace thorp was warned not 
once but repeatedly about the possible effect of alcohol on 
pregnancy he said a warning on a bottle label would not have 
done any good 
he also said he will prove that michaels rate of development is 
not much different from that of his older sister and that his 
condition is due to poor nutrition during pregnancy heredity and 
severe neglect during his early years by parents who are admitted 
alcoholics 
in court documents lawyers for beam said beam does not 
concede that maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects 
an estimated 30000 children are born each year nationwide with 
fetal alcohol syndrome according to a 1982 study by researchers at 
the university of washingtons alcohol and drug abuse institute

the founder of the outlawed 
philippine communist party said today the rebel slaying of a us 
colonel was justified because of american aggression in the 
country 
i think we cannot say that what happened was bad at all 
jose maria sison told a manila radio station of the killing friday 
of col james nick rowe 51 a vietnam war hero and former 
prisonerofwar 
communist rebels have said they shot and killed rowe the 
mcallen texas man was ambushed en route to work at the joint us 
military advisory group headquarters 
the united states continues with perpetuated aggression 
sison who lives in the netherlands told independent radio dzxl 
us officials said rowes body will be flown to the united 
states today but they refused to give further details at the 
request of his family 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa said rowes killing 
adds a new dimension to the 20yearold communist insurgency 
they are apparently targeting foreign nationals and that is a 
new situation for all of us de villa told reporters you 
cannot win a war in the philippines through assassination and 
murder 
defense secretary fidel ramos charged the rebels are escalating 
their terror campaign because they have failed in their 
military struggle against the philippines armed forces 
he called on the public to rally behind the government so the 
international community sees it can effectively take measures to 
protect the population and also our foreign visitors 
police chief maj gen ramon montano said police are more 
interested in destroying the rebel capability for assassinations 
than in arresting individual killers 
it is immaterial whether we get the real hit men or not 
montano said what is more important to us is the destruction of 
their terror machinery the communist hit man can be anybody 
the united states maintains six military facilities in the 
country including clark air base and subic bay naval base both 
north of manila the lease on the bases expires in 1991 
last sunday the communistled national democratic front urged

against the bases 
i think it is preferable that a national alliance is created 
to fight and oust the americans from the bases sison told the 
radio station 
he founded the communist party in the philippines in 1968 and 
was arrested nov 10 1977 he remained in jail until a month after

one panel member the jury in oliver norths irancontra trial 
resumed deliberations today 
the 12 members beginning their fourth day of considering norths 
fate have yet to actually discuss his guilt or innocence with 
their time so far spent reviewing documents 
we are reading through documents that pertain to charges 
jury foreman denise anderson said in a note to the judge monday 
adding no talking 
juror jean johnson 53 experienced bouts of high blood pressure 
monday and a note sent out to the judge in the afternoon asked for 
a nurse to take her blood pressure the monitoring continued today 
federal court rules provide that a jury can proceed with 11 
members at a judges discretion losing two members however would 
in all likelihood result in a mistrial there is a provision under 
which a jury could reach a verdict with fewer than 11 members if 
both sides agreed to it and the judge approves it 
north is charged with 12 criminal counts including lying to 
congress and to the attorney general during the irancontra affair 
illegally converting travelers checks to his own use and conspiring 
to defraud the treasury 
at the jurys request us district judge gerhard a gesell 
moved it out of a small room across from the judges chambers and 
into the main courtroom where norths trial took place the jurors 
were deliberating around the two big tables where prosecutors and 
norths lawyers tried the case 
meanwhile at least one of the panels members was angered by an 
invitation to give interviews after the trial is over 
gesell said that nbc news had left unsigned letters at the 
jurors homes containing the invitations he called it most 
inappropriate quite disrespectful of the situation we are 
dealing with 
one of the letters was picked up by a deputy us marshal who 
informed the juror and withheld the document 
the juror was angry about having gotten the letter and 
mentioned it to other members of the panel who said they didnt 
want anything to do with the invitation said the judge 
nbc news spokeswoman peggy hubble in new york said it was 
intended for them to see them when they got home after they made 
their decision after the trial i think once people understand 
what happened theres not much of a problem with it really 
she added were sorry if there was any inconvenience or 
misinterpretation

one of four security policemen convicted 
of killing the prosolidarity priest jerzy popieluszko has been 
freed from prison after four years the government said today 
deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski said waldemar 
chmielewski was released but said he did not know when he left 
prison 
chmielewskis sentence which has been reduced twice was to 
expire the third week in april 
he was sentenced to 14 years jail in february 1985 for his part 
in the 1984 kidnapping and murder of popieluszko a roman catholic 
priest who fervently supported the independent trade union that was 
banned by authorities at the time 
popieluszkos body was recovered from the vistula river 
northwest of warsaw 
the other officers received longer sentences and a court upheld 
the verdicts during a 1985 appeal 
however chmielewskis sentence later was reduced twice most 
recently in 1987 when the supreme court cut his prison term to four 
years on humanitarian grounds 
the sentences of the other three killers also have been reduced 
sharply 
popieluszko has become a symbol of solidaritys struggle and his 
grave at the warsaw church where he served has become a pilgrimage 
site for poles and foreigners 
this weekend solidarity leader lech walesa laid flowers on the 
grave to mark the priests name day 
solidarity was suppressed when martial law was declared in 
december 1981 and outlawed the following october it was legalized

former prime minister edward heath whom margaret 
thatcher ousted as conservative party leader in 1975 felt 
affronted at being defeated by a woman a former deputy prime 
minister said in a television interview released today 
lord whitelaw who was deputy prime minister until retiring last 
year said heath also felt betrayed by the party he spoke on a 
british broadcasting corp program about him titled the power 
behind the throne which is to be broadcast wednesday 
whitelaw said he too was desperately upset when mrs 
thatcher defeated heath and he doubted that a woman could lead a 
political party or be prime minister 
that is a dreadful male chauvinist remark but it had never 
happened before whitelaw said so i had these questions in my 
mind was the country ready to vote for a woman as a leader would 
she have the strength of purpose would she be able to control 
a whole lot of men in a cabinet 
that makes one laugh today but it was true then whitelaw 
said 
mrs thatcher ousted heath after he lost two consecutive 
elections she became prime minister when the conservative party 
won power again in 1979 
in the leadership contest mrs thatcher outpolled heath in a 
first ballot among conservative members of parliament heath 
withdrew whitelaw joined the contest in the second ballot and she 
defeated him too 
whitelaw 70 became a trusted thatcher supporter serving in 
her cabinets and being made a peer in 1983 he was deputy prime 
minister until he quit after suffering a stroke last year 
in contrast heath 72 is an embittered rankandfile 
legislator who periodically attacks mrs thatcher publicly 
whitelaw described heaths attitude as strange and sad 
but i think ted felt desperately and totally betrayed by the 
party said whitelaw 
so this rather shy rather withdrawn man felt deeply 
affronted said whitelaw certainly he would mind more than 
most people who had been beaten by a woman most men wouldnt like 
it but i think he minded more

a uss iowa crewman who was in the gun turret 
that exploded and killed 47 sailors says he was waiting for its 
massive 16inch guns to fire but the blast he heard didnt sound 
right 
after the explosion kendall l truitt recalled monday he and 
10 others in the bottom of the turret tried to radio sailors on the 
five upper decks but none answered 
we knew that something was drastically wrong said the 
gunners mate 3rd class who is from tampa fla 
he said he then ordered the gunpowder magazine secured and the 
area evacuated 
the quick actions of the 11 and other iowa crewmen were critical 
in preventing an even bigger tragedy aboard the world war iiera 
battleship capt fred p moosally said 
i cant say enough about the hundreds of heroes who fought the 
fire and saved the ship moosally said god gave birth to 500 
heroes 
the two spoke at a news conference several hours after a 
memorial service for the victims at the norfolk naval air station 
the iowas home port 
about 6000 mourners heard president bush praise the men 
behind the guns 
they came to the navy as strangers served the navy as 
shipmates and friends and left the navy as brothers in eternity 
bush said afterward he and his wife barbara consoled victims 
families 
navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of 
wednesdays blast that occurred during a gunnery exercise off 
puerto rico officials said they had no idea when an investigation 
would be completed 
there was a tremendous amount of damage done and of course 
lives were lost so it will be a very thorough investigation lt 
cmdr steve burnett a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in norfolk 
said today 
there are lots of theories floating around moosally said 
unfortunately all the witnesses are dead 
officials also said they havent finished assessing the damage 
to the turret 
moosally refused to give a definite answer to questions about 
whether the turret could be repaired he said the battleship could 
operate without it if necessary 
the iowa has three turrets each with three 16inch guns 
the captain said there were no indications of any problems with 
the guns before the blast 
the no 1 turret had already fired its rounds moosally said 
while in the second turret the practice projectiles and five 
110pound bags of powder had been loaded into the right and left 
guns 
moosally said a projectile was loaded into the center gun and 
the crew was loading powder behind it when the explosion occurred 
that was my best turret moosally said the turrets 
senior chief was the most meticulous man ive ever met you talk 
about training nobody in that turret did anything unless they 
were qualified of the 84 chiefs on the ship he was no 1 
he was referring to chief gunners mate reginald o ziegler of 
port gibson ny ziegler 39 was the oldest victim 
the ships weapons control officer cmdr robert j kissinger 
said the guns had passed a rigorous inspection that morning they 
had been fired last in early february he said 
the powder also had been inspected before the exercise 
kissinger said 
truitt said the 11 on the turrets bottom level were not sure 
what had happened immediately after the blast but they knew that 
didnt sound right 
the men opened a door leading to the next level and immediately 
realized the turret was on fire they escaped through a hatch that 
led to ladders outside the turret 
as i was crawling out of the space smoke was filling all 
the spaces truitt said the first thing that came to mind was a 
nearby magazine full of powder he said 
seven minutes after the explosion moosally ordered the ships 
magazines flooded to prevent the fire from spreading and causing a 
larger blast 
truitt said there was a special bond among the 25 men in the 
turret with the rating of gunners mate only one other survived 
with him 
i lost 23 friends right there he said some of his 
shipmates havent recovered from the shock truitt said but im 
working on it 
moosally said he expected some crewmen would ask to leave the 
battleship after the trauma of the accident but truitt said he 
would be willing to serve in a turret again 
i dont see the likelihood that it will ever happen again 
he said 
moosally vowed when the ship goes to sea again ill be in the 
turret when the first shot goes up

the partnership created in 1984 to promote a 
book coauthored by house republican whip newt gingrich reported a 
loss of more than 100000 during its first five years according 
to partnership tax returns released today by gingrich 
the cos limited partnership was formed by 21 individuals or 
corporations that each put up 5000 to pay for a promotional 
campaign for window of opportunity written by gingrich his 
wife marianne gingrich and david drake one person janet morris 
received a 5000 share of the partnership for editorial work 
the partnership is the subject of a formal complaint filed with 
the house ethics committee by rep bill alexander dark accusing 
gingrich of 10 apparent violations of house rules the committee 
has not indicated whether it will launch a preliminary 
investigation of alexanders complaint 
gingrich initiated the investigation that resulted in the filing 
of 69 ethics charges against house speaker jim wright last week 
gingrich has denied any wrongdong in connection with the book 
deal 
he released several hundred pages of documents today identifying 
the 21 partners and detailing the organizations finances and 
incorporation history the documents including the partnerships 
tax returns for 19841988 were released in response to questions 
submitted by news organizations 
the partnership agreement with the books publisher provided 
that the partnership would get half of the publishers profits in 
exchange for promoting the book 
but despite the partnerships expenditure of 51571 to 
advertise and promote the book from 1984 through 1986 the 
publisher reported to gingrich and his wife in 1988 that there was 
a net loss of 6259 on the book 
the 1988 accounting from the publisher showed that 58996 copies 
of the book were sold to bookstores but 29981 of those copies 
were returned net sales of the book totaled 122120 
because the partnership received no profits from the book sales 
the 104185 loss it generated between 1984 and 1988 was 
distributed among the partners providing them with tax writeoffs 
mrs gingrich as general partner of the partnership received a 
10000 payment in 1984 for her work in setting up the 
organization and later was given a 2 percent interest in the 
partnership for her work according to the documents she did not 
invest any of her own money in the partnership 
in written responses to questions from reporters mrs gingrich 
said she also received a recent 1500 payment from the partnership 
for part of the work i have done since the partnership was 
formed 
i have worked hard in organizing and running this 
partnership mrs gingrich saidi have been paid for my work 
and my legal responsibilities according to the partnership 
agreement i am entitled to more than i have been paid so far 
alexanders complaint alleges in part that the payments and 
ownership interest in the partnership that mrs gingrich received 
were gifts that violated house rules limiting gifts that members 
may receive 
the complaint also alleged that because of the unusual nature of 
the partnership promotional deal the royalties gingrich and his 
wife received from the book do not fit the definition of royalties 
in house rules and thus constitute a violation of house limits on 
outside income 
according to the documents released by gingrich he and his wife 
each received 7018 in royalties from the publisher under the 
agreement with the publisher the three authors received a total 10 
percent royalty on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperbacks 
while the documents identify the 22 partners in the book 
promotional deal gingrich did not respond to questions about 
whether he had intervened with any agency of the federal government 
in behalf of any of the investors 
the 21 investors were richmond n aggrey of peachtree city ga 
bigard oil and manufacturing co of newton ill joe coors of

west germany said today it was 
sticking with its demand for superpower talks on shortrange 
nuclear weapons despite washingtons refusal to begin such 
negotiations 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also said west germany 
would be speaking with other nato partners about the internal 
alliance dispute over the shortrange weapons 
we are going into the talks with our partners with the same 
position that we have already worked out genscher told reporters 
genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg had just 
returned from washington where they tried to convince us 
officials of the need to take up early talks with the soviets on 
reducing shortrange nuclear weapons 
the united states and britain are concerned that negotiating the 
missiles issue with the soviets could lead to stripping the nato 
allies of their groundbased nuclear weaponry leaving them at the 
mercy of stronger warsaw pact conventional forces 
most of the north atlantic treaty organizations shortrange 
nuclear weapons 88 lance launchers with a range of up to about 75 
miles are based in west germany 
west germany also is opposed to us proposals to upgrade the 
lance missiles the issues are expected to be at the forefront of 
the nato summit in brussels at the end of may 
west germanys support for talks on the shortrange weapons 
comes amid a growing antimilitary mood among the populace and 
predictions that chancellor helmut kohl could lose next years 
elections 
the missiles are a subject of irritation in west germany 
because of their short range the nucleartipped missiles are 
designed to hit targets almost exclusively on german soil 
genscher said his talks with us officials had resulted in a 
better understanding of the positions of both sides but he 
gave no indication there would soon be a breakthrough in attempts 
to resolve the dispute 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain will fly to bonn on 
sunday to try to persuade kohl to suspend his campaign for 
ussoviet negotiations on the issue 
kohl has support among several of the smaller nato countries 
including norway belgium the netherlands and denmark

police were examining evidence from 
skeletal remains found along a highway to see if it fits the 
pattern of a serial killer or killers believed to have slain at 
least eight women in the area 
the remains were found monday by state workers clearing brush 
along interstate 195 about 12 miles east of dartmouth where 
bodies of four of the eight victims were found also along the 
highway 
the parallels are there said john corbett assistant 
district attorney for plymouth county its certainly reasonable 
to make the assumption that there is some connection between them 
james martin a spokesman for ronald pina bristol county 
district attorney said a brief examination of the scene in marion 
indicated there were exact numerous similarities between the 
eight victims and mondays discovery 
corbett would not say whether the body was that of a male or 
female and added that officials were not able to determine whether 
it was a homicide an autopsy was to be done today 
three other victims were found along route 140 in freetown and 
the eighth was found along route 88 in westport the three 
locations all within a 10mile radius are in bristol county 
marion is in plymouth county 
the eight dead women had ties to weld square an area of new 
bedford associated with prostitution and drugs 
police have said that as many as three missing women may be 
additional victims

christian army units and syrian gunners 
poured rocket and artillery fire on beirut in an escalation of 
violence today the eve of an arab league meeting aimed at ending 
the fighting 
police said at least two people were killed and 16 wounded in 
the bombardment which began at midnight and raged until 6 am 
then dwindled to sporadic exchanges 
the deaths raised to 272 killed and 991 wounded the toll since 
the latest round of fighting broke out march 8 in the 14yearold 
civil war that pits christians against moslems 
the city shook as army troops under gen michel aoun fired 155mm 
and 130mm howitzer and mortar shells into moslem west beirut the 
only sound other than the blasts of shells was the occasional siren 
of a civil defense ambulance 
civilians scurried to basements and underground shelters 
the syrians opened up on east beirut the heart of the besieged 
310squaremile christian enclave with 240mm mortars and bm21 
launchers which fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds 
four shells crashed in the garden of east beiruts comfort 
hotel which houses offices of un peacekeepers and the un 
relief and works agency police said windows were shattered and 
windshields of five un cars were blown out the hotel and a un 
official said 
shells destroyed the facade of the threestory goethe institute 
a west german cultural center in west beirut 
police said west beiruts sahel hospital on the main airport 
highway took several direct hits that damaged equipment but hurt no 
patients 
on monday moslem forces fired rockets at a french tanker as it 
delivered fuel to restart power stations police reported much of 
lebanon including beirut has been without electricity since fuel 
for power stations generators ran out nine days ago 
police said four rockets crashed into the mediterranean about 
700 yards from the french navy tanker the penhors as it unloaded 
4000 tons of fuel in the christian town of zouk north of beirut 
the salvo was fired despite what christian officers called 
solid guarantees given to french ambassador paul blanc by 
christian and syrian commanders that there would be no shooting 
while the tanker unloaded 
the delivery of the fuel oil caused an interruption in the 
stream of refugees fleeing beirut from the christiancontrolled 
port of jounieh north of the city an aide to aoun said he ordered 
two cypriotflag ferries to stop picking up christians while the 
penhors unloaded 
foreign ministers of the 22member arab league are to meet in an 
emergency session in tunis tunisia on wednesday to find ways to 
end the violence three ceasefires arranged by the league have 
collapsed 
an arab league committee will recommend that the group send an 
observer force of people from all arab states to monitor a 
ceasefire said kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed 
the current fighting erupted after aoun who heads the christian 
government vying for legitimacy with a rival moslem cabinet 
clamped a blockade on illegal ports run by moslem militias south of 
beirut in a bid to restore longeroded state authority 
the druse progressive socialist party retaliated by shelling the 
christian enclave they soon were joined by the syrians who 
maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
the observer force will not be a deterrent one but rather a 
symbolic force assigned to oversee a ceasefire sabah said in 
kuwait 
the truce would be an interim step aimed at stabilizing the 
situation in lebanon until a political solution is worked out with 
provisions for arranging presidential elections and the formation 
of a a coalition government 
syria has said it will attend the arab league meeting

scientists at an indian laboratory have 
achieved nuclear fusion in an electrolytic cell a process first 
reported by two university of utah researchers in march an indian 
researcher said 
the experiment at the indira gandhi center for atomic research 
in this city on the bay of bengal 40 miles south of madras differs 
slightly from the utah work 
cherian k mathews said in an interview that he and two 
associates achieved the cold fusion april 16 after three days 
of experiments 
he said the team used titanium cathode and platinum anode dipped 
in socalled heavy water which contains a form of hydrogen called 
deuterium that has a neutron in its nucleus the utah researchers 
had used a cathode made of a palladium a highly expensive element 
to achieve cold fusion 
cold fusion aims at getting the deuterium atoms to fuse forming 
helium and releasing energy 
the reaction occurs at room temperature and hence is called cold 
fusion previously fusion had been achieved under extremely high 
temperature and pressure as seen in the core of the sun 
mathews said his team experimented with ordinary water and heavy 
water he said there was a significant increase in temperature 
heat during the experiment with heavy water as compared to 
ordinary water 
that suggests that the reaction involved nuclear processes such 
as fusion rather than chemical processes heavy water and ordinary 
water are chemically identical 
the team did not measure the energy output but mathews said 
they had rough estimates of energy during the different 
experiments he did not give details 
the team also noticed an increase in the number of neutrons 
emitted but these could not be reproduced at will he said 
mathews 50 said he had worked with indias atomic energy 
department after receiving a doctorate from mcmaster university in 
hamilton ontario

the supreme court by a 63 vote today tossed 
out a dispute over the federal governments power to ban newspapers 
from publishing lists of winners in privately run lotteries 
the justices ruled that a controversy from minnesota has become 
moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban 
we conclude that there is no longer any live controversy on 
the issue of whether the challenged statute is constitutional as 
it applies to prize lists and that this appeal is moot the 
court said in an unsigned opinion 
justices byron r white and thurgood marshall cast dissenting 
votes but did not explain why 
justice john paul stevens in a brief dissenting opinion said 
the court should have reversed not merely set aside a federal 
judges ruling that had upheld the publishing ban 
the minnesota newspaper association originally challenged a 
postal law that bars newspapers from carrying advertisements and 
prize lists 
postal laws currently prohibit use of the mails to disseminate 
information about any lottery not run by a state since nearly all 
newspapers rely on the mail for at least a portion of their 
distribution the postal laws apply to them 
but after the justices agreed last october to study the case 
congress enacted a new law to take effect in may 1990 dropping 
the ban on advertising for private lotteries the newspaper 
association and the government agreed to drop that part of the case 
government lawyers then told the justices that the existing ban 
on publishing prize winners will not be enforced 
the dispute had focused on lotteries and other gaming such as 
bingo and raffles sponsored by nonprofit charitable 
organizations and others 
lawyers for the minnesota newspapers said the revenue 
generated by charitable gaming is very substantial in minnesota 
alone it appears to exceed 200 million per year 
us district judge paul a magnuson upheld the ban on lottery 
advertising even though he acknowledged that the ads are a 
constitutionally protected form of commercial speech the newspaper 
association appealed 
the judge however ruled that newspapers cannot be barred from 
running lists of private lottery winners unless such lists are 
found in advertisements the government had appealed that part of 
his ruling 
the case is frank vs minnesota newspaper association 871956

sparked by the april 15 death of former communist party chief hu 
yaobang an advocate of reform tens of thousands of students from 
more than a dozen universities have taken part 
the communist partys official peoples daily blamed the unrest 
on a handful of students with ulterior motives 
this is a planned conspiracy an upheaval that in essence 
aims at negating the leadership of the chinese communist party and 
the socialist system the paper said in an editorial broadcast 
today on national television and radio 
the editorial was the strongest warning yet that government 
tolerance of the students was nearing an end 
it said conspirators had used the grief of students to 
fabricate rumors in an attempt to create greater unrest 
this is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and 
the people of all nationalities 
it called on the nation to unite against public disturbances and 
protect hardearned political stability 
the broadcast of the editorial was played repeatedly over 
loudspeakers at several major universities 
this is their first step we can expect arrests to come 
soon said one student activist at beijing university 
students and residents of the district where most of the 
strikebound universities are located reported troops from outlying 
counties had moved into the area in preparation for an eventual 
crackdown 
informed sources said more than 10000 troops had been brought 
in 
the official xinhua news agency said late today that government 
officials had arranged a meeting with student representatives at 
qinghua university where most of the more than 10000 students are 
boycottng classes 
but it said students failed to show up and officials were told 
they had been unable to agree on who would represent them 
the incident appeared to reflect a growing division among 
students who want to reduce tensions and those who want to hold 
more largescale marches and rallies most students want to 
continue the protests in some form until may 4 the 70th 
anniversary of chinas first prodemocracy student movement 
the divisions are not serious said one student leader but 
poster boards at beijing university were plastered with pleas for 
unity 
if we return to class we will be condemned by the ages we 
will be the scum of chinese history said one poster please 
remember we are writing history 
students leaders sent activists to street corners to give 
speeches explaining their demands for a free press respect for 
human rights and an end to official privileges and corruption 
many also are calling for senior leaders such as premier li peng 
to resign 
most workers are sympathetic to the students but they dont 
dare take part said a worker who used his lunch break to go hear 
taped speeches by beijing university students just outside the 
campus 
he said his factory and others were given orders to keep workers 
in line but that the main obstacle was fear of losing their wages 
the students have no responsibilities but what can i do he 
said as he held his small son if i stop working what will my 
child eat 
the students condemnation of official corruption has appeal to 
many workers because profiteering on the sale of raw materials has 
become a major business for many factory officials 
the students also have won sympathy among journalists whose 
statecontrolled publications have been barred from publishing news 
of the class boycott 
only two newspapers have mentioned the student marches for 
democracy and one science and technology daily managed to get 
its edition to the streets only after the reporters threatened to 
quit en masse

defense secretary dick cheney today outlined 
10 billion in pentagon budget cuts and said the hard choices 
included reductions in dozens of weapons systems and a 1 billion 
slash in star wars research money 
cheney making his first appearance as defense secretary before 
his former colleagues in the house told the armed services 
committee that only the marine corps had been spared manpower cuts 
no program was excluded from consideration during the budget 
adjustment process cheney told the house panel at the start of 
what was expected to be a daylong hearing 
but my top priorities are quality people forward strategy 
readiness and sustainability efficient procurement and strategic 
modernization the adjustments we made to the budget were 
implemented within this context 
under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring between 
the bush administration and congress the pentagon is required to 
cut future spending plans by 10 billion for the next fiscal year 
cheney said that in making the budget changes not only did we 
have to make hard choices but we also had to make sure that they 
were the right choices 
funding for star wars research has been cut by 1 billion to a 
new total of 46 billion for fiscal 1990 cheney said 
he said the navy would retire or transfer to the reserves one 
aircraft carrier seven destroyers and 10 frigates and that the 
air force would lose its new f15e groundattack jet and delay 
production of the new b2 stealth bomber 
the army has been told to cancel production of ah64 apache 
helicopters after fiscal 1991 the marine corps has been told to 
scrap development of its new v22 transport aircraft the navy has 
been ordered to defer some purchases of the fa18 jet fighter and 
to cancel its planned last purchase of an ssn688 nuclear attack 
submarine 
cheney who took office a month ago said he had ordered a cut 
in active military strength totaling 16800 positions down to a 
total of 2121500 of those cuts 8000 will come from the army 
5600 from the navy and 3200 from the air force the defense 
chief said 
a request for a 36 percent pay raise in fiscal 1990 for armed 
services personnel has been left intact cheney said and training 
funds would not be cut 
on the nuclearmissile question cheney said president bush had 
decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile strategic missiles 
the larger 10warhead mx missile and the singlewarhead 
midgetman 
cheney had recommended moving the nations 50 mx missiles from 
silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing the 
midgetman but bush opted for quick deployment of the mx and 
researchanddevelopment funding for the midgetman 
further development of the midgetman wastes funds that are 
sorely needed for other defense programs sen pete wilson 
rcalif a member of the senate armed services committee said of 
the compromise decision 
but rep bill dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
house armed services committee said he had no problem with the 
plan the main thing is to preserve and protect the assets weve 
got which is mx in silos and then go forward and make them 
mobile 
congressional republicans over the years have favored the mx 
while many democrats prefer the midgetman 
warner a backer of the compromise proposal said it was his 
opinion that the plan will move through the hill reasonably 
smoothly because of its bipartisan support 
the virginia republican said the mxmidgetman plan has the 
support of democrat sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate 
armed services committee and rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee 
cheneys recommendation for star wars spending of 46 billion 
compares to a total of 59 billion proposed by former president 
reagan in total spending for star wars formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative would be 33 billion over five years 
compared to the 40 billion proposed by reagan 
the star wars funding level is keeping pace with the 
technology thats moving now in several directions said sen 
john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee 
dickinson said the spending proposal for star wars is not 
going to be such a cut that it will permanently wreck the program 
it still gives a viable reasonable program particularly if they 
dont press for early deployment 
cheney said the focus of star wars will shift from deployment 
sometime in the 1990s to research on brilliant pebbles a more 
advanced system consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites 
the defense secretary also said the pentagon would delay work 
for one year on the b2 stealth bomber which at recent estimates 
of 500 million per plane makes it the most expensive aircraft in 
history original plans called for purchasing 132 
the stretchout on the b2 is not that bad in that it was 
going to slip some anyway for technical reasons said dickinson

a hijacker with explosives strapped to his back 
blew himself up after failing to force a domestic chinese airliner 
carrying 50 people to fly to taiwan a chinese news agency reported 
today 
the china news service said two passengers were injured in the 
explosion during mondays attempted hijacking on a flight from 
ningbo in zhejiang province to xiamen in the neighboring eastern 
province of fujian 
ningbo is about 490 miles north of xiamen 
it said the hijacker who was carrying a pass from the 
journalism department of a university stabbed an airline hostess 
in the hand before charging into the cockpit and demanding to be 
flown to taiwan 
the pilot fooled the hijacker by flying around before landing in 
the city of fuzhou in fujian it added fuzhou is 260 miles south 
of mingbo 
it said the hijacker then blew himself up 
it said the aircraft carrying 44 passengers and six crew 
members belonged to the shanghai eastern airlines but gave no 
other details about the plane 
chinas last hijacking came in may when two chinese used a toy 
gun and fake explosives to force a jetliner to fly from xiamen to 
an air base in taiwan 
taiwan gave political asylum to the two and let the plane fly 
back to china five hours later the two hijackers were later 
sentenced to 3 years in prison

contracts settled through collective 
bargaining in the past three months provided workers average annual 
pay raises of 31 percent during the life of the pacts the 
government said today 
the labor department report provided additional data suggesting 
the rate of wage gains was picking up and placing inflationary 
pressures on the economy 
the 31 percent annual increase in wages won in contracts 
settled in the first quarter of 1989 contrasted with a 25 percent 
average for the 12 months ended march 31 indicating wage inflation 
has accelerated in the past three months 
the firstquarter settlements covered 199000 workers about 11 
percent of the approximately 18 million workers whose contracts 
were settled through collective bargaining in the past year 
although the report showed signs of recent wage acceleration 
the rate of average wage gains during the life of the contracts was 
down for both those contracts settled in the past three months and 
those settled in the past year 
the 31 percent average annual wage gains negotiated in the 
first quarter compared with a 35 percent average annual increases 
the last time parties to those contracts negotiated the government 
said 
for 12month period the 25 percent average annual wage gains 
during the life of new contracts compared to 27 percent in the 
prior contracts 
eleven percent of the workers whose contracts were settled in 
the past three months have a costofliving adjustment included in 
the pacts but those workers generally received lower actual wage 
increases to offset expected cola payments later 
workers in nonmanufacturing jobs fared better than those in 
manufacturing in the first quarter winning average annual raises 
of 33 percent compared with 23 percent in manufacturing

a unanimous supreme court today upheld a 1986 
federal law imposing safety user fees on pipeline companies 
that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids 
the court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in 
oklahoma that the law that allows the secretary of transportation 
to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs 
unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of congress 
power to impose taxes 
justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court that the law 
clearly is not an unconstitutional delegation of the taxing power 
by congress to the executive branch 
the userfee system is being used to pay for pipeline safety 
programs costing about 85 million to 93 million a year 
the law had been challenged by midamerica pipeline co a 
transporter of hazardous liquids it has been assessed a 53000 
fee in 1986 by the secretary of transportation 
us magistrate john l wagner in tulsa okla ruled in 1987 
that the assessments are taxes and therefore the law improperly 
gives the transportation secretary the power to set tax rates 
in her opinion today however oconnor said we need not 
concern ourselves whether the pipeline safety user fees are 
really taxes 
assuming they are she said we hold that the delegation of 
discretionary authority under congress taxing power is subject to 
no constitutional scrutiny greater than that we have applied to 
other nondelegation challenges 
had the court upheld the magistrates ruling its decision could 
have affected a broad range of federal fees and taxes 
as examples government lawyers cited congressional 
authorization for the nuclear regulatory commission to assess 
nuclear power plant operators for licensing and inspection and for 
the federal energy regulatory commission to impose fees to pay the 
cost of its various programs 
the assessments may be based on the amount of pipeline miles a 
company operates the quantity of natural gas or liquid and how far 
it is shipped or the gross revenue of the company 
the case is skinner vs midamerican pipeline co 872098

a former fruit picker behind bars for two 
decades for the fatal poisoning of his seven children was 
railroaded attorney mark lane told a special court hearing today 
the 21yearold record of the case was skewed by the 
prosecutor and the sheriff in this county said lane who 
represented the former field hand james richardson before circuit 
judge clifton kelly that file comprises the anatomy of a 
frame 
lane a washington dc lawyer and author who first alleged a 
frameup in the 1971 book arcadia was the first of many 
attorneys scheduled to be heard 
richardson wearing a gray suit and dark hornrimmed glasses 
was applauded by onlookers when he was brought in to sit at the 
defense table 
it is not the purpose of the court to determine innocence or 
guilt said kelly who was appointed by the state supreme court 
in march to hear the appeal we are trying to find out whether 
there was a fair trial according to law but it is impossible to 
separate one from the other 
the hearing was expected to last all day and possibly into 
wednesday kelly previously has indicated he would like to rule 
immediately if that happens richardson could be released from 
prison promptly it could be difficult for the state to retry a 
21yearold case 
for months the oncehearty fruit picker who is now a graying 
53yearold man has been inching toward freedom with evidence 
suggesting he did not poison his children to collect on a life 
insurance policy 
earlier this month special prosecutor janet reno said the 1968 
conviction should be overturned because evidence was withheld and 
witnesses lied under oath with the prosecutors knowledge 
but the man who put richardson behind bars sees his possible 
release as a miscarriage of justice 
i am just as convinced today of the defendants guilt as i was 
20 years ago said former state attorney frank schaub who is 
suing lane and attorney ellis rubin for alleged defamation of 
character 
defense lawyers claim baby sitter bessie reese poisoned the 
children while richardson and his wife annie mae were working in 
citrus groves miles away 
reese who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing home 
has confessed to nurses to the 1967 deaths according to an 
affidavit from nurses no charges have been filed against her and 
prosecutors have said she has become confused 
in a 200page document filed with the court schaub 67 called 
for the conviction to stand 
to really try to understand how a human being could kill those 
innocent defenseless little children we must first realize 
exactly who and what james richardson really was this 32yearold 
man who had more than 10 children schaub wrote 
he also listed charges that richardson refused to support his 
children refused to work regularly neglected the children 
deserted his first two wives and their children and was arrested 
for minor crimes 
deputy attorney general jim york said richardsons character is 
not the issue 
the question is whether he received a fair trial and everyone 
deserves a fair trial york said 
richardson a black man convicted by an allwhite jury in this 
southwest florida farming community was originally sentenced to 
death that sentence was commuted to life in 1972 
his lawyers said richardson was an easy target because he was 
illiterate poor and black they said prosecutors suppressed 
evidence that would have shown richardson had not yet purchased the 
insurance and that a cellmate of richardsons has recanted 
statements that he heard richardson confess 
richardson was transferred sunday from the tomoka correctional 
institution in daytona beach to the county jail in arcadia so he 
can attend the hearing 
if freed lane said richardson would visit the graves of his 
children then return to daytona beach for a shrimp dinner 
rubin said he has found a job and housing in miami for 
richardson who has learned recently about contemporary technology 
such as television remote controls and telephone answering machines 
i wont believe it until i am free he said in a recent 
interview at the prison ive been promised freedom too many 
times before

radios and computers and planned use of a thermal neutron analysis 
machine for bomb detection at heathrow and gatwick airports more 
airport security inspectors would be employed and the government 
would give more money for research into detecting explosives 
channon said he would discuss the thermal neutron analysis 
machine being developed by the us federal aviation authority in 
talks this week with us transportation secretary samuel skinner 
british press reports say the machines cost 850000 each 
channon said under the new measures all hold baggage on high 
risk flights is being screened and aircraft design changes are 
being carried out to make it more difficult to hide arms or 
explosives 
this package represents a concerted effort to tighten up 
security the aim is to give passengers and air crew a high level 
of security channon told reporters later

newspapers should take advantage of technology to 
stay close to their readers knightridder inc president james k 
batten told publishers gathered today for the american newspaper 
publishers association convention 
batten chief executive officer of miamibased knightridder 
said if newspapers are going to be as successful in the future 
as theyve been in the past we have to be much more zealous about 
getting close to our customers and staying there technology can 
help us do that 
used intelligently the telephone and the computer can let us 
recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had 
with their customers 20 or 25 years ago 
for example he said the providence ri journalbulletin 
uses a voice service to offer telephone recordings of soap opera 
updates publishing a daily access code for readers to call the 
journal reported more than 20000 calls a month in colorado the 
boulder daily camera gets more than 77000 calls a month on a 
system that offers recordings of sports scores and stories 
the callin systems are relatively inexpensive requiring little 
more than a personal computer phone lines and tape recordings 
batten said during a session on the conventions second day it 
ends wednesday 
in addition the industry has little choice but to change in 
dealing with the aging of the babyboom generation an increase in 
twoincome households and the growing cultural diversity of the 
us population he said 
these are threats not to our existence but to our pricing 
flexibility to our ability to finance the news coverage that our 
communities deserve and that we want to provide batten said 
we can respond to those threats we can do that by using 
technology to take some modest steps that will bring us closer to 
the customer who keeps our business going the reader

investigators are trying to determine if there 
was any connection between the crash of a student pilot coming in 
for a landing and the almost simultaneous clearing for takeoff of a 
plane carrying transportation secretary samuel skinner 
carol ann reiser 33 of suburban itasca was killed april 15 at 
du page county airport west of chicago her singleengine cessna 
152 plunged to the ground about 580 feet short of the runway as she 
was practicing landings 
skinners plane a government beechcraft king air 90 was 
cleared for takeoff at the same time on the same runway officials 
revealed monday 
the same controller who was in training gave the clearances to 
both aircraft said michael benson a spokesman for the national 
transportation safety board which is conducting the investigation 
our preliminary reading of the airtraffic control tapes is 
that the messages to both planes were virtually simultaneous he 
said 
investigators are trying to learn if the backtoback orders 
were an error that contributed to the cessna crash or if the pilot 
simply lost control of her airplane 
investigators have reported no evidence of mechanical failure of 
the cessna 
officials said witnesses have provided conflicting reports on 
the position of skinners plane when the cessna went down 
some say skinners aircraft was in a holding position waiting to 
take off others say it was already airborne 
skinner who had visited chicago for press interviews and to 
attend the baseball home opener of the white sox was heading for a 
meeting in st louis at the time of the accident

the house banking committee is considering a 
proposal from its chairman that would force savings and loan owners 
to back their lending with more of their own capital 
according to a draft document circulated among committee members 
and obtained monday by the associated press rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas is offering a plan with moderately stricter 
capital requirements than the bill passed earlier this month by the 
subcommittee on financial institutions chaired by rep frank 
annunzio dill 
gonzalez committee is scheduled to hold its first public 
session on the bill wednesday after a private meeting of committee 
democrats today 
both gonzalez plan and the subcommittees bill include a 
riskbased formula for capital that offers a break to sampls making 
lowrisk loans such as home mortgages 
but the gonzalez proposal would require most sampls to maintain a 
somewhat higher base of tangible or real money capital 
which includes cash and assets readily convertible to cash 
the subcommittees bill provides for a base of tangible capital 
of 150 for every 100 in loans while another 150 could consist 
of goodwill an intangible asset representing the value of an 
institutions customer loyalty and name recognition together they 
amount to core capital of 3 percent 
gonzalez plan also provides for core capital of 3 percent but 
its tougher on goodwill allowing it make up only one fourth 
rather than one half of the core 
both the gonzalez and subcommittee legislation represent 
advances over current rules which do not require owners to put up 
any real money if they have enough goodwill and subordinated debt 
money sampls borrow on their books 
as of the end of 1988 goodwill was the biggest loophole 
accounting for a third of the industrys 60 billion in capital 
subordinated debt amounts to about 4 billion 
sampl industry critics are targeting goodwill because it cannot be 
sold when an institution closes 
the subcommittee bill would allow sampls to maintain goodwill on 
their books in some cases for as long as 40 years gonzalez would 
eliminate it in 20 years the bush administration had wanted to get 
rid of it in 10 years 
the gonzalez plan is also stricter with risky activities 
conducted in sampl subsidiaries such as investment in commercial 
real estate and junk bonds it gives sampls five years to come up 
with extra capital to back the subsidiaries while the subcommittee 
plan doesnt require extra capital 
in another change gonzalez would move back the deadline for 
complying with the new capital rules from the june 1 1990 target 
in the subcommittee bill to the june 1 1991 originally proposed 
by president bush 
rep jim leach of iowa one of the topranking republicans on 
the house banking committee is pressing for even stricter capital 
requirements calling the 15 percent tangible rule absolutely 
utterly insane 
we have made a prescription for repetition of the problem and 
i think the country ought to be alarmed leach told a national 
press club forum 
the senate voted 918 to approve its version of sampl legislation 
last week 
bush praising the vote in a speech in chicago to the annual 
meeting of the associated press said i urge the house to act 
promptly and pass this sampl reform bill with its central provisions 
intact

a treatment that could revolutionize 
organ transplants by overcoming the rejection of foreign tissue and 
improving the quality of patients lives is showing promising 
results researchers say 
the treatment which could eliminate the lifelong need for 
highly toxic drugs to fight organ rejection by the bodys immune 
system may be ready for human studies within three years said dr 
c garrison fathman stanford university professor of medicine 
the approach uses three doses of tailormade laboratorygrown 
monoclonal antibodies before the transplant to temporarily 
blind the immune system and keep it from recognizing the new 
organ as foreign tissue and attacking it 
rats given the treatment before receiving transplanted hearts 
have survived for more than 200 days without signs of rejection and 
without any antirejection drugs 
dr thomas flavin of the stanford department of cardiovascular 
surgery was scheduled to present the findings today at the 
international society for heart transplantation meeting in munich 
west germany 
meanwhile the first full year of mandatory reporting of organ 
transplants by us hospitals shows 12798 of the procedures were 
performed around the country in 1988 according to the national 
transplant network 
the statistics released monday were compiled by the united 
network for organ sharing medical centers have been required since 
oct 1 1987 by federal law to report transplants to the 
virginiabased network 
there were 9123 kidney transplants according to the network 
data there also were 1680 liver transplants 1647 heart 
transplants 243 pancreas transplants 74 heartlung transplants 
and 31 lung transplants twentyone of the lung transplants 
involved a full set of lungs and 10 involved single lungs 
the monoclonal antibody treatment effectively paralyzed the rat 
immune system by killing certain cells while surgeons implanted 
hearts from donor rats into the abdomens of other rats with 
mismatched tissue type leaving the recipients original hearts 
intact 
the drugs a patient must take to prevent the immune system from 
attacking a transplanted organ also prevent the immune system from 
attacking other harmful diseases patients then are susceptible to 
infections and may suffer other problems related to the drugs 
toxicity 
the antibody treatment takes a new approach to the problem by 
creating a transient window of immunosuppression said 
coresearch dr judith shizuru 
the antibody wipes out the specific type of white blood cells 
called cd4 t lymphocytes that lead the attack on the foreign 
organ she said but only mature cells are killed immature t cells 
are protected inside the thymus gland and begin repopulating in the 
body a few weeks after the transplant 
were sort of fooling the immune system for awhile fathman 
said 
were wiping the blackboard clean by removing the mature t 
cells that have not yet come into contact with the foreign antigen 
in this instance the transplant he said 
by transplanting the new organ at a time when those cells are 
absent the t cells repopulating from the immature cells in the 
thymus apparently do not recognize the transplant as anything 
except self he said 
when the t cells grew back the immune system appeared to be 
blind to the foreign transplanted organ but the t cells 
maintained their memory and attacked other foreign tissue 
if the same thing holds in man and we can prove that 
immunologic memory is not impaired by this type of immune 
paralysis then we would be very hopeful that this technique could 
be readily applied to man fathman said

by her count dr ruth barnett performed 
40000 abortions over a halfcentury all during a time when the 
practice was illegal 
police raided her clinic again and again she served two terms 
in the county jail one term in the state prison but insisted 
always i never really broke the law 
she died in 1969 never living to see the us supreme courts 
roe vs wade decision which changed the law to give women a 
constitutional right to an abortion 
now the high court is considering a missouri case that could 
change the landmark abortion ruling on the eve of wednesdays 
opening arguments in the case people who knew barnett remembered 
the doctor and her crusade 
to some she was ruthless ruth to others especially her 
patients she was an angel of mercy 
at age 16 barnett became pregnant and had an abortion in her 
1969 book they weep at my doorstep she told about breaking 
the news of the pregnancy to her boyfriend 
he was sympathetic at first then resentful he was not to 
blame he said you got yourself that way now get yourself out 
of it 
the experience persuaded her to learn a method practiced by one 
of the first female surgeons in the northwest dr alys bixby 
griff barnett was trained to perform abortions and in 1932 she 
was certified as a doctor of naturopathy 
she developed her code of ethics every woman had the right to 
choose a safe sanitary abortion over an unwanted pregnancy 
helen was 18 when she went to see barnett in 1946 today 
shes a grandmother 
i wonder in gods name what would have happened to me without 
dr barnett i was so determined said the woman who spoke on 
condition that her real name not be revealed 
she learned of barnett through a girlfriend her boyfriend gave 
her 400 for the abortion 
never at any time was i ambivalent she said it was no 
choice not prochoice it was a sobering event i didnt take 
it lightly to me it was immoral to get married because you were 
pregnant 
helen married her boyfriend and together had two children 
both welcome both planned she said 
barnetts practice flourished during the depression and through 
world war ii when many women joined the workforce 
but in the 1950s police began to crack down on portlands 
abortion clinics 
police were helped by the oregon journals ace investigative 
reporter rolla j crick 
crick said in an interview that in 1951 he and a policewoman 
posing as his pregnant girlfriend made the rounds of the clinics 
they gave their findings to the district attorney 
on july 6 cricks byline appeared under a banner headline 
police crack down on abortion nests 
crick told how police thundered at the doors of half a dozen 
suspected abortion mills in simultaneous raids partially clad 
women ran screaming from the premises as suspected abortionists 
were hauled into jail 
six people including barnett were charged with manslaughter of 
fetuses by abortion and maintaining a public nuisance as a result 
of the raids 
there were no figures on the number of women injured or killed 
by illegal abortions crick said 
there were some deaths but not wholesale deaths he said 
some women said they wished they hadnt had abortions 
others said hey look its nobodys business he said 
a lot of women were ending up unable to have children because 
of botched abortions it was protecting women against themselves 
he said of the raids 
he said he remembered that barnett ran a clean operation and her 
work was respected by the medical community barnett herself 
claimed 70 percent of her patients were referred by doctors 
barnett was flamboyant often dressing like a showgirl in furs 
and fancy jewels detractors claimed barnett performed abortions 
for the money but others said she performed many abortions for 
free 
during her career she made 9 million but with her resources 
exhausted by high living and legal fees she died at age 77 with 
less than 15000 
only when she was dying of cancer in the oregon womens 
correctional center did she agree not to perform another abortion

president bush today announced his intention 
to nominate william lucas a black republican critic of affirmative 
action as the justice departments civil rights chief setting up 
a potentially bruising senate confirmation fight 
the previously announced opposition to lucas by the naacp the 
nations largest civil rights group could energize liberal 
opposition to the nominee 
benjamim hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said in a statement monday 
that lucas is not qualified to be the governments chief enforcer 
of civil rights laws 
the white house formally announced lucas selection as assistant 
attorney general in charge of the justice departments civil rights 
division in a onesentence statement issued in san jose calif 
where bush had spent the night 
lucas had been pushed for the job by attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
in a statement thornburgh called lucas a talented decent and 
compassionate person whom i have known for a number of years 
bill lucas is fully committed to the vigorous and fair 
enforcement of our countrys civil rights laws and to removing 
barriers to equal opportunity for all our citizens thornburgh 
said 
there are many positions for which mr lucas is eminently 
qualified in this administration hooks said but the civil 
rights job is one of the most sensitive positions in government 
as it relates to minorities and we do not believe mr lucas is the 
person for this post 
hooks said the naacp feels dutybound to strive for the best 
qualified appointee for this most important position 
people for the american way a wellfinanced liberal lobbying 
group also expressed reservations about lucas 
lucas is someone with no track records and a lot of question 
marks the groups president arthur j kropp said 
the questions will have to be resolved before the civil rights 
community can support him said kropp who heads a 270000member 
organization that helped defeat robert borks nomination to the 
supreme court in 1987 
hooks said lucas lacks expertise to be the justice departments 
civil rights chief 
each and every day this official must make crucial decisions 
of a highly technical and critical nature that demand specialized 
knowledge based upon experience and background in this area 
hooks said 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the 
naacps announcement doesnt change a thing for us 
were just disappointed that they chose to ignore not only his 
more than 35 years of public service but also his commitment to 
enforcing the civil rights laws of the country she said 
thornburghs support for bill lucas has been unwavering since 
the announcement of his recommendation to the president she said 
thornburghs friendship and admiration for bill lucas spans a 
number of years 
lucas has been criticized by some civil rights leaders since 
thornburgh revealed in february that he had urged bush to nominate 
him for the position the naacp chapter in lucas hometown of 
detroit voted recently to oppose lucas though the citys urban 
league group decided not to oppose the nomination 
the 61yearold lucas a former sheriff and executive of wayne 
county ran unsuccessfully as the gops nominee for michigan 
governor in 1986 a former democrat lucas has been considered for 
other federal positions in the bush administration 
civil rights leaders have cited lucas record as sheriff to 
demonstrate their view that he is not qualified to run a justice 
department division responsible for prosecuting local police for 
brutality 
in 1976 lucas was held legally responsible by a federal appeals 
court for failure to investigate allegations that a prisoner was 
beaten while in the custody of sheriffs deputies lucas says he 
was unaware of the allegations at the time but the court found he 
had failed to institute training procedures to prevent brutality by 
his deputies 
that same year lucas was cited for contempt of court for 
failing to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the county 
jail 
lucas claim on an old resume that he served as an assistant 
us attorney in the justice departments civil rights division 
during the early 1960s also has sparked controversy 
lucas actually worked as a legal assistant and resigned after he 
failed the district of columbia bar examination 
criticism of lucas has been by no means universal among black 
civil rights leaders the rev joseph e lowery president of the 
southern christian leadership conference sent a letter to 
thornburgh praising lucas selection and recently atlanta mayor 
andrew young expressed support for the choice 
in addition rep john conyers a black democrat from detroit 
also expressed support for lucas conyers is a senior member of the 
house judiciary committee

from prisons and reeducation camps in vietnam 
nguyen chi thien wrote of despair of loved ones and of dreams of 
freedom 
through poetry he found a way to let his thoughts escape from 
the swamplands where he spent nearly half his life 
human rights groups have conflicting reports on thiens fate 
with some sources saying he died in jail and others suggesting he 
remains imprisoned his plight has drawn attention of writers 
around the world and now his works are part of an effort to 
highlight the risks writers take to express themselves 
on wednesday a us chapter of the pen organization a leading 
voice of international literary freedom will honor thien with one 
of two freedomtowrite awards 
the other writer to be honored at the pen american center 
montblanc literary gala is identified only as an anonymous 
african woman 
the very thought that that person is unable to be identified 
says so much about the importance of focusing attention on these 
writers said author john irving a member of pen american center 
we cant even say which country in africa she is from because 
of the dangers she faces that underlines the need for us to turn 
to these heroic people as symbols in the fight against the harsh 
treatment of writers in countries where people are a lot less free 
to write 
in addition to 3000 that the pen american center will send to 
a friend or relative of each recipient the group hopes to pressure 
vietnam with a written request for thiens release and pleas from 
prominent writers 
irving said freedom of expression is not just important to 
writers 
in a world where we have writers who are not free who are 
imprisoned and tortured for writing what happens to the readers in 
these societies 
he said promoting freedom of expression is especially important 
this year because of the controversy over salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses the book considered blasphemous by many 
moslems ignited an international furor and led to calls for 
censorship and for rushdies death 
for thien imprisoned for 26 of his 55 years after opposing the 
communist government pushing for literary freedoms and writing 
articles critical of communism poetry became a creative diversion 
to help him survive prison hardships and the emotional torment of 
captivity 
according to reports from human rights groups thien burst into 
the british embassy in hanoi in april 1979 he gave a staff member 
a collection of poems and a letter asking that they be published 
vietnamese guards arrested him 
his poems have been translated into french and english set to 
music and compiled in a book titled flowers from hell which 
won the prestigious rotterdam international poetry prize in 1985 
when successful it sounds like the depth of feelings from a 
man who has endured much pain but continued to dream and to hope 
for freedom said huynh sanh thong who translated the poems into 
english thong is director of vietnamese studies projects at yale 
university where the book was published 
the londonbased human rights group amnesty international 
received reports that thien had died in 1986 but sources in 
southeast asia have told amnesty international since then that he 
is alive there also have been reports that he is suffering from 
depression and is partially paralyzed

federal officials today opened a hearing aimed at 
explaining how a cargo door was torn off a united airlines jumbo 
jet in february killing nine passengers 
national transportation safety board chairman lee dickinson 
began the fourday hearing with a statement that the testimony 
gathered would assist the ntsb in determining the probable cause 
and in making any recommendations to prevent similar accidents 
but he said any conclusions would await a report issued later in 
washington dc 
the boeing 747s 800pound 9footsquare forward lower cargo 
hatch was left at the bottom of the pacific ocean after united 
flight 811 lost part of its fuselage shortly after takeoff from 
honolulu 
the door was located 85 miles southwest of honolulu and under 
nearly 17000 feet of water 
dickinson has said efforts may be made to raise the door which 
several experts say is the best chance of finding definitive 
answers for the cause of the accident 
investigators are debating whether a navy salvage mission this 
summer would be essential and worth the high cost 
officials for united the boeing co the federal aviation 
administration and unions representing airline pilots and 
mechanics were expected to testify during the hearing 
the boards full report will not be issued for several months 
but recommendations to prevent any recurrence could come at any 
time dickinson said in a news release 
the plane was bound for sydney australia with 337 passengers 
and a crew of 18 on feb 24 at about 23000 feet the airplane 
experienced an explosive decompression following the loss of the 
cargo door 
nine people were sucked out along with seats and luggage when 
the door and part of the aircraft fuselage were swept away 
though two engines conked out pilot david cronin managed to 
land at honolulu with no further loss of life 
the 747100 was one of the first jumbo jets built by 
seattlebased boeing 
the 13 people testifying were expected to discuss maintenance 
inspection procedures and practices human factors and details of a 
1987 incident in which the cargo door on a pan am 747 opened 
slightly during a flight from london 
there has been speculation the united cargo door may have broken 
free in an explosive decompression when the latching mechanism 
failed airline records indicated there had been recent problems 
with the door before the accident including a faulty door seal and 
electrical problems requiring the door to be closed manually rather 
than electrically on several occasions 
the faa on march 3 issued an emergency order requiring all us 
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight 
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel so the doors would be less 
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing 
the cargo bay door is hinged at the top so it closes downward 
with eight latching mechanisms along the bottom attached to the 
planes frame it also has a latching mechanism and a hook pin on 
each side 
the united 747 remains at hickam air force base in honolulu and 
will be returned to service after repairs are completed

the postal inspection service is trying to 
help america stamp out drugs by sending guntoting inspectors to 
deliver arrest warrants along with drugfilled mail 
in fiscal 1988 we arrested 425 people for distributing 
narcotics through the mail inspector tom mcclure said in the 
first six months of this fiscal year we have arrested 440 people 
unlike many government agencies which announce their total drug 
seizures with great fanfare the postal inspectors are so low key 
about their work that the spokesman couldnt come up with the total 
amount of illicit drugs they seized last year 
generally however because of the nature of the mail system 
the postal inspection service doesnt make large seizures that 
could compare with those by other agencies 
in a boat or a container ship or an airliner they can move 
tons in those kind of things he said in the mail you cant do 
that at least not in an individual package 
mcclure declined to give too many details on the services 
operations saying the bad guys read newspapers too 
but he said the service gets help from other agencies such as 
the customs service the fbi the drug enforcement administration 
and local police while developing its own cases through informants 
and other tips 
the services recent finds include 8000 worth of pcp packed in 
baby food jars and being mailed from los angeles to broken arrow 
okla and illicit steroids being distributed by two men in miami 
who were arrested april 17 officials said the latter case which 
involved a twoyear investigation by postal inspectors and the fbi 
was the largest illicit steroid ring ever busted 
the postal inspection service has no idea how much drugs are 
moving through the us mail system because its illegal for the 
agency to inspect the mail without a federal warrant he said 
yet the service presumes the amount is increasing 
theres a direct relationship between the amount of drugs in 
society and the amount being passed through the postal service 
mcclure said when one mode of transporting drugs is shut down 
dealers find new avenues to move the narcotics 
of the 1800 postal inspectors nationwide some 800 do criminal 
investigations including mail fraud child pornography and internal 
theft he said 
the number focusing full time on drugs doubled from 50 to 100 in 
the current fiscal year mcclure said tuesday and when a case 
comes along other inspectors are put to work on it well even 
bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the case 
calls for that he said 
the mailings arent limited to any part of the country he said 
there are mailings from miami to california from new york to 
miami its crazy 
private mail services such as united parcel service and federal 
express are not scrutinized as carefully as the us mail 
spokesmen for both companies said they cooperate with authorities 
on drug investigations but neither would indicate exactly how 
often this has occurred nor whether the companies instigated any 
probes 
the customs service is cooperating with the postal service to 
clear mail from 29 highrisk drug source countries at the port of 
arrival according to dennis shimkoski of customs 
in the first half of fiscal 1989 which began last october 
customs seized 65 pounds of heroin 216 pounds of opium 10 pounds 
of cocaine and 297 pounds of marijuana at the 21 international mail 
branches he said 
in fiscal 1988 customs seized 164 pounds of heroin 1600 
pounds of opium and 1310 pounds of marijuana there were no 
significant amounts of cocaine mailed shimkoski said

it took some doing but lawyers in a 
murder trial managed to pick a smith county jury made up of people 
who werent related 
defense attorney jim dukes asked if any of the 83 prospective 
jurors were related by blood or marriage and about half the people 
in the courtroom stood up were going to have a family reunion 
here in a minute dukes of hattiesburg said monday 
prospective jurors included a husband and wife a father and 
daughter a mother and son several sets of brothers and sisters 
aunts and uncles and numerous cousins some of them as far removed 
as third or fourth 
i would say this would be unusual i dont remember this ever 
happening before said circuit clerk billy tadlock 
a total of 258 people were summoned from smith county as 
prospective jurors for the trial of cecil green who is charged 
with killing a police officer on nov 1 1988 many of the 258 had 
already been excused for other reasons by the time dukes asked 
about relatives monday 
dukes asked the prospects if kinship with other jurors would 
sway their thinking 
if we go in opposite directions i might want to know why 
sure it would be difficult to do vote opposite ways said 
alice evans whose son and brother were also prospective jurors 
put it like this we dont communicate that much 
prospective juror james g mccullum said of his wife brenda s 
mclaurin as the entire courtroom broke into laughter she runs 
her own life and i run mine he said 
mclaurin and evans were among the 12 selected for jury service 
their relatives went home 
evans is not related to the prosecutor in the case district 
attorney bob evans who said he found one of his own cousins in the 
jury pool 
she left early he said

syrian gunners firing giant mortars 
battled christian forces in an illmatched duel tuesday that each 
accused the other of starting in an effort to sabotage a new arab 
peace initiative 
police reported two people were killed and 16 wounded as 
artillery and rockets pounded the lebanese capital for six hours 
the fighting shadowed a peacemaking effort by foreign ministers 
of the 22state arab league who are to meet wednesday in tunis 
christian leader gen michel aoun was reported to have accepted 
a league proposal for 200 arab observers to enforce and monitor a 
ceasefire 
but the plan was jolted when justice minister nabih berri 
rejected having more foreign troops in lebanon where his staunch 
ally syria has 40000 troops under a 1976 league peacekeeping 
mandate 
we dont need more armies berri said tuesday 
his remarks are seen as a rejection by proxy of the arab plan 
from syria lebanons main power broker 
berris shiite moslem amal militia so far has taken no part in 
the fighting between aouns mainly christian troops and an alliance 
of syrian troops and moslem druse militiamen that outgun and 
outnumber the christians 
sheik sabah ahmed kuwaits foreign minister and architect of 
the arab plan left tuesday for tunis declaring we hope our 
lebanese brothers will discern the interests of their people and 
country and stop fighting so that dialogue and wisdom replace 
shells and cannons 
in tunisia the palestine liberation organization announced a 
plan to send its own forces to quell the fighting but the plan is 
not expected to win much support 
observers say who is wrong and who is right but to stop the 
killing of the people we need real forces said plo spokesman 
ahmed abderrahman 
earlier arab attempts to halt the carnage have failed as has a 
un security council appeal monday for an end to the battles that 
erupted march 8 since then at least 272 people have been killed 
and 991 wounded 
pope john paul ii repeated his calls for peace tuesday at a mass 
in the vatican where he invited lebanese clerics and families 
the londonbased mideast mirror newsletter quoted aoun as saying 
he will accept an arab observer force as a first step toward a 
political solution so long as it doesnt include any of the 
participants of the fighting 
the ultimate objective remains ending the syrian and 
israeli occupation of lebanese territory it quoted aoun as 
saying 
some arab states support christian demands that syria withdraw 
because it has violated its mandate by shelling them syria says it 
will not withdraw 
tuesdays random bombardment raged from midnight to daybreak 
forcing tens of thousands of residents to shelter in underground 
bunkers it later slackened into sporadic shelling 
the syrians hammered the east of the city heart of the besieged 
310squaremile christian enclave with 240mm mortars and b21 
launchers that fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds 
beirut shook as aouns forces lobbed 155mm and 130mm howitzer 
and mortar shells into west beirut ambulances with wailing sirens 
sped through rubblestrewn streets 
four shells crashed into the garden of east beiruts comfort 
hotel shattering windows and windshields of five cars of the un 
monitoring force in lebanon a un official said 
in west beirut the facade of the west german cultural goethe 
institute was destroyed 
police said west beiruts sahel hospital was hit but no 
patients were hurt 
the arab league proposes an interim truce to stabilize the 
situation until a political solution is worked out providing for 
presidential elections and the formation of a coalition government

in his first 100 days president bush put the 
imperial trappings of the white house in storage the place now 
rings with the squeal of grandchildren and the clang of horseshoes 
born to wealth and privilege george herbert walker bush brought 
to the executive mansion the downtoearth tastes and attitudes of 
a common person hot dogs and baseball games barbecues and country 
music guided tours of the grounds side trips to tourist 
attractions 
yet for all the bustle of the white house these days the 
nations 41st president often rides about town in a silent 
motorcade politely stopping at red lights to avoid tying up 
traffic 
historians and political analysts may differ over the 
presidents accomplishments in these first 100 days but few will 
deny hes been enjoying every one of them 
bush is sort of a james stewart figure said rep newt 
gingrich of georgia the house republican whip recalling the mix 
of awshucks naivete and stubbornness in the actors 
characterization in the movie classic mr smith goes to 
washington 
the presidents personal style is nice and warm and collegial 
its just the way he is hes also a very tough man gingrich 
said adding reagan was a star bush is more of a senior 
playercoach type 
riding the crest of 60 percentplus approval ratings in public 
opinion polls bush is settling with obvious relish and comfort 
into the job that he long coveted at the same time he has 
eschewed efforts to compare him with his predecessor who also 
scored high in the polls 
i certainly know something about following a class act bush 
told a recent audience 
bush himself can joke that his first 100 days are about the 
same as martin van burens who was forced in his first 100 days 
to deal with one of the nations worst financial panics and the 
long depression that followed and whose name the president enjoys 
invoking 
but bushs constantmotion style gives aides and reporters a 
difficult time keeping up with him 
beginning work each day at 7 am bush routinely puts in 
11hour workdays in the oval office although he also has been 
known to slip away in the middle of the afternoon to play tennis 
jog throw horseshoes or play racquetball in a congressional 
gymnasium 
while he seldom held news conferences during his presidential 
campaign bush has met roughly once a week with reporters since 
taking office in forums ranging from regular news conferences to 
smallgroup chats in the oval office 
hes travelled to four foreign counties and 17 states in his 
first three months in office 
bush set a populist tone on his first full day in office 
opening the white house and its grounds to the public and hes had 
a stream of visitors in ever since among them democratic leaders 
who got little such attention from reagan 
ive been here more since bush has been president than i 
was in eight years under his predecessor said rep jack brooks 
dtexas 
congressional leaders who have met frequently with bush say he 
is a good listener at highlevel meetings but a tough negotiator 
i am amazed at how much at peace with himself he is and 
really knows where he wants to go how he wants to do it said 
his chief of staff john sununu 
sununu said bush has no trouble making quick decisions even 
though the president himself jokes that people say im 
indecisive i dont know about that 
aides and associates say he gives careful attention to detail 
even checking travel manifests to make sure there arent too many 
staff members on trips while always keeping up to speed on the 
issues of the day 
in addition to daily intelligence and national security 
briefings he reads about five papers as far as i can see each 
morning said his wife barbara 
participants at cabinet meetings say the president often stays 
on the sidelines and lets others do most of the talking while 
other times jumping in and vigorously leading the discussions 
he enjoys the give and take said vice president dan quayle 
he enjoys having ideas put forward he enjoys the competition 
of ideas and discussion of policy and where we ought to be going 
bush who as vice president had lunch once a week with reagan 
has carried the custom forward he eats a private lunch each 
thursday with quayle who said he has complete access to bush and 
can go into his office any time he wants 
bush is a much more open gregarious outgoing president than 
weve had in a long time said norman ornstein a political 
analyst with the american enterprise institute 
his early reputation is that this is a president who makes 
things happen once you establish that reputation you are going to 
carry it to your advantage for a long time 
still others have trouble focusing on bushs true political and 
policy identity in all the swirl of activity 
the nonimage is the image he has created for himself said 
tom griscom who was reagans communications director 
bush after all is the president who begins speeches on 
education with the phrase you know who talks about things 
and stuff who frequently stumbles over his own lines 
its been said that sometimes i dont speak in very good 
english and that i have a hard time being understood he told a 
white house audience the other day ill admit it its true and 
all i can say is that im in pretty good company though look at 
yogi berra 
i love to quote yogi bush captain of yales 1948 baseball 
team told another audience 
he once said at a state dinner right here in this building 
how could you get a conversation started in there everybody was 
talking too much 
and if berra the yankee catcher who turned the language on its 
ear is the baseball great that bush quotes the most the one he 
admires the most is another yankee the lowkeyed lou gehrig whom 
bush calls his personal hero 
he played in 2130 straight games a record which still 
stands bush said but more than that he was a good and decent 
man about whom a teammate said every day any day he just went 
out and did his job

the communist partys central committee today 
retired 74 senior members including former president andrei a 
gromyko to make way for a renewal of the partys top policymaking 
body that likely will strengthen president mikhail s gorbachev 
party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a news conference 
the committee unanimously approved 110 requests for retirement by 
central committee members nonvoting committee members and 
members of the partys central revisions committee 
the official tass news agency transmitted a list of the retirees 
that included gromyko who retired as president last fall former 
politburo members geidar a aliev mikhail s solomentsev and 
former candidate politburo member vladimir i dolgikh 
gorbachev has complained opposition to his reform program exists 
within the central committee which has included many officials who 
gained membership before he became party leader in march 1985 
medvedev said 83 members or more than onequarter of the 
300member body have lost the government and party jobs that 
entitled them to central committee membership 
western observers call that group the dead souls and say it 
can be a conservative presence on the central committee 
among those promoted to full central committee membership were 
yevgeny velikhov the vice president of the soviet academy of 
sciences who is believed to be a supporter of gorbachev yuli a 
kvitsinsky an arms control expert who is ambassador to west 
germany and yevgeny primakov director of the institute of world 
economics and international relations 
gorbachev opened the meeting today with a speech on the partys 
program and local organizations tass said 
the full agenda of the oneday meeting was not disclosed but 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said monday that 
the issue of nationalities would not be the main topic of 
discussion 
at least 20 people were killed in soviet georgia on april 9 when 
troops clashed with demonstrators demanding independence and last 
year more than 90 died in the neighboring republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan 
gorbachev has said the central committee will devote a summer 
meeting to policy toward the soviet unions 100 ethnic groups 
todays meeting was the first central committee session since at 
least three dozen top officials across the country were defeated in 
parliamentary elections march 26 
among the losers were the premiers of lativa and lithuania the 
mayor and party chief of kiev and the mayor and no 2 party leader 
of moscow 
the defeats were particularly embarrassing for communists who 
ran unopposed others lost as they faced opponents for the first 
time in the first multiplecandidate races in 70 years 
the central committee has the power to oust members who were 
defeated in their parliamentary bids 
gorbachev portrayed the parliamentary elections for a new 
2250seat parliament as a referendum on perestroika and said party 
and government officials lost because they were restructuring 
slowly 
the central committee laid the foundation for perestroika 
gorbachevs wideranging overhaul of the soviet economy political 
and social systems in april 1985 six weeks after gorbachev became 
party chief

former presidents carter and reagan made 
bureaucratbashing the norm and reagans political appointees at 
the office of personnel management were often hostile to the civil 
service a congressional panel was told tuesday 
the congressional federal government service task force received 
reports from task forces of the national commission on public 
service a private organization that has recommended pay increases 
and other steps to make federal service more attractive 
the commissions task force on recruitment and retention said in 
its report that the personnel management office created by 
congress in 1978 has not met early expectations and remains in 
many ways an agency in search of an identity 
although opm operated for a brief time at the end of the 
carter administration it was president reagan who really shaped 
the early character of opm the task force said 
it said reagans first appointee to head opm donald j devine 
took a political approach to both the position and the agency 
and more than quadrupled the number of political appointees 
increasing them from eight to more than 32 
equally troubling is the fact that the political appointees to 
opm were often actively hostile to the career civil service the 
task force said it charged that the organizations effectiveness 
was severely diminished by low morale among the remaining career 
employees 
rep norman d dicks dwash a cochairman of the 
congressional task force said clearly the publics perception 
of the federal civil service has been influenced by negative 
messages from some elected officials in recent years too many of 
whom have been willing to blame civil servants for the countrys 
problems 
the previous two presidents made bureaucratbashing the 
norm dicks said 
the commission task force said the appointment of constance 
horner as director of opm in 1985 signaled a new direction for 
the agency which in 1987 and 1988 paid serious attention to 
promoting the public service 
there is consensus that opm stands at the crossroads the 
task force said 
one of the commissions recommendations is a sharp decrease in 
the ratio of political to career appointees in the federal 
government 
rep steny h hoyer dmd also a cochairman of the 
congressional task force said that career executives have been 
driven off the leadership team in recent years displaced by 
deepening layers of political appointees 
this is a dangerous trend for the federal government hoyer 
said career executives help assure continuity as political 
appointees change 
paul volcker former federal reserve chairman and chairman of 
the privately financed study group said president bush speaks 
clearly and spontaneously about the value of public service and 
i think that is an indication and a hopeful sign that attitudes 
in this area may be in the process of changing 
the commissions recommendations calling among other things for 
a 50 percent increase over two years in pay for senior federal 
officials judges and members of congress were submitted to the 
president march 29 bush has recommended pay raises for judges but 
has withheld recommendations on other increases

a woman condemned to death for bombing 
a south korean airliner probably will be pardoned even if the 
supreme court upholds her sentence government officials said 
tuesday 
confessed communist agent kim hyon hui was convicted tuesday and 
sentenced to death by a threejudge panel headed by senior judge 
chung sanghwak who said her crime underlined north koreas 
unchanging policy of destroying south koreas freedom 
pyongyang has denied kims assertions that north korean leaders 
ordered her to bomb the korean air passenger plane in 1987 all 115 
people aboard died when the plane disappeared over the andaman sea 
near the coast of burma 
we have an enemy which always tries to destroy our liberal 
democratic system we must face that reality with resolute 
determination chung said in the verdict of the threejudge panel 
kim 27 wept and her shoulders heaved as he pronounced her 
guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and 
sentenced her to death 
south korean law gives kim one week to appeal ahn dongil her 
lawyer said they have not yet decided whether to do so 
relatives of those killed sat quietly in the court watching kim 
as she stood before the judge with downcast eyes she said nothing 
before being led away 
she deserves death because she killed 115 people park 
sonjin 60 whose son was on the plane said after the hearing 
hundreds of security agents and police surrounded the courthouse 
to prevent more angry protests by relatives or a possible threat 
from north korea 
the judge said there is no doubt kim planted the bomb aboard the 
boeing 707 that disappeared nov 29 1987 on a flight from baghdad 
to seoul 
kim has said she blew up the plane on orders from kim jong il 
son and heir of north korean president kim il sung to disrupt the 
seoul olympics 
she has said she wants to die to atone for her sin 
but south korean officials said privately they expect she will 
be reprieved on grounds she was duped by north korea and has 
repented 
court officials said if kim is pardoned she will be free on a 
stay of the sentence similar arrangements have freed other north 
korean agents pardoned under a special amnesty after they switched 
loyalty 
north korea denies involvement in the bombing and claims it was 
engineered by south korea to embarrass the pyongyang government 
the two nations have been bitter rivals since their land was 
divided in 1945 
testimony given by kim corroborated the findings of bomb experts 
who said the plane exploded in less than a second no bodies were 
found 
kim has said she and another agent pretended to be japanese 
tourists and planted the bomb which was disguised as a radio and a 
liquor bottle 
the two were arrested a few days later and tried to take cyanide 
hidden in cigarettes the other agent an elderly man died

three youths attacked morton downey jr in 
an airport bathroom cutting off some of his hair and painting a 
swastika on his head said the controversial tv talk show host 
they sieg heiled me when they left downey told television 
station kofy after monday nights incident at san francisco 
international airport 
downey said one of the youths got me from behind another got 
me around the neck one sat on me 
downey said he was not injured and did not go to a hospital he 
was in san francisco to promote his television show on kofy 
i think i kicked one of them downey said at least i hope 
i did 
airport spokesman ron wilson said police are investigating 
downeys report 
he said officers and medical crews were called for help and 
found downey already in the back of his limousine 
a man who was in the restroom at the same time as downey told 
investigators he did not see any confrontation wilson said the 
only thing that he saw was he did see mr downey walk briskly out 
of the restroom assisted by a couple of young men who had been 
with him they were friends of downey who had traveled in the 
limousine with him 
in an interview at his san francisco hotel room early tuesday 
downey said he thought his attackers were skinheads such as the 
young racists represented and reviled on downeys program 
its the skinheads the same ones who have threatened me for 
so long he said discounting the chance his assailants were from 
san franciscos gay community which has been critical of his 
frequent tirades against homosexuals 
ed walsh kofys news assignment editor said only a small 
portion of downeys hair was cut 
it looks like something a little kid would do to another 
little kid he said kind of like a bald spot i think it was 
done with scissors and the swastika was made with a marker pen 
about the same time as downey said the assault occurred a bomb 
threat forced kofy to go off the air during the time slot for the 
syndicated series the morton downey jr show 
the nature of the threat was not explained the show scheduled 
to begin at 11 pm returned at 1135 pm 
the show was making its first appearance in san francisco since

radio messages recorded the morning the 
exxon valdez ran aground show the ships captain spent up to an 
hour trying to rock the tanker free a move the coast guard says 
could have sunk the ship 
the transcripts were obtained in a freedom of information act 
request by the anchorage daily news which published details today 
the state of alaskas department of environmental conservation 
issued a new analysis saying 112 million gallons of oil spilled 
from the valdez rather than the 101 million originally estimated 
by exxon 
also today exxon corp said 31 lawsuits and 1300 claims 
ranging from 500 to 4 million have been filed against the company 
in the wake of the spill at a meeting of security analysts in new 
york exxon officials declined to put a total dollar value on the 
lawsuits or the claims 
in other developments millions of tiny salmon have been 
released into oiltainted prince william sound and wildlife 
officials were deploying fireworks shotguns and other noisemakers 
to scare migrating birds to safety 
transcripts of march 24 radio messages between coast guard 
commander steve mccall and tanker captain joseph hazelwood indicate 
the skipper tried to free the ship despite warnings the tanker 
might be unstable 
in the first transmission hazelwood informed the coast guard in 
valdez that he was aground leaking some oil and were going to 
be here for a while 
the ships logs indicate the ship ran aground on bligh reef some 
23 minutes earlier the delay in reporting and hazelwoods position 
report are subjects of an investigation 
mccall was rousted from bed to deal with the crisis and 
contacted hazelwood for a situation report 
were working our way off the reef hazelwood said weve 
ah the vessel has been holed and were acertaining right now 
were trying just to get her off the reef and well get back to you 
as soon as we can 
mccall told hazelwood to take it slow and easy and said 
help was on the way 
before you make any drastic attempt to get away make sure you 
dont you know start doing any ripping mccall said you got 
a rising tide i wouldnt recommend doing much wiggling 
a conversation about 1 hours after the first transmission 
indicated the exxon valdezs engines had stopped and apparently the 
effort to free the tanker had halted as well 
there was no immediate indication whether trying to free the 
ship made the problem worse the ship had at least eight major 
holes up to 24feet in diameter 
in my opinion if it had slid off the reef it would have 
sunk mccall said in an interview with the daily news 
with high winds and rough seas hampering the cleanup monday for 
the second straight day the focus was on wildlife as the state 
announced exxon had agreed to build a second otter rehabilitation 
center 
the troop ship uss juneau meanwhile arrived from san diego to 
become a floating mobile base for up to 400 cleanup workers who 
will go out in small boats 
the weather with seas up to 18 feet kept oilskimming boats 
hugging the shore in the sound and the gulf of alaska but a 
fishermens flotilla attacked encroaching oil off the southern tip 
of kenai peninsula near the mouth of cook inlet the boats dragged 
nets with absorbent material sewn into them the way they would 
gather herring this time of year 
they hoped to block a sheen of oil from fishrich kachemak bay 
said loren flagg a retired state biologist helping run the 
unsanctioned effort 
were making a last stand as far as getting fishermen 
involved said flagg this bay is our priority wed like to 
see our effort institutionalized we can get close to shores where 
the big skimmers cant 
proximity also was a factor in opening the second otter 
rehabilitation center in seward about 130 miles southwest of 
valdez 
exxon insisted there was adequate capacity at the valdez center 
to handle otters found outside the sound but the us fish and 
wildlife service argued that transporting the otters to valdez 
would subject them to more stress and diminish their chances of 
survival 
twentyfour million salmon fry have been released since late 
sunday because a new plankton bloom made conditions in the sound as 
good as they will get 
its a little earlier than we expected said heather 
mccarty spokeswoman for the prince william sound aquaculture 
association which owns three hatcheries in the sound it caught 
us a little by surprise we really have no choice but to release 
them now 
more were being released this week once the fish reach a 
certain size they can be harvested by fishermen who pay fees to 
the hatcheries 
with officials counting nearly 3000 birds killed by the 
nations worst oil spill and 15 million expected to arrive soon 
the us fish amp wildlife service said it would begin its 
birdhazing plan today 
crews planned to use propane cannons shotguns loaded with 
special cracker shells whistler bombs and bottle rockets to 
keep the arriving birds away from contaminated areas that have been 
prime nesting areas along the southern alaska coast 
reflective tape also was to be used to keep birds from landing 
in oiled areas

in his first 100 days president bush put the 
imperial trappings of the white house in storage the place now 
rings with the squeal of xpediting us economic and 
military aid and states president reagan personally authorized 
the entire plan 
kozak testimony was in response to questions from subcommittee 
chairman david obey dwis who asserted that his panel had been 
misled or lied to by reagan administration officials when it sought 
to find out at the time whether foreign aid money was being 
indirectly used to help the contras at a time when such aid was 
prohibited 
kozak said he had learned before coming to capitol hill that he 
would be asked about apparent discrepancies between the north trial 
document and what administration witnesses had told congress he 
said he called the white house for guidance on how to respond 
before testifying 
the whole proposed linkage that was included in norths plan 
was disapproved was not made there was no discreet emissary 
kozak said 
in an admissionoffact document prepared by norths lawyers and 
the government north linked a trip of the vice president that 
was planned well in advance of even the preparation of this plan 
publicly announced and which did occur to a secret plan that was 
never appproved kozak told the panel 
bushs talks with highlevel officials including honduran 
president roberto suazo never mentioned the quidproquo link he 
said kozak said he has seen memos outlining the conversations and 
theyre not talking about conditionality of the type that north 
document implies 
kozak said the bush administration has been frustrated at not 
being able to comment on the 42page document since it was 
introduced at norths trial on april 6 but he said he now could 
comment on the admissions because norths jury is now sequestered 
and cant be swayed by his comments 
he said the paper was suggested by judge gerhard gesell who is 
presiding over the north trial and prepared by north and his 
lawyers as an expedient way of managing the trial avoiding 
classification issues avoiding long argumentation and calling 
witnessess over material that might not be relevant to that trial 
when i saw this thing i started walking around my office 
shouting he said it was so distorted so misleading but i 
was told that we had no role in being able to influence the content 
of this document other than to ensure that no classified 
information was in there

a major disagreement within nato over 
disarmament overtures to the east heightened tuesday with west 
germanys insistence on superpower talks on shortrange nuclear 
weapons despite a clear rebuff from washington 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg returned from washington after a failed attempt 
to persuade the united states of a need for talks on the 
shortrange weapons 
us officials held out against the west germans citing fears 
that negotiations on the weapons could lead to their elimination 
and increase the threat from superior east bloc conventional forces 
west germans who in general believe the threat from the warsaw 
pact has been reduced have become increasingly eager for the north 
atlantic treaty organization to speed up disarament talks with the 
soviet bloc 
despite washingtons refusal to budge genscher said west 
germany was sticking to its position and would continue discussions 
within nato to resolve the stalemate 
we are going into the talks with our partners with the same 
position that we have already worked out genscher said 
chancellor helmut kohls conservative government facing 
possible defeat in next years federal elections has been trying 
to woo voters in the face of the growing antimilitary mood 
west germanys opposition party the social democrats turned up 
the heat on kohl to not back down on the issue party chairman 
hansjochen vogel demanded that kohl abide by the national 
consensus 
vogel said shortrange weapons should be ultimately removed from 
west germany 
the debate over shortrange nuclear weapons has created 
divisions within the alliance with a key nato summit just a month 
away 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain who sides with the 
united states in the disagreement is scheduled to fly to west 
germany on sunday and is expected to take up the matter with kohl 
the netherlands once one of the most antinuclear voices in the 
nato alliance also backed the united states 
the dutch view doesnt match the german view as it has now 
been publicized during genschers and stoltenbergs washington 
visit foreign ministry spokesman peter van vliet said tuesday in 
the hague 
but kohl has the support of several other nato countries 
including norway belgium and denmark 
kohl also wants nato to postpone a final decision on the 
alliances plans for upgrading shortrange nuclear weapons and has 
the support of several smaller nato countries 
both genscher and stoltenberg said they were optimistic nato 
would be able to forge a common position on the nuclear weapons 
before its summit in brussels at the end of may neither official 
gave any indication of a breakthrough 
genscher said that during his visit to the united states it 
became clear to him that washington recognizes our right to have 
a say in this matter 
most of natos shortrange nuclear weapons 88 lance launchers 
with a range of up to about 75 miles are based in west germany 
because of their short range the nucleartipped missiles are 
designed to be used almost exclusively on german soil 
genscher also said he believes that west germanys view on 
shortrange weapons will have a significant effect on the 
formulation of a common position within the alliance but he 
did not elaborate 
kohls government in a surprise move announced last week that 
it favors prompt superpower negotiations on reducing shortrange 
nuclear weapons just a week earlier the warsaw pact made a 
detailed proposal for starting up such talks 
us officials have said they fear the warsaw pact may be trying 
to drive a wedge among nato nations with a flurry of recent 
disarmament proposals

sales of existing homes dropped 43 percent in 
march the third straight monthly decline as rising mortgage 
interest rates made more inroads into the housing market a real 
estate trade group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
singlefamily homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
333 million units in march the slowest pace since february 1988 
sales had dropped 2 percent in february and 94 percent in 
january 
the march figures were the latest in a series of reports that 
indicate rising interest rates are slowing the economy and taking a 
toll on home sales and residential construction last week the 
government reported that construction of new homes and apartments 
declined 54 percent in march the second straight monthly decline 
because housing usually slows down in advance of other sectors 
of the economy the weak performance has heightened fears that a 
recession could come later this year or in early 1990 the federal 
reserve board for a year has been pushing up interest rates as part 
of a campaign to slow the economy and keep inflation in check 
this is another piece of evidence that things are softening 
and that high interest rates do make a difference maury harris 
chief economist for painewebber inc said of the latest housing 
report 
fixedrate home mortgages averaged between 1086 percent and 
1122 percent in march up a full percentage point from a year 
earlier according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
ira gribin president of the realtors said the higher rates are 
having their biggest impact on firsttime home buyers he said they 
are the first to leave the market and the last who are able to 
get back in 
with fewer sales last month to firsttime buyers the median 
price of existing homes sold rose 1200 to 93100 meaning half 
the homes sold for more and half for less 
what we are seeing is definitely a tradeup market said 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the realtors people still 
in the market are those with the incomes to withstand higher 
monthly mortgage payments resulting from higher interest rates 
economist lyle gramley of the mortgage bankers association said 
that while further declines lie ahead for the housing industry 
this is not a collapse of the housing market 
monetary policy used to clobber the housing market gramley 
said now its nibbling gently on the fringes 
gramley said slower growth is just what the doctor ordered 
to dampen inflationary pressures and keep the economic expansion 
alive 
by region the sharpest decline in home sales last month was in 
the northeast where the resale pace was down 10 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 540000 units sales in the 
northeast had declined 155 percent during february 
sales last month were down 76 percent in the midwest to an 
annual rate of 850000 units and fell 31 percent in the south to a 
rate of 127 million units the only increase was recorded in the 
west where sales rose 47 percent to an annual rate of 670000 
units

the espionage conviction of richard miller 
the only fbi agent ever convicted of spying was overturned by a 
federal appeals court today because of the use of liedetector 
evidence at his trial 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the jury should 
not have been told the results of millers polygraph examinations 
which concluded that he was lying about his motives 
the polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of millers 
later admissions of wrongdoing the heart of the prosecutions 
case the court said in a 30 ruling 
the decision entitles miller to a new trial on charges that he 
spied for the soviet union 
miller was convicted in june 1986 of passing secrets to the 
soviets through his lover svetlana ogorodnikova in return for 
promises of 65000 in cash and gold he was sentenced to two life 
terms plus 50 years in prison 
she and her husband nikolay ogorodnikov pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms 
us attorney robert bonner was informed of the ruling while 
attending a speech by president bush on a ranch in riverside county 
oh really bonner said well obviously want to take a 
look at the 9th circuit opinion we may reappeal and we have other 
means if those fail we will retry the case well deal with it 
when we see the decision bonner said 
joel levine a los angeles lawyer who represented miller 
reacted by noting the time miller has spent behind bars since his 
arrest were very very pleased but we would be more pleased if 
we didnt have to go through five years waiting for a fair trial 
with a client in custody 
miller a 20year fbi veteran was portrayed by prosecutors as a 
bitter vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy the defense 
described him as a wellmeaning fbi misfit who dreamed of redeeming 
his career by infiltrating the soviet spy network in the united 
states 
he was charged with furnishing a clasified document called the 
positive intelligence reporting guide which sets forth annual us 
intelligence needs to his lover for delivery to the soviet 
consulate in san francisco in august 1984 
in reversing his conviction the appeals court ruled there were 
several errors by us district judge david kenyon who presided 
over the trial in los angeles 
one was kenyons decision to admit evidence of liedetector 
tests that the fbi gave miller during the investigation of the case 
miller insisted during the questioning that his actions were 
intended to benefit the fbi but the polygraph examiner told him he 
had failed the tests shortly afterward miller said for the first 
time that he had given a classified document to mrs ogorodnikova 
at trial he contended his admission was false 
over defense objections kenyon allowed evidence of the results 
as well as the questions and answers of millers liedetector test 
saying those tests had set the scene for his disputed admission 
about the document 
the appeals court in an opinion by judge dorothy nelson noted 
that liedetector results are generally prohibited as evidence of 
the truthfulness of the person being questioned because of doubts 
about the reliability of the device 
liedetector evidence can be admitted for other purposes in 
limited circumstances nelson said in several cases a jury has 
been told that a defendant confessed after being told he failed a 
polygraph but she said millers jury was told much more damaging 
information 
nelson also said kenyon improperly admitted evidence that miller 
had once bribed an fbi informant in addition she said testimony 
by a man presented by the government as an expert on soviet 
intelligence and recruiting tactics was improperly used to attack 
millers character 
judges stephen reinhardt and diarmuid oscannlain joined the 
opinion

neighbors of the house where anne 
frank hid from the nazis are waging a campaign against a projected 
renovation of the building now a top tourist attraction 
fearing loss of privacy as well as inconvenience caused by 
construction work residents of the central amsterdam district 
housing the last home of the worldfamous teenage nazi victim have 
written a letter protesting the fouryear renovation plan 
the dutch capitals agency for the preservation of monuments is 
also opposed to the project with its director saying the plan will 
destroy the memories it conveys 
at issue is an urgently necessary project to create sufficient 
room for the anne frank houses 560000 annual visitors said 
nico salm a spokesman for the foundation that owns the building 
pending city hall approval the 6 million renovation is to 
start in january salm said in an interview tuesday 
anne frank was a jewish girl whose posthumously published diary 
on her lifeinhiding in an annex behind the amsterdam canal house 
gained her a worldwide audience in the closing weeks of world war 
ii she died in the bergenbelsen concentration camp at the age of 
15 after having been caught in 1944 
the museum not only tells the story of annes short life 
including a display of the annex in its original state but also 
stages exhibitions on topics related to racism and repression 
opened in 1960 and consisting of two 18footwide canal houses 
built in the 18th century the museum needs to be rearranged 
internally to improve access to the annex and the other displays 
salm said 
right now throngs of visitors are completely jamming the 
premises so that the museum is almost collapsing under its own 
success salm said under the new plan the space dedicated to 
the exhibition is to be tripled 
the renovation project is not aimed at attracting even more 
visitors but to create a better atmosphere and more space for the 
same amount of them said salm who noted that on some busy 
summer days the museum is closed down for hours at a time to avoid 
traffic jams inside 
in their letter the neighbors said a planned allglass 
extension in the museums garden which borders their houses will 
lead to an unacceptable loss of privacy and a decline in the 
value of their real estate 
they said they feared the construction work involved in the 
project will cause inconvenience for years to come a copy of 
the letter was obtained by the associated press but none of the 
signatories was available for comment 
jan dekkers the director of amsterdams bureau for monument 
preservation said the 1116squarefoot garden extension which is 
to be used as an exposition and lecture hall is simply too 
brazen it will definitely destroy the authenticity of the 
complex of the memories it conveys 
mels crouwel the architect of the renovations said that all 
possible care has been taken to avoid vistas by the public into the 
neighboring gardens 
the rest of the work will involve extensive renovations 
maintenance and a complete reshuffle of the displays as well as 
conservation of the annex where anne and her family lived from 
194244 
tipped off by a nazi collaborator the german police raided the 
annex in august 1944 and anne her sister and their parents were 
among the estimated 100000 dutch jews deported to the 
extermination camps during the fiveyear nazi occupation of the 
netherlands 
only 10 percent of those returned after the war among them 
annes father otto who published his daughters diary in 1947 
since then the book has been translated into dozens of languages 
and millions of copies have been sold

four activists were arrested 
today after they sealed themselves into an office at the burroughs 
wellcome inc headquarters to protest the price of an aids drug 
weve been trying to deal with this company for two years 
said peter staley one of the four men led in shackles from the 
building 45 minutes after the takeover began 
the activists were charged with trespassing and damage to 
property 
the pharmaceutical company produces retrovir which costs 
patients or their insurers 8000 to 10000 a year making it the 
most expensive drug ever marketed formerly known as 
azidothymidine or azt the drug is the only us 
governmentapproved medicine aimed at halting the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the four protesters who are scheduled for a may 4 court 
appearance are members of the new yorkbased aids committee to 
unleash power said jay blotcher a spokesman for the group he 
said staley 28 is a former wall street bond trader who has 
aidsrelated symptoms 
staley who said the activists were unarmed and nonviolent 
said they intended to maintain their takeover until their demands 
were met 
we want a 25 percent reduction of the price of azt said 
staley we want them to subsidize the government assistance 
program on azt 
burroughs wellcome spokeswoman kathy bartlett said the protest 
was misdirected because we have been trying for three years to 
get aids therapy to people suffering the disease 
dan baker another actup spokesman said sheriffs deputies and 
burroughs wellcome guards broke down a nonpermanent wall to get to 
the activists who had chained themselves to a door he said his 
group would pay for damages 
baker claimed burroughs wellcome made an 80 percent profit on 
the drug ms bartlett said burroughs wellcome had never released 
figures on its profit and she didnt know where the 80 percent 
figure came from 
tests on azt showed it can stop the aids virus from replicating 
but does not cure patients an estimated 8 percent of aids patients 
being tested died while on the drug compared with 40 percent who 
died while taking a placebo during a ninemonth test period 
the drug also increasingly is being prescribed for patients who 
test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus but have not 
developed any of the infections or cancers that kill aids patients 
the us centers for disease control have estimated 15 million 
americans are infected with the virus

washington law firm which told the panel the witnesses would not 
be available

the government moved tuesday to halt a 9dayold 
student protest for democracy and a free press urging them to go 
back to class and disband their fledgling unions and warning 
workers to stay on the job 
in a harsh editorial read on the televised nightly news and 
hourly on the radio the communist party called for a swift end to 
the student movement the biggest since the revolution of 1949 
this is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and 
chinese citizens the editorial said this is a planned 
conspiracy that aims at negating the leadership of the party 
and the socialist system 
it called the student unions illegal and said new demonstrations 
would be suppressed the unions were set up this week to replace 
the staterun student organizations 
this is their first step said a beijing university student 
as the editorial was played repeatedly over loudspeakers on campus 
we can expect arrests to come soon 
students and student leaders said they would defy the editorial 
it makes me sick to hear this said one student at beijing 
normal university speaking on condition of anonymity this is 
just this kind of propaganda and lies we are fighting 
at least 50000 students have boycotted class since the strike 
began monday they plan to maintain the boycott at least until may 
4 the 70th anniversary of chinas first prodemocracy student 
movement 
they also said they would persist in calling for talks with the 
government to discuss demands for a free press more funds for 
education and the publication of the financial records of chinas 
leaders many also want senior leaders such as premier li peng and 
deng xiaoping to resign 
about 10000 soldiers from a special force for suppressing civic 
disturbances took up positions in many buildings near university 
campuses students and chinese sources said 
police and agents from the ministry of security also occupied 
apartments in the univerity area the northwest corner of beijing 
sources said 
the government took steps to keep workers from supporting the 
twoday student class boycott warning them that sympathy strikes 
would not be tolerated 
im all for what the students are demanding said a worker 
reading a poster on the street outside beijing university i 
really think the government is no good 
another worker who used his lunch break to hear speeches by 
university students said many workers are sympathetic to the 
students but they dont dare take part 
he said his factory and others were given orders to keep the 
workers in line 
many workers back the student movement because of its criticism 
of corruption which runs rampant in chinas staterun factories 
the students also have won sympathy among many journalists 
whose statecontrolled publications have been barred from 
publishing news of the class boycott only two newspapers have 
mentioned the student marches for democracy 
authorities banned this weeks edition of the shanghaibased 
world economic herald after it apparently printed material critical 
of the government 
universities throughout beijing also tried to force the tens of 
thousands of striking students back to class some schools 
threatened students with expulsions others issued warnings of 
unspecified punishment 
the protest is the latest in a series of student actions 
triggered by the april 15 death of ousted communist party chief hu 
yaobang hu was purged after he was accussed of being too soft on 
students during prodemocracy protests in 198687 
on friday and saturday about 150000 people marched to 
tiananmen square in one of the biggest protests since the communist 
victory in 1949 the demonstrations are the clearest rejection yet 
by chinese students of the communist system 
for the first time tuesday bands of students ventured into the 
citys center to distribute leaflets calling for democracy freedom 
and a free press they positioned themselves outside the railroad 
station and at two busy intersections with collection boxes and 
microphones to persuade their countrymen of the righteousness of 
their cause 
comrades our struggle is just beginning and we must have your 
support yelled a bespectacled physics student at the xidan 
intersection we are fighting for a new china down with 
corruption and dictatorship

iran while trying to rescue american hostages 
on a brilliant blue morning on a hillside in arlington national

the federal national mortgage association said 
tuesday it is beginning a pilot project aimed at providing up to 
100 million for creative home mortgages for the elderly 
the program is aimed at making housing more available and 
affordable for the elderly with mortgages that reduce housing costs 
or allow senior citizens to supplement their income by taking 
advantage of the equity in their current homes 
vice president david p riordan said fannie mae would encourage 
lenders to offer these mortgages to the elderly and commit to 
buying up to 100 million in the mortgages on the secondary market 
fannie mae which is congressionally chartered is the nations 
largest investor in home mortgages 
the program will provide mortgages for accessory apartments 
within a singlefamily home which an elderly person could then 
rent for extra income temporary housing units built on a family 
members property homes shared by a senior citizen and one or more 
other adults and the sale of a home by an elderly person to a 
family member or investor who then rents it back to the seller 
david o maxwell fannie mae chairman said it will alter 
underwriting standards as part of the project permitting lower 
down payments on certain types of mortgages and including net 
rental income as part of a borrowers qualifying income 
riordan said the loans are offered now on a sporadic basis if at 
all and that fannie mae hopes to encourage the availablility of 
the loans and determine which are most successful he said the 100 
million represents a significant commitment to elderly housing 
to qualify a person must be 62 or older

the supreme court in a ruling welcomed in 
western states said tuesday states may tax businesses for oil and 
gas extracted from indian reservations 
in a 63 decision in a case from new mexico the justices said 
such taxes neither illegally infringe on the rights of indians nor 
do they amount to illegal multiple taxation 
the court upheld new mexicos authority to tax oil and gas taken 
from the jicarilla apache reservation there the levies were 
challenged by cotton petroleum inc which also pays taxes to the 
tribe for the extracted minerals 
todays ruling is a substantial and rather profound victory 
for the state of new mexico said gov garrey carruthers 
new mexico collects about 19 million a year in such socalled 
severance taxes from oil and gas and coal production on indian land 
in new mexico 
the court ruling also is good news for officials in arizona 
montana and utah there are some 150 cases in the four states in 
which businesses with indian mining leases say they are victims of 
illegal multiple taxation by a state and a tribe 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court rejected 
arguments that the new mexico tax interferes with tribal economic 
development by prompting producers to look off indian reservations 
for mineral deposits 
he said a 1938 federal law the indian mineral leasing act does 
not specifically preempt the power of states to tax oil and gas on 
indian lands 
any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation 
of onreservation oil and gas resources by indian tribes is 
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support a claim the 
state tax is preempted stevens said 
he also said that cotton petroleum which has a lease with the 
apaches for oil and gas on the reservation is not subject to 
unfair double taxation 
it is of course true that the total taxes paid by cotton are 
higher than those paid by offreservation producers he said 
but neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax 
the burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact 
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental 
entities share jurisdiction 
the high court in 1982 ruled that the jicarilla apaches may 
impose their own severance tax on oil and gas extracted from their 
reservation 
stevens noted tuesday that new mexico provides services to 
cotton petroleum on the reservation 
there is no constitutional requirement that the services the 
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays 
stevens added 
the constitution does not demand that benefits received from a 
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer must equal the 
amount of its tax obligations he said 
finally stevens said the apache tribe is not a state and 
therefore cotton petroleum is not subject to multiple state 
taxation 
in a dissenting opinion justice harry a blackmun said new 
mexico is increasing its revenue at the expense of tribal 
economic development that violates federal policy expressed in 
laws and regulations to protect indian selfdetermination he said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
cotton petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 
15000 acres of land on the jicarilla apache reservation 
the company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent 
of its production and new mexico levies taxes on the company 
amounting to 8 percent of its production 
cotton petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state 
with deposits taken from nonindian land only pay 8 percent in 
taxes 
the company said it paid 23 million in taxes to new mexico 
from 1981 through 1985 but received only 89000 in services from 
the state 
the jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case it 
filed a friendofthecourt brief expressing its opposition to the 
state taxes 
in other decisions the court 
upheld a 1986 federal law imposing safety user fees on 
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous 
liquids in a case from oklahoma the court said the law does not 
give the executive branch too much of congress power to impose 
taxes 
tossed out a dispute from minnesota over the federal 
governments power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of 
winners in privately run lotteries the court said the case is moot 
because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban

at a tavern in coburg theres pickled 
spotted owl egg and fried or broasted spotted owl on the menu 
an oakridge tavern held a spotted owl dinner two weeks ago and 
attracted a big crowd 
a springfield man plans to market spotted owl jerky 
the food isnt really owl meat but the spoofs are signs of how 
high emotions are running in oregons timber country over the 
northern spotted owl and its habitat in oldgrowth forest coveted 
by loggers 
bill allison publisher of high lead magazine in eugene said 
hes sold more than 600 tshirts that feature a hairy logger 
carrying an owl on a tray with the caption save a logger eat an 
owl 
despite the protestations the us fish and wildlife service 
said today in washington dc it will tell a federal court in 
seattle next week that protection of the spotted owl as a 
threatened species is warranted 
listing a species as threatened is slightly less restrictive 
than listing a species as endangered said george leonard 
associate chief of the us forest service however it still could 
lock loggers out of much of the oldgrowth forest west of the 
cascade range in oregon and washington 
the fish and wildlife service earlier decided against listing 
the owl as endangered but a reassessment was ordered by us 
district judge thomas zilly in seattle zilly found the earlier 
decision was not supported by evidence compiled by fish and 
wildlife 
under the endangered species act a species is considered 
endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a 
significant part of its range a species is considered threatened 
if it is likely to become an endangered species in the 
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its 
range 
rolla anderson who works at the bohemia inc plywood plant in 
vaughn has written a poem about the owl in it he tells of a man 
seeing a spotted owl contentedly sitting on a limb in a stand of 
oldgrowth trees 
even tho i soon may lose my job 
and stand to lose my home 
i cant explain the peace i felt 
like none ive never known 
standing there in that quiet place 
far from the sound of cars 
i looked around took careful aim 
then blew his brains to mars 
environmentalists who say the owl is faced with extinction 
because of logging and timber industry representatives who say the 
trees are needed to keep the industry alive in the northwest agree 
that the spotted owl dinners tshirts and poems are signs of 
frustration and fear 
karen wood of the environmental group earth first said antiowl 
sentiment has been caused by the timber industry 
they find it convenient to turn their workers heads around 
and say look its that owl thats taking your job when theyre 
sending logs overseas she said 
its just a fear thing and i hope workers can look beyond the 
fear to see whats happenning 
allison said hes received only one complaint about his 
tshirts that came from a timber industry official who said the 
shirts are inappropriate and thought it would be better to show an 
owl or other wildlife living in harmony with good forest practices 
allison accuses both sides of tunnel vision 
the spotted owl is a means to an end he said if it 
wasnt that it would be the pigtailed titmouse the 
environmentalists goal is to save old growth 
as for the timber industry he said how can people like 
weyerhaeuser send logs to japan then go bid on federal timber 
thats not fair 
anderson said he really doesnt advocate shooting spotted owls 
but he lost his job in california when redwood national park was 
established 
i just kind of got a new start and id hate to see it go down 
the tubes here he said 
im not so dumb that i think the owl is the only problem he 
said theyre shipping logs overseas i realize that there 
might be a poem coming on that one of these days 
the owl gets focused on he said because its kind of a 
symbol

a federal judge has ordered the city to 
build a 32 million high school to attract white suburban students 
into a mostly black area as part of a desegregation plan 
it will be the most phenomenal high school facility in the 
nation said arthur a benson ii attorney for the plaintiffs in 
the school desegregation case 
it would cost twice as much as an average high school and 
include whirlpool baths racquetball and handball courts and a 
50meter indoor swimming pool 
the state which would pay much of the cost of building and 
equipping the central high school opposed the order arguing that 
the athletic facilities proposed were extravagant 
although the central design is more extensive than any other 
high school in the kansas city area such facilities are necessary 
to attract nonminority suburban students to the inner city to 
accomplish the difficult task of desegregating central high 
school said the order from us district judge russell g clark 
clarks order was dated april 20 and received monday by the

wages and salaries paid american workers in 
private industry rose 42 percent in the last 12 months the 
biggest jump in 3 years the government said tuesday in a report 
that showed increasing inflationary pressures from tight labor 
markets 
but the labor departments employment cost index and other 
economic reports issued tuesday brought mixed predictions of 
whether a recession is inevitable or could be averted by slower 
growth in the record seventh year of the economys expansion 
economist david wyss of data resources inc noting a number of 
recent reports that point to a slowdown in economic expansion said 
he believed growth had eased enough to convince the federal reserve 
board that further credit tightening would not be needed to fight 
inflation 
wyss said credittightening already done by the federal reserve 
may be enough to postpone a recession for up to two years 
its sort of like death you cant cure it you can only 
postpone it wyss said i dont think weve solved the problems 
of the business cycle 
but chief economist allen sinai of boston co economic advisers 
inc said he was looking for the next downturn to begin within a 
year as inflationary pressures mount 
what is happening is that wages and salaries are picking up 
because of the tight labor market i think there is an increasingly 
embedded upward tilt in wage compensation and overall employment 
costs sinai said there is a recession in there somewhere 
others however predicted that inflation would ease as the 
economy slows to a sustainable pace and that the federal reserve 
then would ease its tight hold on credit to help the economy into a 
soft landing 
i dont think were headed to a recession said paine webber 
economist maury harris the feds going to be able to head this 
thing off at the pass before it gets out of hand 
in other economic news tuesday 
the government reported that orders to us factories for big 
ticket durable goods rose a moderate 08 percent in march after 
two months of big declines reflecting a rebound in orders for 
transportation equipment excluding that volatile category orders 
were down for the third straight month declining 28 percent 
the evidence is mounting that the economy has slowed down 
data resources economist roger brinner said of that report 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
homes dropped for the third straight month in march to the slowest 
pace in more than a year that news came a week after the 
government reported the second straight monthly decline of newhome 
construction both declines are blamed on rising mortgage rates 
firsttime buyers are simply locked out of the market by 
unaffordable financing said ira gribin president of the 
realtors 
the labor department reported that major collective bargaining 
settlements reached in private industry in the first quarter 
provided for average wage increases of 31 percent over the life of 
the contracts that figure was up from average annual wage gains of 
22 percent in contracts settled in the preceding quarter 
taken together analysts said that the four reports contained 
few surprises but confirmed that inflation continues to grow as the 
economy slows 
if labor costs are rising and this data shows that they are 
price inflation can hardly be less than that it has to be more 
said sinai 
said wyss i think all the reports are basically good news for 
the fed which has been trying to slow growth to ease inflation 
he said the wage gains were higher than the central bank would 
prefer but added its hard to panic about it 
the 42 percent increase in privatesector wages and salaries in 
the year ending march 31 was the highest 12month jump since a 48 
percent advance reported for the year ending sept 30 1985 
it followed an equally disturbing 41 percent rise in wages for 
the 12 months ending in december by comparison wages had risen 
33 percent for the year ending in march 1988 
overall privateindustry employment costs which include 
benefits paid by employers in addition to wages and salaries rose 
46 percent over the last 12 months compared to 39 percent in the 
preceding year 
there is unequivocal evidence of a gradual upward movement in 
labor costs said jerry jasinowski executive vice president and 
chief economist for the national association of manufacturers 
the employment cost index is closely watched because it gives a 
broad view of possible inflationary pressures on business costs 
for the first quarter overall compensation costs in private 
industry rose 13 percent up from 10 percent in the final quarter 
of 1988 but down from the 15 percent increase in the first quarter 
a year ago when a 5 percent rise in social security taxes boosted 
benefit costs 
workers in the fastgrowing serviceproducing industries 
received average wage and salary increases of 51 percent over the 
last 12 months compared to average 31 percent pay gains by 
workers in goodsproducing jobs the labor department said 
the rate of wage gains for nonunion workers continued to 
outpace pay increases for union workers although wages for union 
workers remain higher

the united states accused the soviet union on 
tuesday of trying to undermine natos nuclear defense and 
instructed us ambassadors in western capitals to counter a west 
german drive for negotiations to scale back shortrange nuclear 
missiles 
the us offensive is designed to rally the north atlantic 
treaty organization against any reduction in nuclear battlefield 
weapons before president bush meets with the 15 allied leaders in 
brussels at the end of may 
west german chancellor helmut kohl trying to counter growing 
support for disarmament in his country sent defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher to 
washington for talks monday to try to persuade the bush 
administration tn negotiate with the soviets over the missiles 
but secretary of defense dick cheney and secretary of state 
james a baker iii turned the west germans down saying it would be 
a mistake to risk cutbacks in the shortrange nuclear missiles and 
artillery guns that fire nucleartipped shells while the soviets 
held an advantage in nonnuclear forces in europe 
cheney described such negotiations as a dangerous trap but 
kohl whose political future could hinge on the missile issue is 
not backing off and will present his position formally to the west 
german parliament on thursday 
in the meantime the state department sent cables to the 
american ambassadors in all the nato capitals instructing them to 
present the us argument against negotiations to the foreign 
ministries there a us official said 
the presentations known technically as demarches are 
designed to forestall a drift toward the west german position 
which already enjoys some support in norway belgium the 
netherlands and denmark 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said west 
german ambassadors were expected to mount a campaign for support in 
all nato capitals as well 
also rozanne l ridgway the assistant secretary of state for 
european affairs will present the us position to senior 
officials of spain greece and france in madrid on may 16 
that is two weeks before bush and the leaders of the nato 
countries hold a summit meeting in brussels 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said it 
would be helpful if the missile dispute could be resolved before 
the meeting there is more to discuss at the summit than snf 
shortrange nuclear forces she said 
but ms tutwiler who consulted with baker said the 
discussions will continue and launched into an attack on the 
soviet union 
the soviets clearly want to denuclearize and undermine natos 
flexible response and forwarddefense strategies she said 
negotiations would provide them an opportunity to promote a third 
zero 
the battlefield nuclear missiles are considered part of a 
flexible strategy designed to keep the soviets offbalance the 
theory is that uncertainty whether nato would use nuclear weapons 
deters a soviet attack 
the 1987 ussoviet treaty banning intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles eliminated two categories of nuclear rockets in europe 
this is known as the doublezero 
the statement read by ms tutwiler at bakers direction refers 
to a third category of missiles those with a range below 315 
miles and us determination to keep them in europe 
the soviets have already modernized their nuclear weapons and 
the alliance must also maintain uptodate forces she said

suggestion by prime minister david lange of new zealand that his 
country may pull out of a security alliance with the united states 
because of his nations antinuclear policies 
that is new zealands prerogative said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler but she added we take exception 
to the prime ministers assertions that such action is justified by 
the united states refusal to consult with new zealand in 
accordance with terms of the anzus pact 
anzus created in 1951 as a defense alliance among the united 
states australia and new zealand has been crippled since the 
united states suspended guarantees for new zealands defense in 
1986 over the pacific nations ban of ships carrying nuclear 
weapons us policy is neither to confirm nor deny the existence 
of nuclear weapons on its vessels 
even if new zealand does pull out anzus would continue to 
exist as the foundation of our important and active security 
relationship with australia said a state department statement 
we continue to hope that new zealand will reassess its 
antinuclear policies which would enable it to return to full 
participation in anzus the statement said 
the rift between the two countries led the united states to stop 
sharing intelligence information with new zealand and to cool its 
diplomatic relations with the embassy here 
speaking at yale university monday lange said his countrys 
security relationship with the united states is a dead letter 
but the state department disputed that view saying that the 
us continues to maintain a security relationship with new 
zealand albeit much diminished from the close military and 
intelligence ties existing prior to the current dispute 
observers here have noted that despite langes outspoken 
comments at yale and in several interviews he has granted since 
arriving for a sixday visit he has also emphasized that overall 
relations between the two countries are good lange has stressed 
that trade and tourism have grown 
responding to that tone the state department said the united 
states and new zealand now enjoy a constructive relationship on a 
range of issues in which we share common goals and objectives 
we regret however that the prime ministers remarks did not 
more constructively address our difference of opinion on issues 
raised by new zealands antinuclear policies it said 
lange said monday he would not come to washington because the 
us administration had made it clear he was not welcome until his 
government renounced its antinuclear policies

the government said tuesday that a severe 
gas shortage has closed some stations and caused long lines at the 
pumps forcing poland to look to the west for extra gas supplies 
the government blamed a 20 percent jump in gasoline consumption 
on the end of gas rationing jan 1 a mild winter that allowed more 
cars on the road and the governments refusal to allow prices to 
rise high enough to discourage demand 
if we were persistent in introducing the market economy 
prices would surely regulate the problem of lines said deputy 
government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski 
concern about gas shortages and price increases began spreading 
across warsaw by word of mouth last week 
confirmation came tuesday in official newspaper reports the 
government would tap hard currency supplies to buy about 163 
million gallons of gasoline from sweden austria and east germany 
gas imports planned for the first half of this year from the 
soviet union polands largest supplier arrived early and were 
used up ahead of schedule the express wieczorny newspaper reported 
tuesday 
it will be several weeks before the new gas reaches poland and 
eases the supply problems said krzysztof pilich deputy manager of 
the state oil department 
but pilich said rationing would not be introduced again 
when rationing ended the ministry of industry warned that 
prices would increase if sales of gasoline outstripped supplies 
the price at the time was 190 zlotys a liter or 146 per 
gallon the price has been raised to 250 zlotys a liter 
the average monthly salary is about 127 to 175 
disgruntled drivers waiting tuesday at a warsaw gas station had 
differing opinions about the cause of the shortage which is being 
widely discussed in the informal network that keeps residents up to 
date on supplies of goods 
i think it is a matter of bad distribution said one man 
another who had waited for four hours without success the night 
before said he thought the government had created the shortage to 
keep people from moving around the country during upcoming 
elections the first since 1947 
i think it is done on purpose and a lot of people share this 
view he said 
rykowski said there could be some distribution problems but poor 
planning did not cause the shortage instead he said it stemmed 
from a failure for justifiable social reasons to use higher 
prices to suppress demand in the style of a marketbased economy 
i am saying this with certain terror because i know that these 
sorts of moralizing speeches are met with rejection he said at 
the news conference 
i dont intend to continue this sermonizing and point out that 
in countries with a marketoriented economy when someone drives to 
work he calculates how much that costs he said

activists said they canceled a 
proindependence rally tuesday after authorities told them it could 
spark a repeat of the bloody confrontation with soldiers in which 
20 people died 
there is a danger the tanks will charge again and the 
soldiers will shoot so we postponed the meeting said david 
nadiradze a lawyer who advocates the secession of the republic of 
georgia from the soviet union 
nadiradze said independence activists received the warning from 
sympathetic police officers and political leaders advised that the 
curfew and state of emergency that brought soviet soldiers into the 
city could be reinstated 
about 5000 people appeared at the flowercovered square in 
front of government house on tuesday young people holding flowers 
candles or black flags of mourning guarded a shrine at the crash to 
the victims of the april 9 clash 
but no one stood up to address the group 
irakli shengalaya head of the society of national justice an 
informal political group said he and other activists decided to 
postpone the demonstration after georgian interior minister shota 
gorgodze warned earlier tuesday that the curfew and state of 
emergency that brought soviet soldiers and tanks into the 
republics capital on april 7 could be reinstated 
the soldiers and armor were withdrawn from the city last week 
but activist tengiz ordzhonikidze said they have been seen in 
recent days at nearby lakes and in suburbs 
shengelaya and other activists said the interior ministers 
statement which was carried on local tv appeared to be friendly 
advice rather than a threat 
georgian communist party chief givi gumbaridze when asked 
monday how he would react to future demonstrations said what 
happened on april 9 cant happen again 
gumbaridze on monday confirmed accusations by activists that 
some of the 20 deaths were caused by poison gas used by the 
soldiers 
in washington the united states on tuesday condemned the use 
of any chemical agents that cause serious injury or death when used 
against peaceful protesters 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler urged the soviet 
government to investigate fully and openly what happened on april 
9 
in moscow georgy p razumovsky a candidate member of the 
ruling communist party politburo who visited tbilisi after the 
violence said the decision to break up the protest with force was 
made by local authorities 
razumovsky at a news conference criticized georgian officials 
for a constant lack of dialogue with young people and the 
intelligentsia on the republics problems 
activists said the demonstration which had been planned for the 
yard of the kashveti church a 13thcentury stone building across 
the street from government house was postponed to may 21 
tiblisi police chief roman zvensadze said he had personally 
suggested to activists that holding a demonstration during the 
traditional 40 days of mourning would be unseemly 
the demonstration had been called to demand the release of seven 
activists arrested hours after the april 9 clash and to demand 
punishment of the murderers said nadiradze 
they also sought were seeking annulment of a kremlin decree 
making it illegal to insult or discredit the government 
demonstrations in georgia first began april 4 when protesters 
criticized calls from members of the republics ethnic abkhazian 
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by 
georgians 
other protesters have demanded georgia secede from the soviet 
union because of alleged interference from the central government 
the republics senior party official dzhumber patiashvili took 
responsibility for the april 9 attack and resigned

a new law requiring publishers and 
distributors to document the ages of nude models in photographs 
will have a truly devastating effect on free expression and 
will not stem the flow of child pornography a judge was told 
tuesday 
the law poses nearimpossible recordkeeping burdens on 
legitimate businesses and would impose a corporate death 
penalty on distributors because all assets could be seized if 
they violate the law with even one publication said an attorney 
for a coalition of publishing and library groups 
the coalition claims the law would force librarians to remove 
from their shelves any medical sex education and sociological 
texts showing full frontal nudity and stop magazines and tv shows 
from using adult sexual material that is protected by the first 
amendment 
it will have a truly devastating effect on entirely lawful 
protected speech of adults said bruce ennis an attorney 
representing the american library association in a lawsuit against 
the statute 
the law requires that anyone who produces material with images 
of sexual activity or lascivious exhibition of the genitals 
keep records showing the models depicted are at least 18 years old 
the law covers the reissue of any materials produced after feb 5 
1978 the date when a major federal child pornography law took 
effect 
ennis said the word lascivious is too imprecise the text of the 
statute is too broad and the child porno industry is entirely 
underground and would not be affected by the law 
the government is concerned about an underground problem but 
they impose a solution on a legitimate aboveground industry 
ennis said 
richard stearns a justice department attorney told us 
district judge george revercomb that publishers first amendment 
arguments were overwrought and that they would be little 
affected by the law 
he said if mainstream companies werent distributing child 
pornography it must mean they already have adopted ways to prevent 
such occurrences 
stearns said the government has the right to try to stop the 
production of vast amounts of child pornography in this country 
and the importation of child pornography 
the new law would punish criminals not suppress free 
expression he told the judge 
thenpresident reagan signed the child protection and obscenity 
enforcement act last november and the recordkeeping requirements 
were scheduled to start may 17 not aug 17 as published 
incorrectly in the federal register stearns said 
the act increases penalties for anyone facilitating use of a 
child for producing sexually explicit materials creates a new 
federal offense for engaging in the business of distributing 
obscene materials and provides mandatory forfeiture of the profits 
of those convicted of being engaged in the adult obscenity business 
house speaker jim wright dtexas has said congress intended to 
target only major dealers or producers of obscene materials who 
were knowingly engaged for a long period of time he said the 
measure was not aimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single 
volume judged to be obscene 
stearns said the problem in prosecuting child pornography was 
the difficulty in determining the ages of models he agreed with 
revercomb that the issue involved those aged 14 to 17 who can pass 
for 19 and 20 such as actress tracy lords who made 75 porno films 
starting when she was 14 
stearns said the law clearly defines illegal sexual acts and 
doesnt apply to all frank depictions of the human form 
medical texts art books and news photos would not be in jeopardy 
he said 
revercomb took under advisement the coalitions request for a 
preliminary injunction against the recordkeeping and forfeiture 
provisions the justice department sought dismissal of the suit 
the challengers include the american library association 
american booksellers association freedom to read foundation 
magazine publishers of america american society of magazine 
photographers american society of magazine editors council for 
periodical distributors association international periodical 
distributors association and the satellite broadcasting 
communications association 
the association of american publishers and the video software 
dealers association also filed court papers arguing against the law

four environmental groups urged the bush 
administration tuesday to phase out all ozonedestroying chemicals 
by 1995 and said the government is courting disaster by proposing 
to allow some production until the year 2000 
none of the potential scenarios for protecting the ozone layer 
which have been considered thus far by the government are 
designed to do more than stabilize atmospheric chlorine 
concentrations at 1985 levels the groups said in a report 
the 1985 levels the report said were more than enough to poke 
a hole in the ozone layer over the antarctic which appeared in the 
late 1970s 
it is the chlorine in chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that 
breaks down in the stratosphere and destroys the earths ozone 
shield depletion of the ozone layer lets ultraviolet radiation 
from te sun get through increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye 
disease while threatening plant life on land and in water 
the report was prepared by the us public interest research 
group the institute for energy and environmental studies the 
national toxics campaign and the clean water action project the 
groups said they would knock on doors in 40 states and mobilize 
local activist organizations to win support for an earlier phaseout 
than currently planned 
the us government is part of the montreal protocol the 1987 
treaty that requires industrial nations to cut production of cfcs 
to 50 percent of 1986 levels by 1999 
the united states and the european community have proposed going 
further calling for a ban on cfc production by the year 2000 
the report called for a 50 percent cutback of cfcs and related 
chemicals by 1991 and elimination of these chemicals plus 
another ozonedepleter carbon tetrachloride by 1995 
the groups also proposed 1995 elimination of methyl chloroform 
which has similar destructive effects with a fiveyear extension 
if no safe alternative is available 
us chemical companies are now testing cfc substitutes but 
production is not expected for threetofive years according to 
the industry 
us delegates to an international meeting of montreal protocol 
signers next week are expected to warn that unrestricted use of 
nowunregulated carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform could 
offset the phaseout of cfcs in the treaty 
last week epa published a notice in the federal register that 
the upcoming meeting in helsinki is likely to propose that the 
two chemicals be included in the protocol 
the new environmental report said the montreal protocol 
agreement would allow stratospheric chlorine levels from human 
emissions in the next 50 years to increase to a level four times 
higher than the level that existed before the antarctic ozone 
hole was discovered 
even under epas strongest set of measures by the year 2100 
stratospheric chlorine levels from human emissions are projected to 
remain higher than the level that caused the ozone hole the 
report added 
in the long term to allow atmospheric chlorine levels 
anywhere near those which catalyzed the antarctic hole is to court 
disaster the report said 
cfc gases are used as computer solvents refrigerants and 
foamblowing agents for insulation halons are used in 
firefighting equipment carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform 
are solvents used to clean machinery

helmeted police detained at least three 
people tuesday at a noisy rally where an anticommunist 
independence group announced candidates for upcoming elections to 
the national assembly 
the confederation for an independent poland said it will field 
three candidates in warsaw for the larger sejm chamber in an effort 
to weaken the communist system 
police vehicles lined the street in front of the gates to warsaw 
university where the rally began 
then police wielding batons and metal shields moved in and 
detained at least three people including two confederation 
members when about 50 supporters ran into a police line 
confederation campus leader wojciech gawkowski announced that 
he stanislaw mazurkiewicz and stanislaw dronicz will run for the 
sejm 
anybody who gathers 3000 signatures can run for one of the 161 
seats available to independent candidates in the 460member sejm 
or a seat in the new 100member senate that will be the first 
freely elected legislative body in the east bloc 
gawkowski said that if police do not stop interfering with 
election efforts of the confederation known by its polish initials 
kpn the group will call for a boycott of the june voting 
kpn will not stop organizing protests we want to beat the 
communist system down to its foundations he told listeners 
authorities consider the confederation an illegal organization 
and police regularly break up its rallies and meetings 
deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski told reporters 
tuesday that confederation rallies are aggressive and rough 
and contradictory with the spirit of conciliation 
meanwhile 1500 supporters of the students union nzs marched 
across warsaw to the education ministry to demand legal 
registration of the independent group and improved conditions at 
campuses a hearing is scheduled for wednesday on legalizing the

gangs of angry mauritanians armed 
with sticks and clubs harassed senegalese citizens and sacked their 
shops tuesday forcing the government to impose a dusktodawn 
curfew 
in the senegalese capital of dakar 375 miles to the south 
antimauritanian violence was not quelled until 4 am tuesday 
after the army was called out and police resorted to tear gas 
both countries reinforced their troops along the senegal river 
border as tensions mounted over a land dispute 
government officials in the two west african nations tried to 
calm passions sparked by the april 9 killing of two senegalese 
farmers allegedly shot by mauritanian soldiers in senegals 
diawara border village two people have died in violence in senegal 
since then 
sporadic outbursts against mauritanian shopkeepers in dakar and 
senegalese in nouakchott grew into widespread violence sunday 
our compatriots must imperatively no matter what pain they 
have suffered chase from their hearts the cowardly sentiment of 
vengeance interior minister gibril ould abdallahy said in a 
statement broadcast tuesday on mauritanian radio and television 
he announced an 8 pm to 6 am curfew in nouakchott and 
nouadihbou the principal port 
a government source denied reports three people died in 
nouakchott violence although he added officials do not have 
complete casualty lists 
truckloads of police some with riot helmets and shields rushed 
through the streets of this sandblown capital of 500000 people 
violence has been concentrated in poor quarters and shantytowns 
angry crowds formed in dirt back streets occasionally surging onto 
a main artery to attack senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn a 
shop police broke up the crowds with tear gas and clubs 
knots of mauritanians demanded to see id cards and roughed up 
those who did not prove they were mauritanian 
mauritania straddles arab north and black west africa 
twothirds of its 2 million people are moors of arabberber 
extraction the rest are black mostly from the southern river 
region senegals 7 million people almost all are black 
in dakar many women and children sought refuge in the 
mauritanian embassy ambassador mokhtar ould zamel said they were 
escorted to the central mosque many have asked to be repatriated 
senegalese authorities said they arrested large numbers of 
vandals but did not confirm reports that hundreds have been 
detained 
this violence was sparked over the right of senegalese to farm 
on a senegal river island 
even before the colonial period the black toucouleur people 
farmed both sides of the senegal river after both countries became 
independent from france in 1960 senegalese toucouleur continued to 
farm the mauritanian side they had considered their own for 
generations 
moors to the north traditionally nomadic herders did not farm 
but the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up 
new farmland and spurred mauritanian interest in agriculture all 
along the border senegalese are being forced off the land

sen edward kennedy joined a statewide appeal 
tuesday to raise money for a statue of his brother john saying he 
was glad the memorial focuses on the late presidents birthday and 
not the day he was assassinated 
we do not want to relive my brothers death we want to 
remember his life kennedy said at a statehouse news conference 
that included the late presidents daughter caroline kennedy 
schlossberg and gov michael s dukakis 
the 8foot bronze statue is being created by artist isabel 
mcilvain of sherborn whose design was chosen through a nationwide 
competition it depicts kennedy striding into a breeze with his 
left hand tucked in his pocket 
state rep john macgovern cochair of a special legislative 
commission on the statue said he was confident the sculpture would 
be unveiled by may 19 1990 the 73rd anniversary of kennedys 
birth 
at long last massachusetts will properly remember and note the 
wonderful contributions of this outstanding citizens and this 
political hero for so many of us on both sides of the political 
aisle said macgovern 
about 60000 has been raised so far of the overall fundraising 
goal macgovern said the overall goal of 400000 includes 
maintenance funds and some scholarship money 
commission members say they want to raise the money in small 
donations from each of the states 351 cities and towns rather than 
make corporate appeals no public funds are to be used 
they wanted this to be a presentation from the people they 
didnt want it just to be something the state was funding said 
jim burke aide to state sen paul white cochair with macgovern 
although john f kennedy never served in the state government 
his brother said he had close ties to the massachusetts political 
tradition 
he said the kennedy family has been concerned that most tributes 
to jfk focus on nov 22 1963 the day kennedy was shot and he was 
pleased with the planned may dedication of the sculpture 
now on the grounds of the statehouse he loved jack will stand 
forever young kennedy said 
schlossberg spoke briefly saying the statue will encourage 
and inspire other people to dedicate their time and energy to 
public service 
dukakis said the statue and kennedys life commemorate the 
importance of public service 
one of the reasons i believe its so important that we 
remember this man in this place in front of this historic building 
is it makes sure that here in the commonwealth of massachusetts we 
have a constant reminder of what public service is all about he 
said

an international group of bishops and 
educators urged the vatican on tuesday to safeguard academic 
independence in roman catholic universities 
the appeal came at the conclusion of a weeklong meeting to 
assess a draft of a major vatican document on catholic higher 
education the draft has drawn sharp criticism from college 
officials who charge it could undermine academic freedom 
delegates from the united states which has the worlds largest 
catholic college system said at a news conference tuesday they are 
optimistic the vatican will heed the representatives wishes 
but the final document must be approved by pope john paul ii in 
a closing address to the conference the pope called for a more 
strict and faithful collaboration between the universities and 
the catholic hierarchy 
the representatives in a nearunanimous vote said the document 
should contain nonbinding guidelines that are general and 
inspirational rather than specific 
my impression is that the congregation will do a major 
rewrite said the rev raymond fitz president of the university 
of dayton in ohio referring to the vaticans congregation for 
catholic education 
the first draft of the education document issued in 1985 
assigned church authorities some power over catholic colleges and 
universities to ensure that teachers adhered to church doctrine and 
uprightness of life 
those teachers judged not doing so would be subject to dismissal 
the document circulated to educators and bishops drew strong 
protests and a second draft was prepared and presented at the 
meeting this week 
about 175 college presidents bishops and education experts from 
40 countries discussed the draft with vatican officials and came up 
with 10 recommendations for a third version 
the new proposals say the vatican document should be positive 
inspirational and futureoriented and that catholic universities 
must be allowed to run themselves 
freedom of research and teaching must be recognized and 
respected the proposals said 
deciding how catholic a catholic university must be is a 
touchy issue the vatican under john paul is trying to eliminate 
the confusion it blames on the teaching of dissident theologians 
and to strengthen the church through emphasis on traditional 
principles 
at the same time many universities say they must allow 
exploration of new theories however unorthodox as part of their 
role as centers of research and study 
many of the us officials said they were surprised to find the 
vatican very receptive to their ideas 
this is innovative as vatican congregations operate far more 
participatory said the rev william byron president of catholic 
university of america in washington dc weve gotten a step 
further down the line 
several representatives and vatican officials at the conference 
formed a 15member committee that will review the third draft of 
the document this fall us officials said it was significant that 
the congregation would ask college officials for another opinion 
but the college representatives and bishops at this weeks 
meeting play only an advisory role and vatican officials and the 
pope will decide the shape of the final paper

a house committee on wednesday approved a 14 
billion bill reauthorizing the federal vocational training program 
after first removing a requirement that certain amounts be set 
aside for certain groups 
however the measure stipulates that the states are to make sure 
the money is distributed in the most effective way that also 
insures fair treatment for particular segments of the population 
such as the physically handicapped single parents and those who do 
not speak english 
the bush administration opposed writing into the law a specific 
amount to be spent on certain categories of people and the panel 
members had heard testimony prior to final action on the bill that 
the setasides had not proved effective 
the carl d perkins vocational education act of 1984 which 
expires sept 30 says 10 percent of the grants are to go to the 
handicapped 22 percent to the disadvantaged 12 percent to adults 
85 percent to single parents and homemakers 35 percent to 
elimination of sex bias and 1 percent to the incarcerated 
the bush administration had requested 949 million for fiscal 
year 1990 up from the current 918 million however critics said 
that level would amount to a cut because it would not keep pace 
with inflation 
the measure is expected to reach the house floor next month 
where easy passage is anticipated

a house committee acted wednesday to impeach 
federal judge walter l nixon of mississippi before he is released 
from federal prison and returns to the district court to hear cases 
i believe that judge nixon should have had the good grace to 
resign when his appeals were exhausted rep james sensenbrenner 
rwis said as the judiciary committee approved three articles of 
impeachment 340 
the full house is planning floor action on the articles of 
impeachment this week if they are approved nixon would stand 
impeached and be tried later by the senate with house members 
acting as prosecutors 
the senate is currently preparing to hear evidence in the trial 
of judge alcee l hastings of florida who was impeached by the 
house last year even though he was acquitted in 1983 of plotting to 
obtain payoffs 
the articles accuse nixon of lying to a federal grand jury and 
justice department investigators looking into the oil and gas 
investment that was arranged for him by a wealthy businessman 
wiley fairchild 
nixon is accused of bringing the federal judiciary into 
disrepute and undermining its integrity by claiming he never played 
any role in a case involving marijuana smuggling charges against 
fairchilds son 
he already is serving two concurrent fiveyear perjury sentences 
imposed after he was convicted in 1986 since then he has 
collected 286000 in federal judicial salary and plans when he is 
released in a few months to return to the bench and try cases 
according to authorities 
defense attorney david stewart says that some of the statements 
cited as instances of perjury were factual and that in any case 
nixon never did anything that warranted impeachment he says nixon 
was subjected to a sensationalized investigation and an unfair 
trial 
lawmakers said they were unable to agree with stewarts 
contentions in the course of their investigation of nixon 
his pattern of lies and deceit led to the inevitable 
conclusion that he has to be impeached said rep don edwards

sworn statements about a dog that 
understood estonian and trysts between a defense attorney and 
courtroom marshal are some of the odd turns a long trial of three 
leftist militants has taken 
tuesday was day 37 of testimony and arguments in the federal 
trial of two men and a woman accused of plotting to overthrow the 
united states government by force the charge also known as 
seditious conspiracy rarely has been used since it was invoked 
during the civil war to prosecute confederate loyalists 
despite the historical weight of the proceeding which involves 
some of the major violent radicals of the 1970s the dozen or so 
marshals guarding the courtroom usually far outnumber the few 
spectators 
the 17member jury yawned and fidgeted through mondays skirmish 
between defendant raymond luc levasseur dressed in blue jeans and 
georgia hill a graysuited detroit lawyer who was friends with 
some associates of the defendants when she studied at harvard law 
school a decade ago 
levasseur who is serving as his own lawyer has accused hill 
and others of informing on the radicals who sometimes called 
themselves the united freedom front and are accused of bombing 
buildings and robbing banks around the northeast from 1975 to 1981 
i would like you to cooperate although not as much as you did 
with the fbi levasseur said in the kind of bitter aside that 
jurors have come to expect of him 
hill was the 91st witness on the stand and prosecutors are only 
a quarter of the way into their witness list 
levasseur 42 faces a maximum of 60 years in prison if 
convicted on three charges of seditious conspiracy racketeering 
and racketeering conspiracy on trial on the same charges are his 
wife patricia gros levasseur 40 and richard williams 41 
there were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury 
selection in march 1988 prosecutors dropped charges against thomas 
manning and jaan karl laaman already serving lengthy sentences on 
other charges mannings wife carol manning pleaded guilty to 
sedition and other charges and a separate trial was ordered for 
laamans wife barbara curzilaaman 
assistant us attorney michael loucks questioned hill on april 
13 about a dog she said former codefendant jaan karl laaman had 
taught commands in estonian 
did you ever hear him talk to the dog young asked her 
she replied a couple of commands like sort of sit and 
stop 
young later struck the comments saying i cant for the life 
of me see how that would be a statement made in furtherance of the 
conspiracy 
ms curzilaamans attorney linda j thompson and a us 
marshal assigned to guard the courthouse during the trial were the 
subject of an april 7 hearing for their love affair during jury 
selection a judge found that the pair had not discussed court 
business during the liaison

a delegation of nicaraguan opposition leaders 
ranging from an antisandinista communist to contra rebel 
spokesmen accused the nicaraguan government tuesday of laying the 
groundwork for a rigged presidential election next february 
the state department leveled similar charges and appealed to the 
sandinistas to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process 
the nicaraguan delegation said the sandinistas are attempting to 
ensure victory in the election by stacking the allpowerful supreme 
electoral council in their favor and by denying the opposition 
equal access to media outlets 
twelve opposition leaders took part in a news conference 
including eli altamirano of the communist party and three members 
of the ussupported contra rebels 
the occasion for their appearance was the deadline established 
at a central american summit meeting last february in el salvador 
for setting in motion an electoral process that will culminate in 
national elections 10 months from now 
at the summit the sandinistas promised to hold free and fair 
elections and the presidents agreed in return to draw up a plan for 
demobilizing the thousands of contras assembled at camps in 
honduras along the nicaraguan border the rebels have been 
subsisting on food and other nonlethal aid provided by the united 
states 
the nicaraguan delegation had raised its concerns earlier about 
sandinista policy toward the elections in meetings with officials 
from the united nations and the organization of american states 
we have denounced in these meetings the lack of compliance by 
the government of president daniel ortega in relation to the 
commitments which they undertook in el salvador said agustin 
jarquin a representative of the social christian party 
he said sandinista actions will not permit fair and honest 
political competition 
jaime bonilla a member of the independent liberal party said 
the sandinistas have agreed to name a nonpartisan individual as 
head of the election council but that other aspects of the 
electoral machinery would remain dominated by the sandinista 
front 
nicaraguan embassy spokeswoman cecilia lopez said the new 
election laws were approved with the participation of the political 
parties represented in the legislature and are in compliance with 
the terms of the central american summit meeting 
in a telephone interview she said the law allows opposition 
parties more airtime for campaign purposes than they would have 
received under their original request 
in addition she said the sandinistas consistent with another 
pledge made at the summit have released about 1700 national 
guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the 
sandinistas a decade ago 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration is troubled by both the substance of nicaraguas 
electoral laws and the manner in which they have been put into 
effect 
the electoral law approved last week is not the result of good 
faith bargaining between the government of nicaragua and the 
internal opposition groups and was unilaterally imposed after 
being passed by the sandinistadominated legislature she said 
she said the law includes a provision requiring that the 
election council of which the sandinistas maintain control receive 
onehalf of any foreign political contributions 
the law ignores she said proposals made by the internal 
opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring the 
presence and unlimited access of international election observers 
a new law governing press conduct she added includes penalties 
for disseminating information which the interior ministry 
determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows 
officials to order closures of up to four days

the government said tuesday that its 
forces killed 58 moslem guerrillas mounting another attack on the 
eastern city of jalalabad 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammed nabi also said 250 
guerrillas were killed in other fighting his claims could not be 
independently verified 
the soviet ambassador to afghanistan meanwhile reported 
thousands of casualties by both sides in the sevenweek siege on 
jalalabad and he compared the intense shelling to that of the 
world war ii battle of stalingrad 
yuli m vorontsov also said the offensive appears to have been 
orchestrated entirely by the pakistani military not by the 
government of prime minister benazir bhutto 
i dont think shes looking for a military solution 
vorontsov said i think she wants peace and quiet in afghanistan 
the pakistani military has some thing else in mind they want 
people who are going to be very obedient to pakistan 
according to a report in the new york times on sunday ms 
bhuttos government ordered the frontal assault on jalalabad last 
month despite opposition from pakistans military intelligence 
servicee the newspaper said the decision was made in the presence 
of the us ambassador to pakistan robert oakley it said no 
resistance leaders were at the meeting 
islamabad has denied the allegations and washington has refused 
comment 
president najib frequently has accused pakistan its eastern 
neighbor of armed aggression and interference in his country 
i think it was entirely a plot of the pakistani military 
vorontsov said in an interview in the soviet embassy compound 
guerrillas fired a rocket into the compound thursday and the 
explosion shattered windows but caused no casualties among the 260 
people staying there 
if there is a second one vorontsov warned they will be 
sorry 
we will reply swiftly and decisively he said our reply 
is ready and it wont be in a diplomatic note 
the guerrillas who are armed and supported by the united 
states pakistan saudi arabia and china began fighting to 
overthrow the prosoviet government shortly after it seized power 
in a 1978 coup 
the soviet union sent soldiers to support the government in 
1979 more than 100000 soldiers were in the country before 
afghanistan pakistan the united states and the soviet union 
signed a unsponsored agreement 
on march 6 three weeks after the last soviet soldiers left 
afghanistan the insurgents launched the attack on jalalabad about 
45 miles from the border with pakistan 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said government 
soldiers had inflicted heavy blows to the guerrillas in their 
latest attack 
he said 58 guerrillas were killed and 49 others wounded since 
monday night one soldier also was killed and six civilians 
injured he said 
elsewhere the military killed 250 guerrillas and wounded 300 
others in fighting in the southern city of kandahar and two 
civilians died and six others were injured in the western city of 
herat he said 
according to vorontsov jalalabad has been hit by tens of 
thousands of rockets since the siege began he said officials had 
calculated the rate of shelling was comparable to the battle of 
stalingrad 
he said more than 5000 guerrillas have been killed and about 
another 3500 have been injured 
he also said about 2500 soldiers had been killed or wounded and 
that the that the casualties among civilians also have been high 
although he did not have any figures 
if their aim is to find a place for their socalled 
government theyre not going to do it there he said 
the resistance in february formed an interim government in 
pakistan capturing jalalabad would give them a base on afghan soil 
vorontsov said he plans to continue contacts with with 
resistance leaders in pakistan and iran to reach a negotiated 
settlement he said the issue would be brought up during secretary 
of state james baker iiis trip to moscow next month 
what surprises me is the line of the american adminstration 
he said in other parts of the world they are interested in a 
political solution why are they playing another ball game here

thought the people next door were shaking the walls said les 
giddings of miami as he and his wife maria checked out of the 
hotel krystal in the zona rosa tourist area 
they were a day and a half into their honeymoon when the quake 
hit at 826 am

a good rollercoaster ride said giddings 
two hairline cracks ran down the walls one in the bedroom one 
in the bathroom popping chips of paint off the walls running down 
the stairs from their 10th floor room after the motion stopped 
they saw chunks of plaster scattered about

its a terrifying experience 
she said disneyworld was one possibility 
tourists at other hotels said they saw other people checking 
out cutting vacations short because of the quake which measured 
68 on the richter scale 
across the street in the century hotel cobe eekelsbakker of 
amstelveen the netherlands at first thought she was ill then 
noticed that everything was moving back and forth 
i could see through my window stones and dirt coming down 
she said 
although slowed by an already existing hip injury she grabbed 
her purse and cane to run down the steps from her eighthfloor room 
everybody was going past me then somebody took me and brought 
me downstairs quickly she said 
i have cried she said sitting in the lobby more than an 
hour later still shaken 
the quake sloshed water from the hotels rooftop pool over the 
walls onto cars parked on the street 23 floors below

decided to continue their vacation and go on to acapulco

a cuban family from florida that was 
stranded in canada after a sightseeing trip five months ago may 
soon be granted political asylum us immigration officials said 
tuesday 
carlos fajardo has provided information that substantiates his 
claim that he would face political persecution if returned to cuba 
said benedict ferro district director of the federal immigration 
and naturalization service 
it is not a frivolous claim ferro said we would not turn 
people away under those circumstances 
ferro would not discuss details of the case but did say that 
pending a state department review of the case the fajardos might 
be allowed to return in a few weeks 
fajardo his wife bermaida zamorapowers and her two children 
yoradlys diaz and yoandys diaz have lived on charity since dec 
23 when they were denied reentry into the united states at the 
rainbow bridge in niagara falls because they are illegal aliens 
the couple told border authorities that they had driven north to 
find snow for christmas and had ventured into canada to view the 
falls 
the family lived for several weeks in a niagara falls ontario 
motel then in a fort erie apartment under the sponsorship of 
ontario refugee groups 
it looks like we may finally be able to work something out 
said sister kathleen rimar fajardos catholic charities attorney 
in buffalo 
last month ferro denied fajardos application to return to 
miami on humanitarian parole despite pressure from charitable 
organizations and from sen bob graham dfla ferro had insisted 
that the family not be readmitted because of their record of 
immigration fraud and other unspecified evidence 
immigration officials said tuesday fajardo and his wife still 
are guilty of substantial fraud against the us government and 
other offenses but they also said such violations can be 
overlooked in light of concern over possible persecution 
information regarding the potential for persecution for fajardo 
in cuba they added was not available until he was allowed to 
enter the united states late last month for an interview with 
immigration officials in buffalo 
sister rimar said that for the first time since december the 
family has some hope of returning to the miami area but their stay 
in canada has exhausted their resources she said 
their situation is a mess she said they have no home or 
business to return to and theyre in danger of having their car 
repossessed theyll have to start off basically with nothing and 
work their way back again

house republican whip newt gingrich said 
tuesday that none of the 22 investors in a partnership created to 
promote a book he coauthored ever received unusual or 
extraordinary personal help from him in their dealings with the 
federal government 
but gingrich during a stormy news conference which his wife 
left in anger acknowledged that some of the investors had a direct 
interest in legislation and that he had handled routine requests 
from some of them 
while house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth 
more than 100 from people with direct interest in legislation 
gingrich said the partnership did not violate house rules because 
the 5000 that each investor put into the deal did not constitute 
a gift 
rep bill alexander dark has filed a formal complaint with 
the house ethics committee alleging that the partnership involved 
10 apparent violations of house rules the committee has not 
indicated whether it will launch a preliminary investigation of the 
complaint 
gingrich who initiated the investigation that led to house 
speaker jim wrights being charged with 69 violations of house 
rules last week said he was satisfied that each investor in the 
partnership thought there was a reasonable chance that it might 
make money 
in exchange for their investments the 19 individuals and three 
corporations that formed the cos limited partnership in 1984 were 
promised half of the publishers profits from the book window of 
opportunity written by gingrich his wife marianne gingrich 
and david drake 
according to hundreds of pages of financial documents and tax 
returns released tuesday by gingrich the partnership spent 51571 
to promote and advertise the book from 1984 through 1986 but the 
publisher still had a net loss of 6259 on the book by the end of 
1987 
because the partnership received no profits from book sales the 
104185 loss it generated from 1984 to 1988 was distributed among 
the partners providing them with tax writeoffs 
mrs gingrich as general partner of the partnership received a 
10000 payment in 1984 for setting up the organization and later 
received a 2 percent interest in the partnership and a 1500 
payment according to the documents she did not invest any of her 
own money in the partnership 
alexanders complaint alleges in part that the payments and 
ownership interest in the partnership that mrs gingrich received 
were gifts that violated house rules limiting gifts members may 
receive 
the complaint parallels the ethics committees allegation that 
the salary and benefits wrights wife betty received from an 
investment corporation were actually gifts because there was no 
evidence that mrs wright did any work for the corporation 
mrs gingrich said tuesday that she kept all the records for the 
partnership interviewed potential investors to ensure they were 
qualified and handled the filings necessary to comply with various 
state securities laws 
she left the news conference abruptly after telling reporters 
she was upset that no one seemed interested in going through the 
350 pages of tax returns financial records and incorporation 
papers that she had put together in response to questions about the 
book deal 
gingrich defended his wife telling reporters that unlike mrs 
wright she actually did the work for the money she got he 
said the 350 pages of documents represent her work product 
gingrich said he was willing to concede that the book 
partnership was unusual but he said there was nothing 
unethical in the deal which he described as markedly different 
from the financial arrangements for wrights book reflections of 
a public man 
we wrote a real book working with a real publisher 
distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a 
realistic standard royalty he said jim wright did none of 
those things 
part of the ethics committees charges against wright allege 
that he violated house rules on outside income limits though bulk 
sales of his book on which he received a 55 percent royalty

a boeing engineer testified tuesday that the 
cargo doors of the companys 747 jetliners are safe but a 
colleague at pan am recalled a 1987 episode in which one of the 
doors partially opened in flight 
the engineers spoke at a national transportation safety board 
hearing on the february accident that tore the cargo door off a 
united airlines plane near hawaii killing nine passengers 
the opening session of the threeday hearing was dominated by 
detailed and technical testimony on the design and operation of the 
800pound cargo doors 
the basic system has been a safe and reliable system for many 
many years said james fitzgerald a fuselage structural design 
manager for the boeing co which builds 747s in everett 
but robert dann of pan am said that testing after the 1987 
episode in which the cargo door came partially open in a flight 
from london showed the door could open in midflight if there was 
damage to parts of the locking system 
the plane involved in that incident returned safely to london 
dann said 
the ntsb is looking into the feb 24 accident of united flight 
811 which lost the cargo door and part of its fuselage in an 
explosive decompression shortly after takeoff from honolulu nine 
passengers sitting above the cargo door were sucked out 
although two engines conked out pilot david cronin managed to 
land at honolulu with no further loss of life 
the united 747100 built in 1970 was one of the first jumbo 
jets built by the seattlebased company it had over 58800 flight 
hours 
lee dickinson chairman of the hearing panel said the ntsb is 
still studying the costs and benefits of retrieving the door of the 
craft from under nearly 17000 feet of water in the pacific ocean 
85 miles southwest of honolulu 
there has been speculation the cargo door may have broken free 
when the latching mechanism failed united records indicated there 
had been recent problems with the door before the accident causing 
the door to be closed manually rather than electrically on several 
occasions 
the faa on march 3 issued an emergency order requiring all us 
airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight 
aluminum latch mechanisms with steel so the doors would be less 
vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing

the absence of strong untainted leaders in the 
governing liberal democratic party was a big reason prime minister 
noboru takeshita held on so long through a personally painful and 
damaging scandal 
takeshita 65 was in power only 18 months and had to deal from 
his first days in office with the multimillion dollar scandal 
involving the recruit information conglomerate 
he announced tuesday he will resign that had been expected but 
it still left the liberal democratic party which has been in 
control since 1948 foundering 
takeshita was ldp president and that assured him of becoming 
prime minister in november 1987 when prime minister yasuhiro 
nakosone retired 
and although the new ldp president could expect to become prime 
minister the party is riddled with factions 
many of the leaders of factions inside the ldp are themselves 
involved in the recruit scandal so it would be difficult to find 
someone to take takeshitas place said seisaburo sato a 
political science professor at tokyo university 
unlike questions of personal finances in the 1970s that led to 
the resignation of prime minister kakuei tanaka the recruit 
scandal has scarred virtually all the ldp factions 
political analaysts said the plunge of takeshitas popularity in 
public opinion polls to less than 4 percent reflected broad 
opposition to the political system often characterized by 
backroom dealings 
i feel deeply responsible for having fostered such distrust 
takeshita said in his resignation announcment he said he would 
leave office after parliament approves the budget for fiscal 1989 
the recruit scandal created a stalemate in parliament with a 
boycott of the budget debate by opposition members demanding former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone be called for questioning about 
payments and stock deals by recruit to politicians and the ldp 
for many people the scandal revealed the extent of unreported 
money flowing between business and government analysts noting the 
years the ldp has governed suggested a system of structural 
corruption had been created 
some ldp members including reform leader masayoshi takemura 
have said the party may not be able to end its dependence on large 
sums of money from the business world and maintain its dominance 
sometimes i think we may have to dissolve the party and start 
again from zero takemura said last week 
takako doi head of the socialist party told other opposition 
leaders at a strategy session this month that the scandal offered a 
rare opportunity to wrest power from the ldp 
this is a time of unprecedented importance she said 
fuyuko kamisaka a prominent writer on womens and consumer 
issues suggested in a television interview that an independent 
panel be appointed to supervise political reforms 
i hope that someone not directly linked to the political world 
can lead a fundamental reform of politics that will eliminate the 
flow of strange money she said

japanese prime minister noboru takeshitas 
resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial 
fsx fighter project official sources said tuesday 
some highlevel sources suggested the end result could be a 
weaker deal for the united states or a complete unraveling of the 
plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the american f16 
takeshitas announcement that he would step down as a result of 
an influencepeddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the 
alreadytroubled fsx plan said administration and congressional 
officials all of whom declined to be identified 
the sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any 
movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor 
to takeshita takes office 
its not on the verge of being resolved now anyway said one 
administration soucre 
were continuing to try to clarify the conditions on the 
project set down a month ago by us negotiators its proven to 
be a very difficult process 
although president bush signaled general support for the joint 
venture in midmarch japanese officials balked at some of the 
conditions he stipulated including a guarantee that us 
companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet 
the united states also wants assurances that any new technology 
developed from the project would be available to the united states 
along with protection for usdeveloped computer codes that help 
fly and control the plane 
the agreement to codevelop the fsx which stands for fighter 
support experimental was negotiated late last year between 
takeshitas government and the outgoing reagan adminstration 
under the agreement general dynamics corp would build the 
upgraded f16 with japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
the plan encountered stiff opposition in the 
democraticcontrolled congress where critics have called it a 7 
billion giveaway of high technology to japan suggesting the 
united states would get little in return 
takeshitas resignation will make it harder to deal with the 
issue said rep richard gephardt dmo 
i think the position of the japanese will be that because 
theyre in a difficult circumstance they cant give as much as 
they might have on fsx gephardt said in an interview 
he also said that the japanese government might use the current 
political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking us 
concessions in other usjapanese trade disputes 
proponents of the fsx project claim it represents a way to add 
fighters to japans inventory in strategic northeast asia at its 
own expense and would give the united states access to 
sophisticated radar technology developedby mitsubishi 
one congressional source involved in trade issues said that any 
further delay in the project now would let japan strengthen its 
negotiating hand 
japans final response on the fsx clearly had to be signed off 
on by the prime minister but there was divided counsel in japan on 
the terms and he takeshita obviously has been preoccupied this 
will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade 
hardball 
any effort by japan to demand further concessions from the 
united states could jeopardize a project that already has thin 
support in congress possibly torpedoing the plan entirely said 
both administration and congressional sources 
traveling with bush in california presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater was asked what impact takeshitas resignation might have 
on the fsx project we dont really know how it might affect that 
deal he said 
asked if the white house still favored moving ahead with the 
agreement with the new qualifications fitzwater said our 
position is the same we still hope so

a prominent iranian newspaper on tuesday 
backed parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani to head a leadership 
council that would eventually succeed the 88yearold ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
the statecontrolled ettelaat daily said in an editorial that no 
single possible substitute for khomeini existed when it comes to 
knowledge and jurisprudence especially in the area of government 
or when such other factors as record of struggle or political 
intuition is concerned 
it suggested a leadership council made up of present state 
administrators and leading religious authorities in which one 
member would be capable of saying the last word on matters of 
dispute and able to adopt decisions on his own responsibility 
if we were to make a decision on the basis of a grade point 
average of a candidate it seems rafsanjani has the necessary 
qualifications for heading the leadership council etelaat said 
in all countries and with every leadership council there is 
one member entitled to veto the vote of the rest 
it was the first public backing for a khomeini successor since 
khomeini forced ayatollah hossein ali montazeri to step down last 
month as his officially designated successor 
rafsanjani is a leading candidate for president in elections 
scheduled to be held this year to choose a successor to ali 
khamenei who is not permitted by the constitution to run for a 
third fouryear term 
but under irans present system the president divides power 
with the prime minister and parliament all of them subject to the 
authority of khomeini the revolutionary patriarchs separate 
status as spiritual leader is unmatched and unlikely to be filled 
after he dies iranian political experts say 
ettelaats endorsement significantly boosts rafsanjanis status 
in current political infighting 
rafsanjani kept a low profile in a recent purge of moderates and 
in the international outcry over khomeinis death sentence decree 
for british author salman rushdie rafsanjani is considered a 
pragmatist able to maneuver between hardline theologians and 
others who wanted to soften the harsh islamic revolution and end 
irans international isolation 
on friday he announced the discovery of a us spy network 
including senior iranian naval officers a move apparently aimed at 
gaining points with the hardliners 
on saturday rafsanjani 54 who also holds the post of acting 
commander in chief of the armed forces received backing for his 
presidential campaign from an influential party of hardliners the 
assembly of combatant theologians 
and on monday khomeini included rafsanjani in a 20man 
committee given two months to rectify defects in irans 1980 
revolutionary constitution one task khomeini said was to 
consider the leadership question 
rafsanjani has been campaigning for a constitutional change 
giving the president more power and abolishing the prime ministry 
prime minister hussein musavi meanwhile said tuesday that the 
us spy network which rafsanjani reported uncovered recently had 
direct contact with cia offices in neighboring countries some 
agents communicated with the americans through west german 
embassies in europe he said 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted musavi as saying in 
an interview with the stateowned islamic republic news agency that 
the west germans should know their embassies are at the service 
of the american spy network 
he said some agents were in sensitive positions with access 
to top secret information which they passed on to the americans 
the radio reported 
musavi said the purported us actions violated the algiers 
agreement which stipulates noninterference by the united states 
and iran in each others domestic affairs he was apparently 
referring to a 1980 accord under which iran released 52 us 
diplomats held hostage in tehran for 444 days 
musavi said iran would lodge a complaint against america at the 
international court of justice at the hague

the chairman of the house banking committee 
on the eve of public sessions to write savings and loan bailout 
legislation privately appealed to fellow democrats tuesday to 
resist pressure from industry lobbyists or face the anger of 
taxpayers 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas at a closeddoor caucus of the 
panels democrats urged support for requiring sampl owners to back 
their lending with more of their own money calling it the litmus 
test on whether anything has changed and the guts of this whole 
issue 
capital investment from sampl stockholders acts as a cushion 
absorbing losses that would otherwise have to be paid by government 
deposit insurance gonzalez is attempting to persuade his 51member 
committee to toughen the standards passed earlier this month by the 
panels 47member subcommittee on financial institutions chaired 
by rep frank annunzio dill 
more than 100 amendments are pending before the committee which 
in sessions scheduled wednesday and thursday is expected to rehash 
many of the battles fought during during 32 hours of subcommittee 
deliberations 
gonzalez who is joined by rep chalmers wylie of ohio the 
panels senior republican would require institutions to hold 225 
in tangible or real money capital for every 100 in loans 
compared with 150 in versions of the legislation passed by the 
house subcommittee and the full senate 
inadequate capital standards simply mean that we let the 
industry once again roll the dice with the taxpayers money he 
said in a statement prepared for delivery at the caucus 
gonzalez is trying to raise the visibility of the complex 
capital issue which is at the heart of president bushs savings 
and loan proposal in the past industry lobbyists have heavily 
influenced congressional decisions on banking laws because most 
voters dont follow the issues 
with taxpayers picking up the bulk of the 10year 157 billion 
sampl bailout however gonzalez told his colleagues that the 
decisions will be tough and they will be watched 
the choice may be difficult but as democrats we had better 
be able to say when the choice was presented we sided with the 
taxpayers he said 
rep barney frank dmass predicted the capital standards 
are going to look pretty kosher to the president by the time were 
through 
theres intense lobbying by people in the industry but i also 
think theres a view that if the committee votes 100 billion 
without a tough bill sooner or later the public will react said 
rep charles schumer dny who is supporting gonzalez capital 
amendment 
however rep john lafalce dny argued that gonzalez was 
trying to precipitously impose lily white absolutely pure 
standards on sampls he warned that if sampls were not permitted to 
gradually improve their condition the governments list of 
troubled institutions will swell 
i honestly believe that if we prescribe this medicine for our 
troubled financial system the medicine will be so strong that it 
will if not kill the system at least exacerbate the problem 
multifold he said 
in addition to raising the tangible capital requirement 
gonzalez is also trying to tighten two other standards one 
affecting an accounting item known as goodwill the other the 
treatment of sampl subsidiaries 
according to the federal home loan bank board more than 
onethird of the sampl industrys 60 billion in capital consists of 
goodwill an intangible asset representing the value of an 
institutions customer loyalty and name recognition 
the bush administration is seeking to eliminate goodwill 
value over 10 years arguing that it is phantom capital and has 
no worth when an institution is shut down the bill passed by 
annunzios subcommittee would permit goodwill in some cases to 
remain on institutions books for as long as 40 years gonzalez is 
proposing it be phased out over 20 years 
the gonzalez plan gives sampls five years to come up with extra 
capital to back subsidiaries investing in risky areas such as 
commercial real estate and junk bonds the subcommittee bill did 
not require the extra capital 
the associated press based on a staff document reported monday 
that gonzalez would permit subordinated debt money sampls borrow 
to count for up to onehalf of an institutions core capital aides 
explained tuesday however that while subordinated debt will be 
permitted in capital it will not be counted toward meeting the 
very minimum or core requirement

the us fish and wildlife service said 
tuesday it has dediced after all that the spotted owl is worthy of 
protection as a threatened species 
environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient 
forests of the northwest the timber industry says the move could 
lock up vast areas of the region to logging 
a federal judge in seattle had given the agency until monday to 
review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl 
under the endangered species act 
we will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl 
as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially 
propose it for listing said meg durham a spokeswoman for the 
fish and wildlife service 
once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species a 
yearlong review will begin during which management plans for 
protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought 
ms durham offered no indication when the agency would actually 
propose the listing but said the best scientific evidence 
available confirms the owl was worthy of protection 
the fish and wildlife service in december 1987 refused to list 
the owl and environmental groups filed suit district court judge 
thomas zilly ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was 
arbitrary and capricious and gave the agency until may 1 to 
review its decision 
the bird which is thought to nest only in the oldgrowth 
forests of washington oregon and northern california has become 
the focal point of a raging dispute between environmentalists and 
the timber industry 
environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as part 
of their campaign to halt logging in the oldgrowth forests of the 
northwest while the industry has claimed such protection would 
close vast areas of the region to logging forcing dozens of mills 
to close and the layoff of thousands of workers 
court orders in related cases have already put a halt to more 
than 140 timber sales in the regions national forests forest 
service officals have said those injunctions would interupt half of 
the harvest planned in the national forests this year and during 
the longterm the harvest could drop by onethird 
f dale robertson forest service chief has said under a 
worst case scenario more than 31000 workers could loose their 
jobs and his agencys timber receipts from the region could be cut 
in half 
they should have done it a year ago but better late than 
never said mike anderson of the wilderness society adding his 
his group believes listing the owl as an endangered species will 
require an end to logging in most of the remaining oldgrowth 
forests of the northwest 
jim pissot of the national audubon society said the decision 
gives the northwest an opportunity to focus on some of the real 
threats to the timber industry rather than using the spotted owl as 
a scapegoat 
ward armstrong executive director of the oregon forest 
industries council in salem ore said the industry was 
disappointed primarily because we dont believe the facts 
warrant it 
we believe there will be ramifications to this decision we 
just dont begin to understand yet said armstrong we believe 
it was a grave error

the us ambassador to greece denied 
tuesday he was interfering in greek politics after the conservative 
opposition party accused him of supporting the governing socialists 
a statement issued by the us embassy in athens said ambassador 
robert v keeley had steered clear of local politics since he was 
assigned to the country 3 years ago 
ambassador keeley has made it the foundation of his service in 
athens to make clear to everyone in this country that the 
politics of greece are for the greek people alone to determine 
that the united states government does not take sides the 
statement said 
the statement came after the conservative new democracy party 
protested a story in the new york times on sunday that quoted 
western diplomats and greek political analysts as saying the party 
leader constantine mitsotakis was less charismatic than premier 
andreas papandreou 
a western diplomat was also quoted as saying it was not yet 
clear who would win the june elections despite the papandreou 
governments loss of popularity because of allegations that 
officials were involved in a multimillion dollar financial scandal 
new democracy said the diplomat was american and it said greek 
journalists recognize the american diplomat is none other that 
ambassador keeley 
the envoy has not ceased for four years to interfere in an 
unfitting way in greeces domestic affairs by acting as a 
propagandist for andreas papandreou the conservatives said 
the conservatives did not however provide any evidence for the 
accusation 
the embassy said keeley had not met alan cowell the new york 
times correspondent that wrote the story since july 1987

congressional investigators have cleared the 
former inspector general of the veterans administration of 
tailoring audit decisions to meet political or administrative 
pressure 
a report from the general accounting office said the decisions 
of frank sato to end audits or not issue reports in nine instances 
and his conclusions in those cases were exercises of professional 
judgment and results of a policy not to issue reports that in 
his judgment would not accomplish a useful purpose 
anonymous complaints from people in satos office to congress 
said sato inspector general from 1981 to 1988 had not issued 
reports or else had changed conclusions in eight cases under 
pressure from the agencys administrators harry walters before 
1986 or tom turnage in 19861988 
the staff of the senate veterans affairs committee asked the 
general accounting office to examine those eight cases plus one 
more it was concerned about 
while not taking a position as to whether the former ig 
reached the right decision in each case we recognize that when 
dealing with sensitive controversial issues reasonable people 
can and often do arrive at different conclusions we believe 
this is the central issue here said the gao report dated march 
17 and received tuesday 
in four cases sato wrote a memo to or briefed the 
administrator either walters or turnage or wrote to program 
officials about his findings in five cases the report or other 
document was listed as available to the public 
according to the gao report sato said that in sensitive 
subject areas he did not want to create controversy unless it 
would lead to improvements and expressed frustration about 
recommending that a va facility not be built when it was already 
determined by the agency and the congress that the facility was 
needed and would be built to help meet the agencys mission 
despite any ig recommendation to the contrary 
sato now retired said he was never asked or directed by 
anyone else including the va administrator to cancel or not issue 
an audit report or to water down a report and all decisions 
were his own the report said 
only two of 50 people interviewed in the inspector generals 
office believed there was an independence problem and those 
two did not provide evidence to show the former ig was impaired 
in his reporting decisions gao said 
the gao report by jeffrey c steinhoff director of financial 
management system issues said in the future reasons for not 
issuing reports should be documented and placed in the office 
files 
new audit standards issued last year require such a memo and 
the acting va inspector general renald morani has agreed to 
follow such a policy gao said

of killing the roman catholic priest in 1984 and dumping the body 
in the vistula river north of warsaw the three other officers were 
given longer sentences and remain in prison 
deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski said chmielewski

the countdown began tuesday for 
fridays launch of space shuttle atlantis and five astronauts on a 
mission to send a payload to venus and revitalize a us planetary 
exploration program 
the 550 million magellanvenus project will mark the end of a 
decadelong dry spell for us planet flights and signal the 
beginning of a sciencerich threeyears when four major probes will 
be rocketed into deep space 
liftoff is scheduled for 224 pm friday in a rare afternoon 
launch only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after 
noon 
the countdown clock began ticking on time at 8 am when 
electrical power surged into the spaceship 
test director terry willingham reported there were no problems 
as the count began he said work tuesday included checking computer 
software the main engines and communications systems and closing 
out the engine compartment 
he said the forecast was for clear skies friday afternoon but 
officials were expressing some concern about the possibility of 
strong crosswinds that could interfere with atlantis if it had to 
make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad 
the astronauts flew here late tuesday from their training base 
in houston to make final preparations for launch 
commander dave walker told reporters the crew and spacecraft are 
ready to fly and that we are mighty proud to be part of the 
first shuttle planetary mission the other crew members are pilot 
ron grabe and mission specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman 
thagaard 
six hours after atlantis lifts off commander dave walker and 
his astronaut crew will release the 7600pound magellan payload 
propelling it on a 468day journey to venus 
magellan is to slip into orbit around the cloudshrouded planet 
in august 1990 and map up to 90 percent of its surface during the 
following 243 days with a high resolution radar system 
the images relayed to earth and enhanced by computer could 
help scientists understand how venus was formed and evolved they 
are expected to show features as small as 120 yards across 10 
times sharper than any previous pictures of the planet 
stephen saunders magellan project scientist at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory said it is hoped the expedition will answer 
a major question of why earth and venus evolved so differently 
even though at the beginning of the solar system they were almost 
identical 
the surface temperature of earths sultry twin is 900 degrees 
fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than 
that on earth 
magellan is the first new american planetary spacecraft since 
pioneer 13 was launched in 1978 also to venus it also is the 
first planetary payload to be carried by a shuttle 
the launch is being hailed as a resurgence of the national 
aeronautics and space administrations planetary science program 
in october another atlantis crew will start the galileo 
spacecraft on the way to jupiter in october 1990 the ulysses 
probe will be launched also from atlantis to study the sun and 
in 1992 the mars observer craft will be on its way aboard an 
unmanned rocket

guards tore down an office 
wall at burroughs wellcome co on tuesday to remove four men 
protesting the cost of the only governmentapproved drug aimed at 
halting the aids virus 
we wont let them tell us pay or die any longer said 
protester peter staley who has been diagnosed as having 
aidsrelated complex and takes the drug azt either they knock 
down the cost or they knock down their own walls to get us out 
burroughs wellcome security guards and durham county sheriffs 
deputies did just that after the four activists from the aids 
coalition to unleash power or actup sealed the door of an 
unoccupied office 
the protesters used small steel plates bolted to the door and 
door frame to seal the door they planned to cut through a window 
in the secondfloor office and unfurl a banner that would be 
visible from nearby interstate 40 
while the officers cut through the wall about 30 minutes after 
the protest began the activists chained themselves together inside 
the room the chain was cut before the four men all wearing suits 
and ties were led out of the company headquarters in handcuffs 
weve been trying to deal with this company for two years 
staley said as he was put in a patrol car 
staley said the protesters wanted a 25 percent reduction in the 
cost of azt and wanted burroughs wellcome to fund a government 
program to supply azt to the needy 
the drug azt marketed by burroughs wellcome under the name 
retrovir costs 8000 to 10000 a year it prevents the virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome from replicating 
but is not a cure for the fatal disease 
dan baker a spokesman for the new yorkbased coalition said 
burroughs wellcome recovered its development costs for azt in the 
first year it was marketed and was now making an 80 percent profit 
on the drug sales 
they could afford to practically give the drug away free 
baker said were not denying that they deserve a profit but we 
say it should be a reasonable profit on a drug people need to stay 
alive 
burroughs wellcome spokeswoman kathy bartlett did not deny the 
80 percent profit claim but said the company had never released 
profit figures and did not know where that information came 
from 
she said burroughs wellcome has given away millions of capsules 
of azt for clinical trials and had donated money to government aids 
programs 
we understand their actions were motivated by desperation 
ms bartlett said but it was really misdirected burroughs 
wellcome has been working for three years to bring therapy to aids 
patients 
baker said the group was prepared to pay burroughs wellcome for 
damages to the office 
the protest he said was a desperate act to draw attention to 
the aids issue until they agree to our demands we will continue 
to take these actions well be back 
azt was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of 
clinical tests when preliminary results showed 8 percent of the 
patients died while taking the drug compared with 40 percent who 
died while taking a placebo the government waived largescale 
clinical tests after those preliminary results so the drug could be 
put into circulation

opposition spokesmen on 
tuesday urged the defense minister to resign because of a purported 
arms deal between protestant extremists from northern ireland and a 
south african diplomat 
the opposition parties also demanded criminal charges against 
the diplomat in part to show good faith to britain which is upset 
because the transaction reportedly involved delivery of spare parts 
for its blowpipe missile launcher 
french authorities said they took south african diplomat daniel 
storm into custody last week with an american and three members of 
the ulster defense association the largest paramilitary group in 
northern ireland french authorities said they were arrested in a 
raid on a hotel room where parts of the britishmade missile system 
were being delivered to the south african 
the three irishmen and the american identified as geneva 
businessman douglas bernhart are being held on charges of 
gunrunning and conspiracy storm who is posted in paris was 
released after claiming diplomatic immunity colin eglin foreign 
affairs spokesman for the moderate opposition democratic party 
said if storm was involved in murky arms deals with terrorist 
organizations there is no doubt the minister of defense should 
resign 
foreign minister pik botha and defense minister magnus malan 
both have said the government sometimes uses unconventional methods 
to obtain arms technology to circumvent a un arms embargo but 
both denied south africa was supplying arms to any terrorist 
organization 
they have said storms activities will be investigated 
published reports in britain say south africa has supplied arms 
to protestant groups in return for blueprints of the blowpipe a 
shoulderfired antiaircraft missile made at short brothers a 
factory in belfast northern ireland 
the democratic partys defense spokesman dave dalling said 
storm should be charged as soon as he returns to south africa to 
hash out the whole affair in an open court 
presumably it is a criminal offense for a south african 
citizen to conduct arms dealings with terrorist organizations 
said dalling 
he said such a step would demonstrate to the british government 
south africas good faith 
spokesmen for the rightwing conservative party opposition have 
also called for a government explanation 
in london on tuesday foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe told 
south africas visiting finance minister barend du plessis that 
he viewed with the utmost seriousness any supply of arms to 
violent groups in britains strifetorn province of northern 
ireland 
the reports embarrassing for south africa are clouding what 
british officials have claimed is a successful policy by prime 
minister margaret thatcher toward south africa she refuses to 
impose tough embargoes while pressing the whitecontrolled 
government to share political power with the black majority 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper in johannesburg said 
whatever happens now the incident will affect our credibility as 
a country opposed to terrorism in any shape or form 
the government accuses the major armed opponent of its apartheid 
system of racial segregation the african national congress of 
engaging in terrorism

york importer pleaded guilty tuesday to two felony charges each in 
the unlawful importing of unapproved animal drugs 
robert clack of pittsfield ill and heinz dall of ossining 
ny could be jailed for up to 10 years with dall facing fines of 
more than 500000 and clack up to 260000 
clack pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of 
making a false statement in the hearing before us district judge 
david hansen 
dall pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and another stemming 
from the importing of the illegal drug chloramphenicol 
more than a dozen additional charges against both men will be 
dropped when they are sentenced july 18 
clack dall and jeffery engel president of the now defunct 
custom feed blenders of fort dodge were charged last november with 
conspiring to ship tons of cheap outlawed toxic drugs from canada 
to animal feed manufacturers and veterinarians throughout the 
midwest the antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread 
of disease in animals 
engel earlier pleaded guilty to three counts 
two of the 16 drugs that clark and dall were charged with 
smuggling into the united states are prohibited from being used in 
any food animal while three are prohibited in hogs or cattle

richard teske deputy director of the center for veterinary 
medicine at the food and drug administration rockville md said 
that chloramphenicol is so potent that any dose is critical

the communist party swept out 110 senior officials 
many thought to be inactive and conservative and promoted 24 
people tuesday in a major reshuffle that expands mikhail s 
gorbachevs power base to push for reform 
the partys policymaking central committee retired 74 of its 
301 full members including former president andrei a gromyko 24 
nonvoting members and 12 members of the central auditing 
commission which handles party finances 
party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a news conference 
they volunteered to step down and the central committee unanimously 
approved 
at a full meeting of the committee the officials issued a joint 
request that referred to president gorbachevs campaign for 
perestroika or restructuring now that all comrades on the 
communist party central committee and the central auditing 
commission should work hard to further perestroika it is essential 
for us in the interest of the common cause to give up our 
powers 
medvedev remarked this is a serious and important milestone 
in our course perestroika which shows that our party is 
realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about 
its own activities 
the resignations followed the first contested nationwide 
elections in 70 years of communist rule on march 26 dozens of top 
party and government officials including more than 30 regional 
party chairmen were defeated 
it was not clear whether gorbachev had urged the officials to 
step aside tuesday but portraying their removal as voluntary was a 
deft tactical maneuver possibly meant to head off criticism that 
they wee ousted 
the military lost a substantial voice in the central committee 
at least nine senior officers were dropped and just one officer 
was promoted from candidate status to full membership 
the changes left the central committee with 251 members party 
personnel chief georgy p razumovsky told the news conference 
medvedev said 83 members or more than onequarter of the body 
lost the government and party jobs that entitled them to committee 
membership since the 27th party cngress elected them in 1986 
officially they lost their jobs because of poor health or age but 
some clearly fell from political favor 
of the 83 many were removed tuesday medvedev said a few others 
were too ill to sign the request 
western observers call such inactive officials dead souls 
and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms the term 
was borrowed from nikolai gogols 1842 novel dead souls about a 
rogue who buys the names of dead serfs to mortgage them as property 
jerry hough a political scientist at duke university in north 
carolina has said dead souls are accumulating at a rate of 
about 10 percent a year and by 1991 more than half the central 
committee members would fall into that category 
all but two of those promoted tuesday to full membership were 
made nonvoting members at the 1986 party congress gorbachevs 
first as general secretary the reshuffling between party 
congresses was extremely rare 
among others gorbachev might like to have on board in the 
central committee are six men named party leaders in the baltic 
republics of latvia lithuania and estonia and the caucasus 
republics of georgia armenia and azerbaijan all are potential 
gorbachev allies but cannot be appointed until a 1991 party 
congress 
the six republics have been wracked by ethnic unrest 
gorbachev has complained that opposition to his social and 
economic reform program known as perestroika extends all the way 
to the central committee the body has included many officials who 
held spots there long before he became party leader in march 1985 
in a speech to the central committee the 58yearold kremlin 
chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika 
many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of 
thinking and still at this time of utmost importance for the 
development of our society the central committee rose to the 
occasion gorbachev said 
but in remarks carried by the soviet news agency tass he added 
the situation has changed considerably comrades vast changes 
have taken place over this period also in state bodies and this 
required personnel changes 
tass said the retirees included gromyko who had retired as 
president last fall former politburo members geidar a aliev and 
mikhail s solomentsev and former nonvoting politburo member 
vladimir i dolgikh 
also dropped were sergei sokolov who was retired as defense 
minister in 1987 after west german teenager mathias rust flew a 
plane onto red square and karen demirchyan and kyamran bagirov 
who lost their jobs as first secretary of the armenian and 
azerbaijani parties respectively in ethnic unrest last may 
among those promoted were yevgeny velikhov vice president of 
the soviet academy of sciences and thought to be a close gorbachev 
supporter the ambassador to west germany yuli a kvitsinsky an 
arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with us 
officials in geneva and yevgeny primakov director of the 
institute of world economics and international relations

defense secretary dick cheney on tuesday 
predicted a very real likelihood that mikhail gorbachevs 
reform plans would fail and the soviet leader may either be forced 
to change course or hand over power 
cheney told congress that as a result the united states and its 
nato allies must resist the temptation to respond to gorbachevs 
proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to 
the policies it has advocated until now 
cheney testifying before the house armed services committee 
said he had watched gorbachev and had become convinced that he 
seeks change inside the soviet union but primarily because the 
soviet system has been a failure 
however i think its going to be extremely difficult for him 
to succeed and i think there is a very real likelihood that hell 
either have to reverse course or that for one reason or another 
ultimately have to resort to force perhaps in eastern europe 
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the 
soviet union 
and of course theres always the possibility that his 
successor may arrive fairly soon and may pursue radically different 
policies than he has he said 
in apparent reference to pressure from west germany for talks 
with the kremlin on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons cheney 
said i think were in a posture now where people are responding 
to what they perceive to be the intentions of the soviet leadership 
rather than what are the capabilities of the soviet military 
and we dont have the luxury of assuming that the intentions 
expressed by mr gorbachev necessarily are going to permanently 
become a part of the policies of the soviet union he cautioned 
nato must continue to resist the temptation to react to mr 
gorbachevs proposal of the month by trying to dismantle if you 
will some of our own military capabilities or alliance strength 
cheneys comments came as the state department accused the 
soviet union of trying to undermine natos nuclear defense and 
instructed us ambassadors in western capitals to counter the west 
german drive for negotiations 
the us offensive is designed to rally the north atlantic 
treaty organization against any reduction in nuclear battlefield 
weapons before president george bush meets with the 15 allied 
leaders in brussels at the end of may 
west german chancellor helmut kohl trying to counter growing 
support for disarmament in his country sent defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher to 
washington for talks to try to persuade the bush administration tn 
negotiate with the soviets over the missiles 
cheney said that having spent yesterday negotiating with 
stoltenberg and genscher over the kremlin proposal and natos plans 
for modernizing shortrange lance missiles in europe he is 
convinced that now more than ever the alliance requires strong 
leadership 
the united states will provide an example he said by 
maintaining its current troop strength in europe about 350000 
despite budgetary pressures at home to bring some forces home 
i would hope that eventually it will indeed be possible to 
take down some of those forces that are currently stationed over 
there and to restructure our military forces accordingly but i 
dont believe the summer of l989 is the time to do it he said

the federal agency overseeing the nations 
futures markets on tuesday recommended against increasing penalties 
for violating trading laws and called for more study on other 
suggested reforms 
the commodity futures trading commission in response to 
questions posed by sen patrick leahy dvt said it does not 
believe that proposals for treble damages and punitive damages 
would significantly enhance deterrence of violative conduct 
leahy chairman of the senate agriculture committee is 
exploring proposals to tighten regulation of futures markets in the 
wake of revelations that the fbi has conducted a twoyear 
undercover investigation of alleged abuses at the two largest 
futures exchanges the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
leahys panel and its counterpart in the house have been 
conducting hearings into the matter and on whether or not congress 
should extend the cftcs authorization to continue operating after 
sept 30 
the commission did not recommend increased penalties but it 
recommended removing a requirement that it consider a firm or 
traders financial condition before levying a penalty 
the commission chaired by wendy l gramm said the exchanges 
themselves should increase their surveillance programs but noted 
that a number were already doing so 
it said congress should increase the agencys staff by 20 
positions but recommended against changing the rules to offer 
higher pay to attract more qualified professionals instead the 
cftc said pay should be raised acrosstheboard for professional 
positions in the federal government 
it said it would support increasing the physical presence of 
cftc on exchange floors but said it was reviewing its staff to 
determine if that could be done without hurting other efforts 
in another area the cftc said it plans to monitor the 
composition of the boards that govern the exchanges to ensure that 
the public in addition to floor traders are adequately 
represented

a weekly published what was believed to 
be the first detailed report on the late cardinal josef mindszenty 
and his show trial for treason incarceration and seclusion in the 
us diplomatic mission 
in its latest issue idea carried a frontpage photo showing the 
cardinal praying in front of an altar 
idea was formerly the publication of the hungarian communist 
youth league which is now defunct it now refers to itself as a 
political weekly 
displaying a degree of press freedom unthinkable only months 
ago idea carried an eightpage report that included an account of 
mindszentys trial 
it also made frequent references to his memoirs and printed a 
speech hungarys roman catholic prelate made on nov 3 1956 a day 
before soviet tanks quashed a popular uprising against soviet rule 
in the speech the cardinal said the main aim of the hungarians 
should be the revitalization of the nation and demanded an 
allout effort of the entire country for progress 
mindszenty also said hungarys fate will be decided by what 
the russian empire decides to do we didnt attack russia and we 
hope that russian troops will be withdrawn from hungary 
however it took almost 33 years for the soviets to begin a 
withdrawal a first batch of soviet tanks were pulled out tuesday 
starting a partial pullout of 10000 red army soldiers 
mindszenty was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism and 
following a humiliating trial was sentenced to life in prison on 
trumpedup charges of high treason 
in 1956 he was freed from prison by hungarian revolutionaries 
after the soviets crushed the uprising mindszenty found shelter in 
the us mission in budapest until 1971 when he left under an 
agreement worked out between the vatican and hungary 
after a short stay in rome mindszenty settled in vienna where 
he died in 1975 at age 83 
konrad szanto a franciscan and historian was quoted by the 
magazine as saying there were increasing signs of a broad demand 
for the rehabilitation of mindszenty along with others who were 
imprisoned on similar phony charges 
last month imre pozsgay a politburo member and leading party 
reformer said mindszentys trial would be reviewed as part of the 
reexamination of all political trials in hungary between 1945 and 
1962

disintegration of the ottoman empire religous courts were 
abolished in 1924 and islam ceased to be the official state 
religion in 1928

a key figure in two 
federal investigations involving washington mayor marion barry was 
convicted tuesday of drug trafficking stemming from an undercover 
fbi operation 
an eightwoman fourman jury deliberated for 90 minutes before 
finding former virgin islands government consultant charles lewis 
guilty of all four drug counts against him the us district court 
trial took two days 
lewis 48 was charged with two counts of drug possession and 
two counts of distribution in the sale of 550 worth of crack a 
cocaine derivative to undercover fbi agents last month 
us attorney richard harris said each count carries a maximum 
sentence of 20 years and 1 million 
chief us district court judge david v obrien set sentencing 
for june 14 and released lewis on unsecured bond of 10000 lewis 
left the courtroom accompanied by his brother and sister 
lewis had pleaded innocent but did not testify 
lewis faces 10 felony charges in washington in a separate case 
in which district of columbia police reportedly were called off an 
attempted drug buy from lewis while barry was visiting his hotel 
room in the city 
a federal grand jury is looking into the circumstances of 
barrys visit to the hotel 
a second investigation involving lewis and barry focuses on the 
district of columbias joint personnel project with the virgin 
islands last year lewis headed the 266000 project for the us 
territory until he was fired by gov alexander farrelly in april 
1988 because of cost overruns 
in the current case the fbi accused lewis of selling 012 
ounces of crack worth 550 to two undercover agents march 2 and 3 
at a luxury hotel on st thomas one of the us virgin islands 
special fbi agent mary ann krauss who allegedly bought crack 
from lewis with agent joan burns testified that the fbi believed 
lewis had been using and selling cocaine for a long time 
the purpose of the undercover operation was to prove or 
disprove mr lewis association with drugs she said 
the agent said she and ms burns were introduced to lewis march 
2 by a patricia teal identified in court only as a cooperating 
citizen and bought two 25 bags of crack the same day 
ms krauss said arrangements were made to buy 500 worth of 
crack and a 15 pipe for smoking the drug to be delivered to a room 
at the frenchmens reef hotel 
our scenario was to suggest a party to lewis the agent 
testified 
defense attorney leonard francis argued that the fbi used female 
agents to entice lewis into the illegal drug transaction 
was it coincidence that lewis that there were three people 
three ladies awaiting him to see if he can buy drugs francis 
asked the jury 
before closing arguments tuesday however judge obrien denied 
a defense motion to dismiss the case on ground of entrapment 
psychiatrist olaf hendricks testifying for the defense said 
lewis told him he was a longtime abuser of alcohol and was 
psychologically addicted to crack 
obrien told the jury that drug addiction could not be cited as 
a reason for acquittal

a judge tuesday overturned the murder 
conviction of a former migrant farm worker in the poisoning deaths 
of his seven children freeing the 53yearold man after 21 years 
in prison 
retired circuit judge clifton kelly released james richardson 
53 to the custody of defense attorney ellis rubin of miami 
the decision came after an extraordinary appeal in which both 
rubin and special prosecutor janet reno agreed that richardson a 
black man who was convicted by an allwhite jury had been 
railroaded 
within my heart i knew that these great men were going to get 
me out they werent going to let me stay in there the 
grayhaired richardson flanked by his attorneys told the 
associated press right now i feel fine 
richardson was convicted in 1968 of murdering his oldest child 
an 8yearold daughter and sentenced to death his sentence was 
later commuted to life imprisonment 
this court is now convinced that the defendant did not receive 
a fair trial kelly told a packed courtroom in the desoto county 
courthouse 
there is a definite possibility of a different outcome in the 
trial if material that the defense should have had access to had 
been provided by the prosecution he said 
the judge denied defense attorney mark lanes motion to dismiss 
the charge saying the state would decide later whether to retry 
the case 
reno however said the charges would be dropped within about 10 
days 
richardsons attorneys said they were thrilled 
we have shown the world there is justice in florida said 
rubin 
richardsons wife annie mae cried when she heard the judges 
decision she raised her arms to the heavens and said thank you 
thank you 
gov bob martinez who had appointed reno to review the case 
said the evidence justified richardsons release 
mr richardson has lost too many years of his life in prison 
but my hope is that this decision will give him an opportunity to 
rebuild martinez said in tallahassee the capital 
kelly spent the day listening to arguments from three sides 
richardsons defense attorneys the former prosecutor who brought 
the case in 1968 and the special prosecutor he deliberated about 
30 minutes before making his ruling 
lane had argued that the state attorney and the desoto county 
sheriff at the time of the trial railroaded richardson by 
manufacturing and encouraging perjured testimony and by withholding 
essential evidence from the defense 
now the state and the defense both say the judgment of 
conviction must be vacated said lane a washington dc lawyer 
and author who first alleged a frameup in the case in his 1971 
book arcadia 
ms reno a state attorney from miami agreed with some of 
lanes conclusions that the prosecution and the sheriff had aided 
in violating the defendants right to an impartial trial 
she said former state attorney frank schaub and thenassistant 
state attorney john treadwell had withheld six key pieces of 
exculpatory evidence that could have changed the outcome 
schaub who has said he remains convinced of the defendants 
guilt denied the use of perjured testimony or the withholding of 
key information 
he accused ms reno of a hatchet job and said she and her 
staff had little respect for the truth in their zeal to free 
a childkiller 
the exstate attorney called himself the last remaining 
protector of the rights of these poor young defenseless 
children he is suing lane and rubin for alleged defamation of 
character 
lane charged that schaub treadwell and thensheriff frank cline 
forced jail inmates and others to testify against richardson and 
suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant 
lane said cline was friendly to bessie reese the babysitter who 
originally came under suspicion in the poisoning case and lied to 
protect her cline was with ms reese on the morning in 1967 when 
richardson children were fed lunch laced with parathion a 
sincebanned deadly insecticide lane said 
ms reese who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing 
home has confessed to nurses to the deaths according to an 
affidavit from nurses no charges have been filed against her and 
prosecutors have said she has become confused 
kelly 71 was appointed from retirement by the florida supreme 
court to hear the arguments 
the case has drawn intense attention in the area and security 
was heavy at the courthouse

american tv evangelist pat robertson 
said tuesday that nicaraguas leftist sandinista government is 
willing to stop accepting soviet military aid and slash the size of 
its army under a regional peace plan 
robertson said vice president sergio ramirez also told him 
nicaragua would let neutral observers inspect its military 
installations and allow international monitors at the borders 
im not an official of the united states government nor do i 
speak for them robertson told a news conference but it would 
appear to me as a private citizen that if the nicaraguan government 
agrees to a comprehensive arms settlement and if such a settlement 
is accompanied by truly valid verification procedures such a 
proposal would be warmly received by the bush administration 
nicaraguas presidential press office told the associated press 
it would seek verification from ramirezs office of what robertson 
told reporters 
a us embassy spokeswoman said the embassy had no comment 
because robertson was on a private visit 
neither robertson nor ramirez issued statements when they met at 
ramirezs office monday night 
when roberton sought the republican presidential nomination last 
year he strongly supported usbacked rebels in nicaragua known 
as contras in 1985 he called the contras an army of god 
president daniel ortega left on a 10nation european tour 
saturday seeking financial help for nicaragua in an economic 
crisis with hyperinflation and declining production 
several european countries have said further aid depends on 
nicaraguas efforts toward democratization and free and fair 
general elections next feb 25 
ortega on tuesday addressed a session of the european parliament 
in brussels belgium and invited the parliamentarians to send 
observers to monitor nicaraguas electoral process up to and 
including the february voting 
he pledged fair and open elections and defended a new electoral 
law which his foes at home denounced as undemocratic 
i extend a formal invitation to the european parliament to 
send a team of observers so they get to know the whole 
political situation in the country ortega said 
however a group of about 40 people including opposition party 
members gathered in managua on tuesday to protest the governments 
electoral reforms 
violeta chamorro publisher of the opposition daily la prensa 
said the reforms violate accords that ortega made last february 
with other regional leaders this is a first violation of those 
accords this law is a fraud she said 
the opposition says the new law does not give it equal access to 
media outlets it also says the reforms give the sandinistas 
control of the supreme electoral council 
robertson came to nicaragua monday for the resumption of a 
spanishlanguage version of his evangelical tv show 700 club 
which last broadcast here in august 1979 a month after the 
sandinistas rose to power 
the principal reason of my visit is religious robertson 
said nevertheless in my meeting with the vice president in 
answer to my questions he said speaking for the government of 
nicaragua that he was prepared to accept as part of a central 
american peace initiative reductions in the nicaraguan army to 
25000 men 
estimates of the size of nicaraguas armed forces run as high as 
123000 men robertson later said ramirez gave no time frame for 
effecting these reductions 
ramirez also said nicaragua would accept international 
monitors of nicaraguas borders to ensure no traffic in arms or 
combatants in or out of nicaragua or any other countries in central 
america according to robertson 
washington has accused nicaragua of supplying arms to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador separated by only 25 miles by the gulf 
of fonseca 
the vice president indicated he would agree to international 
inspections by neutral observers of nicaraguan military equipment 
and installations robertson added 
he also indicated to me that as part of a central american 
peace plan the government would agree to complete cessation by 
nicaragua of accepting soviet arms and equipment 
ortega and the presidents of el salvador honduras costa rica 
and guatemala signed an accord last feb 14 that calls for 
electoral and other reforms in nicaragua they also agreed to come 
up with a plan by may 15 to dismantle the contras 
about 11000 contras and their relatives have dwelt in honduran 
jungle camps since march 1988 when contra and sandinista leaders 
signed a ceasefire earlier the us congress cut off military 
aid to the contras

several hundred friends associates and 
diplomatic colleagues said goodbye tuesday to cuban envoy ramon 
sanchez parodi who said the lack of a political will is 
blocking improved relations between his country and the united 
states 
at a buffet reception given by sanchez parodi in the ornate old 
cuban embassy building on 16th street the departing envoy offered 
scant hope of warmer uscuban relations under president bush 
asked about the prospects he replied that is for the 
administration to say not for us 
there is a need for a political will to improve relations 
said sanchez parodi who leaves thursday to become cubans deputy 
foreign minister after nearly 12 years as fidel castros diplomatic 
representative in washington 
he will be succeeded by jose antonio arbezu vice chairman of 
the central committee of the cuban communist party for american 
affairs who is scheduled to arrive in may 
among those offering best wishes to sanchez parodi in his new 
post were rep ted weiss dny mrs claiborne pell wife of the 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and washington 
lawyer r sargent shriver who also is chairman of special olympics 
international 
shriver a democratic vice presidential candidate in 1972 said 
he thanked sanchez parodi for cubas participation in special 
olympics athletic games for the mentally retarded and handicapped 
for the past eight years 
this gentleman has been very helpful in maintaining good 
working relations between the special olympics and the cuban 
government shriver said im just here to wish him well in his 
new job 
although sanchez parodi was invited to several white house 
social events during the carter administration after he opened a 
small cuban diplomatic mission here in the summer of 1977 he was 
given the deep freeze during president reagans eight years in 
office 
no bush administration official attended the cuban missions 
farewell party for sanchez parodi who had been officially snubbed 
by the white house and the state department throughout the reagan 
administration 
his last invitation to a white house social event was when he 
attended a reception for the washington diplomatic corps shortly 
after reagan took office in january 1981 
sanchez parodi refused comment on a memorandum that secretary of 
state james a baker iii sent to us diplomatic posts last month 
in which he declared that improved relations with cuba were 
impossible until cuba stops fomenting subversion in the western 
hemisphere and supporting soviet expansionism

judges hoping to find an opening line to 
rise to the literary heights of it was a dark and stormy night 
will approach their task fortified by soggy potato chips and 
cheap wine 
judging of the annual bulwerlytton fiction contest is about to 
begin and the poor souls faced with the brainnumbing task of 
poring over thousands of convoluted clumsy or just plain bad 
entries need something else to turn their stomachs 
scott rice the san jose state university english professor who 
started the contest eight years ago calls it a literary sting 
operation to expose the worlds wretchedest writers to flash a 
spotlight on the seamy underside of literature 
this year weve gotten a lot of entries from places like new 
zealand and australia the people down under have taken a big 
interest in the contest said rice 
rice said he goes over the entries before the judging and tosses 
out anything too well written after all youve got to keep up 
down the standards of a rotten writing contest he said 
appropriately judges will be energized by soggy potato chips 
and cheap wine results will be announced may 5 
the contest is named for lord edward george earle bulwerlytton 
who with a leap of timeless turgidity wafted to literary 
immortality with the opening it was a dark and stormy night 
the central rule of the contest is to write the opening 
sentence to the worst possible hypothetical novel in any genre they 
choose like this entry from conroe texas 
like an overripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese 
the corpulent remains of santa claus lay dead on the hotel floor 
or from coral gables fla 
jake liked his women the way he liked his kiwi fruit sweet 
yet tart firmfleshed yet yielding to the touch and covered with 
short brown fuzzy hair 
if those deliciously rotten examples fail to bring a tear maybe 
this slippery gem from washington dc will do the job her 
mouth said nonono but every other inch of her throbbing 
glistening body said yesyesyes except for her pancreas 
the first competition in the unlikely contest drew only six 
entries to a high point of 20000 entries from around the globe 
three years ago 
rice said he created the contest to provoke san jose state 
students to approach writing playfully and with a sense of whimsy 
a campus literary organization is named the bulwerlytton 
undergraduate society 
we try to promote the philosophy that people should approach 
the language recreationally as well as practically the professor

the creator of a large photograph of a 
crucified christ submerged in urine said tuesday his critics were 
flattering the work by creating a furor over it 
an organization in tupelo has condemned the federal and private 
funding of the artist and an exhibit of his work saying it 
reflected bigotry against christians 
the creator of piss christ was a winner in the awards in the 
visual arts funded by the rockefeller foundation the equitable 
foundation and the national endowment for the arts 
the american family association said monday that tax dollars 
should not have gone toward the 15000 award for the artist 
andres serrano his was one of 10 such awards last year 
the person at the national endowment for the arts responsible 
for approving federal tax dollars for promotion of the work of 
art should be fired said the rev donald e wildmon a united 
methodist minister who heads the tupelobased association 
wildmon said the equitable foundation a section of equitable 
life assurance society of the united states and the rockefeller 
foundation owe christians a public apology and assurance that 
they will not be a party to such antichristian bigotry in the 
future 
serrano said tuesday from new york that he expected some 
opposition to his work primarily because of the title 
i feel when people attack a work of art to such a great 
extent they imbue it with a far greater power than when they 
ignore it and in that im flattered that they think it deserves 
such attention 
as winner of the stipend the artist selects a work for a 
national tour the 38yearold new york artist said piss 
christ the piece he selected for tour was a limited edition of 
four prints one print he said already has been sold to a private 
collector for 3600 the work is not currently on exhibit 
joseph slye a national endowment for the arts spokesman 
defended the award 
expression not prohibited by federal law is protected by the 
first amendment he said moreover the endowment is expressly 
forbidden in its authorizing legislation from interfering with the 
artistic choices made by its grantees 
the national endowment for the arts supports the right of 
grantee organizations to select on artistic criteria their 
artistrecipients and present their work even though sometimes the 
work may be deemed controversial and offensive to some 
individuals slye said we at the endowment do none the less 
deeply regret any offense to any individual 
stefan stux owner of the stux gallery in new york which handles 
serranos works said the photograph was created by immersing an 
image of the crucified christ in a glass container of urine he 
had collected from himself 
when you look at it you would never know that all you can 
see is the image of jesus christ in a kind of hazy yellowish mist 
a kind of poetical image if you did not know the title of it you 
could be very enraptured by the beauty of it it is very pleasing 
poetic and spiritual 
he said the artist uses other body fluids in his art including 
blood he was born in the christian faith he feels very much a 
part of that stux said he has deep religious feelings but he 
does not express them exactly the way every other guy does 
rockefeller foundation president peter goldmark said in new 
york i respect the right of any individual to object to a work 
of art and the parallel right of artists to express themselves and 
of exhibitors to show works that they deem interesting and 
meritorious artistically i think tolerance and mutual respect for 
such rights may be the qualities we most need in order to get along 
together on this planet

a number of atlanta banks and thrift institutions 
said tuesday they would cooperate with a justice department 
investigation of possible racial discrimination in the areas 
mortgage lending industry 
im sure the justice department will find a good level of 
cooperation among atlantas financial institutions said dallas 
lee a spokesman for citizens and southern national bank 
the washington post reported tuesday that the justice department 
wants to see loan records covering the past five years as part of 
an investigation of the 64 banks and savings and loan associations 
in the metropolitan atlanta area 
the newspaper said the agencys civil rights division in 
letters that began arriving monday gave the institutions official 
notice that they are under civil investigation the letters signed 
by acting assistant attorney general james p turner asked the 
institutions to make the records available voluntarily it said 
lee and others said the banks have taken significant steps in 
the past year to do away with discrimination in mortgage lending 
we are surprised that atlanta was the city the justice 
department picked for its investigation considering all the 
activities that have taken place in the last year said bo 
spalding director of communications for bank south i wouldnt 
be surprised if after all of this atlanta has a rather exemplary 
record of minority lending 
we dont feel we have discriminated overtly said james j 
wallace of fulton federal savings bank i dont think there is a 
single instance of outright discrimination by any of the larger 
institutions 
the post said the case is the broadest inquiry into socalled 
redlining since the government settled a suit against the national 
real estate appraisal associations in the late 1970s 
redlining which is prohibited by federal law is the refusal to 
lend on the basis of race or other factors unrelated to credit 
worthiness 
the investigation was prompted by articles beginning last may in 
the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution that disclosed a 
segregated mortgage system in which banks and thrifts made few 
loans in black areas even in upperincome black areas and often 
made mortgage services less accessible to black home buyers 
atlantas largest banks responded to the articles by pooling 77 
million for lowinterest mortgages primarily in black 
neighborhoods a few of the largest banks also changed some 
policies such as increasing contacts with black real estate 
agents many smaller institutions reported no changes 
the justice inquiry going beyond information available to the 
newspaper seeks records of actual loan applications and credit 
reports on mortgage applicants the post said

president bush barnstormed california on 
tuesday sending a message to drug dealers that you are going to 
be out of business and asking the entertainment industry to raise 
its voice against illegal narcotics 
i never want to see a movie again that makes drug use into 
something humorous bush said it is time that they got behind 
this crusade 
he also campaigned for smaller budget deficits and lower taxes 
on capital gains 
bush blended a variety of sharply different themes in a 
threestop series of appearances in northern and southern 
california on the second day of a busy fourday trip through six 
states 
the journey took him from a ford aerospace plant in palo alto to 
a remote ranch in orange county seized from an alleged drug kingpin 
and finally to los angeles for an appearance before a hispanic 
audience 
opening the day bush started to say he was in north carolina 
but quickly caught himself and corrected it to north california 
later bush toured the 213acre rancho del rio described by the 
white house as once housing the largest marijuana network in the 
united states now it is used by orange county as a training 
facility for drug enforcement officers 
bush did not propose any new federal initiatives but called on 
the entertainment industry to use its influence as a tool against 
drugs 
he said entertainers have raised your voices so effectively in 
the cause of so many issues can you not raise them once more in 
support of a cause so important 
he turned over to law enforcement officials 10 million 
recovered from drug dealers 
he called the money the bounty of defeated drug criminals 
and said let these funds go to fighting the war they once 
financed 
and let us send a message loud and clear to every drug 
merchant in america you are going to be out of business 
bush said we wont build a better america until we win the 
war on drugs he said drug users were living lives without hope 
or meaning 
were looking at a desperation that money alone will never 
cure we wont win this one with our wallets alone we will win it 
through our collective effort and our collective will 
in los angeles bush met with republican hispanic supporters he 
said hispanics were building a better america through family 
church love of country and belief in the value of hard work 
he said as americas fastestgrowing minority in the 21st 
century you more than ever will help tell the american story

after the hispanic reception in los angeles bush flew by 
helicopter to anaheim to watch a baseball game between the 
california angeles and the baltimore orioles he was to remain in 
los angeles overnight and meet wednesday with former president 
ronald reagan 
at his first stop of the day bush said the best investment for 
americas future would be to cut the huge federal budget deficit 
warning that tough talks still lie ahead to achieve that goal 
he said the nation must be more competitive to sustain the 
economic recovery that has produced nearly 20 million jobs over the 
last seven years 
bush spoke to workers at ford aerospaces space systems division 
in palo alto the facility which employs 2000 people produces 
communications satellites tactical weapons systems space systems 
and other hightech products 
after touring the aerospace facility bush told the audience 
that the best investment in the future is to slash the federal 
deficit every dollar the government does not borrow means more 
capital available for investment 
he noted that he recently concluded a sketchy agreement with 
congress to cut the deficit to 994 billion in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 the blueprint does not provide much detail about 
how the reduction will be achieved 
now this plans an agreed outline bush said tough talks 
still lie ahead 
he said think of deficit reduction as an exercise like 
walking the dog every day believe me i know exercise keeps you 
at the top of your game 
while challenging the nation to become more competitive in 
technological innovation bush did not offer any new initiatives 
he made a new pitch to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15 
percent from its current level of 28 percent lower capital gains 
taxes will create jobs for those who dont have jobs and help build 
a better america 
he laced his speech with television soundbite lines such as i 
want to give the highfive symbol to high tech and i want to do it 
by investing in competitiveness 
ticking off some of his proposals bush noted he has proposed a 
permanent extension of tax credits for research and 
experimentation and has asked congress for an increase of 24 
billion for nasa 
let us use our own technological prowess to expand free and 
fair trade bush said im talking about excellence in such 
fields as microcomputers superconductivity and yes aerospace 
before an audience of whitecollar workers bush also extolled 
his proposal for a childcare tax credit for lowincome parents 
his plan would provide a credit of up to 1000 for each child 
under age 4 in poor families 
our proposal urges a nex tax credit to make child care more 
affordable bush said and it puts money in the hands of the 
lowincome parents limits federal intervention and increases 
options 
a church can help or grandparents or professional nursery 
he said when it comes to child care we say let the parents 
decide keep the family strong and we must do that

at the drug store straddling the 
pennsylvaniaohio line the big money tuesday moved to carol 
mcghees lottery machine in pennsylvania and ignored debbie 
trinckes machine in ohio the difference was a fortune 
the super 7 jackpot soared to 100 million in pennsylvania and 
its upper reaches were limited only by the deadline for the drawing 
wednesday night 
miss trinckes sold a few tickets for the ohio lotterys super 
lotto game worth a mere 3 million but even she crossed the line 
to plunk down 20 for 20 tickets in pennsylvania 
i dont even play their lottery she said but since its 
so high i decided to 
lottery fever heightened not just in pennsylvania but around the 
country as state officials upped the ante in the super 7 lottery 
drawing to at least 100 million based on everspeeding ticket 
sales from the delaware river to the pennohio drug store off us 
62 
the jackpot is the result of six straight weekly drawings with 
no winner and international publicity which generated ticket sales 
monday of 19 million and a state record for daily sales of 2434 
million tuesday last weeks jackpot was 46 million 
a single winner of the 100 million would receive almost 385 
million a year for 26 years lottery officials said 
pennsylvanias super 7 game lets players choose seven numbers 
from 1 to 80 for 1 if those seven are among 11 numbers selected 
the combination wins the jackpot a chance lottery officials put at 
96 million to 1

commercial flights into pittsburgh and philadelphia to get a chance 
for the biggestever jackpot in north america 
the line outside the twostate store northeast of youngstown 
ohio grew to 150 people at times sometimes stretching all the way 
across the state line as patrons waited for the stores two 
pennsylvania lottery machines to crank out up 2000 tickets per 
hour together 
store senior vice president bob annis suggested to customers at 
the end of the line that they may have more luck at least buying 
tickets in nearby mercer about 20 miles into pennsylvania 
we want your business but were running at capacity come 
back tomorrow he said 
most ohioans were not deterred 
you can tell everybody that the winning ticket is going to 
cleveland said james casey 36 ive been a police officer for 
12 years and if i win im going to retire 
harry brandt 52 of ravenna ohio admitted he may be foolish 
to take the longest of long shots but said what else are you 
going to do not play 
miss mcghee 40 of sharon said selling the tickets was not as 
hectic as it appeared she noted clerks get a chance to rest when 
the machine prints tickets for large orders of 20 or more 
she was able to rest tuesday morning when one player ordered 200 
tickets and on monday one player bought 672 tickets coworkers 
still talked about a man who put up 1400 for tickets last 
thursday and gave them a 52minute break

radio messages recorded the morning the 
exxon valdez hit a reef show the ships captain spent up to an hour 
trying to rock the tanker free which could have sunk the ship and 
spilled more oil the coast guard said tuesday 
the captain ignored coast guard warnings that trying to move the 
ship could have spilled the entire 12 millionbarrel cargo making 
the nations worst oil spill almost five times as bad the 
recordings show 
but the coast guard commander who began monitoring the spill 
shortly after it began said he did not fault the tanker skippers 
desperate efforts and said he doubted they caused much more damage 
than already had occurred 
i think he probably used all his mariners skills after the 
grounding said cmdr steve mccall obviously before the 
grounding he didnt do all he could to prevent it because it 
happened 
the state revised the estimate of the oil spilled from the 
tankers punctured tanks to 112 million gallons officials said 
its crews had been busy with the cleanup and were slow revising 
exxons original estimate of 101 million gallons 
exxon said it has been hit with 31 lawsuits and 1300 claims 
ranging from 500 to 4 million in connection with the spill and 
expects more lawsuits as well as government fines at a meeting of 
securities analysts top exxon executives of the company said the 
company already had paid 400000 to settle smaller claims 
environmental damage from the oil still is being assessed but 
three hatcheries in oilsoaked prince william sound have begun 
releasing millions of tiny salmon because the annual bloom of 
plankton an important food source for the fry was at its peak 
you cant stop mother nature said heather mccarty 
spokeswoman for the nonprofit association that owns the three 
hatcheries by midmay 800 million salmon fry will be released 
from five hatcheries throughout the sound 
if we dont release them now or within the next few days 
theyll miss the peak for plankton flowering then they wont 
survive for sure she said 
salmon fry tend to swim close to the surface of the water and 
remain close to shorelines until they migrate to the open sea 
mccarty said 
exxon estimates at least 1 million gallons of oil still is 
floating on the water of the sound and the gulf of alaska and the 
fry may encounter oil 
oilskimming operations were hampered by a third straight day of 
rough seas most vessels remained anchored in safe harbors and 
snow fell in valdez 
alyeska pipeline service co the consortium of oil companies 
that operates the pipeline and marine terminal announced it had 
purchased three emergency response vessels and would use them 
starting may 15 to help tugs escort tankers from valdez through 
prince william sound to the gulf of alaska 
the exxon valdez was not guided by tugs when it ran aground 
march 24 
the recorded radio messages showed that mccall in valdez 
warned capt joseph hazelwood to take it slow and easy in 
trying to get the ship off the reef that ripped his hull 
before you make any drastic attempt to get away make sure you 
dont you know start doing any ripping mccall said you got 
a rising tide i wouldnt recommend doing much wiggling 
but hazelwood already had begun trying to free the tanker 
a little problem here with the third mate but were working 
our way off the reef hazelwood said weve ah the vessel has 
been holed and were ascertaining right now were trying to get 
her off the reef and well get back to you as soon as we can 
the third mate was gregory cousins whom exxon says had been 
given control of the ship as it maneuvered through prince william 
sound on its way to the gulf of alaska and on to long beach calif 
cousins who was not certified to control the ship in the sound 
has been unavailable for comment 
the reef was well outside the shipping lane through the sound 
the first word of the accident came at 1227 am ast when 
hazelwood informed the coast guard in valdez that he was aground 
leaking some oil and were going to be here for awhile 
the ships logs indicate the ship ran aground 23 minutes earlier 
hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of 
pollution into the water all misdemeanors 
his attorney dick madson said hazelwood will return to alaska 
voluntarily perhaps as early as next week and definitely before a 
may 5 extradition hearing in new york 
the radio tapes were obtained in a freedom of information act 
request filed by the anchorage daily news which published details 
of the conversations in a copyright story in its tuesday editions 
mccall said he doubted trying to free the ship exacerbated the 
problem to any significant degree the ships hull had at least 
eight holes some up to 24 feet in diameter 
chief petty officer dick wehn said typically the risk of rocking 
a stuck ship is that it may enlarge any holes in the bottom of the 
boat 
knowing what we know now i believe it would have gone down 
mccall said 
dan lawn of the state department of environmental conservation 
said the tanker was shifting creaking and groaning when he boarded 
it about three hours after it ran aground

finance minister tatsuo murayama said tuesday that 
japans policy of coordinating economic and currency matters with 
its western partners will not change with the resignation of prime 
minister noburu takeshita 
its not something that depends on one leader murayama told 
reporters 
takeshitas announcement tuesday that he would resign came at a 
delicate time in japans international affairs the announcement 
was followed by official reassurances that foreign and economic 
policies would remain steady 
but the nation is expected to endure weeks of political 
uncertainty as a successor is found leaving takeshita a lameduck 
leader 
the prime minister said he would step down after parliament 
passes the fiscal 1989 budget but parliament is stalled by an 
opposition boycott over the scandal enveloping the governing 
liberal democrat party and no legislative timetable exists for the 
leadership transition 
washington will meanwhile be approaching crucial decisions on 
how to deal with japans huge trade surplus other countries may 
have to wait for word on japanese aid and future moves on 
increasing cooperation in the pacific region 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with president 
bush in san jose calif said japan is a close ally and friend 
we will continue to work closely with the new prime minister and 
government 
with a long holiday period called golden week starting 
saturday a number of cabinet members were scheduled to make trips 
to the united states the soviet union and other countries 
america will decide next month whether to impose sanctions 
against japan under the new trade law because of the huge us 
deficit in trade with japan and several ministers were to leave 
sunday for talks in washington to try to avoid penalties 
among them were hiroshi mitsuzuka minister for international 
trade and industry and agriculture minister tsutomu hata 
mitsuzuka told reporters he expected to go ahead with his trip 
unless prevented by parliamentary business the passage of the 
budget for the new fiscal year should be given top priority he 
said 
takeshita said he would go ahead with a nineday trip to five 
southeast asian countries starting saturday because of the need 
for consistency and continuity in japans foreign policy 
foreign minister sousuke uno remained set to visit moscow for 
talks on a peace treaty and then go on to mongolia japan and the 
soviet union have yet to close the books on world war ii 
analysts were divided on whether the widespread political 
scandal that prompted takeshitas resignation had an international 
impact 
yozo yokoda professor of international law at international 
christian university said bureaucrats here carry out policy and 
switching prime ministers would have little effect on the 
governments ability to function 
but he said foreign countries would be watching how japan deals 
with the scandal in which the recruit co conglomerate is 
suspected of using bribes and dubious share transactions to buy 
influence with politicians and bureaucrats 
scandals are common in any democracy yokoda said whats 
more important is how to overcome the scandal it will show the 
level of the countrys democracy if one dirty politician leaves 
only to be replaced by another dirty one the japanese political 
system will lose the trust of other countries 
foreign secretary raul manglapus of the philippines said in 
manila that takeshitas talks there would center on japans role in 
a multinational program to supply 10 billion in aid to the 
philippines 
malaysias foreign minister abu hassan omar said the 
resignation is a shock but we respect his position he noted 
that takeshita launched a development fund to benefit the six 
members of the association of southeast asian nations and he hoped 
such aid would continue 
asean members are thailand malaysia singapore indonesia 
brunei and the philippines takeshita is to visit all except brunei 
president suharto will receive takeshita with full honors in 
indonesia state secretary moerdiono said in jakarta he said 
suharto described the visit as an indication of the close 
relationship between japan and indonesia japans aid to indonesia 
is about 3 billion a year 
south korean president roh taewoos scheduled may 2427 visit 
to tokyo already postponed from last november because of the fatal 
illness of emperor hirohito may be put off again government 
sources in seoul said tuesday 
the japanese situation may take a long time to calm down so 
it may be practically impossible for mr roh to make a trip this 
year said a foreign ministry source there speaking on condition 
of anonymity

its regrettable that this kind of fission has developed but the

he joined the republican party 
while opponents of the choice appeared to be gearing up for what 
could be a bruising fight for senate confirmation sen edward m 
kennedy dmass a leading member of the judiciary committee told 
reporters in boston that he would withhold judgment on lucas 
pending hearings 
well have a chance to examine his record kennedy said 
noting reservations expressed by civil rights groups 
lucas has said he generally opposes racial hiring quotas but 
once told an interviewer that there were some specific areas 
where quotas are appropriate 
lucas has said he disagreed with attempts by the reagan 
administration to overturn affirmativeaction plans for the detroit 
police department and the memphis tenn fire department 
since thornburgh recommended lucas in february lucas has drawn 
criticism from some civil rights leaders who question whether he is 
qualified to be the governments chief civil rights enforcer 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations said his 
group is concerned that lucas lacks civil rights and legal 
experience the groups executive committee has not taken a 
position on lucas neas said it would meet shortly to discuss 
whether to take one 
william lucas is a disappointing choice for the most important 
civil rights job in the federal government a job for which 
expertise and experience are absolutely vital said arthur j 
kropp president of people for the american way instead of a 
strong civil rights advocate bush has chosen a man whose 
qualifications and record are at best a question mark he added 
in a statement 
people for the american way a wellfinanced liberal 
organization helped spearhead the 1987 fight to have the senate 
reject president reagans nomination of robert bork for the supreme 
court 
on monday the national association for the advancement of 
colored people the nations oldest and largest civil rights group 
announced its opposition saying we do not believe mr lucas is 
the person for this post 
but opposition to lucas is not universal among black civil 
rights leaders the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference praised lucas in a letter to 
thornburgh 
rep john conyers a black democrat from detroit reiterated his 
support on tuesday saying a fight by civil rights groups to block 
senate confirmation would be a useless one maybe even 
counterproductive 
as far as i can see this is as good a nomination as we are 
going to get conyers said adding that if lucas is defeated 
bushs next choice would also disappoint civil rights groups 
my suspicions are that he wont pick anybody better and he 
wont pick another africanamerican conyers said well end up 
regretting this hypercritical examination that some people choose 
to indulge in with reference to bill lucas 
opponents have pointed to lucas record as sheriff of wayne 
county mich which includes detroit as evidence he lacks the 
qualifications and sensitivity to run the civil rights division 
they cite a 1976 court decision in which he was held in contempt 
of court for failure to reduce overcrowding in the wayne county 
jail lucas has contended his hands were tied by the refusal of 
local authorities to appropriate more money but the court also 
cited him for failure to improve conditions it said were within his 
control 
in 1985 a federal appellate court in a case involving 
allegations a prisoner was severely beaten while in custody 
criticized lucas saying he failed to implement training procedures 
that would have prevented the incident 
lucas who also served as wayne county executive has been 
criticized for listing himself as an assistant us attorney in the 
justice department on resumes he prepared in the 1970s 
lucas served as a researcher in the justice departments civil 
rights division in the early 1960s but resigned in 1963 after he 
failed to pass the district of columbia bar examination 
the rev jesse jackson sounded a conciliatory note 
after an appearance tuesday night at harvards john f kennedy 
school of government jackson said we would be better served by 
meeting with him than confronting him 
i hope he serves well said jackson who said a major 
challenge for lucas would be interpreting the socalled richmond 
decision by the us supreme court in january that struck down 
the citys minority contract quota system 
jackson urged lucas not to attempt to broaden the applications 
of the decision to other cities 
while jackson said he would oppose an allout senate 
confirmation fight he said the senate should judge lucas by an 
objective set of criteria and if he fails the test he should be 
rejected

an aide to noboru takeshita killed himself 
wednesday after the prime minister announced he would resign partly 
because of financial dealings handled by the aide police said 
japan broadcasting corp said ihei aoki committed suicide by 
slashing his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home in 
tokyo on wednesday morning the network quoted police and fire 
officials as saying an ambulance crew responding to an emergency 
call found him dead 
officials at the tokyo metropolitan police headquarters 
confirmed that aoki 58 had slashed his wrists 
aoki had handled political donations stock purchases and loans 
from the recruit co which is at the hub of the bribery scandal 
that toppled takeshita there was no immediate comment on the 
suicide from takeshita whom aoki had served as aide for three 
decades 
two days before takeshita announced his resignation news 
reports surfaced that aoki had accepted a loan from the recruit co 
of 384000 in 1987 for use in takeshitas campaign to succeed 
yasuhiro nakasone as prime minister the money was later paid back 
the revelation embarrassed takeshita because he had not included 
it in a report to parliament on april 11 when he acknowledged 
receiving more than 1 million in legal political donations from 
recruit an information conglomerate 
takeshita did not blame aoki in his resignation statement but 
news reports monday said he had not known of the loan when he spoke 
to parliament the reports said the aide had not informed him of it 
until saturday 
recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling 
shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians 
bureaucrats business leaders and media executives 
takeshita through aoki and a relative received some of those 
shares which skyrocketed in value after they went on public sale 
in late 1986 aoki bought 2000 shares which yielded a profit of 
about 30000 
the scandal has forced the resignations of three cabinet 
ministers in addition to takeshita and led to the arrests of 14 
businessmen and bureaucrats

three years after james garner and james wood 
starred in an awardwinning television special about schizophrenia 
the actors have reunited for a production that can best be 
described as sobering 
my name is bill w which airs sunday on abctv tells the 
story of bill wilson the late cofounder of alcoholics anonymous 
this is a very unsentimental version of bill wilsons life 
said woods 42 who plays wilson there are scenes in this 
picture that i think are literally hairraising there was no 
sentimental restraint placed on us 
they allowed us to show the true story and its a 
devastating story and its not an easy story to watch he added 
the story focuses on the struggles of a stockbroker whose health 
and success are destroyed by twin calamities the stock market 
crash of 1929 and his own alcoholism 
it details the days when wilson was unable to stop drinking 
despite the efforts of a devoted wife lois played by jobeth 
williams strapped to a hospital bed he realizes he is helpless 
to defeat alcoholism alone 
most of the twohour movie shows the horrors wilson faced before 
he met dr bob smith an akron ohio surgeon and drunk played by 
garner 
a church arranged for the two men to meet after wilson only 
sober for a short time and struggling to rebuild his life arrived 
in akron he was lonely uptight and tempted by other drinkers 
smith thinking wilson came to lecture him to stop drinking was 
suspicious 
just what do you think a man like you can do for me smith 
asks 
wilson cries out i didnt come here to help you i came here 
to help me 
garner calls wilson and smith two of the greatest men of this 
century two drunks who got together to help each other and ended 
up helping millions of others 
filmed in richmond va the hallmark hall of fame presentation 
was written by william borchert who read his script to the 
97yearold mrs wilson on the back porch of her bedford hills 
ny home last fall 
when i got finished she reached for my hand put her arms 
around me and we shed tears together she said im very happy 
this story will finally be told to the world twenty one days 
later she passed away he said 
the production was the idea of peter duchow coproducer with 
garner 
duchow met wilson in the 1950s and was convinced by 1953 the 
story should be told but he could not pursue it for 30 years 
garner and duchow discussed the project in 1983 but five scripts 
were rejected 
because there is a tendency to beatify bill wilson most 
writers really are influenced by the size of the membership and 
what all of that means he said our feeling was always lets 
personalize by simply telling the story of bill wilson which was 
very difficult to get on paper 
garner and woods had worked together more than once as a 
fledgling actor woods played the villain in the first episode of 
garners the rockford files 
and in promise another hallmark special broadcast in 1986 
garner played a carefree man forced to care for his schizophrenic 
brother played by woods after the death of their mother it lost 
in the ratings to a dolly parton television movie but won five 
emmy awards 
woods recalled hearing duchow and garner mumbling about their 
next project in a coffee shop at the end of filming for 
promise 
i kind of cocked an ear and thought there could be a job in 
this i said heh im bill w i could be bill w i didnt quite 
realize what i was about to embark on he said 
i have friends and people i love very dearly who in the course 
of work are alcoholics most of them have found alcoholics 
anonymous and a few have not and some are dead he said i just 
hope the few who arent members will find their way in 
even before the production aired it had an impact after garner 
and woods appeared on television talk shows to promote the movie 
woods was stopped by a woman outside his hotel in new york she 
said the actors had convinced her brother to join aa 
a day earlier woods had told a luncheon gathering if we can 
save one life then we will go greatly beyond what we hoped to do 
which was great entertainment some information if theres a life 
or two along the way that we can save then we will indeed be 
blessed

whatever ibm does its bound to attract 
attention and provoke discussion and maybe even spur others to do 
the same investors who depend on dividends are hoping so 
ibm raised its common stock dividend this week for the first 
time in 4 years the 11cent increase to 121 a share raises the 
annual yield to 42 percent from 39 percent and enriches 
shareholders by 250 million a year 
will others follow perhaps but in this instance ibm isnt so 
much a leader as a follower without the excitement that often 
attends increases in share prices corporate dividends have been 
moving higher for the past year 
in fact commerce department and independent analysts data show 
it has been many months even years since such increases have been 
seen there are suggestions that improvements will continue through 
the year 
wright investors service which analyzes stock performance 
notes that for the 12 months through march dividends for the 
standard amp poors 500 stock index rose 115 percent 
firstquarter action in the current year also was strong 
according to wright with 521 companies raising dividends and 116 
paying extras the highest total of favorable dividend actions of 
any first quarter since 1982 
if you use the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks as a 
measuring stick the dividend news is even more impressive 26 
percent for the first quarter 17 percent for the past 12 months 
until you know the reason why 
wright points out that these growth rates were inflated by two 
unusual actions one being a 112 a share extra dividend by alcoa 
the other a 75 cents a share dividend paid by texaco which was 
undergoing bankruptcy court reorganization a year earlier 
commerce department data verify the improved performance 
indicating that recent dividend growth has been in the range of 10 
percent to 12 percent all in all the activity has been the best 
since 19791980 but with a difference 
that difference is a big one in the earlier period the 
inflation rate was close to 10 percent and dividend growth was 
merely keeping pace inflation is lower today real dividend growth 
is more than 5 percent highest in 12 years 
despite the sharp increases the growth of dividends over the 
past year has trailed corporate profit growth and dividend yields 
the payout compared to earnings remain well below the longterm 
norms 
wright points out for instance that the 11 percent dividend 
increase for the sampp 500 in the past 12 months compares with a 
profit rise of more than 30 percent the increases it states 
result in a dividend payout rate of 41 percent of profits compared 
with 50 percent for the postworld war ii period 
wrights explanation the current low payout rate is in large 
part cyclical dividend growth normally lags in periods of strong 
profit recovery with payout catching up as profit growth slows 
while this would suggest futher dividend increases to come 
wright is a bit cautious limiting itself to forecasting a 
reasonably good pace through 1989 
for this cycle it explains the rate of dividend payouts may 
improve more slowly than normal because funds that corporations 
normally set aside for dividends may be siphoned into stock 
repurchase programs

amritsar is now a boom town said 
sanjay galhotra a hindu who owns a hotel and plans to build a 
fourstory shopping center last year i would have been called a 
fool 
long the center of the bloody 7yearold separatist war by sikh 
radicals amritsar has come alive since indian government forces a 
year ago dislodged sikh militants from the golden temple holiest 
shrine of the sikh faith 
but the terror that gripped the city has moved to villages and 
wheat fields of the countryside of punjab state torn by the 
militant uprising since 1982 
people dont care for the militants any more said amarjit 
walia the owner of an amritsar television and appliance shop where 
business has increased spirits are high in amritsar 
the most visible change over the past year is at the golden 
temple which gets its name from the gold plating on its walls 
hundreds of pilgrims throng the marble walkway around the shrine 
earlier inhabited by rifletoting militants who had turned it into 
a fortress 
sikh devotees in orange and blue turbans are accompanied by 
wives and children a hindu visiting the temple is no longer deemed 
foolhardy 
the change came after security forces laid siege to the temple 
last may more than 40 people were killed and in the course of the 
10day siege nearly 200 militants including many of the separatist 
movements leaders surrendered and were arrested 
police say the clearing of the temple left remaining militants 
leaderless and without a base of operations armed policemen remain 
on guard outside the temple searching visitors for weapons 
however 
but the sikh militants war for independence from india 
continues in the fields just outside amritsar 
there is terror in the countryside terror and threats said 
mukhtiar singh a doctor in the village of jagdev kalan a 
mudandbrick hamlet 14 miles north of amritsar the government 
is not doing anything for our protection 
the hindus had left earlier now sikhs are joining them to 
find safety in big towns 
about 8000 people all sikhs live in jagdev kalan most till 
the wheat fields surrounding the village some work at the local 
school and grocery shops 
mukhtiar singh said the 200 hindus in the village moved to 
amritsar after an attack by sikh militants in august 1987 left at 
least 12 hindus and sikhs dead 
now the militants now turn their guns on fellow sikhs accusing 
them of being police informers or failing to show enough enthusiasm 
for their movement to separate from india and what they perceive as 
hindu domination sikhs make up 55 percent of punjabs 20 million 
population but only 2 percent of indias 880 million people 
at least 15 sikh families have left jagdev kalan this year 
mukhtiar singh said 
the village is not safe said harbhajan singh the villages 
headman no one moves out at night only the police and if there 
is a gunshot all lights in the village go out 
mukhtiar singh said wealthy sikhs are fast becoming the main 
source of money for the militants a demand for money is followed 
by a visit and then an attack on those who do not comply he said 
as ordained by their faith all sikh men use the name singh 
which means lion in the punjabi language 
militant activity has shifted from fundamentalism to petty 
crime said c pal singh police inspectorgeneral in amritsar 
there is no leadership so the militants cannot get organized 
they hit soft targets if they can 
more than 550 people have been killed in punjab this year at 
least 2400 people were killed in the state in 1988 
sarabjeet singh the top administrator of amritsar district 
said that in the last three months in the amritsar district alone 
more than 500 villagers had left their homes for the relative 
safety of places like amritsar where oncedeserted restraurants 
nowadays are crowded until midnight

americans think its more important for 
newspapers to cover religion than sports a new national study 
finds but people are a bit more likely to read sports stories 
indications also turned up that increasing religious coverage 
likely wont do much to boost circulation since 
religioninterested readers already make up the bulk of readership 
the religious and religioninterested readers are already 
there says the project director steward m hoover of temple 
university in philadelphia religiosity and newspaper readership 
are statistically associated 
preliminary findings of the study described as the first 
comprehensive research on press coverage of religion and interest 
in it were presented recently to the religious public relations 
council convention in washington 
concerning the relative news importance of nine special fields 
religion was found to rank about in the middle below education 
health and business but above sports food personal advice 
entertainment and art 
when people were asked to rate their likelihood of actually 
reading about the topics religion also ranked in the middle but 
below sports ahead of sports again were health education and 
business 
the study sponsored by religious news service under a grant 
from the lilly endowment included two national gallup polls of 
1100 samples each plus indepth interviews in a variety of local 
congregations 
contrary to assumptions that people are primarily interested in 
local religion stories we discovered great expressions of 
interest in national and international religion stories said 
judy weidman rns editordirector 
in ranking the importance of types of religion news the polls 
gave first place to social and ethical positions and 
pronouncements by major faith groups such as on abortion 
nuclear policy and the economy 
while local church news and announcements ranked second all 
the other highlyrated categories were national and international 
in scope rather than locally or individualistically oriented 
hoover said 
these included in this order ethical and social issues 
the role of religion in foreign or international politics the 
role of religion in american politics and national religious 
issues and controversies 
hoover said the findings undermined triedand true 
assumptions that readers want stories of faith and 
inspiration or opinion commentary about religion these rated low 
in appeal 
the findings confirmed what we have been hearing in our 
localcongregational interviews hoover said people think of 
religion in national and even global terms they know it is a 
dimension of other news they clearly want that dimension to be 
covered well 
seventyone percent of those polled called themselves daily 
readers and 81 percent said religion is important in their lives 
of these considering religion important a higher proportion 80 
percent are daily readers 
more than half of the total sample 522 percent said it was 
important for newspapers to cover religion as well as other kinds 
of news 
asked how well the press covers the various specialties sports 
got the most excellent scores followed by business food and 
entertainment but a rather poor job is seen in religious coverage 
it ranked seventh 
the sad truth is that many of this countrys almost 1700 
daily newspapers either ignore the religion story or amuptate it at 
the county line ms weidman said 
a still incomplete part of the study involves interviews with 
eight newspapers regarded as covering religion well three already 
have been visited the los angeles times the tennessean in 
nashville and st petersburg fla times 
what these newspaper executive believe in common is that the 
religion story is central to interpreting life in their communities 
and american culture in general ms weidman said 
debunking an old claim that a news professional needs to be 
religious to give a fair shake to religion she quotes teresa 
wasson city editor of the tennessean as saying 
im an atheist myself but i have great respect for religion 
as a motivational force in peoples livesreligion is simply not 
important to many reporters or editors personally and thus they 
dont understand how personally important it is to readers 
i think they dont understand the richness of coverage 
available in religion its not just socials and churchy things 
religion is very rich turf in news value and many editors dont 
know that

if i needed shoes and south africa 
was the only place i could get shoes i would do without them 
former president julius nyerere of tanzania once said but if i 
needed corn and south africa was the only place to get corn i 
would go to south africa 
millions of people in southern africa are both barefoot and 
hungry these days and though their leaders are reluctant to admit 
it they depend on south africa for commerce so conditions wont 
get any worse than they are 
from warravaged angola and mozambique to tiny overcrowded 
malawi the region includes some of the poorest and least developed 
nations in the world 
almost a decade after nine blackruled states joined forces in 
an ambitious effort to lessen their reliance on south africa they 
have yet to tap their economic potential and still are inextricably 
linked to their southern neighbor 
in many ways the countries are worse off now than in 1980 
said tom kennedy a south africanbased researcher who recently did 
a study on economic conditions in southern africa due to wars 
bad internal policies and poor management theres been very little 
progress in the region 
the nine regional states are angola mozambique zimbabwe 
zambia tanzania malawi botswana lesotho and swaziland which 
make up the southern african development coordination council 
sadcc 
sadcc concentrates on the regions two most pressing problems 
transportation routes and food supplies since it was founded in 
1980 the organization has helped increase trade among member 
states improved the flow of technology and research and currently 
is involved in almost 600 projects that will cost some 7 billion 
but successes have been limited almost threequarters of the 75 
million people in sadcc countries remain subsistance farmers and 
per capita income in the region is less than 500 a year according 
to world bank figures 
south africa remains the leading trading partner for seven of 
the nine sadcc countries its roads rails ports power stations 
and communications networks are essential to their economic 
survival 
south africas 28 million blacks have higher average incomes 
than in any sadcc country more than a million workers from 
neighboring countries earn their livings in south africa while the 
traffic in the opposite direction is minimal 
the blackled countries want to reduce reliance on south africa 
not only because they oppose its apartheid policies but also to 
take advantage of potentially more efficient trade routes 
malawi where annual per capita income is about 200 spends an 
extra 100 million a year exporting its tobacco tea and nuts 
through distant south africa because railway lines in neighboring 
mozambique are mostly inoperative because of guerrilla sabotage 
according to kennedys estimates 
zaire more than 600 miles north of south africa receives more 
than half its imports via south africa although it has its own 
atlantic ocean port 
five major railways connect landlocked nations of southern 
africa to the indian and atlantic oceans 
however four pass through angola or mozambique where civil 
wars dating to the mid1970s have halted or sharply reduced traffic 
the region will never have secure food supplies until we can 
make these rail lines work said nkwaki ngwanakilala a 
spokesman at sadccs headquarters in gaborone and that wont be 
possible until the fighting stops 
the regions fifth rail line which links zambia to the port of 
dar es salaam in tanzania has been unaffected by war but poor 
management has kept it from operating anywhere near full capacity 
since it was built by the chinese in the 1970s about half its 75 
locomotives are out of service 
farmtomarket roads throughout southern africa range from 
primitive to nonexistent crops in the fertile region often rot in 
the fields 
the region has the potential to feed much of the continent but 
farmland is often under utilized farmers are almost exclusively 
smallscale growers with little training equipment or access to 
government services 
zimbabwe is the only sadcc country that has more than 100 
private commercial farms of several hundred acres or more 
according to regional agricultural officials 
the southern african economist a magazine published by sadcc 
noted that regional governments blame the decline in food 
production on a host of factors ranging from adverse weather 
escalating costs of fertilizers and longer transport routes to 
disruption of agriculture by south africanbacked terrorists 
but it added the blame also lies with the governments 
themselves for maintaining subsidies and setting unrealistic 
producer prices which give farmers no incentive to produce more 
despite the gloomy picture there have been two recent 
developments that could strengthen southern african economies in 
the longterm 
south africa has been trying to improve relations with black 
africa and expressed eagerness to cooperate on development 
projects it has agreed to grant independence to namibia and says 
it has stopped supporting guerrilla movements in angola and 
mozambique 
sadcc has estimated that south african military actions in the 
region have cost more than 10 billion during the 1980s 
the more peaceful climate has eased the international pressure 
for sanctions against south africa which inevitably would damage 
its neighbors as well 
also several countries have begun to pursue marketoriented 
economies and are moving away from african socialism and 
centralized economies 
tanzania long hostile to free enterprise has been implementing 
austerity measures backed by the international monetary fund since 
president ali hassan mwinyi came to power in 1985 
imf conditionalities are painful mwinyi said last year 
but we have to make a choice between two sharppointed spears it 
is either we go forward with shops full of expensive commodities or 
we revert to the days of empty shops 
malawi has pursued similar reforms while mozambique and 
zimbabwe both officially socialist are talking less about 
ideology and offering some encouragement to foreign investors 
at present sadccs only economic standout is the arid nation of 
botswana where diamond wealth has transformed the country from one 
of the poorest in the world into one of africas wealthiest states 
in 22 years of independence 
the economy has been growing at roughly 10 percent a year 
throughout the 1980s and botswana has foreign reserves of 23 
billion equal to south africas 
the governments formula has been a commitment to free 
enterprise support for foreign investors and a fiscal policy that 
is probably the most conservative in africa officials warned of 
spending curbs this year when the projected budget surplus dipped 
below 200 million

when zambia gained independence from 
britain in 1964 it had thriving copper mines abundant farmland 
and a degree of prosperity that made it the envy of its neighbors 
today more than 1 million zambians are threatened by famine the 
government cant pay its bills and acute shortages of many 
supplies keep even successful businesses operating at sharply 
reduced capacities 
zambias economy has been in a downward spiral since the 
mid1970s and western economists say its ills have been largely 
selfinduced through bad policies and poor management 
living standards have declined every year during the 1980s and 
per capita income was 361 in 1988 only marginally higher than 
when the british left according to government statistics 
inflation is at least 50 percent unemployment is high and 
zambias foreign debt of 55 billion is about twice its annual 
gross domestic product 
the government knows it has a serious problem but it 
continues to create obstacles and display a hostile attitude toward 
many businessess especially small entrepreneurs said a 
zambiabased western economist who requested anonymity 
kenneth kaunda zambias president since independence is a 
harsh critic of western capitalism but in 1985 he began an 
economic restructuring plan sponsored by the international monetary 
fund 
kaunda slashed subsidies for a number of consumer goods 
including corn meal which many zambians eat three times a day 
thousands of people rioted in december 1986 leaving 15 dead 
kaunda responded by breaking relations with the imf leaving the 
landlocked nation of 75 million even more desperate for foreign 
assistance 
the government has fixed prices for more than two years on such 
basic goods as corn meal sugar cooking oil and charcoal the 
result has been widespread shortages and a bustling black market 
every morning women line up outside supermarkets in lusaka then 
buy up scarce items within 30 minutes after the doors open some 
buy more than they need and sell the extra on street corners at 
double what they paid 
zambia is the worlds fifth largest copper producer and last 
year prices were near an alltime high but production problems and 
a lack of skilled workers and managers limited output to just over 
400000 tons well short of the goal of 500000 tons and nowhere 
near the 720000 tons gathered in 1969 
the country also had a record corn crop in 1988 but a large 
portion rotted due to poor transportation truck drivers often 
refuse to travel on unpaved rural roads because spare parts are 
scarce 
chico a cab driver in lusaka gave an example of what its like 
if i need a spare tire i have a big problem he said

teeming shantytowns sprawl across the hills 
surrounding caracas in venezuela and more and more as economic 
conditions worsen they are becoming breeding grounds for social 
unrest an associated press correspondent visited one recently and 
filed this report one of a series on the economic social and 
political turbulence that has turned south america into a continent 
in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
maria zurbaran ruiz her commomlaw 
husband and their eight children live in a tinroofed threeroom 
shack called a rancho on the slope of a hill overlooking caracas 
they consider themselves fortunate 
he has a job making bricks 10 to 12 hours a day 100 miles away 
in valencia for roughly the equivalent of 25 a week 
the good life for her is being able to feed her the children 
corn bread and coffee sometimes with milk for breakfast black 
beans and spaghetti for lunch and again for dinner and meat on 
saturdays when her husband luis antonio zambrano is home 
but maria zurbaran ruiz who is 48 years old said things wont 
be that way much longer 
she was talking about the recent turn of events in venezuela 
price increases that set off rioting down on the streets of caracas 
feb 27march 2 leaving 276 people dead and about 1000 injured 
there are several bad years ahead she said nothing will 
be easy anymore 
some of those who went down into the streets to protest loot 
and burn were from marias slum rancholandia 
it is the kind of place in south america where riots and 
sometimes revolutions are born 
maria said she tells her children to prepare themselves for hard 
times she has 14 in all 7 to 33 years old but just eight still 
live with her 
i was blessed with 20 children she said but my triplets 
and another three died in the 60s from disentery 
millions like maria and her family live in ranchos on the hills 
around venezuelan cities 
maria and luis antonio arent as poor as most of them nor as 
better off as some of them 
she stays at home while he goes off to work mondays through 
thursdays in valencia before leaving valencia for home on 
weekends he stops at a slaughterhouse and with part of his pay 
buys a kilo of meat 22 pounds 
with luis antonio at home for the weekend saturday is the 
feast day maria said everyone gets a piece of meat mixed with 
a lot of boiled potatos so that everybody is full for the rest of 
the day maybe it wont be every saturday anymore 
she was thinking again about the price increases and the riots 
the price increases were part of a government austerity program 
intended to halt the downward economic spiral venezuela has been in 
since the collapse of oil prices a few years ago 
the program called for the lifting of subsidies that kept prices 
low for the poor at the same time the bolivar the local 
currency was allowed to float for the first time in decades and 
prices for unsubsidized goods and services also rose 
the government of president carlos andres perez said it had no 
alternative but it did not expect people to pour out of the 
ranchos as they did 
they came by the thousands in caracas at least 50 percent of 
the population of 4 million lives in ranchos 
sociologists and politicians analyzed the sudden swarm of 
protest as the revenge of the havenots against the rich 
maria said she had no part of it 
here we are all honest people the malandros criminals 
came from up the hill she said gesturing with her left thumb 
there wasnt much hill left before the top and it was hard to 
determine where the malandros could have come from 
all that can be seen from marias rancho are myriads of other 
ranchos crammed over the hills like a waving ocean of corrugated 
metal 
full employment is rare in the ranchos many people are 
completely jobless others are underemployed and still others make 
a living as street vendors 
maria considers herself lucky because luis antonio has the 
brickmaking job in valencia where he stays with his mother during 
the work week to save bus fare back and forth every day 
maria adds about 400 bolivars 13 to the weekly budget by 
sewing pants on a neighbors machine and sweeping a nearby school 
twice a week 
but electricity is free in rancholandia people simply hook 
into the power lines and water comes from a public line not far 
from marias rancho 
ranchos began sprouting in venezuelan cities only during the 
last 30 years while the nation was establishing itself one of the 
most stable democracies in latin america 
before that the dictatorial governments that ruled most of the 
time since independence from spain in 1811 barred the poor from 
building shacks in the cities 
they were kept in rural areas and the few who made it into 
caracas were constantly harassed by authorities 
but after the dictatorship of marco perez jimenez collapsed in 
1958 the poor were allowed in from the countryside and as the 
nations oil economy burgeoned they flocked to the cities for jobs 
caracas and other cities soon were overwhelmed by a new socialwing 
decade when venezuela began to swell with oil money 
the couple built a sturdier one of adobe and concrete blocks a bit 
further down the hill 
now we do have space she said pointing to the narrow 
partly walled space where she cooks and does the laundry at 
midday it is the only cool place in her rancho heat in the rest 
of the shack soars over 100 degrees 
this is the best we could get she said but i think my 
children will get something even better

a 400 million blend of bigleague 
film making and hollywood stargazing is making its debut as 
floridas top entertainment resort opens its newest attraction 
the disneymgm studios theme park 
the 135acre complex at walt disney world combines working 
movietv sound studios with backstage tours for the public a 
mixedmedia ridethrough show and special effects adventures 
its all themed to the flamboyant ambience of hollywoods 
golden age in the 1930s and 40s when a small group of moguls ran 
the studios with a firm hand art deco and california crazy 
dominated the architectural styles 
the park has its own entrance admission and more than enough 
activities to fill a visitors entire day disney officials say 
visitors will walk through recreations of palmlined hollywood 
boulevard and grummans chinese theater peek at movies under 
production take a role in an ongoing television show make their 
own music videos get a screen test and rub elbows with the stars 
at the brown derby restaurant 
movie and television production began last summer with the 
superboy syndicated tv series and parts of several largescreen 
films while construction continued on the tourist portion workers 
were still putting finishing touches on it prior to the opening on 
may 1 
chairman michael eisner describes it as one of the disney cos 
most exciting projects 
it is a theatrical environment that is very close to the 
original conception by walt disney he said in a recent 
interview its been on the shelf since the 1940s and is the 
culmination of a company dream this attraction is unlike anything 
else we have 
the grand opening to the public is preceded by a weekend of 
glitzy celebrity parties and previews that include a special on 
nbctv april 30 and live tapings of the tv special and the 
new mickey mouse club television series 
dick nunis president of walt disney attractions believes 
bringing a bit of hollywood to florida will lure new fans and 
encourage former visitors to return 
we talked of doing a studio tour when walt was alive said 
nunis weve wanted to do this for a long long time its a 
dream come true 
disney will get a full years jump on its formidable 
competition universal studios florida which wont complete the 
tour portion of its 500 million complex until may 1990 
situated just a few miles down the road universal is billed as 
the nations largest working studio outside of hollywood movie and 
tv production is already under way at the facility owned by mca 
inc and rank organization plc of london it is built on a 440acre 
site 
universal will feature what it calls a total experience of 
hollywoodstyle filmmaking to the public making the visitor a 
participant in the action it expects to attract up to 6 million 
visitors a year disney officials do not project attendance 
despite their wellpublicized rivalry disney and mca officials 
downplay the situation insisting the competition is good for each 
other as well as florida 
weve always had competition from sea world busch gardens 
cape canaveral boardwalk and baseball and many others eisner 
said we welcome competition its good for central florida 
disney does things in its own way and we feel comfortable that we 
will have our niche in the community 
the disneymgm theme park is the centerpiece of a 1 
billionplus renaissance of the 27400acre resort situated in the 
pine woods and citrus groves of central florida near kissimmee and 
orlando 
not that a rebirth is needed 
after earning a record 34 billion in revenues and 522 million 
in profits in fiscal 1988 the walt disney co has on tap a number 
of openings at its florida resort this year in addition to the 
studios 
on schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the 
largest conventionhotel complex in the southeast making their 
debut this summer will be typhoon lagoon the worlds largest 
water park and the pleasure island nighttime entertainment 
district 
built for the teenage crowd nunis says typhoon lagoon will 
make all other water attractions as obsolete as disneyland made 
amusement parks in 1955 
were finally going to be able to make waves says nunis 
surfing a 100foot mountain a saltwater snorkling reef 
including sharks and other live critters in an enclosed area i 
can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit 
pleasure island is for those who still have energy left at the 
end of an exhausting day at the disneymgm studios park epcot 
center or the magic kingdom the complex of restaurants shops and 
nightclubs is built on a sixacre island at the disney village 
on track to open this fall is the 770room swan hotel which 
along with the larger dolphin hotel will form the lodging side of 
the conventionhotel complex going up near epcot center the 
1500room dolphin is to open in july 1990 together the two 
hotels will cost about 375 million and provide 2300 guest rooms 
and 200000 square feet of convention space beside a 50acre lake 
the more modestly priced caribbean beach resort hotel opens an 
additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2112 the 907room 
grand floridian beach resort a luxury victorianstyle hotel 
opened last summer 
also set for completion this fall will be a new epcot pavilion 
the wonders of life featuring a simulated ride through the human 
bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through 
birth 
disney does not release attendance figures but from early 
indications at walt disney world and with the debut of its new 
attractions and hotel rooms this year it may surpass the record 
year of 1987 its florida parks racked up some 24 million 
admissions then 
disney worlds building spree is boosting its employment rolls 
and its prices as well disneys minimum wage is 5 an hour and it 
has little trouble attracting prospective employees 
one of its mostpopular spots these days is its employment 
office which is currently hiring 2500 new workers to help staff 
some of the new attractions this will boost disneys work force of 
25500 by 10 percent in one month 
shortly after the new park opens disneys total of 28000 
yearround cast members will be twice what it was eight years 
ago this figure is swelled by some 5000 employees of companies 
that run hotels restaurants and shops on disney property plus 
parttime workers during seasonal peaks the company says 
the new studio attraction has also prompted a 1 increase in 
oneday admission prices at the magic kingdom and epcot center and 
the introduction of a new fourday passport good at any of the 
three theme parks effective may 1 
the new ticket will cost 94 for adults and 77 for children 3 
to 9 years old it provides unlimited admission to the three parks 
for four days new singleday admission prices for any one park 
will be 29 for adults and 23 for children

eight men out orion home video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg 
 
whos on first whats on second i dont know is on third 
abbott and costello made the skit a classic in 1945 and viewers of 
eight men out might just revive it 
the movie as earnest as it may be in trying to present the 
whole tangled scandal of the chicago white sox throwing the 1919 
world series has enough faces and characters in it to pack a 
locker room and it would take extra innings to comprehend whos 
doing what to whom 
eight men out begins just as the white sox are about to meet 
the cincinnati reds in the world series the team is owned by a 
pennypinching manipulative charles comiskey who has driven 
morale into the ground with his cheap wages 
enter scheming sleazy gamblers to capitalize on the discontent 
the ball players are approached by a cast of underworld types and 
the deal is hatched for the team to allow the reds to win the 
series 
during the conspiracy director john sayles introduces the eight 
crooked players their wives and sundry girlfriends at least two 
gambling kingpins and their assistants the teams manager and 
somebodys father 
it takes a score card to keep track of the rest 
the whitesoxturnedblacksox yarn is a good one but this 
movie has too many loose threads

symphony in bflat psalm 23 alexander zemlinsky riccardo 
chailly conducting the radiosymphonieorchester berlin and 
kammerchor london 
 
its always a pleasure to come across an unfamiliar performer 
giving a familiar work a superlative reading its even better to 
discover exciting lesserknown music particularly when the 
performance is as excellent as that of chailly and the rso on this 
disc 
zemlinsky 18711942 was a prominent teacher composer and 
international conductor whose musicial life centered in vienna he 
moved to prague in 1938 escaped during the war to this country and 
died oddly in larchmont ny a suburb of new york city 
schoenberg was his brotherinlaw and pupil and webern also 
studied with him mahler was a friend and supporter and brahms 
recommended zemlinsky to his own publisher no lack of favor from 
the musical community here 
he wrote a quartet of string quartets a halfdozen works for 
orchestra and chorus seven operas and three symphonies including 
the bflat in 1897 the year of brahms death 
the work sounds at times like a cross of the better halves of 
brahms and mahler though without their depth but zemlinsky has 
his own world of orchestral sound chailly understands that he 
also seems to understand exactly what to do with each phrase even 
more so at times than zemlinsky whose style can seem fragmented 
psalm 23 sounds more mahleresque maybe because of the chorus 
the recorded sound of the orchestra is crystal clear and nigh 
perfect instruments blend but stand out when need be never out of 
balance the rso musicians play difficult music with panache 
buy this disc not because no collection is complete without 
zemlinksy but because no listener is complete without a desire to 
hear the new and unfamiliar and buy it because chailly and the rso 
deliver a great performance

blast off emi usa stray cats 
 
now this is the way to do a rock n roll reunion invite a 
couple of buddies over turn the speakers up real loud and to 
steal a phrase blast off 
the stray cats pinup boys and rockabilly revivalists in the 
long ago days of president reagans first term drifted apart when 
the hits stopped coming now theyre back with blast off an 
unexpectedly delightful reunion lp that kicks snarls scratches 
and bites 
unlike most ponderous reunions where middle aged rockers check 
their lawyers at the door blast off sounds like that jam 
session with old friends where someone left a tape recorder on 
sure its more complicated than that but it doesnt sound that 
way and thats the key 
age hasnt diminished the cats skill and spirit it may even 
have helped singer brian setzers voice has deepened into an 
effective growl with none of the precocity of his youth 
and producer dave edmunds the ultimate kindred spirit was a 
perfect choice to guide this project his voice brightens the 
catchy singalong bring it back again 
dont look for particularly deep statements the stray cats must 
set a record for most songs on one 10song album with the word 
rock in the title 4 everybody needs rock n roll 
rockabilly rules rockabilly worlds and rockin all over 
the place are all high octane 
for what it aspires to the soundtrack for a terrific party 
blast off is a howling success

kelly mcgillis seems so strongwilled and 
controlled both on the screen and off that you wonder if she ever 
had doubts in her waitress days that she would reach the top of the 
acting world 
oh yeah all the time she admits but theres also that 
part of you the driven side that says i will and has that 
kind of confidence but i think you will always have selfdoubt i 
still do i continually wonder if i would ever work again maybe 
thats one of the things that drives me 
contributing to her air of confidence is her appearance stately 
if not quite regal with a cool beauty that would have melted the 
late alfred hitchcock was her height ever a drawback 
not to me maybe to other people but no i dont think so i 
suppose people say how come you always play sort of stronger 
women not the vulnerable victim types i can maybe attribute 
that to my height its sort of hard to be a victim when youre 
5feet10 and youre bigger than a lot of guys youre working 
with 
significantly jodie foster was the gangrape victim in the 
accused and mcgillis was the prosecutor who sought justice for 
her in her new film winter people mcgillis plays both victim 
and protagonist she is an unwed mother ostrasized by her family 
who stirs up a smoldering mountain feud and then resolves it with 
an act of supreme sacrifice 
the columbia release was filmed in the locale of the john ehle 
novel the blue ridge mountains under conditions that duplicated 
the hardships of living on the land 50 years ago 
it was pretty rough to be out in the elements for so many 
hours a day she recalled it was cold and wet and damp 
the emotional challenges of playing coley wright were very 
demanding but thats why i did it i wanted to see if i could hit 
those emotional peaks and valleys 
coley is a bit rebellious but at the same time she is very 
traditional she is very strong and impetuous but at the same time 
very weak and feminine which are all sort of interesting things to 
portray in a character because thats how we are in real life 
any resemblance between coley and kelly 
mmmm yeah i think so she said i think that im a bit 
rebellious and yet very traditional at the same time and i think 
im strong and weak at the same time im very singleminded when i 
get an idea nothing can stand in my way or change my mind 
filmmakers have discovered that about kelly mcgillis while she 
doesnt push her weight around on a set she does like to 
contribute to the creative process and why not 
i must say ive been very fortunate in not working with that 
type of dictatorial director ive always felt that i could at 
least bring up an idea and they can say thats not a good idea 
or i dont like that i dont take that personally 
ive never worked with the kind of person who said just shut 
up and do it this way if i did i probably would rebel a lot 
she said 
after a certain amount of time an actor or an actress knows 
their character better than anyone else around once youve 
assimilated and really become this person you know what you would 
do in a given situation than anyone else on that set 
mcgillis 31 spent her early years in thousand oaks halfway 
between los angeles and ventura by a weird coincidence her father 
was physician for her winter people costar kurt russell then 
a disney child star 
i had a big crush on him when i was 8 years old she said 
the mcgillis family moved to newport beach in orange county 
we went on vacation and never came back 
when i was in high school i took theater said mcgillis 
whose new hair style is closecropped blond and brown i dropped 
out of high school to pursue acting which didnt make my family 
happy i studied a few years at the pacific conservatory of the

an unprecedented show on art deco 
brings together some of the best decorative works of the 1920s from 
12 european nations to redefine the whimsical elitist style of the 
rich and powerful 
in all 274 pieces from fine jewelry and glassware to massive 
bulky dressers are on show until the end of may at the beauxarts 
palace itself an art deco gem to mark its 60th anniversary this 
year 
the art deco in europe exhibit aims to shed new light on the 
muchabused concept of the movement by highlighting work from as 
far apart as sweden czechoslovakia and italy the style is an 
eclectic ode to superficial prettiness for the rich who failed or 
refused to face the harsh social realities of the 1920s 
the difference between art deco and other styles of its age is 
often very thin said exhibit organizer marc lambrechts explaining 
why art deco has often been confused with and used as an amalgam 
of everything from stark modernism to flamboyant rococo the 
kaleidoscope of forms and shapes at the beauxarts palace might 
still leave many visitors lost for a uniform vision of art deco 
but then art deco loved to quote from foreign and bygone 
styles from the japanese and chinese cultures from rococo and 
classicism much in the same way that postmodernism does today 
lambrechts said only the social idea behind the pieces 
constituted the art deco style there is no unity of form no 
real style he said only a common attitude of snobbery and 
elitism among art deco artists and buyers 
through his show lambrechts paints a picture of a gilded cage 
in which a spoiled european elite sought to shield itself from the 
revolutionary changes that swept society early this century it did 
so by cultivating an art that had no meaning other than to please 
the eye 
in contrast the contemporary modernism of le corbusier and 
walter gropius thrived on the new technologies and social 
developments art deco shunned through its devotion to function and 
lack of ornament it gave shape to many of worlds modern cities 
in almost all the capitals of europe the high bourgeoisie 
tried to compensate the threat to its power with a refined culture 
while the new rich wanted to create an identity by purely showing 
off lambrechts said 
in return art deco was dismissed as kitschy and tasteless for 
many decades but in recent years it has found a new following as 
evidenced by the fact that over 2000 people a day visited 
lambrechts show which opened march 3 at victor hortas beauxarts 
palace in the center of brussels 
france and britain have long claimed to be the cradle of art 
deco but lambrechts show breaks new ground there it shows strong 
contributions from across europe many of them on display for the 
first time outside their home countries 
the exhibit is not as complete as lambrechts would have liked 
as much art deco was destroyed in west germany by the nazis who 
considered it decadent 
still culled from 101 museums and private collections from 
around europe it shows a lot of previously undiscovered beauty 
among the best arts and crafts this century has produced 
lambrechts said 
what all the pieces have in common is a sense of luxury expert 
finishing and craftmanship leafgold silver gems china 
delicate woods no costs were spared to produce a unique work of 
art deco 
while modernists employed concrete and steel to allow function 
to prevail over style art deco only wanted to impress with its 
flashy materials and ornaments 
and impress they did 
dutchman hendrik van den eynde was lavish enough in his use of 
silver but his 1918 urn flanked by four statuettes shows some of 
the restraint other works at the show dearly lack 
at the other end of the spectrum austrian anny schroeder 
outrages with loud clashing colors and seemingly irrelevant 
drawings of hunters and exotic deer on her 1919 mask 
and nowhere is craftmanship and use of rich materials more 
evident than in the art deco jewelry of the maison van cleef and 
arpels 
its 1927 vanity brooch of gold enamel christal emerald 
rubies and diamonds wrought by master hands is one of the 
highlights of the exibit 
after spending some decades in relative obscurity dealers are 
also quickly reevaluating art deco some small tables have been 
sold for close to 1 million and prices for all objects are rising 
constantly 
times have changed said lambrechts today art deco is 
even more expensive than french art of the 18th century

tone loc the raspyvoiced rapper whose bawdy 
wild thing went to the top of the charts didnt think the tune 
about a pickup artist on a streak of amazing luck was hit material 
the record company delicious vinyl did i didnt its not 
my style of rap the 22yearold los angeles native said in a 
recent interview i mean locd after dark is really my style 
of rap slow and funky thats how i like it 
the song was a no 1 hit for loc whose real name is tony smith 
loc is short for loco a gang term for a crazy man who likes to 
fight 
but loc who grew up in a twostory house on the affluent west 
side of los angeles and went to university high school and santa 
monica college had to travel by bus to the citys tough south side 
to get his reputation 
he was uncomforable dwelling on gangs during the interview 
however in the past he has said he was involved with a gang during 
his teens but withdrew because a girlfriend asked him to a choice 
kids locked into the southside scene usually dont get 
but his commutergang experience had nothing to do with his 
interest in rap he said i found it out on my own clear out of 
the blue 
loc said a friend from new jersey came to los angeles about 
eight years ago with a tape that he rapped along to 
i never saw anybody rap live before it was pretty new 
especially out here i went home and tried to write one of my own 
and it sounded pretty cool he said 
all the original big rappers such as kurtis blow and kool moe 
dee were from the east coast only recently have west coast 
rappers been taken seriously in the genre early 1980s acts such as 
the la dream team failing to take hold loc said the west coast 
rappers now have developed their own laidback style rather than 
trying to imitate the uptempo hiphop from the east 
weve grown tremendously out here he said weve got a 
groove that slow im a slower more mellow type 
locs own rap experience came during high school with a group 
called the triple as because all the members first names began 
with a 
there really wasnt too much happening with it i think we 
were too good for our time he said loc was a rap retiree by age 
20 but took it up again when the los angeles rap scene began to 
heat up a cousin introduced him to matt dike and mike ross 
founders of the small delicious vinyl label and two of locs 
records i got it goin on and im on fire received play 
on local station kday 
but it was the crossover appeal of wild thing which got 
play on new wave station kroq in los angeles last fall that helped 
launch loc los angeles rap and delicious vinyl now distributed 
by island records 
as for wild thing loc said he pieced the song together 
pretty much from personal experience 
you change a little bit here and there but the idea comes 
from something that happened to you he said 
does he get any static for the lyrics 
nah all the girls i know love it he laughed besides 
they know its all true 
loc is currently on tour for his album locd after dark 
which is climbing the billboard pop and black charts facing crowds 
of up to 18000 in arenas 
i was playing clubs in january and february he said its 
different but its the same i really like the hype 
and the crowds join in on wild thing 
they rap right along with it loc said 
loc is casual so far about his own success when asked he 
didnt know exactly where his records were on the charts except to 
say i know a lot of people are buying them 
there is also street recognition for the husky 6foot1 loc who 
appears in the heavy rotation wild thing video clip which 
borrows the expressionless allwoman band from robert palmers i 
didnt mean to turn you on 
locs own stock is soaring and he finds some things more 
difficult to do such as shopping in a mall 
when im shopping or eating i get swarmed you can hear 
people saying is that tone loc yeah thats him but theyre 
always nice to me and stuff and i love that plus i can get into 
a lot more clubs now he said laughing 
its nothing like michael jackson or anything but i can 
definitely tell the difference he said

from gone with the wind to a southern 
family writers have addressed the south with much sound and fury 
but vs naipaul has used his acute eye to furnish some fresh 
insights in a turn in the south 
naipaul a trinidadian of indian descent who has lived in 
england for nearly four decades spent six months traveling through 
the south studying race relations religion the romance with the 
past and its wary concessions to progress 
a turn in the south knopf 1895 takes the reader from 
greensboro nc where naipaul begins his sojourn through 
atlanta charleston sc tallahassee fla tuskegee ala 
jackson miss nashville tenn and back to north carolina at 
chapel hill he shows us confederate monuments and catfish ponds a 
selfproclaimed redneck and a nashville songwriter fundamentalist 
preachers and a futuristic nissan assembly plant 
the oxfordeducated naipaul is the author of 19 other books 
eight of them nonfiction works such as this one in which he 
exhaustively explores a locale they are much too complex to be 
considered mere travel books he is best known for his caustic 
pictorials of third world countries in both his nonfiction 
india a wounded civilization the loss of el dorado 
the middle passage and his novels a bend in the river 
guerrillas in a free state 
for example among the believers his controversial 1981 
account of the islamic faith in iran pakistan and indonesia 
probably would elicit a death threat from the ayatollah khomeini if 
it were issued today 
one of the pleasures of reading a turn in the south is 
experiencing the southern united states through the eyes of a world 
traveler the land was flat like the pampas of argentina or the 
llanos of venezuela naipaul writes of greensboro 
interviewing naipaul about the writing of this book is another 
experience altogether he detests interviews submits to them only 
on the insistence of his publisher and endures them with a pained 
air and mostly terse responses 
asked in a recent interview for example to explain what kind 
of advance work he does before setting out on a destination he 
said curtly i dont i dont do any research 
when the interviewer points out that in his book he says he has 
obtained letters of introduction that this sounds like advance 
preparation and asks him how he decides whom to contact naipaul 
responded that is always difficult 
when pressed to elaborate he would add only it varies from 
place to place it is one of the difficulties of the traveling 
business 
asked if he read any southern authors beforehand such as 
william faulkner or eudora welty whom he interviewed in a turn 
in the south he snapped thats fatal i always refuse to 
read in advance 
after a pause he added i always try to see what ive found 
im a fairly welleducated wellread person and ive spent all my 
life writing and i have a rough idea of the history of places i 
like to go and see what i find and move from there i dont want to 
be reacting against other peoples views 
in a turn in the south naipaul writes that this will be his 
last travel theme book why abandon a format that has served him so 
well 
i felt it at the time i felt i was getting on said 
naipaul who is 56 but what happened was i was so energized by 
it researching the book so excited so delighted i was so 
delighted by the method i had stumbled on in my middle 50s i found 
it so true and interesting and i so marveled that i hadnt 
alighted on it before i found that at the end of it quite a bit of 
energy remaining or generated and i thought i should do a 
little more before my chest absolutely packs up on me naipaul 
suffers from asthma 
the methodology to which he referred is to interview a wide 
range of people and to let them do the talking rather than his old 
habit of spending a long period in a given place quietly observing 
and analyzing which he now says gives a more prejudiced account 
naipaul seems unaware that the new method he has stumbled upon 
is that used daily by journalists 
naipauls next trip will be to india where he has traveled 
extensively but he didnt know if a book would come of it he said 
that because of his poor health he views every book as his last

country music performer roy clark the 
longtime star of the hee haw tv show thinks the cornpone 
program would be received well in the soviet union 
clark has made two concert tours of the soviet union most 
recently giving 12 performances last november he previously made 
18 concert appearances in 1976 
im sure they would be bewildered by the corny jokes but the 
overall image of hee haw would be compatible with their 
entertainment clark said in an interview they are interested 
in the history of the american west such as the cowboys 
you see audiences in europe in fringe and cowboy hats and the 
soviets are the same way they would identify with that image of 
hee haw 
the 56yearold clark who has been host of the show since it 
first aired 21 years ago foresees an entire wave of new viewers 
theres a generation of young people who get together on 
saturday nights and use it as an excuse to have a party in the 
college dorm he said its gone around and made a complete 
cycle we may become another fad i have a feeling it will outlast 
me 
the program which is seen on more than 200 stations is taped 
every june and october clark says the fact that its not a 
monthslong process has contributed to the shows longevity 
this keeps it fresh he said by telephone from his office in 
tulsa okla were not around each other enough to get on each 
others nerves its a natural high energy for us to perform 
because its like starting over twice a year 
when clark first appeared on the show he already had been 
performing on primetime network tv variety shows but he said 
hee haw capped his career 
this was the icing on the cake he said this put my face 
and name together 
his recent appearances in the soviet union have embellished his 
role as one of country musics major ambassadors after his first 
tour there 13 years ago which was made with the oak ridge boys 
the country music association gave him the title international 
friendship ambassador 
he also performed in bulgaria last year where his concert was 
broadcast live and seen by more than 500 million people in 
socialist countries 
theres a special feeling when you play in a foreign 
country clark said its not just another concert there is a 
lot of responsibility on your shoulders 
you are representing your country first of all also you must 
represent your music well the opinions of your performance 
reflects back on all the other country music performers if the 
people dont like it they will think thats what all of country 
music is like 
your adrenalin definitely flows a little faster 
his appearances were taped for television broadcast throughout 
eastern bloc countries soviet officials told him his concerts 
would be seen by 700 million people by the time they are broadcast 
and rebroadcast several times 
in the united states the nashville network on cable tv is 
carrying two onehour specials about clarks soviet shows 
clark said such a huge audience is a bit intimidating 
the first thing you think about is how many mistakes you 
made he said chuckling you wonder how many flat notes you 
hit and whether you looked tired and were at your best 
but it was gratifying theres nothing like recognition 
he said the soviet people were especially interested in the 
banjo crowds would gather at the foot of the stage to get a close 
look at his instruments especially the banjo 
you could tune one up and they would love it clark said 
they know the history of it as an authentic american instrument 
they know it speaks of our heritage and they like that brilliant 
sound of the banjo 
clark a native of meherrin va grew up in staten island 
ny st clairsville ohio and washington his father was a 
computer programmer for the federal government 
he learned to play a homemade ukulele as a youngster and got his 
first guitar at age 14 he is accomplished on the 12string guitar 
acoustic guitar banjo and fiddle and also plays five other 
instruments 
clark has dabbled in acting costarring in the 1986 movie 
uphill all the way with mel tillis hes also appeared in the 
tv shows the odd couple and the beverly hillbillies 
he is now approaching 30 years as a performer having celebrated 
his 25th anniversary in 1985 and his foreign concert tours are not 
over he plans to return to the soviet union within two years 
id like to keep the friendship going clark said

nearly a century after chauncey wing 
invented a simple device to stick mailing labels onto newspapers 
his greatgrandson is turning out almost identical wing mailers 
handcrafted on turnofthecentury lathes for modern newspapers 
times change but the wing mailer just goes along said 
donald wing the latest in the long line of yankee tinkerers and 
inventors to preside over the little brick mill in this 
northwestern massachusetts town 
he estimated that 3000 to 4000 of the devices are being used 
by newspapers ranging from large metropolitan dailies such as the 
boston globe and the hartford courant to hometown weeklies 
many bigger papers use it to back up their computerized 
systems the fancy electronics are only as good as the people who 
operate and fix them and they still have to get out the papers when 
the power goes off said wing and for the smaller papers it 
can be a lot more economical 
the device which feeds a strip of mailing labels through a glue 
well and then cuts and affixes the labels onto the newspapers with 
a pull of the thumb was invented in 1894 
the familyowned company still occasionally gets back for 
repairs mailers made 50 and 60 years ago said paul sevrens who 
manages the fiveemployee factory the only difference between 
these older models and the ones made today is that after the 1920s 
the mailers were made of aluminum instead of brass today the 
mailers cost about 215 
even the cherrywood handles that chancey wing and james a 
horton editor of the greenfield gazette and courier chose for the 
mailer when grover cleveland was in the white house remain still 
turned on a footdriven lathe 
there would be no purpose to changing said wing 45 our 
customers are familiar with it as it is and we dont care about 
being modern 
in its one concession to the computer age the company last year 
unveiled a new model without a glue well to handle preglued 
computer labels but otherwise the 2pound machine that has 
outlasted all its competitors is a handheld anachronism in the 
heavily computerized newspaper industry 
the factorys only pause was during world war ii when henry 
wing donalds father halted production to mill parts for 
topsecret radar research 
the companys sales including supplies totaled 250000 last 
year wing said 
to step into the plant near the family home is to walk into 
the 19th century 
most of the machines were made here and some even predate the 
mailer said wing a turnofthecentury fivehorsepower 
electric motor in the basement powers the more than two dozen gear 
cutters taps dies and presses through an intricate arrangement of 
leather belts and pulleys that whir overhead 
the electric bill for the whole plant is about 20 a month 
said sevrens wife peggy the office manager 
its hard to find people with the skill and inclination to work 
often by eye on the old machines sevrens said but his 
fascination came early 
i grew up in the neighborhood and did odd jobs for henry 
wing said the young machinist he was interested in everything 
and always working on all sorts of things tinkering i just 
thought he was kind of a neat guy 
richard haskins 78 who retired and returned twice because i 
dont have a place where i can have a hobby said he wouldnt 
want to work on a modern computerized milling machine 
theres a nature to man that can be lost he said a 
machine can make a standard socket but when youre finished 
theres nothing of toolmaker in it

international business machines corp can 
revive its stagnant us sales and pull away from competitors by 
getting closer to its customers chairman john f akers told 
shareholders at their annual meeting 
ibm must become a company that wont rest until every 
customer is not just satisfied but delighted with every 
association with ibm he said here monday everything else will 
follow market share revenue profit returns and stockholder 
value 
we intend to accomplish all this not by selling them 
smaller and faster machines to replace more clerical duties but 
rather working more closely with them to get an ever deeper 
understanding of their businesses he said 
ibms revenue in the united states the largest single market 
for the worlds largest computer manufacturer declined 07 percent 
last year to 253 billion 
measured in local currencies south american sales grew 21 
percent last year the most among ibms major geographic markets 
akers said revenue in local currencies grew by 14 percent in asia 
and the pacific and by 9 percent in europe the middle east and 
africa 
because of changes in the value of the dollar in terms of 
various foreign currencies the dollar value of foreign revenue was 
different from the value in local currencies

the clock is running out for south africalinked 
minorco sa the worlds largest gold producer to complete its 
hostile takeover of consolidated gold fields plc of great britain 
the no 2 gold concern 
us district judge michael b mukasey who issued a preliminary 
injunction barring the takeover bid in october on monday rejected 
another request by minorco to lift or modify his order 
minorcos 4 billion bid expires at 1 pm london time 
wednesday and unless the luxembourgbased conglomerate is able to 
acquire half of gold fields shares by the deadline it would be 
barred from attempting another takeover for one year under british 
law 
minorco controls 296 percent of the stock of gold fields 
last month the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in manhattan 
upheld mukaseys original injunction against further gold fields 
stock acquisition by minorco because it might violate us 
antitrust laws 
minorco through its various holdings is the largest producer 
of gold in the noncommunist world accounting for 203 percent of 
all gold production according to court papers 
last fall minorco which is largely controlled by two south 
african corporations anglo american corp of south africa ltd and 
de beers consolidated mines ltd launched a hostile takeover bid 
for gold fields 
but gold fields resisted and filed an antitrust action in new 
york sparking one of the largest takeover battles in british 
history 
mukaseys preliminary injunction last fall prevented minorco 
from proceeding with its tender offer until the antitrust issue is 
resolved 
just before mukaseys ruling the bid was referred to britains 
monopolies and mergers commission to consider possible 
anticompetitive consequences in the united kingdom on such 
strategic metals as titanium and zircon 
british law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until 
feb 2 when the commission held that acquisition of gold fields 
would not be against the british public interest 
with that ruling mukaseys injunction remained the only legal 
obstacle to minorcos offer 
last week mukasey rejected a minorco bid to lift or modify the 
stay 
to eliminate antitrust conflicts minorco offered to sell 
substantial gold fields subsidiaries gold fields of south africa 
usbased newmont mining corp and australianbased renison 
goldfields ltd and not buy them back for 10 years 
but mukasey said there was no guarantee the other minorcolinked 
entities debeers and anglo american wouldnt buy back the 
subsidiaries and keep the transactions secret under sympathetic 
south african laws 
he noted at the time that he enjoined the takeover because the 
resulting combination would control 323 percent of the 
noncommunist world gold market 
on monday minorco anglo and debeers offered to put up a total 
of 300 million bond and pledged not only to sell the previously 
mentioned properties but to not buy them back for at least 10 years 
but mukasey rejected that offer because he said members of 
the anglo group other than anglo debeers remain free to 
purchase shares in the three companies

the contours of striketorn eastern airlines 
could be markedly changed under managements proposed plan to 
rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell 18 billion in assets 
the plan presented monday to easterns major creditors which 
must be approved by them and a federal bankruptcy judge would 
slash the airlines work force by 43 percent from levels before the 
strike that started march 4 easterns unions as well as us 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland have been pushing for a sale of 
the entire carrier by its parent texas air corp 
if managements plan were approved miamibased eastern would 
cut its fleet size to 157 aircraft from the current 255 and the 
number of cities served to 77 from a prestrike 102 
eastern president phil bakes would not specify all the cities 
where eastern would cut service but told a press briefing the 
company would sell its northeast shuttle service and philadelphia 
hub along with a total of 117 unspecified airport gates and 28 
landing slots and deemphasize some foreign routes 
while keeping many of the plans details under wraps bakes did 
say eastern would retain its atlanta hub its routes linking 
northeast cities with florida and some or all of its caribbean 
service the atlanta hub which vies with delta air lines accounts 
for 35 percent to 40 percent of easterns total revenue 
i think its very aggressive but i think its possible said 
raymond neidl a securities analyst at mccarthy crisanti amp maffei 
inc who follows texas air 
neidl and other observers believe the plan could strip eastern 
down mainly to its heavy northsouth routes on the east coast 
eliminating its eastwest runs as the airlines network is 
currently structured the east coast is densely covered but routes 
become much sparser as they move west they mainly include cities 
such as los angeles san francisco phoenix seattle portland 
ore and salt lake city 
eastern also could sell its south american routes and part of 
its caribbean service possibly including its hub in san juan 
puerto rico neidl suggested 
eastern has been flying substantially reduced schedules since a 
march 4 strike by its machinists union which was joined by 
easterns pilots and flight attendants unions the company sought 
federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors on march 9 
under the new plan eastern would emerge from chapter 11 by 
september bakes said a target that neidl called overly 
optimistic 
fleet size would be reduced by aircraft sales and by leasing 
planes to other carriers bakes said 
employment at the scaleddown eastern would total about 17000 
down from a prestrike 30000 bakes said the total would include 
1700 pilots down from 3600 before the strike he said 
eastern would cut its daily scheduled flight hours to 1473 from 
2076 under the plan 
dan ashby a spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
the plan would not work partly because eastern would not be able 
to get enough pilots to fly its planes 
bakes said eastern plans to hire and train new pilots at the 
rate of 200 a month 
eastern indicated that by yearend under the plan it would have 
18 billion in net cash from asset sales giving it a net cash 
balance of 774 million after paying creditors and pension 
obligations 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo has insisted he no longer is 
interested in selling all of eastern following the collapse of a 
proposed 464 million deal with a group led by former baseball 
commissioner peter v ueberroth 
the federal bankruptcy examiner for eastern said monday that 
further bids to acquire the airline could be made as early as this 
week by suitors who include hotel executive jay pritzker and trans 
world airlines inc chairman carl c icahn

rather than wage a bitter battle with 
citizens amp southern corp of atlanta ncnb corp has withdrawn its 
24 billion takeover attempt scuttling what would have been the 
largest merger in us banking history 
i recommended to our board of directors that we terminate the 
offer ncnb chairman hugh mccoll said monday 
i did so because as was evident in our proposal and 
throughout subsequent communications we were committed to a 
friendly merger he said the management and directors of camps 
for reasons satisfactory to themselves have decided not to accept 
our offer i see no benefit in continuing it 
the announcement was made after the close of trading monday on 
the new york stock exchange ncnb had risen 25 cents a share to 
3637 and citizens amp southern had fallen 62 cents a share to 34 
the merger which consisted of a stock swap would have created 
the nations sixthlargest banking company but the atlanta bank 
refused to discuss the proposal 
camps chairman bennett brown said he believed from the beginning 
that this offer was not in the best interests of our shareholders 
customers employees and communities and that it would meet 
significant regulatory difficulties and public policy concern 
both these fine institutions can now get back to the business 
of banking and serving their communities brown said 
one analyst said he wasnt surprised by mccolls decision to 
drop the bid because ncnb needed the merger to be friendly 
they wanted to retain the management strengths of camps said 
the analyst dennis shea of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
just four months ago ncnb which has assets of more than 50 
billion effectively doubled its size when it was selected by the 
federal deposit insurance corp to acquire the largest bank in 
texas first republicbank corp 
since 1982 ncnb has expanded aggressively into new markets in 
florida south carolina georgia and tennessee the first 
republicbank move was the biggest until the camps offer 
tony davis a bank stock analyst with wheat first securities in 
richmond va agreed that ncnb could not go ahead with the 
takeover bid without the support of campss managment 
i think you have to take them at their word he said they 
said they wanted a friendly merger it was important as they 
approached the georgia market that they had the endorsement of the 
folks at camps 
chris davis of wheat firsts charlotte office added that ncnb 
needed a friendly merger because they have a full plate in 
texas 
shea said ncnb was going after a respected bank with a strong 
management team that could have offered the charlotte bank 
considerable help down the road in its expansion into texas and 
florida 
if camps continued to refuse to negotiate ncnb was not going to 
pull off a friendly merger he said i think ncnb realized that 
it could not negotiate in a vacuum they couldnt just keep upping 
the price 
shea also suggested that ncnb may have underestimated campss 
unwillingness to participate in the deal 
ncnb made the offer which would have created a banking company 
with assets of 76 billion on march 30 and on april 3 the camps 
board rejected the offer at the time camps called the bid 
inadequate and said camps present management was better able to 
serve the banks customers shareholders and communities than ncnb 
ncnb continued to court camps asking for facetoface meetings 
and adding different elements to the proposals including a plan to 
move ncnbs southeast banking headquarters to atlanta 
on april 13 mccoll visited atlanta and vowed to continue to 
pursue to the offer though he did not meet with any camps officials 
five days later camps chairman bennett brown urged shareholders to 
support the camps board in its rejection of the ncnb offer 
let me put it bluntly brown said at the time ncnb cannot 
afford camps 
last week mccoll announced that his bank would increase its bid 
if camps officials agreed to meet with ncnb executives mccoll did 
not indicate how high the offer would go

calling parts of oilman marvin davis 27 
billion bid for northwest airlines illegal and unfinanced nwa 
incs board of directors unanimously rejected the offer and moved 
to take further court action to block the efforts 
the board on monday reaffirmed its willingness to negotiate with 
suitors including davis in the interest of producing a 
transaction that is in the best interests of all nwa 
shareholders but it said it will seek a quick hearing on a 
motion to enjoin davis 90ashare tender offer 
the board also said it is working with an undisclosed number of 
other parties that have indicated an interest in acquiring 
northwest the nations fourthlargest carrier 
nwa stock closed at 10275 monday up 25 cents a share in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
in an amended complaint in us district court in minneapolis 
the nwa board said davis financing plan would exceed federal 
margin rules aimed at limiting the amount of credit used to buy 
stock the board said 125 billion in preferred stock financing 
planned for davis buyout actually should be considered debt 
the motion also claims davis tender offer actually was an 
illegal proxy solicitation that provided insufficient information 
to shareholders regarding the source and availability of 450 
million in equity davis said he would provide for the buyout 
in addition minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch said 
monday he found davis acquisition incs registration statement 
offering to purchase all of nwa incs outstanding shares deficient 
hatch said davis failed to disclose the manner in which he would 
operate nwa so as to expand its operation and not dispose of 
strategic assets of the company or lay off employees 
additionally the commissioner said davis did not disclose 
plans relating to an airbus maintenance facility that he said he 
intended to locate in minnesota 
hatch scheduled a hearing on the matter for this evening and 
said the registration would be suspended friday if the deficiencies 
are not corrected 
jim fingeroth a davis spokesman said the acquisition company 
had no comment on the order 
davis attorneys meanwhile were shoring up their efforts in 
delaware where nwa is incorporated his lawyers argued in a 
wilmington del court against a provision in nwas poison 
pill takeover defense that is hindering his efforts to put a new 
nwa board of directors in place 
the defense effectively would block a new board of directors 
from selling nwa for 180 days 
the prospect of a long delay would discourage shareholders from 
supporting davis in the proxy fight planned at nwas may 15 annual 
meeting attorney gilchrist sparks told the hearing 
nwa chairman steven rothmeier has said he prefers to see the 
airline remain independent or find a white knight investor to 
work with current management 
in letters to the 5000 union pilots at northwest rothmeier 
said last week that there are alternatives available to us from 
friendly investors 
but he said the assistance is contingent upon a contract 
settlement with the pilots who have been working under two 
separate contracts since northwest acquired republic airlines in 
1986 
davis delaware court action altered the course of his fight 
against the northwest poison pill he initially sought to 
invalidate the entire poison plan which would more than double the 
cost of a potential acquisition by a hostile bidder by flooding the 
market with new nwa shares 
but sparks said monday that davis would like to retain the pill 
for his own use in the event he gained control of the board 
rothmeier has declined to identify any potential friendly 
investors but the company has said a group holding 49 percent of 
nwas 291 million shares outstanding is interested in a leveraged 
buyout in a leveraged buyout a company is bought with largely 
borrowed funds 
the group includes los angelesbased investor alfred checchi and 
former nwa board member gary wilson now an executive for walt 
disney co 
the new york times reported monday that kelso amp co a small 
investment bank based in new york is considering a bid for the 
airline spokesman for kelso and northwest declined to comment

laidoff workers at the wall street brokerage 
lf rothschild amp co have sued their former employer under the new 
federal plant closing law while three drexel burnham lambert inc 
employees have sued that investment house over its plans to sell 
its retail brokerage business 
the rothschild employees claim they were dismissed without the 
60 days notice required under the plantclosing law 
a lawyer for the workers said monday he did not know of any 
other suits filed under the worker adjustment and retraining 
notification act which took effect feb 4 the workers were laid 
off march 10 
though the act is known popularly as the plant closing law it 
applies to any company with at least 100 employees in all and at 
least 50 at one site such firms must give workers 60 days notice 
of a shutdown or mass layoffs 
the lawyer jeffrey g smith said lf rothschild laid off 
about 250 workers at its manhattan headquarters without warning 
the suit seeking back pay and punitive damages was filed friday 
in us district court in manhattan by seven former employees as a 
class action 
the suit said rothschild was one of the 20 largest brokerage 
houses in the nation with more than 300 million in capital 
before the october 1987 stock market crash 
the firm suffered heavy losses in the crash and was purchased in 
june by a subsidiary of franklin savings association a savings and 
loan based in ottawa kan but it continued to lose money and the 
layoffs ensued 
in a letter announcing the layoffs rothschild told its 
employees the plant closing law did not apply because the company 
had been pursuing a realistic opportunity to have a lender bail 
it out and avert the layoffs 
smith said the law did offer such an exemption on grounds that 
a layoff notice would scare off potential lenders 
but he said in this case the bailout apparently was being 
considered by franklin the parent company smith said that would 
not qualify for an exemption because franklin already was aware of 
rothschilds condition 
kevin hoffman rothschilds attorney declined to discuss the 
case saying the company would respond in court 
he did say rothschild gave severance pay to the workers but 
smith said the law requires notification regardless 
in the drexel case the classaction suit filed monday by the 
three workers charges drexels top managers with breach of contract 
and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the plans to 
sell the brokerage division 
the suit filed in new york state supreme court in manhattan 
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions 
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their drexel stock 
for far below its true value 
the price of the stock is based on book value the suit did not 
disclose the firms book value 
according to the suit drexel has understated the book value of 
its assets including warrants and options it has received in some 
deals in lieu of partial payment of fees 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm had not studied 
the suit and had no comment 
drexel annouced plans last week for a major restructuring that 
involves the sale of the brokerage unit and the elimination of 
about onethird of drexels work force the restructuring was 
prompted in part by bad publicity due to the investigation of 
securities fraud at the investment house

noboru takeshita announced he will resign as soon as parliament 
approves the fiscal 1989 budget 
the dollar closed at 13117 yen down 021 yen from mondays 
13138yen finish it opened at 13165 yen its high for the day 
and ranged as low as 13105 yen 
the dollar started higher following its weak note on overseas 
markets where the yen was sold but japanese investors concertedly 
bought the yen following news about mr takeshitas 
resignation said an analyst with a commercial bank in tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
investors believed that takeshitas departure would eliminate 
some political and economic tensions he said 
takeshita has been linked with a company at the center of a 
stockprofiteering and bribery scandal and opposition parties have 
been boycotting budget deliberations in parliament to demand that 
the government clear up the situation 
there has been speculation of some more arrests of 
politicians but the majority expects that things would not 
worsen the analyst added 
also encouraging yenbuying today were expectations that the 
japanese central bank might raise its interest rate soon 
higher domestic interest rates which would narrow the interest 
rate gap between the united states and japan would weaken 
dollarbuying incentives traders said 
bank of japan gov satoshi sumita told a meeting of branch

134 percent closing at 3324478 the gain was the thirdlargest 
of the year 
news reports early today that takeshita might resign boosted 
buying said kenji ishizuka of daiwa securities 
since mr takeshita would not resign until the budget is 
approved participants concertedly bought construction issues 
because the budget approval guarantees public construction he 
added 
takeshita announced his decision to resign following a cabinet 
meeting his popularity has been eroding steadily in the face of 
the stockprofiteering and bribery scandal and a new sales tax 
besides construction issues steel shares attracted investors 
although share prices were higher across the board trading was 
only moderate with first section volume estimated at 800 million 
shares up from mondays 450 million

consumer price figures for march due to be announced later this

the highprofile italian retailer benetton 
has opened its first store in poland shocking shoppers accustomed 
to empty shelves with mounds of colorful clothing and prices in 
their own currency 
sales clerks reported the most common question was dollars or 
zlotys as a storefront on warsaws main shopping street ulica 
marszalkowska on monday turned into a glistening benetton outlet 
with its crisp modern look 
the italian retailer is on the leading edge of marketing by 
western companies in the east bloc poland has been trying to 
attract such businesses to help shore up its ailing economy 
stacks and stacks of knitwear in bright hues of orange blue 
and yellow were folded on open shelves in the warsaw store on 
monday a bevy of saleswomen in benetton outfits volunteered 
assistance 
in short the new store at first looked and sounded very unlike 
a typically bare polish store with its clerks curt replies of 
nie ma there is none 
within hours of opening however the store had acquired the 
customary line 
the first day probably will be pretty violent since it is 
something new said saleswoman elzbieta makucz 
benetton is the first western clothing retailer to open an 
outlet selling for zlotys in poland which increasing has a 
twocurrency economy but is plagued by a shortage of quality 
consumer goods 
many desirable goods from cocoa to cars are bought for dollars 
in special shops or by private arrangement 
many of benettons first shoppers found the zloty prices 
astoundingly high a hot pink sweatshirt was offered for 78000 
zlotys about the average monthly salary 
last month poles became able to legally trade dollars for 
zlotys at about the same rate now 4000 zlotys per dollar as on 
the black market 
thus a pole with 25 perhaps sent by a relative abroad can 
turn it into 100000 zlotys 
in a 1988 report the government estimated that 5 billion in 
us currency was circulating in the country and another 28 
billion was deposited in bank accounts many other hard currencies 
are of course also in circulation 
in the joint venture with benetton the staterun fashion 
company moda polska is buying merchandise from the italian retailer 
in hard currency and translating the prices to zlotys 
i first of all want to be a businessman said moda polska 
director marek zembrzuski 
he said moda polska spent about 400000 for the first benetton 
stock out of about 5 million to be spent on imported goods this 
year the hard currency is obtained through exports and auctions of 
hard currency he said 
for benettons part poland is one of a series of new markets 
explored by the company 
there are nine benettons in hungary five in czechoslovakia and 
seven in east germany said renata sponchiado who represents 
management in italy 
however the other east bloc benettons do not accept local 
currency zembrzuski said 
benetton designed the store and trained the staff there is 
even a company style for folding clothes but moda polska operates 
it 
moda polska and benetton are two young companies and this is 
a good starting point for us said mrs eva villax who set up 
the warsaw store for benetton she predicted other company outlets 
in poland 
one man who was among the first shoppers left monday with two 
bulging trademarkgreen shopping bags and an enthusiastic review 
it is a great idea there is a much bigger choice 
he said the prices seemed about the same as those in stores that 
accept dollars 
however some women peering at the display window had other 
ideas the prices shock me said one it is not even worth 
looking said another

the year is 2089 and fusion power plants are 
energizing the world bringing the benefits of virtually unlimited 
electricity to countries everywhere 
earths sky is crystalline blue purged of the gases and gunk 
that soured the atmosphere above whole continents a century before 
when fossil fuels were the main energy of civilization 
concerns about the greenhouse effect and problems of acid rain 
are now only academic curiosities an atmosphere once choked with 
the combustion gases of fossil fuels is slowly cleaning itself and 
life is returning to lakes and streams that previously were 
acidfilled 
such is the world that scientists and engineers envision with 
the advent of fusion the process by which atoms are fused together 
to release energy 
their visions are not just wishful thinking but goals that must 
be achieved according to some experts because the age of fossil 
fuels is expected to start drawing to a close within only a few 
decades and when fossil fuels are gone or become impractically 
expensive something must be ready to take their place 
the most likely thing will be fusion said harold p furth 
director of the princeton university plasma physics laboratory 
the present projections are that by the year 2040 or 2050 there 
will be a divergence between the energy required for a growing 
population and the energy available from fossil fuels easily 
obtainable uranium and other sources 
there will be quite a calamity unless something new is 
ready he added 
the cold fusion process announced last month by the 
university of utah is still controversial and unproven but furth 
and others believe a fusion process based on compressing deuterium 
plasma and heating it to 100 million degrees can be developed 
within two decades or less 
thousands of researchers working at both federal and university 
laboratories are moving closer and closer to the point where the 
fusion fires will ignite and burn powered by deuterium or 
hydrogen chemicals easily extracted from seawater 
most experts believe the fusion future lies with the 
highpressure hot process but they would welcome convincing 
proof that utahs cold roomtemperature fusion works because it 
possibly could be developed more quickly 
eric storm a fusion research project leader at the lawrence 
livermore laboratory in california said that researchers could 
have a fusionfired power plant operating by the year 2020 if the 
industrial nations of the world would commit the resources 
fusion is the energy source that nature prefers its the one 
that drives the sun and the stars said storm and nature is 
efficient 
we could have fusion in just 15 years or so said stephen 
dean president of the fusion power association a nonprofit 
education foundation but the government hasnt put a high 
priority on it so it will take 30 years or more 
dean said an investment by the federal government of 1 billion 
a year for 15 years would bring fusion power to reality but he 
said that isnt likely to happen until theres an economic 
incentive 
most experts believe there will be a slow phaseout of fossil 
fuels as they become more expensive and that the 21st century 
eventually evolve into an allfusion civilization 
some of the fusion of that era will be from manmade plants on 
earth but the experts also believe there will be a more efficient 
use of solar radiation the energy created by the natural fusion 
process of the sun 
once that time comes according to scientists visions oil 
spills will be obscure footnotes in history texts or just quaint 
memories recalled by centenarians who lounge in the bright sunlight 
of a pollutionfree sky petroleum expensive and becoming rare 
will seldom be used for fuel and coal even less often 
a fusiondriven world could have automobiles and trucks running 
on nearly silent electric engines leaving in their wake only 
eddies of clean air not the rank clouds that trailed vehicles of 
an earlier gasolineburning age 
some engines could operate on hydrogen a fuel extracted from 
seawater by the use of the plentiful electric power 
in this scenario fusion power plants easily licensed and 
fueled by a chemical extracted from seawater would dot the 
landscape on continents around the globe 
the plants would not pose the radiation hazard that once seemed 
so threatening from nuclear fission plants of the late 20th 
century there would be no chernobyllike monster straining to 
break free with fusion 
radiation waste from fusion would be only a fraction of that 
from fission plants fusion wastes are rendered harmless within 
decades while the centuryold spent fuel rods from the 1989 
nuclear fission power plants would still be deadly and would be for 
another 1000 years 
whatever process is developed fusion is inevitable said 
storm the fusion researcher its not a question of if but of 
when

linked to an influencepeddling scandal and 
immensely unpopular prime minister noboru takeshita announced his 
resignation today but left his successor and the timing of his 
departure unclear 
the recruit scandal has bedeviled japanese politics for half of 
takeshitas 18month tenure and it appeared possible an elder 
politician might become interim prime minister until the situation 
is sorted out 
the candidate mentioned in many news reports was former foreign 
minister masayoshi ito an elder statesman untouched by the recruit 
scandal but his health was in question he is a diabetic 
i think it should be a young person its time for a young 
person to be in charge said ito 75yearold chairman of the 
executive council of the governing liberal democratic party 
other powerful figures in the party that has governed japan 
since 1955 are as tainted by money from the recruit co as 
takeshita including his rival and party secretary general former 
foreign minister shintaro abe 
the recruit question has caused a grave crisis for the 
nations parliamentary democracy takeshita 65 said in a 
nationwide television broadcast after telling the cabinet of his 
intention to resign 
i have decided to pull out in order to retrieve the publics 
trust in politics he said as the chief executive of 
government and president of the ruling party i deeply apologize 
asked about the succession he declined to comment saying it 
is not the place of one resigning to express such opinions 
once takeshita resigns governing party members would choose 
their next party president who would become prime minister due to 
the liberal democrats majority in both houses of parliament 
his resignation would also mean his entire cabinet would leave 
office the party leadership also would be expected to resign news 
reports said 
prices on the tokyo stock exchange surged after the 
announcement the nikkei stock average rose 134 percent the 
years third largest oneday gain 
newspapers rushed out singlesheet extra editions with the news 
the tabloid fuji daily headlined takeshita finally resigns 
vice president dan quayle said today the bush administration 
would work with takeshitas eventual successor its a democracy 
and whoever the leader of that democracy is well work with 
quayle said during a stop in honolulu en route to american samoa 
and australia 
takeshitas approval rating in a recent poll by kyodo news 
service slumped to 39 percent making him japans most unpopular 
postwar prime minister 
in addition to the scandal he was hurt by the introduction 
april 1 of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax and rural voters a 
bastion of liberal democratic strength were disaffected by moves 
to liberalize agricultural imports 
takeshita said he would leave office after parliament passes the 
1989 budget but parliament or the diet has been stalled by a 
boycott by opposition parties demanding that former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone testify about the recruit scandal 
there was a hint of progress on the issue this evening as the 
governing party said the opposition had agreed to participate in 
budget committee sessions but the opposition still insisted on a 
promise that nakasone would testify 
the liberal democrats have more than enough votes to ram the 
budget through but doing so would go against the japanese 
tradition of politics by consensus 
takako doi head of the japan socialist party the largest 
opposition group said she wants new general elections and 
nakasones testimony i think it is nonsense to ask for the 
passage of the budget in exchange for his takeshitas 
resignation she said 
takeshita said he would go ahead with a nineday trip to five 
southeast asian nations starting saturday indicating he hopes the 
diet will pass the budget in early may 
takeshita had been clinging to office with a pledge to reform 
politics and reclaim public trust in politicians 
recently however he acknowledged he received even more money 
from the recruit co than the more than 1 million in what he 
called legal political donations that he earlier this month 
admitted getting 
during the weekend it was reported takeshita he also received a 
loan of 381700 from the informationpublishing giant in 1987 
admitting the reports were true further embarrassed takeshita 
the recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations that the 
company had sold cutprice shares in a real estate subsidiary to 
more than 150 politicians bureaucrats business leaders and media 
executives 
the shares often bought with money lent by another recruit 
subsidiary yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went 
public in 1986 
takeshita through an aide and a relative who actually held the 
shares benefited to the tune of 192000 nakasones aides 
similarly raked in about 460000 
three cabinet ministers had resigned previously because of links 
to recruit prosecutors have so far arrested 14 people but no 
politicians in the case charging them with bribery and 
securities law violations 
it is alleged that recruit sought favors from bureaucrats who 
regulated its main business in jobplacement magazines and from top 
executives of companies with which it did business including 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
although japan has been known for money politics since the end 
of the war the public was shocked by the amounts of money involved 
and the broad spectrum of the establishment that was tainted 
the recruit scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in 
japan since former prime minister kakuei tanaka was accused in the 
lockheed affair in 1976 he was convicted of taking a 2 million 
bribe after the us aircraft company admitted it spent 121 
million to advance its sales in japan

the cost of wages salaries and benefits to 
the nations employers rose 12 percent in the first quarter of 
1989 with increases in benefits costs again outpacing pay gains 
the labor department reported today 
the employment cost index report showed that for the 12 months 
ended march 31 the cost of wages salaries and benefits rose 48 
percent down slightly from the 5 percent average for calendar 1988 
but up significantly from the 1987 jump of 36 percent 
the index measures changes in an employers costs for all forms 
of compensation principally wages and salaries and employerpaid 
benefits such as health insurance it is closely watched as a 
barometer of inflation particularly in the past year as analysts 
have speculated that the tight labor market would drive up 
compensation costs because of increased competition for workers 
analysts disagreed over whether the figures signaled a faster 
pace of wage gains and therefore increased inflationary pressure on 
the economy 
the numbers are reasonably favorable and there are no signs of 
wage acceleration said michael evans president of a washington 
economic forecasting firm except for the one sore spot of rising 
health care costs i think the figures show wage gains continue 
to be stable and no signs of rapid acceleration 
but economist roger brinner at data resources inc in lexington 
mass said the report indicated labor costs are creeping up 
he predicted the annual rate of employer cost increases which 
would be 45 percent if the firstquarter numbers held throughout 
the year would climb to 5 percent and possibly to 55 percent over 
the next year 
with unemployment down to almost 5 percent workers feel that 
they can ask for their normal share which is the sum of inflation 
and productivity brinner said in a telephone interview 
inflation on usproduced goods is about 45 percent and 
productivity gains have been in the 1 percent to 15 percent range 
the rate of employer costs could slow however if unemployment 
rises brinner predicted that the civilian jobless rate 50 
percent last month would edge up in the next quarter and reach 55 
percent or slightly higher by years end 
the 12 percent increase in the index for the first quarter 
compared with 10 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and 14 
percent from the first quarter of last year the labor department 
reported 
the increase for the first three months of 1989 was attributed 
to a 11 percent jump in wage and salary costs and a 18 percent 
rise in employers costs for benefits escalating health care costs 
have been the largest factor in the rising costs of benefits 
for the year ended march 31 the government said wages and 
salaries for workers in private industry rose 42 percent while the 
cost of benefits rose 51 percent 
employer costs for workers in service industries rose 15 
percent in the first quarter up from 12 percent in the final 
three months of 1988 and the 13 percent gain reported in the first 
quarter of 1988 
in the goodsproducing industries employer costs rose 10 
percent for the quarter up from 08 percent in the final quarter 
of 1988 but down from the 18 percent jump reported for the first 
quarter of last year

today brings another critical test for the auto 
industry the first full sales period of the latest round of 
incentives and carmakers are looking for the consumer response 
that so far has eluded them 
im holding my breath a little on this one auto analyst 
douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york said monday 
sales during march were lower than expected prompting general 
motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp to institute new 
expensive incentive programs partially because of those 
enticements car and light truck sales during early april were 283 
percent higher than the same period last year 
but sales during the first 10 days of april last year were among 
the lowest of the year distorting comparisons with this years 
performance 
sales rebounded in midapril 1988 meaning todays yeartoyear 
comparisons will give a better snapshot of how sales are faring 
compared to the same time in the secondbest sales year in industry 
history 
automakers had counted on strong march and april sales to shrink 
inventories and put off the need for largescale production 
cutbacks 
i guess youd say they incentives are working but not as 
well as they used to analyst david healy of drexel burnham 
lambert inc said monday if thats so midapril sales were 
better than the march rate but not as good as early april 
laughlin said he was watching interest rates particularly 
closely 
if interest rates start to trend down i think that would 
alleviate some of the concern among automakers about the impact 
of this particular incentive program he said it would 
suggest that things will be easier in the next few months 
if interest rates hang up here it may be a source of concern 
for the industry 
one of the first places any industry concern would be noted is 
in the companies production schedules gm ford and chrysler held 
to ambitious production levels through the first quarter of this 
year leading some analysts to speculate that production rates 
would have to be changed later this year especially at 
modelchangeover time in the third quarter 
today ford analyst ray windecker said the nations no 2 
automaker was cutting about 2 percent from its secondquarter 
production schedule as part of fine tuning 
our market share continues to move up but we will cheerfully 
admit the industry is a little softer than we thought it would 
be he said the cuts windecker added would come in overtime 
ford has been running at all but one of its 18 us and canadian 
assembly plants the companys oakville ontario plant which 
makes the ford tempo and mercury topaz is operating on straight 
time 
windecker said thirdquarter production schedules are due out 
later 
meantime wards automotive reports a weekly industry 
newsletter said in monday editions that gm had cut its production 
schedule by 60000 cars for the third quarter of 1989 
gm spokesman tom pyden refused to comment on the report saying 
final production figures for the julyseptember period arent set 
however he confirmed the nations largest carmaker had cut its 
secondquarter production schedule by about 3 percent 
the vast majority of it is elimination of some of our planned 
overtime he said this does not change our yearlong sales 
forecast for 1989 we will approach 15 million units 
chryslers original production schedule for mid1989 was scaled 
back from firstquarter levels

president bush said today that critics 
couldnt be more wrong when they call his proposed cut in 
capital gains taxes a tax break for the rich 
rather he said that proposal and other new investment 
incentives are needed to help america compete in the global economy 
bush took note of the criticism of his proposal in congress and 
elsewhere in a speech prepared for managers and employees at ford 
aerospaces space systems division here 
well they couldnt be more wrong he said lower capital 
gains taxes will create jobs for those who dont have jobs and 
help build a better america 
capital gains taxes are levied on the profits that businesses 
and individuals make on investments the president wants to cut the 
33 percent maximum tax on capital gains to 15 percent and to exempt 
entirely the gains accrued by people with incomes under 10000 a 
year 
when fully effective in 1995 the tax break for capital gains 
would apply to assets held for 36 months or longer 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and other top 
congressional democrats have criticized bush for pushing the 
capitalgains reduction which they term a tax break for the 
rich while opposing legislation to increase the minimum wage to 
455 an hour from the current 335 
in his palo alto speech bush also put in a fresh plug for his 
proposed tax credit aimed at making child care more affordable for 
the poor 
this came a day after it was disclosed that he had come out 
against a reduction in the surtax paid by older americans for 
medicare coverage of catastrophic illiness 
the president noted that demographic changes in the american 
labor force indicate that the majority of new jobseekers in the 
years ahead will be females minorities and immigrants 
to keep abreast of the rapidly changing technologies and the 
change in the labor markets he said businesses must have 
incentives to make the kinds of investments that will create new 
jobs and he suggested that many of these new jobs will come in 
the hightechnology area 
lower capital gains taxes will create jobs for those who dont 
have jobs and help build a better america he said so let us 
act to lift revenue help savings and free american businesses 
without distorting world markets 
my friends i want to give the high five to hightech and i 
want to do it by investing in competitiveness he said 
the president was coupling his northern california economic 
speech today with a pep talk downstate to officers at a 
narcoticsenforcement training institute in rancho del rio 
the disparate themes of the fourday bush trip which will 
conclude thursday in florida seemed aimed at projecting an active 
president in the final seven days of the first 100 a milestone 
that has been used to report first impressions of the presidents 
stewardship of national affairs 
bush has sought to minimize the importance of the 100day marker 
for presidential performance but during a speech monday to the 
annual luncheon of associated press newspaper publishers in 
chicago he went ahead anyway 
weve made a good start these first three months bush said 
so while im pleased with all weve accomplished in these three 
months theres a long road ahead of us 
meanwhile in a letter made public monday the president came 
out against any quick moves to reduce the surtax for medicare 
coverage of catastrophic illness 
in the letter released by rep dan rostenkowski dill bush 
said it would be imprudent to tinker with the program even in 
light of a congressionally projected surplus in its reserves 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee last week raised the possibility of a reduction of up to 
16 percent in the surtax 
bush however said in the letter that financial reserves for 
the program are not excessive and may actually be too thin 
he said the surplus projections are based on uncertainties in a 
program that is only a few months old 
the president set aside the ford aerospace plant speech today to 
laud the more than 75month recovery from the 198182 recession and 
the nations 5 percent unemployment rate which is at the lowest 
level in 15 years but bush also wanted to warn anew of an america 
that is declining competitively in the global economy 
the merchandise trade deficit fell from 1521 billion in 1987 
to 1187 billion last year a 22 percent reduction which 
represented the first annual improvement since 1980 
but the deficit has been on an upward trend more recently with 
the redink figure at 105 billion in february which was more 
than 20 percent above the january figure 
we had a tremendous improvement in the trade figure last year 
but were now seeing a pause said michael boskin chairman of 
the presidents council of economic advisers when you go through 
a very substantial growth in exports as we did last year you 
often see such a pause and an adjustment 
speaking to reporters en route here on air force one boskin 
said that many businesses and industries are still trying to build 
up to capacity production 
bush will travel to los angeles on wednesday to be reunited with 
the president he served as vice president for eight years ronald 
reagan 
later in the week the president will address the texas 
legislature in austin and make drugrelated appearances in miami 
and clearwater fla before returning to washington late thursday

injured in mondays arrests many strikers accused virginia state 
troopers of being unnecessarily rough 
most of the towns businesses closed for mondays daylong rally 
in support of the strike now in its 20th day

supporters were arrested and charged with obstructing a free 
passage route 773 and were being released on their recognizance 
union members estimated the number arrested at closer to 300 an 
exact count was not immediately available because the numbers 
overwhelmed local officials forcing them to turn a courtroom into 
an impromptu holding cell 
theres not enough cells to hold us hudson said 
the 1400 pittston employees in virginia and 300 in west 
virginia went on strike april 5 accusing the company of unfair 
practices during contract talks the miners had been working 
without a contract since february 1988 
about 200 union members gathered today at the mcclure mine but 
did not block the road or mine entrances no one was arrested 
however i think all of them here were prepared to go to jail 
if necessary umw district 28 president jackie stump said today

the pittston employees on strike in virginia were joined on the 
picket lines by about 750 westmoreland employees who are taking off

the supreme court ruled today that states may 
tax companies for oil and gas taken from indian reservations 
voting 63 the justices handed western states an important 
victory in upholding a new mexico tax on oil and gas taken from the 
jicarilla apache reservation there 
the court said the state levy does not trample on indian rights 
and is not unfair to a petroleum company even though the company 
must pay taxes to the state and the tribe 
the court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes with 
tribal economic development by prompting producers to look off 
indian reservations for mineral deposits 
new mexico officials told the court the dispute is of great 
concern in the west they said there are more than 150 cases of 
companies with deposits on indian land protesting such double 
taxation in arizona new mexico montana and utah 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said congress 
has not specifically preempted the power of states to tax oil and 
gas on indian lands 
any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation 
of onreservation oil and gas resources by indian tribes is 
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support a claim the 
state tax is preempted stevens said 
stevens rejected arguments by cotton petroleum inc which has a 
lease with the apaches for oil and gas on the reservation that it 
is subject to unfair double taxation 
it is of course true that the total taxes paid by cotton are 
higher than those paid by offreservation producers he said 
but neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax 
the burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact 
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental 
entities share jurisdiction 
stevens also noted that new mexico provides services to cotton 
petroleum on the reservation 
there is no constitutional requirement that the services the 
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays 
stevens added 
the constitution does not demand that benefits received from a 
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer must equal the 
amount of its tax obligations he said 
finally stevens rejected an assertion that the apache tribe is 
a state and therefore cotton petroleum is subject to multiple 
state taxation 
in a dissenting opinion justice harry a blackmun said new 
mexico is increasing its revenue at the expense of tribal 
economic development that violates federal policy expressed in 
laws and regulations to protect indian selfdetermination he said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall 
cotton petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 
15000 acres of land on the jicarilla apache reservation 
the company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent 
of its prpoduction and new mexico levies five taxes on the company 
amounting to 8 percent of its production 
cotton petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state 
with deposits taken from nonindian land only pay 8 percent in 
royalties 
the company said it paid 23 million in taxes to new mexico 
from 1981 through 1985 but received only 89000 in services from 
the state 
todays ruling upholds a 1987 decision by the new mexico court 
of appeals 
the jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case it 
filed a socalled friendofthecourt brief expressing its 
opposition to the state tax 
in other action the court 
upheld a 1986 federal law imposing safety user fees on 
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids 
the court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in 
oklahoma that the law which allows the secretary of transportation 
to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs 
unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of congress 
power to impose taxes 
tossed out a dispute over the federal governments power to 
ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run 
lotteries 
the justices ruled 63 that a controversy from minnesota has 
become moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the 
ban 
the indian reservations case is cotton petroleum vs new mexico

ranks hovis mcdougall plc has made a takeover bid 
of about 14 billion pounds for goodman fielder wattie ltd the 
australian food concern that failed in its hostile attempt to 
acquire ranks hovis last year 
turning the tables on the sydneybased company the british food 
group emphasized monday its bid did not stem from last years 
takeover battle or from fears it might be revived 
ranks hovis characterized its proposal which values the 
australian company at the equivalent of about 24 billion as part 
of its own plan to expand internationally goodman fielder is the 
largest food company in australia and new zealand 
goodman fielder said it wasnt informed of the takeover bid in 
advance and advised shareholders to keep their shares while its 
directors examine ranks hovis proposal 
there was mixed speculation on what goodman fielder would do 
several analysts said they consider ranks hovis offer fair and one 
analyst speculated that goodman fielder would welcome it 
goodman fielders corporate affairs director greg russell said 
clearly there are synergies between the two companies 
this same point was made last year by the australian company 
when it was pursuing ranks hovis 
john elston an analyst with james capel amp co said goodman 
fielder could block the british bid if it chose to because a large 
portion of its shareholders are loyal to current management 
in practical terms you either have an agreed deal or you 
dont have a deal at all elston said 
goodman fielders attempted takeover of ranks hovis last year 
was thwarted by britains monopolies and mergers commission because 
of its dependence on debt and on possible anticompetitive grounds 
the attempt left goodman fielder with 299 percent of ranks 
hovis shares a goodman fielder official said the company has held 
discussions with several interested parties about selling the stake 
but the talks are on hold while goodman fielder considers the ranks 
hovis proposal 
ranks hovis said its bid is contingent upon acquiring more than 
50 percent of goodman fielders common stock the british company 
also said its offer carries a condition that goodman fielder not 
enter into any new financial obligations exceeding a certain 
monetary threshold 
the transaction would have to be endorsed by ranks hovis 
shareholders and would be subject to review by government 
regulators ranks hovis said it did not anticipate any problems 
with australian authorities 
besides britain ranks hovis has interests in australia new 
zealand asia europe and the united states it makes bread flour 
cakes and a wide range of other food products 
goodman fielder holds about 35 percent of the australian 
flourmilling market and has a 50 percent share of that market in 
new zealand it controls 60 percent of the australian margirine and 
cooking oil market is the third largest gelatin maker in the world 
it also owns meneba nv a dutch flour bakery and poultry company

goldome bank one of the nations leading 
thrifts reported a loss of 388 million or 141 per share for 
its first quarter ending march 31 company officials said today 
goldome lost 12 million or 45 cents per share during the same 
period last year 
chief executive officer ross kenzie told shareholders at the 
companys annual meeting in buffalo that the loss which follows a 
loss of 119 million in 1988 was due to continued high interest 
rates and a decrease in income from nonbanking subsidiaries

continue restructuring efforts under the leadership of thomas 
cooper the former head of the bank of america who was recently 
named his successor 
i have no doubt this company will triumph in the 1990s

higher supply costs but the maker of televisions and computers 
said it still expects to turn a profit this year

recorded its first annual profit in four years in 1988 mainly as a 
result of booming computer sales

sales of cars and light trucks made by the 
nations big three automakers rose 47 percent in midapril 
compared with last year mainly because of a strong performance by 
ford motor co the companies said tuesday 
general motors corp ford and chrysler corp reported their 
vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 38686 during the april 
1120 period this year compared with a rate of 36956 cars and 
trucks a day during the same time last year 
car sales rose a modest 21 percent and truck sales were up 93 
percent during the period in which each of the big three had new 
incentive packages in full force 
the companies have been banking that incentives announced at the 
end of march and in early april would entice customers into 
showrooms and help pull the industry out of a lowerthanexpected 
sales slump during the first three months of the year 
normally march and april sales are robust but they failed to 
live up to that billing last month hence the incentives 
for the first 20 days of april big three car sales were up 121 
percent and truck sales were running 156 percent ahead of last 
years pace since jan 1 car sales by the big three were down 84 
percent and truck sales were off 12 percent compared with last 
year 
ford said its midapril car sales were running 145 percent 
ahead of last years pace going to a daily rate of 8348 this year 
from 7292 during the period last year so far in 1989 fords car 
sales were running 11 percent ahead of last years pace 
truck sales by ford were up 49 percent during the 10day period 
this year and were down 24 percent for the calendar year 
gm reported a 15 percent decrease in its midapril car sales 
with a daily rate of 12296 this year compared with 12483 last 
year so far this year gm has sold 11 percent fewer cars than last 
year 
gms light truck sales were up 147 percent in midapril and 
down 24 percent so far this year 
chrysler said its average daily car sales rate fell to 3374 
during midapril this year a 103 percent decline from the 3760 
rate during the period last year car sales by the nations no 3 
automaker for the year were running 182 percent behind last years

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods posted a moderate gain in march the government 
reported tuesday but analysts said the increase reflected a surge 
in aircraft orders that masked a broader slowdown in the economy 
the commerce department said total orders for durable goods rose 
08 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1249 billion last month 
with virtually all of the increase attributed to a jump in demand 
for transportation equipment 
excluding the transportation category which is subject to wide 
swings depending on when big contracts are signed orders were down 
28 percent in march the third straight monthly decline 
analysts said the figures were consistent with recent government 
reports which suggest that economic growth is slowing as the record 
peacetime expansion extends into its seventh year 
this definitely should tell even the biggest skeptic that the 
slowdowns arrived maury harris chief economist for painewebber 
inc said of the latest report anybody who says monetary policy 
hasnt affected the economy is just crazy 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and thus restrain 
inflation although some analysts have expressed concern that the 
feds actions could unintentionally topple the country into a 
recession 
economist priscilla trumbull of the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa said the fed still should be able to engineer a soft 
landing in which growth slows enough to cool inflation without 
causing an economic downturn 
ms trumbull said the weakness in manufacturing orders is 
probably one of the best things that could happen for the economy 
because it reduces concern that factories will overheat and face 
shortages that would drive up prices 
in march transportation orders rose 104 percent while most 
other industry categories posted declines the jump in the 
transportation sector reflected a large boost in orders for 
aircraft and parts that more than offset a decline in demand for 
motor vehicles 
harris said the surge in orders for planes would have little 
immediate impact on the economy since the aircraft manufacturing 
industry already has a large backlog of unfilled orders 
in the defense category which overlaps with the transportation

second consecutive session tuesday on the chicago board of trade as

in the region early next week 
its a weather market said john frazier a grainmarket

the agriculture department reported that corn planting got under 
way in most major producing areas last week soybean planting will 
begin in early may 
but the usda also said the kansas winter wheat crop was in 
mostly very poor to poor condition last week due to a lack of 
moisture that report helped support the wheat market

gov terry branstad asked federal 
officials tuesday to help soften the effects of a spring drought by 
activating emergency feed programs and allowing cattle to graze on 
fragile acres normally held out of production 
our recent scattered rains may have helped in some areas but 
certainly they were not dustbusters by any means branstad said 
branstad said up to 40 percent of the states pasture has been 
destroyed by dry weather this spring cattlemen said farmers 
already have started selling off their herds and may speed up the 
liquidation within the next two weeks if they do not get help 
it is appropriate to take action early the governor said 
these are difficult times for our cattle producers 
branstad asked us department of agriculture officials to 
activate emergency programs to give farmers financial aid in buying 
feed and to allow grazing on highly erodable acres taken out of 
production 
gene wiese of manning presidentelect of the iowa cattlemens 
association said farmers are facing a bleak future because the 
prime months for growing pasture are april and may 
this is normally when we have lush growth in our pastures 
he said in many areas of our state thats just not happening 
before any decision can be made on the assistance requests a 
countybycounty survey must be completed something branstad said 
could take two weeks 
programs the governor requested include 
allowing grazing on conservation reserve program acres land 
for which farmers receive annual payments to hold out of 
production that grazing would be allowed initially for 30 days 
but could be extended if dry weather continues 
activating an emergency feed program giving up to 5 cents per 
pound for assistance to farmers purchasing feed 
activating another feed program where farmers can purchase 
feed owned by the government for 75 percent of its loan value 
they do not require any outlay of cash branstad said 
adding he was confident federal officials would approve the 
request were not asking for anything thats out of line or that 
will run into a wall of resistance 
government officials however have warned that farmers should 
not expect a massive federal bailout similar to one approved last 
year due to the drought that gripped much of the midwest 
but wiese said cattle farmers need some signal that government 
will help or many will begin to sell herds 
we need some assurances to carry on he said 
branstad said the immediate threat was to livestock producers 
we wont really know the impact on crops until much later 
branstad said he said he would seek drought aid for other farmers 
if the drought continues and worsens throughout the year

cray research inc the worlds biggest 
supercomputer maker on tuesday reported a 94 percent decline in 
firstquarter earnings and said secondquarter earnings also could 
be down significantly 
the company reported firstquarter net earnings of 15 million 
or 5 cents a share down from firstquarter earnings of 264 
million or 85 cents a share for the same period in 1988 
firstquarter revenue was 1161 million compared with 1459 
million for the 1988 quarter 
we entered the year expecting the delivery of computer systems 
to be much higher in the second half of the year than the first 
said marcelo a gumucio president and chief operating officer 
the revenue results for the first quarter are consistent with 
that outlook 
current delivery schedules indicate that more systems have 
shifted to the last half of the year and we now expect revenue for 
the second quarter to be similar to last years second quarter 
gumucio said 
but he added we have not changed our objective of achieving a 
10 percent revenue increase for the full year 
gumucio said all operating areas are exercising strong expense 
control in line with the companys revenue objective for the full 
year while we continue to invest fully in new product development 
projects to meet longterm objectives expenses will be spread more 
evenly through the year than revenues 
this affected earnings in the first quarter and earnings in 
the second quarter could be down significantly from the same period 
a year ago for the same reason he said earnings for the full 
year will depend primarily on our ability to meet the aggressive 
delivery schedules for the third and fourth quarters 
during the first quarter 13 systems were installed at customer 
sites including seven new systems and six used systems three of 
the new systems were leased as were four of the used systems cray 
said 
cray posted a 6 percent increase in net earnings in 1988 it 
reported 7563 million in revenues and 1566 million in net 
profit for that year 
cray based in minneapolis employs more than 5200 people and 
has manufacturing and development facilities in chippewa falls and 
rice lake in wisconsin and in colorado springs colo

cable industry leaders are teaming up to 
encourage use of cable tv programming in the classroom including a 
new daily news program that could rival a similar show for schools 
from whittle communications lp cable industry and education 
sources said tuesday 
the effort which is expected to be announced at a news 
conference wednesday in washington dc comes on the heels of 
whittles completion of a 25show test in school classrooms of its 
commerciallysponsored news program channel one 
the cable group includes some of the nations biggest cable 
programmers and operators led by turner broadcasting system inc 
which operates cable news network and reportedly will produce the 
daily news show 
the atlantabased turner broadcasting scheduled a news 
conference for wednesday at the national press club to announce a 
new venture to benefit american schools 
also scheduled to attend were top officials of the cable 
networks arts amp entertainment cspan and the discovery channel 
along with cable operators telecommunications inc continental 
cablevision inc and jones intercable 
turner spokesmen refused to elaborate on the topic of the news 
conference and the other participants either declined comment or 
failed to return calls 
but one education industry source requesting anonymity said he 
had been told turner will disclose plans for a daily news show for 
use in schools 
in addition to turners news show the other networks either 
would create new programming or more heavily promote the 
availability of their existing shows for use in schools cable 
industry sources said 
it will be a mix of programming of current events and some 
cultural and educational type programming a nice mix said one 
cable executive familiar with the groups plans discussing it 
provided he was not identified 
it was not clear whether the programming would contain 
commercials as whittles channel one service does or whether the 
cable group would donate equipment on the scale of that envisioned 
in the channel one project 
whittle launched channel one a daily 12minute news show with 
two minutes of paid advertising in six test schools march 6 the 
schools were each given about 50000 in video equipment tv 
monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for agreeing to run the 
program every school day 
the cable industry effort was being viewed in part as a way for 
the cable industry to show it is being a good citizen at a time 
when calls have arisen for greater regulation of the industry 
it also reflects an effort to protect cables turf against the 
entry of an outsider the knoxville tennbased whittle 
turner has been involved for two years in a joint venture with 
the national school boards association called news access that 
has made available cnns the week in review program and a 
detailed classroom guide with suggestions on how to use portions of 
the show in schools 
the news access program which is being used in about 220 
schools relies on schools to use their own equipment to record and 
show the program 
cspan the discovery channel and the arts amp entertainment each 
have their own arrangements for sharing programs and course guides 
with schools 
but none of those efforts has drawn the attention that whittles 
channel one test did 
whittle is reviewing the results of the sevenweek test ended 
last week and hopes to decide by midsummer whether to make the 
program available nationally in the fall of 1990

traders surveyed by one of the countrys largest 
brokerage firms say they have not changed the way they do business 
despite the governments investigation of activities at the chicago 
board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
eighty percent of more than 1100 private speculators who 
responded to the lindwaldock amp co survey said disclosure of the 
fbi probe on jan 23 had not affected their trading methods the 
brokerage firm reported tuesday 
sixtynine percent said they believed trading pits at the 
nations commodity futures exchanges operate honestly and 
efficiently but 63 percent thought the exchanges could do a 
better job of policing themselves 
we wanted to know how our customers felt about the industry 
said barry lind president of lindwaldock a chicagobased futures 
discount brokerage 
with futures trading in the headlines he said we thought it 
would be a good time to get information 
the federal probe of suspected trading fraud at the board of 
trade and the merc the worlds two largest futures exchanges has 
not yet produced any official charges or indictments 
of those who said they had changed the way they traded 12 
people or 1 percent said they had stopped trading as a result 
of the investigation others said they changed the type of orders 
they placed or said they were trading less than before 
the survey was of active clients as of march the brokerage said 
it did not have an unusual number of clients drop out in january 
and march as the investigation became known 
i tend to think we have a image problem lins said 
referring to those who had curtailed their trading its our 
fault because of our esoteric business we have to explain why we 
are here and the importance of futures trading to the economy 
most of those expressing dissatisfaction in the survey opposed 
more federal regulation of futures trading saying they feared it 
would reduce liquidity and volume on the trading floors increasing 
the cost of transactions 
i think the response to that question indicates the public 
wants reform lind said the exchanges understood that when they 
created committees to recommend changes he added 
the ongoing investigation in which undercover fbi agents have 
posed as traders reportedly centers on allegations that as many as 
100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of 
dollars 
a survey of traders conducted by the wall street journal shortly 
after the federal investigation was revealed indicated that trading 
violations were numerous at the mercantile exchange 
the 130 chicago merc traders responding to the journals survey 
blamed the violations on the way exchange rules are written and 
enforced but they said cheating of customers was not common 
last week a chicago merc panel recommended that most forms of 
dual trading be banned and floor surveillance of trading 
doubled to prevent wrongdoing 
dual trading which is legal enables traders to trade for their 
own accounts at the same time that they handle customers orders 
the merc panel also recommended more extensive screening of 
applicants for membership reform of the exchanges disciplinary 
committees and daily computerized trade information on the previous 
days trades for members 
lindwaldock conducted its survey in march it mailed forms to 
4353 of its 13000 customers and 1142 replied 
we were happy at the very high positive response we received 
and surprised at the extraordinarily high rate of return of our 
questionnaires lind said people actually thanked us for the 
opportunity to voice their opinions 
seventyeight percent said they were well served by the current 
open outcry system of filling orders one respondent said attempts 
to automate trading would decrease confidence in the futures 
markets because it would take trading out of the public view

exxon corp said tuesday it has been hit with 31 
lawsuits and 1300 claims ranging from 500 to 4 million in 
connection with last months alaskan oil spill and expects further 
suits as well as government fines 
at a meeting of securities analysts top executives of the 
nations biggest oil company said exxon already had paid 400000 
to settle smaller claims brought mainly by fishermen and cannery 
workers whose jobs were disrupted because of the march 24 spill 
that fouled hundreds of miles of coastline 
exxon executives declined to put a dollar value on the existing 
lawsuits or the claims 
exxon chairman lawrence c rawl who has been criticized for 
staying out of sight in the crucial days following the disaster 
said that in retrospect he would have responded differently 
however he said he did not understand the public anger against the 
company especially because it had accepted the blame and 
apologized for the spill and was cleaning it up 
im angry with myself rawl said its not really clear to 
me as to why everyone is so angry once we get past the point of 
admitting it was our ship that went on the rocks 
exxon president lee r raymond said all but two of the lawsuits 
were class actions against the company all but one were filed in 
alaska state and federal courts he said with the remaining suit 
filed in california 
raymond said exxon has four separate insurance policies totaling 
5998 million in cleanup and liability coverage including a 400 
million policy that would pay off even in cases of company 
negligence but raymond said the various policies cant necessarily 
be added together 
raymond said the insurance would cover most if not all of the 
cleanup costs and that therefore its impossible for us at this 
point to make any provision for our earnings for any reserves 
on monday exxon announced that it had charged 30 million 
against firstquarter earnings for expenses associated with the 
salvage and repair of the broken tanker but not for the cleanup 
itself 
raymond also said the company probably was subject to fines but 
did not yet know what fines various government agencies might 
impose 
rawl said the company did not anticipate any punitive damages 
due to the spill in which an exxon tanker ran onto a reef and 
spewed more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince 
william sound 
there obviously was no intent on our part to put a very 
expensive ship on bligh reef to put expensive oil in the water and 
then a very very very expensive cleanup rawl said 
in response to criticism that exxon did not have enough people 
working on the cleanup rawl said exxon would increase the number 
to about 4000 by next month he also reiterated his optimism that 
despite concerns by alaska officials the major part of the spill 
would be cleaned up by september 
exxon told a news conference monday that the cleanup was ahead 
of the pace calculated in the oil companys federallyapproved 
plan which estimates cleanup completion by sept 15 
when questioned about the impact of a possible boycott against 
exxon rawl said that with anticipated tight supplies and high 
demand during the summer season its hard to see this summer how 
we wouldnt be able to sell all the gasoline we can make 
a number of consumer activists have called for a boycott of 
exxon to punish the company for what they claim is its poor 
response to the disaster and alleged negligence leading to the 
spill 
the boycott will damage the dealers who are independent 
business people rawl said 
rawl said the spill hasnt changed exxons outlook or spending 
plans he also declined to specify when the company would declare 
its next dividend which generally is issued quarterly 
as to changing exxons tarnished image he said its pretty 
clear theres a better way to do that job but we havent had time 
to sort that out were going to have to do a hell of a lot better 
job than we have done

employees caring for elderly relatives often 
experience jobrelated stress and increased absenteeism and 
corporate america can expect even more of these problems as the 
population ages a private study released tuesday found 
if elder care is a problem now and it is we had better 
find good humane answers soon if we dont the future will 
turn into a nightmare for millions of us said e james morton 
chairman of john hancock financial services which conducted the 
study along with fortune magazine 
the study was based on responses from 370 senior executives and 
369 people in the general employee population 
it found that six out of 10 senior executives were aware of 
specific workrelated problems with elder caregiving employees 
fortyfive percent of the executive respondents noticed employee 
stress 38 percent unscheduled days off 37 percent late arrivals 
and early departures 32 percent aboveaverage use of the 
telephone and 30 percent absenteeism the survey said 
those in service companies were more likely than industrial 
companies to report having these problems the survey said 
a vast majority of the employees questioned 70 percent 
admitted that taking care of elderly relatives or friends 
interfered with job performance 
fiftyone percent of them said they felt increased tension on 
the job as a result of their responsibilities the survey said 
fortyfour percent also admitted to increased use of the telephone 
and that same percentage had to take more time off for emergencies 
the survey said 
fourteen percent said their productivity was affected it said 
the survey found that women were more likely to shoulder 
responsibilities for caring for the elderly and take a socalled 
daughter track approach in which their careers are slowed as 
they juggle work and parental care 
executives havent been immune to these problems either the 
survey said that half of them are personally responsible for an 
elderly person now or have been in the past two years and one out 
of every two executives reports being concerned about maintaining 
job performance 
caregivers spend on average 13 hours a week tending to the 
elderly usually a parent with responsibilties ranging from 
providing transportation and companionship to performing simple 
household chores 
about a quarter of all fulltime employees in the united states 
reportedly provide some care for the elderly who represent roughly 
12 percent of the us population that figure is likely to 
increase over the years with the elderly population expected to 
nearly double by the year 2030 and as nursing home care expenses 
rise 
with this rapid increase in the elderly population and with 
caring for the elderly being a family responsibility we must 
expect growing pressure on the workplace said leslie 
gainesross a research director for fortune this dual 
responsibilty will be overwhelming both emotionally and 
financially 
this dual responsibility will affect business bottom line 
resulting from lost employee production and higher healthcare 
expenses 
few companies though offer programs to deal with this problem 
other than providing things like unpaid leaves of absence or 
personal days to their employees ms gainesross noted 
it might be beneficial for corporations to educate managers as 
to the enormity of elder care responsibilities she said 
understanding the problem goes a long way to coping with it and 
resolving it 
the surveys margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage 
points

contracts settled through collective 
bargaining in the first three months of 1989 gave workers average 
annual wage increases of 31 percent over the life of the pacts 
the government reported tuesday 
the wage gains were up from the 22 percent average raises 
provided during the life of contracts settled in the fourth quarter 
of 1988 and also ahead of the 24 percent average wage gains 
contained in collective bargaining agreements settled in all of 
last year 
analysts said the new gains were in line with other labor 
department data showing wage inflation growing because of tight 
labor markets 
the quarterly report on collective bargaining like the labor 
departments broader employment cost index report showed workers 
in the fastgrowing service sector winning larger wage gains than 
manufacturing workers 
thats where the tighter labor markets are chief economist 
allen sinai of boston co economic advisers inc said of 
serviceproviding parts of the economy 
the labor department said the 64 firstquarter collective 
bargaining agreements it analyzed covered 199000 workers the 
average length of the contracts was just under three years with 
only seven being for less than two years 
firstyear pay gains averaged 32 percent with average wage 
increases of 31 percent in the second and third years of the 
contracts the department said 
the government which tracks agreements covering bargaining 
units with at least 1000 members said 107 such contracts 
affecting 636000 workers had expired or been reopened in the first 
quarter but had not been settled or ratified by april 1 
of that group about 350000 employees worked for railroads and 
104000 for airlines with the remaining number dispersed 
throughout a variety of industries 
the firstquarter report showed that workers who received 
lumpsum payments from their employers or had costofliving 
adjustment clauses in their contracts on average received smaller 
wage increases than workers who received neither of those forms of 
compensation 
about 30000 workers got lumpsum payments as part of contracts 
negotiated in the first quarter and their pay raises averaged 18 
percent a year over the lives of the new contracts 
contracts affecting 21000 workers contained cola clauses 
generally tied to the governments inflation index and the annual 
wage gains in those agreements averaged 24 percent the government 
said 
more than 75 percent of the workers whose contracts were settled 
in the first quarter worked in the nonmanufacturing sector of the 
economy and their annual pay gains averaged 33 percent over the 
lives of the contracts 
in the manufacturing sector where lumpsum payments and cola 
clauses are prevalent wage increases averaged 23 percent annually 
over the contract lives

president bush quoted several sports 
figures tommy lasorda satchel paige and woody hayes and gave a 
high five to high tech during a pep talk on competitiveness 
tuesday in silicon valley 
critics complained however that he didnt say enough about 
unfair trade by foreign competitors in his speech before business 
leaders and workers at ford aerospaces space systems division 
after bush received boos for his reference to lasorda the los 
angeles dodgers manager who is an enemy to san francisco giants 
fans the president won applause for advocating a cut in the 
capital gains tax and a boost in spending for nasa and other 
science and technology 
he praised ford aerospace which recently delivered the first of 
two communications superbird satellites to japan in a 209 million 
contract as a good example of americas ability to compete 
internationally 
today american satellites are among the most competitive 
spacecraft for customers who want affordable highpowered 
communications satellites bush said 
he quoted former pitcher satchel paige dont look back 
somebody might be gaining on you and said america must invest 
in the future by developing new programs to accommodate a changing 
workforce 
as an example bush cited fords employee assistance program 
which helps workers find childcare help 
though bush offered no new strategies for increasing us 
productivity or improving americas ability to compete abroad his 
appearance in the nations hightechnology capital early in his 
term showed an eagerness to stimulate business 
i think it fires up the people to want to be competitive to 
realize theyre making progress and to want to be in the forefront 
of americas success for exports and products for our own use 
said robert e berry vice president and general manager of fords 
space systems division 
chris hoeber director of fords commercial space programs 
operations led bush on a tour of the facilitys space 
environmental chamber which duplicates temperatures in space and 
showed him the next superbird satellite 
this is a case study to show american businessmen what is 
possible if theyre willing to take the time and make the 
investment in japan and other countries said hoeber theres 
no reason why americans cant be as competitive as anyone else 
larry stone mayor of sunnyvale in the heart of silicon valley 
criticized bush for saying very little about fair free trade and 
the restrictive policies of other countries 
but stone commended bush for returning to an area that he lost 
fairly handily in the november election 
he came back within the first 100 days and gave a message that 
i think will be widely accepted by the corporations here the 
capital gains tax and the extension on research and development tax 
credits 
rep tom campbell the firstterm republican congressman and 
stanford business school professor who represents much of silicon 
valley accompanied bush on his first domestic speaking tour since 
entering office 
the rampd tax credit is so important and the capital gains tax 
is critical campbell said hes hitting it in every speech 
campbell said he talked with bush aboard air force one about 
other ways to boost competitiveness including improving access to 
foreign markets ending excessive litigation and guarding against 
transferring technology to other countries that could hurt us 
business 
we talked explicitly about access to foreign markets in 
connection with the semiconductor agreement to sell to japan 
campbell said bush did not mention the semiconductor problem in 
his speech

may wholesale heating oil which slid 182 cents in the previous 
session gained 027 cent to settle at 5208 cents a gallon 
andrew lebow a senior trader with edampf man international 
futures inc attributed the gasoline rally partly to expectations 
that the latest american petroleum institute weekly report due out 
late tuesday would show decreased supplies in the wake of the exxon 
oil tanker spill in valdez alaska 
an explosion in the north sea last week also compounded fears of 
an already tight gasoline supply situation as the summer driving 
season approaches 
on tuesday exxon corp and shell uk the british unit of 
royal dutch shell group said they expected a prolonged shutdown in 
production in that area 
the north sea accident has disrupted the flow of brent crude 
through a major pipeline affecting the production of at least

beutel a new york analyst for elders futures inc i cant

usx corps profits shot up 88 percent while bethlehem steel 
corps profits fell 24 percent the nations biggest and 
secondbiggest steelmakers said tuesday in firstquarter reports 
pittsburghbased usx said its net income surged 88 percent to 
296 million or 109 per share led by a near threefold increase 
in operating income at marathon oil co 
operating income from steel sagged 40 percent to 99 million on 
sales of 15 billion 
income from continuing operations at texas oil amp gas corp 
shrank from 7 million to 3 million even though sales grew 42 
percent from 276 million to 393 million 
texas oil amp gas eported operating income of 147 million but 
144 million of that came from the settlement of lawsuits 
concerning takeorpay supply contracts said company spokesman 
william p ryder 
overall sales grew by 125 percent to 45 billion from 40 
billion in the 1988 first quarter when profits were 157 million 
or 52 cents per share 
marathon contributed operating income of 241 million on 24 
billion in firstquarter sales compared with 84 million on 21 
billion in sales a year earlier 
secondquarter operating results should be even stronger in 
energy usx chairman david m roderick said in a printed statement 
marathons improvement was the result of higher profit margins 
on refined products greater volume and higher prices for crude oil 
and natural gas and lower exploration costs the company spent 31 
million exploring for oil and gas in the first quarter down from 
50 million a year earlier 
operating income in steel declined from 167 million on sales of 
14 billion 
the decline was due primarily to continued weakness in the 
oil country tubular goods market and increased costs for raw 
materials roderick said 
income from the diversified group of usx dropped from 98 
million on 341 million in 1988 firstquarter sales to 30 million 
on 252 million in sales reflecting the sale of businesses in the 
group and a 43 million ontime credit last year 
usx received 83 million in extraordinary income in the first 
quarter due primarily to the sale of assets including the 
phosphate fertilizer business of the agrichemicals dividion and 
the sale of 25 percent of quebec cartier mining co 
the company boosted capital spending by 143 million to 372 
million 
even after this relatively heavy capital spending the 
corporations cash balance continues over 2 billion roderick 
said this cash flow for the first quarter is on track with our 
goal of generating more than 1 billion in 1989 permitting 
continuation of our program to strengthen our balance sheet and 
enhance shareholder value 
bethlehem steel said its 24 percent decline was the result of a 
onetime charge 
the bethlehem pabased steelmaker said its net income fell to 
647 million or 78 cents per share from 854 million or 123 
per share a year earlier sales rose 56 percent to 14 billion 
from 133 billion in the comparable period a year earlier 
the nations secondlargest steelmaker said it charged 55 
million against the first quarter as the cost of reorganizing its 
troubled baltimore marine division the division could be hurt 
further by a strike that was begun march 17 by members of the 
international association of machinists bethlehem said 
the 1988 first quarter results included a charge of 19 million 
over a coal mine fire and employee benefits and a 10 million 
credit as an investment tax credit refund 
shipments increased 2 percent from 26 million tons to 27 
million tons production declined 1 percent to 32 million tons as 
the company operated at 82 percent of capacity only 1 percentage 
point below the 1988 first quarter 
chairman walter f williams said he expects shipments to remain 
about the same at least through the second quarter he said second 
half industry shipments will decline from levels of the first half 
bethlehems future financial performance will be affected by its 
contract negotiations with the united steelworkers and by the 
extent to which the bush administrations renews steel import 
quotas due to expire in september williams said

had onetime gains on asset sales another media company 
knightridder inc also reported a decline in its firstquarter 
profit 
times mirror owner of the los angeles times newsday and other 
papers said it earned 688 million or 53 cents a share in the 
first quarter down 8 percent from 751 million or 58 cents a 
share a year earlier 
firstquarter sales rose 93 percent to 8469 million from 
7746 million a year earlier 
the times mirror results for the first quarter of 1988 included 
an aftertax gain of 153 million from sale of timberland and of 
timesmirror press if that gain were excluded this years profit 
would have risen 15 percent the los anglesbased media concern 
said 
newspaper publishing revenue hurt in recent months by soft 
demand for advertising rose 11 percent in the quarter because of 
higher advertising volume costcutting and the fact the accounting 
period was five days longer than last years advertising 
performance improved at the los angeles times and baltimore sun 
papers but continued slow in new york 
revenue rose 9 percent for book magazine and other publishing 
and 17 percent for cable television broadcast tv revenue declined 
less than 1 percent 
in addition to the times newsday and the baltimore sun papers 
times mirror holdings include the hartford courant the allentown 
pa morning call the stamford conn advocate and greenwich 
conn time kdfwtv in dallas and other publishing broadcast and 
cable tv operations 
washington post which owns the washington post newspaper and 
newsweek magazine and has interests in tv stations and cable 
television said its earnings tumbled 71 percent to 415 million 
or 322 a share in the first quarter from 1448 million or 
1125 a share a year earlier 
firstquarter revenue rose 65 percent to 3419 million from 
3212 million a year earlier 
the 1988 results had included a nonrecurring gain of 1157 
million from the sale of cellular telephone interests 
excluding that gain the company said its earnings would have 
risen 42 percent from a year earlier 
newspaper division revenue rose 7 percent in the latest quarter 
as advertising lineage at the washington post edged up 3 percent 
revenue from the companys four television stations rose 5 
percent and cable division revenue rose 13 percent newsweeks 
revenue rose 1 percent from a year ago 
miamibased knightridder said its profit fell 393 percent to 
205 million or 39 cents a share from 338 million or 59 cents 
a share a year earlier 
firstquarter revenue rose 104 percent to 5407 million from 
4897 million a year earlier 
robert f singleton senior vice president and chief financial 
officer said this was a difficult quarter but the results were 
just about what we expected when we set our 1989 budget 
he said more than half of the decline was due to acquisitions 
including the purchase of dialog information services and an 
investment in a cable operation while the rest reflected 
softness in operations and higher interest rates 
he said he expected growth in earnings per share for the year 
partly because of softening newsprint prices stronger operating 
results from the newspaper division and growth in business 
information services 
he said the company also expects to benefit from lower interest 
costs as the result of the previouslydisclosed agreements to sell 
its eight television stations and two newspapers 
knightridder owns 30 newspapers offers a variety of electronic 
business information services and has interests in cable television

us sprint communications co plans to give 
refunds to thousands of customers in las vegas after one man 
complained he was overcharged 60 by the longdistance telephone 
company 
sprint officials have acknowledged that thousands of their 
22000 las vegas customers were overcharged from april through 
august of 1988 because computers recorded the wrong time of day for 
the phone calls the mistake also affected creditcard customers 
dialing from las vegas 
sprint officials declined to estimate how much the refunds would 
be 
the refunds were prompted by lenny frome a las vegas resident 
who complained about a billing error to the company last year 
frome a retired aerospace engineer who teaches mathematics at 
the university of nevadalas vegas figured the company owed him 
about 60 in overcharges when he felt the company was delaying in 
resolving the issue frome took his complaint to former sen chic 
hecht rnev who passed it along to the federal communications 
commission 
michael furtney a vice president of corporate relations for 
sprint said tuesday the company was correcting the situation when 
the fcc notified sprint about the complaint 
furtney defended any delays in dealing with frome saying 
erroneous charges are hard to find in a company thats generating 
billions of dollars in revenues 
its like looking for a needle in a haystack he said 
furtney said the company plans to identify all overcharged 
customers within two weeks he said customers should receive 
refunds within a month after that

taken a modest bite out of this years crop yields and that the

drought remains the leading force in world agriculture at 
least until more is known about this years crops of wheat and corn 
both schnittker and the agriculture department project huge 
declines in world and us inventories as a result of last years 
droughtshriveled yields in north america 
by july 1 he said the global grain inventory going into the 
new 198990 season will be down to a 61day supply compared with 
an 87day reserve last summer that will be the smallest reserve 
since the early 1970s when global grain stocks were drawn down to 
a 57day supply 
speaking to a meeting of the national association of 
agricultural journalists schnittker said the supply situation puts 
the united states sort of on the razors edge because of the 
uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions 
although many areas are dramatically improved from last years 
summer drought parts of the great plains and corn belt are still 
woefully dry even in some areas that have moderate surface 
moisture the reserves deep in the subsoil are scant 
and if we do have a second adverse cropgrowing season the 
effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and 
in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past 
year schnittker said 
the reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major 
crops as it became apparent that the us granary would be 
partially emptied 
schnittker said he finds himself disagreeing quite a lot 
with usdas chief meteorologist norton strommen who told the farm 
writers earlier that he was still optimistic that crop conditions 
will improve and that nationally the united states can have a 
productive year 
strommen and others maintain the fate of the us winter wheat 
crop will not be known for another month or so and that farmers 
still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent in 
planting corn 
if i seem a little on the optimistic side it may be that im 
looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that 
have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of 
the 1988 drought strommen said 
acknowledging there are pockets of drought problems still around 
kansas for example where about 75 percent of the winter wheat 
is reported in very poor or poor condition strommen said many 
other sections of the country have had good moisture last year in 
recent months 
when you put all of the big parts together the overall 
outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last 
year strommen said but we are still deeply concerned about 
the pockets and the problems we have in the western great plains 
and the central part of the corn belt 
schnittker said strommen may turn out to be right but it 
seems to me with the extreme subsoil drought concentrated on 
the central corn belt at the moment that it is prudent for private 
forecasters at least to reduce the probable corn yield a little 
bit 
already he said the moisture problems have shaved this years 
average corn yield if all had been normal the yield trend pointed 
to an average of about 120 bushels per acre but schnittker says he 
thinks 115 bushels are more likely 
that would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 754 billion 
bushels up from 51 billion bushels estimated for 1988 the usda 
currently estimates last years corn harvest at 492 billion 
bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop 
based on april 25 conditions schnittker forecast this years 
total us wheat harvest at 215 billion bushels about 300 million 
bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had 
been normal last years wheat harvest was 181 billion bushels

the alaska oil spill is a tragic accident that 
should not be used to prevent oil industry development of such 
controversial sites as the arctic national wildlife refuge amoco 
corps top official told shareholders tuesday 
th spill resulted from a transportation accident unrelated to 
oil exploration or production richard m morrow amocos chairman 
and chief executive officer told the companys 100th annual 
meeting in prepared remarks 
overseas oil is being transported daily to ports throughout 
the us by an increasing number of ocean tankers morrow said 
these tanker shipments will continue to escalate in the years 
ahead if we do not develop more of this nations energy resources 
particularly oil and natural gas 
morrow who also is chairman of the american petroleum 
institute said the industry is reexamining its operational 
policies in the wake of the spill he said a task force of top 
oilcompany executives is conducting a comprehensive review of 
industry spillprevention and cleanup capabilities 
two weeks after the exxon corp spill of 11 million gallons of 
crude oil in fragile prince william sound president bush called 
the accident an aberration that had not dissuaded him from 
urging congress to authorize exploratory drilling in the arctic 
refuge 
i am not going to suggest that because of this spill that we 
should rethink a policy of trying to get this country less 
dependent on foreign oil bush said 
environmentalists disagree 
if we want to prospect for oil we should do it in detroit 
director scott denman of the safe energy communication council said 
earlier this month 
amoco recently has been emphasizing its overseas operations 
company spokesman richard judy acknowledged 
but he said the opening of some of the lastfrontier areas 
domestically such as the arctic refuge on alaskas north slope 
and other sites considered environmentally fragile would present 
new opportunities for domestic exploration and production 
amoco has no share of the prudhoe bay oil fields on the north 
slope whose crude oil is channeled through the transalaska 
pipeline to tankers at valdez like the one that caused the 
disastrous march 24 spill 
the company does have limited production in alaskas cook inlet 
and a small share in a field in the beaufort sea as well as 
inactive exploration acreage in bristol bay and the beaufort and 
chukchi seas judy said

attempting to reverse the decline in its 
flagship high life brand miller brewing co unveiled new 
commercials tuesday promoting the beer as a reward for everyday 
heros 
the new high life campaign under the slogan the best comes 
shining through is reminiscent of the millertime commercials of 
the 1970s that touted beer as a reward for regular work 
for example one commercial in the new series extols a man who 
helps a woman cross the street and another salutes a farmer who 
helps harvest corn for the widow of a friend others praise a man 
in a wheelchair who is playing basketball and show a member of a 
carracing team warning a competitor of a mechanical problem with 
his car thereby possibly losing the race but doing the honorable 
thing at the same time 
these ads portray people who do the right thing said robert 
toledo vice president of brand management and promotions for 
miller and unlike the miller time ads these celebrate basic 
human values and elevate the man and the beer and not just a 
regular job welldone 
high life sales fell to sixth place last year from third in 1987 
among the top domestic brewers according to statistics from 
beverage media a liquor industry publication 
beverage media estimated 85 million barrels of high life were 
sold last year down from 93 million in 1987 
moving past high life in the rankings were bud light at 97 
million barrels coors light at 87 million barrels and busch at 
86 million the publication said 
the top sellers were budweiser at 506 million barrels and 
miller lite at 196 million barrels 
the new ad campaign for miller high life was the first developed 
for the brand by leo burnett usa chicago

shearson lehman hutton inc approximately 2 million for work that 
shearson says the law firm did not perform 
michael oneill a spokesman for shearson confirmed tuesday the 
existence of an investigation into the matter disclosed in 
mondays editions of the wall street journal 
there have been billing irregularities oneill said we 
have have brought them to the attention of myerson amp kuhn and we 
have ended the relationship 
the law firm denied the charges 
myerson amp kuhn was formed in 1988 and is headed by kuhn and 
harvey myerson 
shearson which had been a client of myersons former law firm 
retained myerson amp kuhn for about 12 million annually a financial 
industry source said tuesday the journal quoting unidentified 
sources said the amount of overbilling was about 2 million 
in addition myerson amp kuhn said the appellate division of new 
york state supreme court was looking into the matter after 
receiving a complaint from shearson the appellate division which 
investigates allegations of misconduct informed myerson amp kuhn at 
the end of last week that it had 20 days to respond to the charges 
the spokesman said 
there has never been a basis for a claim of overbilling 
myerson amp kuhn said tuesday in a statement the orchestrated 
public attack upon us rather than an effort to present a claim in 
a decent a businesslike way is itself compelling evidence that

japanese prime minister noboru takeshitas 
resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial 
fsx fighter project official sources said tuesday 
some highlevel sources suggested the end result could be a 
weaker deal for the united states or a complete unraveling of the 
plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the american f16 
takeshitas announcement that he would step down as a result of 
an influencepeddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the 
alreadytroubled fsx plan said administration and congressional 
officials all of whom declined to be identified 
the sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any 
movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor 
to takeshita takes office 
its not on the verge of being resolved now anyway said one 
administration soucre 
were continuing to try to clarify the conditions on the 
project set down a month ago by us negotiators its proven to 
be a very difficult process 
although president bush signaled general support for the joint 
venture in midmarch japanese officials balked at some of the 
conditions he stipulated including a guarantee that us 
companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet 
the united states also wants assurances that any new technology 
developed from the project would be available to the united states 
along with protection for usdeveloped computer codes that help 
fly and control the plane 
the agreement to codevelop the fsx which stands for fighter 
support experimental was negotiated late last year between 
takeshitas government and the outgoing reagan adminstration 
under the agreement general dynamics corp would build the 
upgraded f16 with japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
the plan encountered stiff opposition in the 
democraticcontrolled congress where critics have called it a 7 
billion giveaway of high technology to japan suggesting the 
united states would get little in return 
takeshitas resignation will make it harder to deal with the 
issue said rep richard gephardt dmo 
i think the position of the japanese will be that because 
theyre in a difficult circumstance they cant give as much as 
they might have on fsx gephardt said in an interview 
he also said that the japanese government might use the current 
political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking us 
concessions in other usjapanese trade disputes 
proponents of the fsx project claim it represents a way to add 
fighters to japans inventory in strategic northeast asia at its 
own expense and would give the united states access to 
sophisticated radar technology developedby mitsubishi 
one congressional source involved in trade issues said that any 
further delay in the project now would let japan strengthen its 
negotiating hand 
japans final response on the fsx clearly had to be signed off 
on by the prime minister but there was divided counsel in japan on 
the terms and he takeshita obviously has been preoccupied this 
will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade 
hardball 
any effort by japan to demand further concessions from the 
united states could jeopardize a project that already has thin 
support in congress possibly torpedoing the plan entirely said 
both administration and congressional sources 
traveling with bush in california presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater was asked what impact takeshitas resignation might have 
on the fsx project we dont really know how it might affect that 
deal he said 
asked if the white house still favored moving ahead with the 
agreement with the new qualifications fitzwater said our 
position is the same we still hope so

the us postal service slashed its price for 
international express mail tuesday in an effort to increase its 
share of the business 
assistant postmaster general peter k eichorn announced that the 
rate for express mail packages of a halfpound or less will be 
1075 effective july 1 
until july 1 the agency will handle those envelopes for what he 
termed an introductory price of 875 each 
currently international express mail up to onehalf pound costs 
13 to canada 15 to great britain and 18 to the nearly 100 other 
nations where the high speed service is available 
eichhorn said that the service which delivers parcels in one to 
three days is profitable for the postal service and he expected 
the agency to do even better as volume increases 
while lengthy complex procedures are required for the postal 
service to alter its rates for domestic mail it has the latitude 
to change international rates 
the postal service carries about 74 percent of the 30 million 
international express parcels sent annually eichorn said he 
predicted that volume will rise substantially with the new rates 
international express mail is primarily used by businesses 
although eichorn said the lower rates will also bring it within 
reach of individual consumers 
when expedited international mail was first offered in 1971 the 
rate was 30 plus 1 per ounce 
the decision was immediately criticized by ups a competitor 
ups spokesman bob kenney said todays announcement by the 
postal service that it is reducing the rate on its international 
express mail overnight letter to 875 and then to 1075 is 
another incredible example of a marketing strategy designed solely 
to maximize postal volume at the expense of private enterprise 
competitors 
how could any company faced with rising costs and 
disappointing productivity levels as the postal service is 
justify a rate cut of more than 50 per cent the answer is simply 
that this service offering is not based on usps cost factors

an investment group controlled by canadian real 
estate mogul george mann applied tuesday for permission from 
federal regulators to acquire more than 50 percent of dunkin 
donuts inc 
kingsbridge capital group said in the filing with the federal 
trade commission that it has already bought 76 percent of the 
stock in the doughnut maker which owns or franchises more than 
1780 shops 
kingsbridge announced april 20 that it had acquired 66 percent 
of dunkin donuts and might seek control over the randolph 
massbased company which reported earnings of 135 million on 
sales of 1128 million last year 
the group still has not decided whether to launch a takeover 
bid spokesman eric w evans said tuesday 
what were seeking is approval to acquire up to 100 percent 
of dunkin donuts but that doesnt mean were going to do it 
he said 
dunkin donuts vice president richard n hart jr said it would 
vigorously resist any takeover attempt 
kingsbridge capital group is a torontobased merchant bank owned 
by unicorp canada corp the 15th largest company in canada with 
assets of 59 billion canadian dollars unicorp is controlled by 
mann its chairman who owns about 25 percent of its total stock 
and 68 percent of its voting shares 
under us antitrust laws investors must apply for permission 
to buy more than 15 million or 15 percent of the stock in large 
publicly held companies 
kingsbridges purchases so far total just under 15 million and 
evans said the group would like to exceed that figure but he said 
there is no current intention to acquire more than 15 percent 
of dunkin donuts the threshhold that would trigger antitakeover 
defenses 
dunkin donuts moved quickly after last weeks announcement to 
shore up those defenses setting up both a poison pill 
shareholder rights plan and an employee stock ownership plan 
the poison pill would give stockholders an automatic right to 
purchase additional shares in the event of a takeover 
significantly boosting the cost to the buyer 
the esop would put 11 million shares or about 167 percent of 
the total outstanding into the hands of workers hart said dunkin 
donuts has begun buying back an equal number of its shares 
purchasing 300000 so far this year 
in addition hart said dunkin donuts laid off 80 of its 560 
employees last friday as part of a continuing reorganization that 
began before the kingsbridge announcement people who work in the 
stores are employees of the individual franchise owners not the 
company

a federal judge on tuesday approved a 764000 
settlement of criminal charges against the cordis corp after the 
miamibased company pleaded guilty to selling faulty pacemakers 
from 1983 to 1985 
last october us district judge stanley marcus refused to 
accept fines and court costs totaling 264000 saying the amount 
was not commensurate with the crime charged 
but on tuesday he agreed to the new plea bargain after 
prosecutors added a 500000 count 
four former cordis officers are set to go on trial here in 
september on an indictment in the case but the case tuesday 
involved the company itself which was charged separately with 12 
felony and 13 misdemeanor counts the company sold the pacemaker 
division in 1987 
last month in washington cordis also agreed to pay 5 million 
in civil penalties levied by the veterans administration and the 
us health and human services department 
as far as the company is concerned the issue is behind us 
cordis spokesman chick mcdowell said after tuesdays hearing 
cordis was accused of selling 2200 defective pacemakers and 
6000 batteries prone to corrosion from december 1983 to october 
1985 
the us food and drug administration said the pacemakers could 
have stopped without warning although no deaths were attributed to 
failure of the devices which are implanted under the skin to 
regulate the heartbeat the charges said company officials knew of 
the problems but sold the pacemakers anyway 
cordis sold its pacemaker business to the australian medical 
device manufacturer telectronics cordis now concentrates on making 
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for 
monitoring pressure on the brain 
the company reported a loss of 561 million in 1987 but a 
major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation 
brought the company a profit in 1988 of 24 million on sales of 
132 million

military regime has had little success curbing budget deficits 
spurring economic growth and making payments on argentinas
