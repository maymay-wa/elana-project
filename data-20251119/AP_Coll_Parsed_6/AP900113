the scales of justice tipped against a 
350pound man who had claimed he was fired from his fastfood 
restaurant job for being too fat 
a us district judge on thursday rejected ted s mounts claim 
of discrimination by long john silvers inc and his request for 
205000 in damages 
mounts 37 said his obesity was a medical problem and therefore 
a physical handicap federal and state laws prohibit employment 
discrimination on the basis of race sex nationality religion and 
physical handicaps 
but judge charles haden said it would require some quantum 
leaps of logic to accept the discrimination argument attorneys 
for the restaurant where mounts worked for 12 years said he was 
fired in 1987 for incompetence not size 
mounts claimed that company officials harassed embarrassed 
and humiliated him because of his weight he was never 
reprimanded for his job performance but every written evaluation 
he received from 1980 to 1986 mentioned his size he said 
it was always an unwritten rule there that being big was 
bad mounts said they say i dont look professional being 
overweight 
mounts said he is unemployed and receives social security and 
state workers compensation benefits 
im not really happy about the decision but maybe it will 
encourage others in my situation to stand up and not be afraid of 
the big guy mounts said

the crumbling of communism is sweet vindication 
for soviet dissident natan sharansky who was whisked through the 
berlin wall in a 1986 prisoner exchange after languishing for nine 
years in the gulags 
the events of the last year were the realization of our 
wildest dreams there is such a hole in this iron wall that nobody 
can ever rebuild it again sharansky said there is no question 
communist ideology has failed and some of the most fascinating 
changes are happening in our lifetime 
sharansky 41 personifies the struggle of soviet jews for human 
rights and freer emigration he begins his first us lecture tour 
with a speech tuesday at the university of california at davis 
in an hourlong interview here sharansky said dissidents should 
get credit for forcing president mikhail gorbachev to restructure 
the soviet system he also said antisemitism in the soviet union 
is getting stronger as communisms grip weakens and is fueling an 
exodus of jews to israel 
for sharansky the breakdown of the old order in the soviet bloc 
was the most exciting moment since his release from prison after 
serving nine years of a 13year sentence for spying a charge that 
he denied 
we dissidents had such deep beliefs in our hearts that sooner 
or later this system had to become bankrupt morally socially 
economically and politically nobody could expect it to go so 
quickly he said 
i told my wife that that by the time our youngest daughter 
grew one tooth two more dictators in eastern europe had fallen 
down said sharansky who lives in israel with his wife and two 
daughters 
sharansky was at first denied permission to leave the soviet 
union although his wife avital was allowed to leave a day after 
they were married in 1974 she worked tirelessly for his freedom 
meeting with president reagan to plead his case reagan and 
gorbachev arranged for his release at a summit meeting and 
sharansky passed to freedom across glienicke bridge to west berlin 
on a frozen feb 11 1986 
sharansky recounted the horrors of soviet prisons in his 1988 
book fear no evil published by random house he plans about 10 
lectures a year to talk about who is responsible for soviet 
restructuring 
the soviet dissidents and their supporters in the west are the 
midwives of glasnost and perestroika sharansky said cautioning 
against the lionization of gorbachev as a champion of democracy 
gorbachev is a loyal communist his aim was to save the 
communist system by changing it he deserves credit for one thing 
he was the first soviet leader to say that communism would lose to 
capitalism if urgent changes werent made in the economy 
sharansky also said there are dissidents still in soviet 
prisons who were jailed for saying the same things as gorbachev 
sharansky was a comrade of soviet dissident and nobel 
prizewinning physicist andrei sakharov but was denied permission 
to visit the soviet union for sakharovs funeral in december 
sharansky who has a street marker in new york named after him 
dropped his soviet name anatoly to use his hebrew name natan 
when he entered israel 
as chairman of the soviet jewry zionist forum he helps soviet 
jews find housing and jobs 
we are seeing the biggest exodus of jews in modern history 
they are afraid to stay in the soviet union because of 
antisemitism its absolutely inevitable this exodus will 
continue sharansky said there is practically no place for 
jews in the soviet union in the future

a judge on friday threw out all charges 
against a couple accused of kidnapping their adult daughter in a 
failed deprogramming attempt saying a jury never would be able to 
reach any kind of verdict 
superior court judge david moon jrs ruling came a day after he 
declared a mistrial because a jury had been deadlocked on kidnap 
false imprisonment and battery charges against earle and dorothy 
brown both 58 of santa cruz 
the browns and three codefendants were charged with abducting 
ginger brown from a northern san diego county parking lot in may 
1988 and holding her for five days in an attempt to deprogram her 
ginger brown then 22 had joined a small religious group called 
great among nations which her parents say is a cult whose leader 
benjamin altschul brainwashes his followers 
also charged in the case were the browns other daughter holly 
brown 25 of san francisco los angeles deprogrammer cliff 
daniels 35 and his accomplice hank erler 23 of escondido 
a jury on wednesday had returned seven acquittals against the 
defendants but deadlocked on remaining charges 
the judge said that any further court proceedings would not be 
worth the time and expense he said the jury was unwilling to 
convict the defendants even though some of them incriminated 
themselves during testimony 
this judge is not going to let the peoples courtroom be used 
to titillate the publics fascination with unusual religious 
groups he said 
earle brown said he was delighted by the rulings and said he now 
wanted his daughter back 
weve since forgiven her if there is animosity toward us on 
her part we might apologize but i dont know what we might 
apologize for to the group we will still continue to pray for 
her he said 
ginger brown who remains a part of the religious group said 
she was not disappointed with the ruling and planned to drop a 25 
million civil suit against her parents and the other defendants 
i didnt lose anything other than the strong binding i had 
with my family that deprogrammer cliff daniels has been 
successful in wedging apart she said 
i hope they come to me and apologize come to all the members 
of my church and apologize and especially to my pastor and 
apologize for this slanderous way in which they have portrayed our 
ministry she said 
altschul has described his group as a television ministry that 
hopes to produce and sell programs to television stations worldwide

the energy department under pressure from 
environmental critics will give the public a chance to review how 
its plans to clean up and rebuild the nations nuclear weapons 
complex will affect the environment 
the announcement friday by energy secretary james d watkins 
came nearly seven months after 22 environmental and arms control 
groups sued the department to force such a review 
the significance of it is that it would be the first 
comprehensive and public analysis of the whole weapons program 
said dan reicher an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council one of the environmental groups that sued 
reicher said allowing the public to participate in the planning 
could lead to significant changes in the future emphasis of the 
multibillion dollar weapons program 
it could very well shift the direction of the program away 
from modernization and toward cleanup he said 
watkins also won applause from capitol hill 
the departments decision today may mean that the bomb 
factories iron curtain of secrecy is lifting said rep les 
aucoin dore one of several members of congress who 13 months 
ago requested the environmental reviews 
many environmental groups including reichers have argued the 
government should spend more to clean up the trail of hazardous and 
radioactive wastes generated by weapons plants many of the 17 
major plants and laboratories in 12 states were built in the late 
1940s or early 1950s and operated for decades in a dome of secrecy 
that permitted environmental abuses 
watkins also announced friday he was sending independent teams 
of environmental specialists to five weapons plants or laboratories 
to study their compliance with federal and state environmental laws 
as well as health and safety rules 
the five plants are the savannah river site near aiken sc 
which makes materials for nuclear warheads the pinellas weapons 
components plant near largo fla the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory at livermore calif which performs research and 
testing of weapons designs the brookhaven nuclear research 
laboratory at upton ny and the sandia nuclear weapons 
laboratory at livermore 
watkins has been trying to reassure the public his department is 
committed to developing a longrange plan for cleaning up nuclear 
wastes but he also wants to spend billions of dollars rebuilding 
key parts of the weapons complex 
in his announcement watkins said the department would prepare 
an environmental impact statement on its recently published 
fiveyear plan for cleaning up the weapons plants he said the 
report will evaluate alternative approaches to resolving the waste 
problem including treatment storage and disposal options 
he said an environmental impact statement on longterm plans for 
modernizing the weapons production system also is planned although 
the department has not released details of a modernization plan 
catherine kaliniak a department spokeswoman said an internal 
assessment of modernization priorities will be completed in a few 
months 
watkins said public hearings would be held as part of the 
environmental studies and the results would be used as a 
planning tool to guide decision making 
preparation of these major environmental documents with 
opportunities for full public participation in the process will 
assure environmentally informed decision making he said

us computer companies are dropping plans for a 
cooperative venture to challenge japanese leadership in the making 
of computer memory chips according to published reports 
the proposed venture us memories failed to attract enough 
investors according to reports in saturdays editions of the new 
york times and the washington post citing sources in the computer 
industry 
the plan called for building a 1 billion factory to make 
computer memory chips using money donated by at least seven 
computer and semiconductor companies 
sanford l kane the president of us memories told the times 
that he was frustrated by his failure to persuade computer 
companies to sign up for the venture 
one can only bang their head against the wall for so long 
sooner or later you get a headache he told the times he refused 
to comment directly on the reports that the cooperative venture was 
dead 
us memories was announced in june as a project to restore 
american strength in production of the common computer memory chips 
known as dynamic random access memory chips or drams by november 
however several major computer companies including sun 
microsystems inc unisys corp apple computer inc and tandy 
corp had said they would not join as investors 
japanese firms supply a majority of the memory chips now 
available most american chip manufacturers dropped out of the 
market several years ago 
computer industry officials told the times that the end of us 
memories was decided wednesday at a meeting in dallas attended by 
the seven firms that had signed up and other firms still 
considering entering the venture 
the times said the project failed in part because the memory 
chips have become more widely available as samsung of south korea 
siemens ag of west germany and motorola inc of the united states 
have begun manufacturing the chips

the internal revenue service is toughening 
rules of conduct for senior employees following highly publicized 
allegations of misconduct by some field managers 
the aim said irs commissioner fred goldberg is to protect 
what is the bedrock of our tax system and that is the real and 
perceived integrity of this institution 
what we need is ongoing attention and adherence to the kinds 
of issues of conduct ethics and appearance that are essential to 
tax administration goldberg said friday in announcing the ethics 
initiative 
goldberg acted after congressional hearings last summer in which 
managers and other top officials of some field offices were accused 
of abusing power favoring friends and operating almost 
independently of directives from the agencys washington 
headquarters 
this is an agency of 120000 employees and we will rise or 
fall on the kinds of procedures the kinds of controls we have 
in place that minimize to the absolute extent possible incidents 
that create either the appearance or reality of illegality 
misjudgment or misconduct goldberg said 
the initiative was hailed by rep douglas barnard dga 
chairman of the house government operations consumer subcommittee 
which conducted a twoyear investigation of the allegations and 
held public hearings last year 
if that plan is properly implemented it will go a long way 
toward solving some extremely serious employee misconduct and 
morale problems at the service barnard said 
in order for our selfassessment tax system to work properly 
the public must be confident that senior irs employees are 
respectful of taxpayer rights and educated to exercising their 
responsibilities fairly as well as effectively barnard said 
in announcing the plan goldberg disclosed the irs has suspended 
at least temporarily a lockbox setup roundly criticized during 
barnards hearings that some have interpreted as an amnesty 
program for tax cheats 
the irs will be trying to clarify what if anything we want to 
do with the lockbox procedure goldberg said he denied that the 
procedure is necessarily an amnesty but acknowledged it could be 
interpreted as such 
the procedure was authorized by ronald saranow then head of the 
irs criminal investigation division in los angeles delinquent 
taxpayers represented by a lawyer friend of saranow could while 
keeping their identities secret make cash payments to a lockbox 
and receive an irs letter saying they would not be the subject of a 
criminal investigation unless their evasion arose from illegal 
activities 
in discussing the ethics initiative goldberg refused to answer 
questions about the most widely publicized allegation at the 
barnard hearings a charge that an irs executive launched an 
investigation of the manufacturers of jordache jeans because of his 
relationship with the competing makers of guess jeans 
in that probe the irs raided jordaches new york offices and 
seized one million documents the company has not been charged 
the new ethics program announced by goldberg includes 
an agreement under which the treasury department inspector 
general will investigate allegations against senior irs managers 
and all employees of the irs inspection division employees in that 
division operate as the internal affairs branch of irs 
an inspection hotline to give irs field employees a direct 
line to washington headquarters when they dont feel comfortable 
complaining to local officials 
reversal of an earlier decision under which local office 
managers can approve their own travel vouchers 
removing any ambiguity from regulations on investments by irs 
employees 
ensuring that every training program for irs employees includes 
emphasis on ethics and conduct

president bush described as pretty broken 
up by a meeting with the family of a soldier slain in panama is 
using the invasion to argue that the united states must keep a high 
state of military readiness 
this is not a time when we should naively cut the muscle out 
of our defense posture bush said friday in a speech aimed at 
congress which reconvenes jan 23 after its winter recess 
bush cautioned that despite a relaxation of military tensions in 
eastern europe lawmakers should not expect a peace dividend in 
which defense savings could be funnelled into domestic programs 
unfortunately what is being packaged as a dividend is not 
money in the bank it is more like a possible future inheritance 
bush said in his speech to the cincinnati chamber of commerce 
whenever a potential inheritance looms there are those eager 
to rush out and squander it to buy new things to spend spend 
spend spending funds they dont yet have he said 
bush went to camp david after the ohio trip and planned to spend 
a threeday weekend at the presidential retreat in maryland 
he told the business audience the dec 20 us intervention in 
panama was a beautifully coordinated operation if a rationale 
for keeping a strong defense is ever needed we saw it last month 
in the courage of our troops in panama he said 
but later bush was brought close to tears in a meeting with the 
cincinnati parents of a army pfc james markwell a ranger medic 
killed in the invasion aides said 
markwell who had been in the army 18 months died of gunfire 
after his arrival by parachute in a drop zone on the day of the 
us invasion 
bush met after the speech with mr and mrs william rouse 
markwells mother and stepfather 
markwells brother brandon 17 and his sister dawn 15 were 
also present said bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
it was a pretty emotional meeting said fitzwater who was 
present at the session along with deputy chief of staff andrew 
card jr and several secret service agents 
he said bush was touched when mrs rouse produced a poem her son 
wrote at age 15 about his desire to be a solider it was very 
sad fitzwater said 
then the mother produced a death letter her son wrote before 
entering combat each ranger writes such a letter and it is 
delivered only if the soldier is killed fitzwater said 
in the letter he talked about how he was proud of what he was 
doing fitzwater said it also contained a little message for 
each of the people he knew in life the aide said 
all of us were pretty broken up at that point fitzwater 
said 
bush has written personal letters to the families of all 23 us 
soldiers killed in the invasion but it was his first facetoface 
meeting with one of the families fitzwater said 
bush visited us servicemen wounded in the invasion on new 
years eve in two military hospitals in san antonio texas he 
mentioned that visit in his chamber of commerce speech saying i 
will never ever forget their spirit 
the panamanian operation was conducted by highly trained 
troops the best trained troops in the world but it is not simply 
training it is patriotism and dedication he said 
bush said he welcomed the dynamic changes in eastern europe 
and strongly supported soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs efforts 
at political reform 
the president also told his audience of about 1500 people that 
key parts of his domestic agenda including a cut in the capital 
gains tax stronger clean air standards and education and 
anticrime programs were bogged down in the jungles of capitol 
hill 
the clock is running and americas patience is running out 
he said 
at cincinnatis predominantly black taft high school bush also 
hailed a program of business leaders government officials and 
educators to reduce dropouts and improve academic performance 
and borrowing a line from 1988 democratic presidential 
contender jesse jackson bush told the students i dont think 
you can design a curriculum to lift the selfesteem of a kid its 
got to come from peers from family from dedicated volunteers who 
are saying you are somebody

britains best ballet dancers are threatening to 
strike over pay and working conditions raising the prospect of a 
picket line outside the venerable royal opera house in covent 
garden 
the dispute had dragged on since july and now threatens the 
cancellation of three ballets it also has disrupted the first 
joint production of the royal opera and royal ballet the russian 
opera prince igor which has a 25minute ballet 
richard wright the royal opera administrator said friday that 
after two days talks with equity the performers labor union a 
revised offer would be made monday to the 136 dancers of the royal 
ballet and the sadlers wells royal ballet both share the royal 
opera house with the royal opera 
the opera house at first offered a 10 percent pay increase to 
the dancers demand for 15 percent the house gradually raised its 
offer to 15 percent but only in return for more hours of work and 
agreement to allow two productions a year to be shown on a screen 
to nonpaying crowds in the covent garden piazza 
the dancers are likely to go on saying no 
the dispute broke friday into frontpage caricature 
cartoonist matt of the conservative daily telegraph playing on 
a pay dispute at ford of britain auto plants showed one ford 
assemblyline worker saying to another i hope we dont go on 
strike i dont want people thinking im a ballet dancer 
the dancers want salaries that would close the gap with the 
higher pay of the choristers and musicians at the royal opera house 
the 15 percent offer would take the pay of senior principal 
dancers from 860 a week to 988 pay for firstyear members of the 
corps de ballet would go up from 278 to 322 for a 33hour week 
the dance dispute is really a rebellion at the 132yearold 
statesupported opera house where ballet dancers feel they have 
always been treated as poor cousins opera is definitely king at 
covent garden 
jeremy isaacs the opera house director struggling with a 5 
million deficit this year has pleaded for a quick settlement 
rebecca holmes 21 a royal ballet dancer of firstartist rank 
making 410 a week told a reporter her day usually runs from 7 
am to midnight with subway travel and having to use rehearsal 
rooms nearly six miles away from covent garden 
she said sunday is her one day off when all she does is sleep 
and eat 
the dancers say their work is tough and demanding with grueling 
rehearsals followed by evening performances their dancing careers 
will end in their mid30s 
friday also was a bad day for the royal ballet on another front 
anthony dowell the director said it had been forced to abandon 
talks with new yorks metropolitan opera association for a 
longplanned tour to the united states in july because it could not 
find sponsors 
i am very disappointed that the tour will not take place 
dowell said we were eagerly looking forward to a return visit to 
the metropolitan opera and to our american public

believing this one the trouser zipper that stopped a bullet 
angel santana 51 was reportedly shot with a 357caliber 
magnum pistol friday during a struggle with one of three men 
holding up the store where he worked 
the robbers were so shocked to see the bullet lodged in 
santanas zipper that they fled and dropped their gun said 
officer fred weiner a police spokesman 
maybe they thought they were outnumbered by the zipper 
weiner said adding that while the story was kind of hard to 
believe it was doublechecked by officers the gun and the spent 
bullet were found in the store he said

its as though the folks over there in the epa building dont 
even know that we have this treaty with canada said mark van 
putten director of the national wildlife federations great lakes 
natural resources center 
an epa official said the bush administration shares the 
environmentalists goals but added that implementing the agreement 
will take time 
because the problem is so big and complex and there are so 
many players involved things do not move with the speed of 
light said frank covington deputy administrator in the agencys 
chicago office headquarters of the epas great lakes program 
covington said epa has focused its attention on provisions added 
to the agreement in 1987 when the emphasis shifted to 40 hot 
spots where toxic pollution is especially severe the agency has 
been helping states develop plans for cleaning those areas he said 
signed in 1972 renewed in 1978 and updated two years ago the 
bilateral accord pledges the us and canadian governments to 
cooperate with each other in ridding the great lakes of toxic 
substances 
central to the pact is a pledge that toxic discharges into the 
waters be virtually eliminated 
there have been improvements since 1972 including cutbacks in 
the discharge of pollutants directly into the lakes ms griffin 
said but little has been done about toxins such as contaminated 
rainwater and runoff from farms city streets hazardous waste 
dumps and contaminated sediments she said 
numerous scientific studies have concluded the lake pollution is 
entering the food chain posing a health threat the 
environmentalists letter said 
researchers believe the atmosphere is the source of 25 percent 
of all toxins in the lakes ms griffin said yet the epa has 
regulated only seven of hundreds of toxic air pollutants she 
complained 
pesticides and phosphorus flow into the lakes from farm runoff 
and urban runoff contains heavy metals such as copper and lead 
said diane cameron an environmental engineer with the natural 
resources defense council 
the agreement calls for programs to collect and treat runoff 
which neither country has done adequately ms cameron said they 
also are failing to protect wetlands and continue to allow 
developers to construct buildings too close to lake shores 
worsening the runoff problem she said 
van putten said state and local governments in the great lakes 
region have added top the problem by engaging in a conspiracy of 
silence on covering up violations of regulations 
michigan is unwilling to publicly criticize wisconsin because 
wisconsin might later criticize michigan and epa has been 
unwilling to step in and force the states to make the progress 
required under the agreement he said

federal authorities used a stinger to lure four 
suspected irish republican army guerrillas into a sting operation 
in which they offered 50000 for the missile that can shoot an 
airliner out of the sky 
the four men were arrested friday after going to a warehouse in 
the west palm beach area to buy the heatseeking missile from 
agents posing as arms dealers who told the suspects the weaponry 
was stolen from the us military said william gavin who heads 
the fbi in south florida 
they made it very clear they were interested in procuring 
stinger missiles and high explosives and they intended to ship 
them out of the country gavin said at a news conference 
kevin joseph mckinley 33 seamus moley 30 and joseph 
mccolgan 39 all irish nationals and sean john mccann 34 of 
canada are believed to be members of the provisional ira or 
provos the guerrilla arm of the nationalist group fighting to 
end british rule in northern ireland 
each suspect was charged with conspiracy to possess destructive 
arms possession of a destructive device and violations of the arms 
export control act and the neutrality law each faces up to 25 
years in prison and 750000 in fines if convicted the fbi said 
the suspects denied the charges as they were led in handcuffs 
from the federal courthouse to the palm beach county jail where 
they were being held without bond pending a hearing tuesday 
im just a poor irishman here on holiday and i was entrapped 
by certain people here mccolgan said in a thick irish accent 
they were going to sell equipment for the irish republican 
struggle mccolgan added with a smile they wanted to sell us 
missiles imagine that 
their capture concluded a twomonth joint undercover 
investigation by the fbi the us customs service and the federal 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the investigation began after the fbi received intelligence that 
the men who had been staying in a riviera beach trailer park were 
looking to buy weapons agents said 
in a series of meetings the suspects told the agents about 
terrorist activities to persuade them that they were serious about 
buying the stinger officials said 
when they met with our undercover agents they described in 
detail events which occurred outside of the country which did 
occur and we believed absolutely they were involved said 
special agent robert creighton regional atf supervisor he 
provided no details about the events discussed by the men 
the suspected guerrillas went to the undisclosed warehouse 
friday to inspect the stinger which was on loan from the us 
military and allegedly paid 50000 for its purchase creighton 
said 
if this was fired at an airliner it could blow it right out of 
the sky said timothy wagner head of the us customs service in 
florida 
the stinger uses an infrared homing device to target the heat 
generated by the engine of an attacking plane or helicopter it has 
proved highly effective against lowflying aircraft stingers that 
the united states provided to the afghan rebels reportedly caused 
heavy losses to soviet warplanes and helicopters 
fired from a tube held on the shoulder the stinger vaguely 
resembles the world war ii bazooka it has a range of about three 
miles is about 5 feet long weighs 345 pounds and carries a 
fragmentation warhead 
in a previous operation against ira arms procurements in the 
united states authorities arrested three ira technical experts 
in massachusetts new hampshire and pennyslvania on july 12 and 
seized radar and missile parts 
a federal grand jury in boston indicted five people in the case 
on charges of violating federal arms export regulations

a group of prominent scientists including 
five nobel prize winners wants the super collider built as 
originally envisioned even though the cost of the giant particle 
accelerator could rise by more than 1 billion 
the energy departments high energy physics advisory panel 
agreed friday with a subcommittees findings that significantly 
reducing the size or power of the collider to contain costs would 
unacceptably increase the risk of missing important new physics 
the panel said it was told that keeping the texas project as 
originally envisioned however could increase the 59 billion 
pricetag by 20 percent to 30 percent 
as designed the super collider will smash beams of protons into 
each other in a 53mile circular tunnel at 20 times the energy 
possible with the most powerful existing accelerators 
it would take a reduction of beam energy of 25 percent to hold 
costs to the original figure the advisory panels report said 
but it said the projects mission to learn more about such 
issues as the origin of mass the best efforts of theoretical 
physicists indicate the original energy is about the minimum 
energy needed to have confidence that these phenomena in whatever 
form they may take will be seen 
a 25 percent reduction in beam energy means broad agreement 
that this confidence would be lost the report said 
a decision on collider spending recommendations is expected from 
energy secretary james watkins later this month officials said 
the collider is expected to be completed by 1998 congress last 
year approved 225 million to begin initial construction and 
president bush is expected to request about 393 million for the 
next fiscal year 
the department is reviewing cost estimates by ssc laboratory in 
desoto texas on how various design changes would affect the price 
officials of the ssc lab which contracted to build the 
accelerator at a site south of dallas recommend an increase of 
about 1 billion to keep the project essentially as it was 
envisioned in 1986 
sen phil gramm rtexas said he believes a compromise would be 
reached but would not speculate on the new cost estimate 
its important that we try not to build a cadillac gramm 
said we dont have the money and to attempt to do that would 
put us in a position where we would have no machine at all 
the subpanel said the cost increases would give new ammunition 
to capitol hill opponents of the giant machine which if completed 
will be the largest most complicated scientific instrument ever 
built 
congressional opponents of the collider fear it will draw 
resources from other scientific projects that would deliver more 
immediate payouts benefitting the nations economy and 
international competitive position 
the additional costs would have to be absorbed by us taxpayers 
or could come from foreign sources 
while some members of congress favor letting foreign sources 
provide inkind equipment and services others fear those countries 
would gain immediate technological benefits for their industries 
at us expense 
james f decker acting director of the departments office of 
energy research said the collider should provide a substantial 
new physics capability when it comes on line 
the united states should not spend this large amount of money 
for a facility that would be only marginally better than some other 
existing facility decker said

new jersey has sued exxon corp over a 
567000gallon oil spill but new york officials decided not to sue 
because the company agreed to pay for an environmental study and 
damages 
federal officals meanwhile said they were prepared to fine the 
company 10000 a day starting wednesday unless they received a 
detailed explanation of the jan 2 spill of home heating oil in the 
arthur kill shipping channel between new jersey and the new york 
city borough of staten island 
new york officials said the spill contaminated a sensitive bird 
sanctuary and the cleanup will cost millions by friday the coast 
guards tally of dead birds had risen to at least 317 with 48 
oilcovered live birds being treated 
new jersey attorney general peter perretti jr filed a civil 
lawsuit friday in elizabeth charging exxon violated the new jersey 
spill act the states water pollution control act and state common 
law 
if exxon is found liable it could be hit with fines of 50000 
per day per violation the number of alleged violations has not 
been determined perrettis office said 
the lawsuit also seeks to force exxon to pay any of the 
substantial expenses the state is incurring because of the 
spill said john hagerty a spokesman for the new jersey department 
of environmental protection 
we havent been able to put a price tag on our environment 
yet hagerty said 
exxon spokesman phil wetz said the company could not respond to 
the lawsuit because its attorneys have not reviewed it 
meetings between new york and exxon officials led to a 
lastminute agreement to try to settle differences out of court 
in a letter to exxon officials wednesday new york attorney 
general robert abrams threatened to sue unless the company admitted 
its liability and paid for the cleanup 
abrams charged that exxon had created a minialaska in the 
arthur kill exxon has been criticized for its handling of the 
march 28 spill of about 10 million gallons of crude oil from the 
grounded exxon valdez tanker in alaska the nations largest oil 
spill 
abrams also said the arthur kill spill has contaminated 
critical waterfowl feeding and wetland areas of the 
environmentally sensitive pralls island bird sanctuary 
in response to abrams letter exxon said it will pay for 
appropriate environmental studies of its oil spill but that it 
has accepted responsibility only for damages for which it is 
liable 
carol ash regional director of the new york state department of 
environmental conservation said cleanup and restoration of the 
area will run into the millions of dollars 
ash said exxon agreed that new yorks environmental agency will 
oversee damage assessment and the company will not participate in 
determining the extent of the damage 
in new jersey hagerty said exxon has neither agreed nor refused 
to pay the bill 
the federal environmental protection agency meanwhile has 
given exxon until wednesday to explain how the spill occurred what 
the companys response was to protect the environment and what is 
being done to restore the environment the agency threatened fines 
of 10000 a day 
the response from exxon wasnt what we would have liked 
said epa spokeswoman kim helper in new york 
helper said her agency was particularly concerned that exxon 
initially estimated only 5000 gallons of oil had spilled 
when you hear about a 5000gallon spill you respond one way 
when you hear about a 500000gallon spill you react another way 
she said 
wetz the exxon spokesman said the company would have no 
comment on the threatened fines

romanians flush with the success of 
their uprising against nicolae ceausescu now face the formidable 
task of repairing the ravaged economy that is the former communist 
dictators legacy 
romanian economists and western experts say ceausescu severely 
restrained the economy by exporting goods needed at home and 
blocking imports that could have modernized the countrys 
antiquated industries 
the harsh program managed to pay off a 105 billion foreign 
debt but it also left romanian homes cold and people with only 
basic staples to eat 
how could one man do more than an economic tornado asked 
mircea pirjol spokesman for the provisional governments economy 
ministry 
for one romanias once healthy export trade in lathes has 
disappeared because the makers could not import modern calibration 
equipment said eugen dijmarescu a researcher at bucharests 
institute for world economy 
ironically the lack of foreign debt and the low production 
costs fostered by ceausescus policies could help revive the 
economy 
the dictator ousted dec 22 and executed three days later was 
replaced by an interim government headed by the national salvation 
front which plans to hold free elections as early as april 
the countrys immediate need is for help in providing food and 
heating for romanias 23 million people during the long harsh 
winter the soviet union already has promised fuel oil and the 
united states and france have said they are working on aid programs 
pirjol says economists trying to solve longrange problems must 
first find out exactly where the country stands since most economic 
statistics from ceausescus 24 years in power cannot be trusted 
asked about production figures pirjol replied god knows all 
the economic data was falsified 
one example is grain production before ceausescu was toppled 
dec 22 the government reported a 1989 harvest of 60 million tons 
the provisional government recently said the real figure was 169 
million tons 
dijmarescu said industrial production figures were just as 
uncertain 
last year ceausescu said that onethird of industrial capacity 
was not properly employed if he said that you can imagine the 
problem is much greater said dijmarescu whose private institute 
has been hired by the goverment to help plan romanias economic 
future 
a western diplomatic source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity estimated that less than 5 percent of romanias industry 
was working at capacity 
dijmarescu said that not all romanias economic problems could 
be blamed on ceausescu 
communist policies before his time devastated the oncerich farm 
economy by driving peasants into cities for jobs in industry and 
collectivizing what had been profitable small farms 
but ceausescu held to his policy of expanding heavy industry and 
developing grandiose projects when other east bloc countries 
recognized the need for new trade policies 
for the past five years 60 percent of the countrys meat was 
sent abroad homes and factories were kept cold and dimly lighted 
so petroleum products could be exported 
at the same time virtually all imports were blocked 
this did more than leave consumers crying for western goods it 
denied modern technology to factories and meant romanian goods were 
without the imported components that could have made them saleable 
ceausescu announced last april that romania had succeeded in 
wiping out the 1982 foreign debt of 105 billion but he did not 
withdraw austerity measures perhaps raising the public anger that 
brought his downfall in fact food rationing was expanded in 
october 
dijmarescu says the first needs are to revive agriculture and 
upgrade industrial technology 
for years people in this county have been in a black hole in 
terms of knowledge he said we need an inflow of economic and 
scientific information we need to train people to manage a market 
economy 
the western diplomatic source said it will not be possible to 
privatize some of romanias huge heavy industries for years 
one of the countrys assets could be its agriculture already 
being pushed by a decision of the interim government to give land 
to peasants another plus could be light industry such as 
textiles and shoes if technology in factories can be upgraded 
quickly 
dijmarescu warned that romania will have to avoid economic 
shocks that could lead to social tensions he noted that one dated 
heavy equipment factory has 20000 workers and added you cant 
just close down a factory with that many employees

police in three states knew about the 
nomadic life in tents the code words camouflage clothing and 
cultish worship services of jeffrey lundgren and his followers 
but they could find no reason to arrest anyone until it was too 
late nine months after a family of five had been killed possibly 
as a sacrifice in a misbegotten reading of mormon teachings 
for more than a year agents in missouri ohio and west virginia 
exchanged information about the cult authorities said but they 
were hardpressed to build a case 
in fact lundgren and his clan seemd like good neighbors making 
improvements on the farm they rented near this northeast ohio town 
25 miles east of cleveland said kirtland police chief dennis 
yarborough 
the family had started adding things like siding yarborough 
said they were acting and appearing like good citizens it was 
kind of a paradox 
on jan 3 and 4 acting on an anonymous tip federal and local 
officials dug under a barn on the farm and found the bodies of 
dennis avery 49 his wife cheryl 42 and their three daughters 
trina 15 rebecca 13 and karen 7 
the lake county coroners office said all five had been bound 
hand and foot with duct tape with tape covering their mouths and 
eyes and shot one at a time 
investigators said the averys who lived nearby had been 
members of the cult but were not as fervent as some of the other 
followers 
last week the 39yearold lundgren a former lay minister of 
the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints was 
arrested with his wife teenage son and 10 other followers in 
scattered cities mostly around san diego 
yarborough said friday there was speculation that lundgren felt 
people had to die as part of a cleansing ritual so the cult 
could relocate in the wilderness 
the rev dale luffman pastor of kirtlands reorganized church 
has theorized the killings stemmed from fights over money sex or 
the possibility the averys would leave the cult 
lundgren came to kirtland from the independence mo area in 
1984 to work as a tour guide at a mormon temple used by the 
reorganized church 
the reorganized church based in independence split in the last 
century from the church of jesus christ of latterday saints the 
mormon church which is based in salt lake city both churches 
remain rooted in the book of mormon and in the writings of founder 
joseph smith 
luffman said lundgren at first seemed devoted enough in his 
tours and his sundayschool teachings but later became menacing 
he apparently felt the leaders of the church were part of the 
unrighteous around the temple and needed to be eradicated that 
was the term he used luffman said 
lundgren began seeing himself as a prophet using his lay 
ministry and tour job as forums to recruit followers luffman said 
the church defrocked him in january 1988 but he was able to 
find a dozen or more people who listened some came to kirtland at 
his urging from the independence church he had attended the 
followers quit jobs and sold their belongings cheap to make the 
move bewildered friends said 
the followers moved in with lundgren on the farm living commune 
style turning over their paychecks from outside employment and 
letting him read their mail and listen in on their telephone calls 
police said 
the group fit the classic description of a cult luffman said 
they acknowledge and take their direction and allegiance to a 
leader with an authorized message second there takes place a 
separation from all other groups friends and family he said 
the kansas city office of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms at one point warned kirtland authorities that lundgren 
had spoken of a sword of laban that would be used to decapitate 
people while taking over the temple in kirtland there is 
mention of a sword of laban in the book of mormon 
eventually male cult members started wearing camouflage 
clothing and paramilitary gear practicing with guns and other 
weapons and adopting code names such as eagle eye and 
talon1 authorities said 
yarborough said that in april 1988 he heard reports of 
paramilitary activities and threats against other people 
authorities investigated the reports but pressed no charges 
the group left the kirtland area in april 1989 and showed up in 
davis wva a rugged coalmining area where they camped out in 
tents until midoctober they planted a large garden and built a 
15foot wooden bridge across a stream 
i thought gee theyre not doing anything worse than a boy 
scout group would do davis conservation officer harold spencer 
told the cleveland plain dealer 
lundgren and his followers next traveled to chilhowee mo 
where they lived in a barn said yarborough then they disbanded 
probably sometime in december investigators said

on the eve of a visit to the united states by 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani both his government and the 
leftist rebels are showing signs of moderating their policies with 
an eye on the us congress 
the state department on friday welcomed as a positive 
development a rebel announcement that they are willing to renew 
peace negotiations with the usbacked government under united 
nations auspices 
the rebels proposed a meeting within 30 days and the government 
accepted the offer but us officials noted that previous attempts 
since 1984 to negotiate a settlement have all failed 
the timing of the rebel announcement suggested an interest in 
generating good will with congress where there is some sentiment 
for scaling back on us aid commitment to the government 
some lawmakers called the aid commitment into question following 
the massacre of six jesuit priests two months ago cristiani 
blunted that criticism somewhat last weekend when he said 
elements of the armed forces were responsible for the killings 
this indicated salvadoran authorities were serious about their 
investigation nonetheless cristiani whose government is heavily 
dependent on us military and economic aid for its survival is 
expected to face tough questions from members of congress when he 
visits washington next week 
rep joe moakley dmass said friday cristiani has predicted 
the investigation into the murders of the priests will be completed 
within a week 
moakley chairman of a house task force on el salvador said the 
probe has made substantial progress but i worry that the 
possibility of a coverup remains 
those who ordered or otherwise consented to the crime must 
also be brought to justice he said 
meanwhile representatives of international organizations said 
friday that relief workers in el salvador are being harassed and 
even tortured by the military but they said cristiani seemed 
willing to end those abuses 
churches social welfare organizations trade unions and 
associations of cooperatives have had staff detained and offices 
raided ransacked and sometimes destroyed or occupied by the 
military said a statement from a sixmember delegation of the 
international council for voluntary agencies 
files and office equipment have been confiscated and 
international staff colleagues expelled said the delegation 
which just completed a threeday tour of el salvador and a visit to 
capitol hill and the state department 
the council based in geneva represents organizations involved 
in humanitarian relief and development cooperation

some investigators are leaning toward the theory 
that an elderly loner rather than an organized racist group is 
behind mail bomb attacks in three states that left a judge and an 
attorney dead 
we feel he is 50 or older is a loner and someone not known to 
associate with any of the white hate groups said fbi special 
agent charles archer of mobile ala we have no information that 
the ku klux klan or any similar groups are involved in any of the 
bombings 
but in atlanta the man who is coordinating the federal 
investigation of the bombs said the case has not yet been narrowed 
to a single suspect 
there are suspects all over the place said fbi special 
agent william hinshaw of atlanta 
early in the investigation of the december mail bombings 
authorities said it appeared an organized white supremacist group 
could be responsible a letter claimed responsibility for the 
attacks in the name of the previously unknown americans for a 
competent federal judicial system 
al adams a spokesman for the postal inspection service in 
atlanta which also is involved in the investigation said 
authorities are not close enough yet to solving the case that 
anyone can be ruled out 
but he said he believed that if a large group were involved in 
the plot at least one member by now would have come forward 
even though a white supremacist group is subject to do this 
someone would disagree with murdering a federal judge adams said 
adams said the large number of leads in the case have been 
divided among the fbi the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
and his office 
the fbi meanwhile confirmed that threatening letters have been 
sent to five judges or courts in ohio including the supreme court 
douglass ogden senior supervisor in charge of the fbis 
columbus ohio office would not say whether the letters contained 
death threats or disclose further details 
he said threats against judges are not unusual but attention 
is being a little more focused because of what is going on down 
south he said 
the bombs killed 11th us circuit court of appeals judge robert 
vance near birmingham ala and savannah ga civil rights 
attorney robert robinson bombs delivered to the 11th us circuit 
court offices in atlanta and to an naacp office in jacksonville

federal officials plan to send extra money and 
resources to new york city miami houston los angeles and almost 
the entire southwest border to fight drug trafficking according to 
administration sources 
the sources speaking to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said the metropolitan areas and border region are to be 
designated highintensity drug trafficking areas qualifying them 
for the new federal assistance 
it is unclear how much help those areas will get because of the 
designation in the current fiscal year only 25 million has been 
allocated for highintensity localities 
however that could increase by up to 21 million with money 
coming from assets seized from drug traffickers reggie walton 
associate director of the office of national drug control policy 
said last month 
an administration official who spoke friday on condition of 
anonymity said the total federal effort in the designated areas 
probably will be over 1 billion when such things as 
temporarily reassigned federal agents and military efforts along 
the border are figured in 
an updated national drug control strategy required by congress 
is expected to be announced at the end of january the original 
version was announced by president bush last september 
sources contacted by the ap friday had seen drafts of the new 
strategy which went to the white house domestic policy council on 
thursday and to bush on friday 
one source said the strategy calls for the areas around the 
actual cities to be including in the strategy to fight drugs 
when william j bennett director of the drug control office 
designated washington dc as a test case for future 
highintensity drug trafficking areas last spring leaders of 
surrounding cities and counties protested that the problems dont 
end at the capitals borders they suggested that problems could 
simply be pushed into the surrounding areas 
in addition to the metropolitan areas the new strategy 
designates 34 counties along the southwest border as highintensity 
drugtrafficking areas 
the strategy also outlines broader federal drug crimes for which 
the death penalty can be imposed in line with the changes bush 
said he wanted to make last year under the proposals the death 
penalty could be imposed on drug kingpins even when they or their 
organizations have not killed anyone 
the death penalty could be imposed if the attorney general 
approves the indictment and if on conviction the jury found 
serious aggravating factors a source said this is basically 
following through on implementing the presidents agenda vis a vis 
nasty felonious drug traffickers the source said 
interdiction efforts by the customs service and the coast guard 
will not get more money under the strategy but military 
expenditures on border control will increase from some 313 million 
in 1990 to about 12 billion in 1991

manuel noriegas attorneys met with his trial judge 
amid speculation the government would move the ousted panamanian 
dictator from the courthouse basement to a more secure federal 
facility 
us district judge william hoeveler met with noriegas 
attorneys in a closeddoor session friday reportedly to discuss 
the governments interest in moving him to federal prisons in 
atlanta or marion ill 
noriega attorney frank rubino said he would fight any effort to 
move noriega from south florida on the grounds that it would make 
it difficult for him to meet with his client 
hoeveler refused to comment on the meeting 
noriega is accused in a february 1988 federal indictment of 
using panama to protect cocaine shipments heading north and 
southbound drugprocessing chemicals and drug money 
rubino said he and cocounsel steven kollin have been joined on 
the defense team by david lewis of new york 
lewis an attorney in the pizza connection mob case is 
considered an expert on the federal classified information 
protection act expertise needed because of noriegas longtime 
association with the cia 
the new york office of attorney barry slotnick who represented 
subway gunman bernhard goetz issued a statement friday saying the 
firm has decided it does not wish to be part of the noriega 
defense effort 
houston attorney richard racehorse haynes also was reported 
to have expressed interest in the noriega case 
but rubino told the associated press friday that when he 
mentioned slotnick and haynes to noriega the deposed dictator said 
he had not contacted them 
he told me that he is satisfied with our representation and 
whoever we get rubino said david lewis is the first weve 
added but were going to get four or six more from all over the 
country the best in their fields in their specialties 
us magistrate peter palermo on friday set bail at 1 million 
for noriega codefendant daniel miranda 36 who is charged with 
flying 800000 in drug money from fort lauderdale to panama 
mirandas attorney michael okane said they would be able to 
post the bond but prosecutors immediately filed an appeal of the 
ruling and temporarily blocked his clients release 
okane appeared in court with a bandaged head and explained that 
he had been attacked by a masked man with a crowbar in front of his 
home 
police later said they had a suspect in the attack in custody 
and identified him as a person hired by a former client of the 
attorneys

the united states and soviet union are 
expanding their environmental cooperation including plans for an 
international park spanning the bering strait 
acting under a 1972 agreement the environmental protection 
agency and its soviet counterpart are expanding cooperation into 45 
areas including the exchange of information on scientific and 
regulatory issues officials from the two agencies said friday 
taking their cue from the united states for example the 
soviets are developing a program in which leaded gas would be 
banned by 1996 or 1998 said valentin g sokolovskiy deputy 
chairman of the state committee on environmental protection 
william k reilly the epa administrator said cooperation would 
include preparation for a conference on global warming proposed by 
president bush at the superpower summit in malta last month 
we began the week with 37 projects and we ended with about 
45 reilly told the news conference areas of cooperation 
included 
remote sensing of atmospheric pollutants 
wetlands management 
historic preservation 
seismological monitoring along the lines of an exchange of 
scientists that took place after the 1988 earthquake in soviet 
armenia and the tremor that shook san francisco last october 
by the end of 1991 the us and soviet governments hope to form 
a jointly managed preserve on both sides of the bering strait that 
separates alaska and siberia said an epa spokesman sean mcelheny 
the plan stems from talks the two nations held last september he 
said 
for years soviet officials denied they had significant 
environmental problems but the issue has been widely discussed 
under the reforms of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the greater soviet emphasis on environmental problems has lent 
new energy to official ussoviet meetings on the issue of which 
the fourday session this week was the 12th 
moscows new interest in the environment has created some stress 
in the official relationship however because unlike the american 
delegate the soviet entourage included a representative from a 
recently formed nongovernment group 
the private soviet delegate was maria v cherkasova of the 
socialecological union formed in december 1988 as a consortium of 
some 120 groups in 260 cities and towns 
the soviet environment is in a disastrous state requiring 
urgent attention she said stressing problems with childrens 
health 
i feel that great movement has been made in the past year by 
the soviet government to protect the environment she told 
reporters after the news conference but it seems that the 
american side does not realize the full extent of soviet 
environmental problems she said 
during her stay she said she formed contacts with several 
private us environmental groups including the natural resources 
defense council greenpeace international the audubon society and 
the sierra club 
david wirth an attorney from the natural resources defense 
council complained in a statement read at a bilateral session on 
wednesday that the original 1972 agreement was underutilized 
wirth proposed ussoviet cooperation to curb emissions of 
carbon dioxide which are widely blamed for a perceived global 
warming trend and he said the two governments should monitor joint 
business ventures to ensure that us pollutants such as some 
pesticides are not sold to the soviets

barbara bush is finished with the radiation 
treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision 
but will not know for at least two months how effective the 
treatments have been 
the first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on 
friday said anna perez mrs bushs press secretary 
after receiving the 10minute radiation dose at walter reed army 
medical center mrs bush returned to the white house and took her 
daily swim in the outdoor heated swimming pool said ms perez 
she also attended a briefing on the head start education 
program hosting volunteers from the organization 
she feels great said ms perez 
doctors will not know for at least two months and maybe as long 
as four whether the radiation was effective in treating the 
symptoms of graves disease an immune system disorder that earlier 
affected mrs bushs thyroid as well said ms perez 
mrs bush began the radiation treatments after the steroid drug 
prednisone failed to improve her eyes she suffers eye irritation 
double vision and bulging eyes as a result of the graves disease 
which was diagnosed early last year 
the disease initially caused her thyroid to be overproductive 
but a onetime radioactive treatment rendered the thyroid inactive 
and cured that effect of the disease 
the lowlevel radiation treatments were intended to decrease 
swelling behind the eyes in the small muscles that control eye 
movement 
although suffering from eye irritation mrs bush has maintained 
a schedule of public appearances both with her husband and by 
herself 
should the radiation fail surgery would be an option experts 
say

even before the article was published the 
foreign policy establishment and the academic world were abuzz 
when it appeared copies of a highbrow journal with a slender 
circulation were suddenly in high demand 
the article in daedalus was about ussoviet relations and it 
was signed with the provocative pseudonym z a clear allusion 
to the 1947 article signed x that laid the theoretical 
framework for the cold war policy of containment 
xs article published in the journal foreign affairs later was 
acknowledged to be the work of george f kennan a state department 
official who later became ambassador to the soviet union and one of 
the nations leading diplomats 
speculation about the identity of z began last thursday when 
excerpts from the daedalus article appeared on the opinion page of 
the new york times washington was soon alive with rumors that the 
author was a wellplaced government official perhaps even a 
wellplaced soviet government official 
the article takes a dim view of mikhail gorbachevs chances of 
making the soviet system economically efficient and politically 
democratic while maintaining the primacy of the communist party 
the fundamental structures of the leninist system reached an 
inextricable impasse at the end of the 1970s and the mounting 
contradictions of perestroika indicate that the system cannot be 
restructured or reformed but can only stagnate or be dismantled 
and replaced by market institutions over a long period of time z 
wrote 
daedalus a literary and philosophical quarterly published by 
the 210yearold american academy of arts and sciences in 
cambridge mass printed 23000 copies of todays edition 3000 
more than usual and expects to issue many reprints said its 
editor stephen graubard 
graubard however was hardly ecstatic about his publishing 
coup instead the 65yearold editor was ruminating about the 
frivolity of the american media and fuming about allegations 
that the pseudonym was hype 
i want people to read it and say whether they agree or 
disagree graubard said in a telephone interview this is a 
very serious subject and so far i have yet to see an analysis of 
what was said as opposed to a guessing game about who said it 
graubard refused to name the author or explain why a pseudonym 
was used except to say that there were compelling reasons to 
protect the writers identity 
as to the allegation by columnist patrick buchanan that the z 
byline was just clever hype graubard was indignant 
all you have to do is read daedalus to know we dont go in for 
hype he said 
z argues that it is futile for the united states to try to help 
gorbachev succeed in his avowed aims of democratizing the communist 
system and revitalizing the soviet economy 
but the article contends the west can play a constructive role 
primarily by investing in the soviet unions emerging private 
sector without triumphalism about capitalisms superiority and 
with due sensitivity to soviet national pride 
the wests aim should be to encourage the change of soviet 
realities while leaving the old labels intact the article says 
the arkansas democrat reported today that it had determined z 
was retired lt gen william odom the former director of the 
national security agency the newspaper quoted william e jackson 
jr an international relations professor at the university of 
arkansas as saying odom a close friend was z 
odom reached friday in middlebury vt gave a cryptic 
response he denied that he was z but said the newspapers 
reporter would be correct in quoting jackson 
you can write what he says said odom who in september was 
quoted as warning that it was unlikely a liberal democracy would be 
established in the soviet union and that reforms there could lead 
to chaos 
much of the speculation about zs identity has focused on robert 
m gates president bushs deputy national security adviser 
gates had planned to give a speech late last year expressing 
pessimism about gorbachevs chances of success but was blocked by 
secretary of state james a baker iii who reportedly felt such 
sentiments were inappropriate about the time of the malta summit 
gates denied through the white house press office on friday that 
he is z 
another possible author is zbigniew brzezinski former national 
security adviser under president carter brzezinski declined to 
discuss the article but did not expressly deny writing it 
new york times writer flora lewis suggested in her column today 
that z was dennis ross head of the state departments policy 
planning staff 
after the original x article appeared in july 1947 kennan 
was identified as the author within a matter of days now a 
historian at the institute for advanced studies in princeton nj 
kennan declined to discuss the z article 
graubard said he believes zs article is infinitely more 
provocative than the mr x article was in its day but not all 
scholars agreed 
the sense of it is that we should help the russians right now 
but whether gorbachev succeeds or fails is going to be decided 
inside the soviet union said adam ulam director of the russian 
research center at harvard university its a sensible but not 
terribly original point of view

the air force is proposing to retire all 450 
minuteman 2 intercontinental ballistic missiles at a savings of 
400 million a year a newspaper reported today 
defense secretary dick cheney has tentatively accepted the 
proposal the washington post said and will discuss it with 
congressional leaders next week before making a final decision 
a defense department spokesman air force lt col richard 
oborn said late friday that he had no information on the matter 
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials who cautioned that 
president bush might withdraw the proposal before he presents his 
fiscal year 1991 budget to congress on jan 29 
meanwhile cheney on friday ordered a freeze on hiring civilians 
at the defense department for the rest of this fiscal year cheney 
said in a statement he took the step to cut costs and because of 
sweeping international changes 
the release announcing the step cautioned that department 
officials do not know how much the work force will be reduced by 
the freeze 
in effect until sept 30 the hiring freeze applies to all 
department of defense civilians worldwide including parttime and 
temporary employees the department currently employs 927000 
civilians fulltime and another 123000 on a temporary or parttime 
as many as 80000 workers normally retire or otherwise leave 
that work force each year the pentagon said 
the minuteman 2 based at malmstrom air force base mont 
ellsworth air force base sd and whiteman air force base mo 
carries a single warhead with an explosive force estimated at 12 
megatons or the equivalent of 12 million tons of tnt that is 80 
times the power of the atomic bomb that destroyed the japanese city 
of hiroshima in 1945 
these are the last warheads in the us arsenal greater than one 
megaton in destructive power 
compared with later missiles the minuteman 2 is relatively 
inaccurate published estimates say half the missiles launched 
would land within 1200 feet to 2000 feet of the point of aim 
similar estimates for the 550 deployed minuteman 3 missiles 
which carry three smaller warheads are from 600 feet to 700 feet 
in addition to the minuteman the nations landbased missiles 
include 50 mx peacekeeper missiles with 10 warheads each 
counting other missiles and bombs the minuteman 2 force represents 
about 35 percent of the nations strategic nuclear warheads 
the bush administration has proposed building a new 
midgetman singlewarhead missile that could be moved about on 
giant trucks much more difficult to hit than known fixed 
positions such as current minuteman silos 
because they are so old and inaccurate the minuteman 2 missiles 
have been candidates for retirement for some time the 
administration told congress last summer that a likely strategic 
nuclear arms treaty with the soviet union would mean significant 
reductions in missiles on both sides

two allies of former philippines ruler ferdinand 
marcos were found liable in the murders of two cannery union 
members and ordered to pay their survivors at least 84 million 
us district judge barbara rothstein found conclusive evidence 
friday that constantine tony baruso and leonilo malabed drew 
from a fund established to battle marcos opponents in the united 
states to arrange the deaths of silme domingo and gene viernes 
slain in the seattle offices of the alaska cannery workers union in 
1981 
this is wonderful said jeff robinson one of the attorneys 
for the families 
rothsteins ruling awarded 6669000 to the estate of domingo 
and 1727800 to viernes survivors with a pain and suffering 
portion to be decided later 
malabeds attorney kate alfieri of san francisco said she 
would appeal the ruling barusos attorney anthony savage of 
seattle could not be reached for comment 
baruso was president of the union when the killings occurred 
although his gun was used in the shootings he was never criminally 
charged 
malabed allegedly ran marcos west coast intelligence operation 
and controlled a slush fund for security projects against 
marcos opponents 
his testimony vacillated between a total lack of memory and 
outright fabrication said rothstein who concluded malabeds 
fund provided baruso 15000 for the murders 
baruso was found liable for conspiracy to monitor harass 
intimidate and operate against marcos opponents while malabed was 
found liable for the conspiracy charge and for negligence for not 
keeping the intelligence operations in check 
the late marcos and his wife imelda were found liable on dec 
15 for running an intelligence network that spied on foes of his 
regime they were ordered to pay 15 million to the families of 
domingo and viernes marcos was ousted as president of the 
philippines in 1986 and fled to hawaii where he died in september 
michael withey lead attorney for the plaintiffs said he would 
meet monday with king county prosecutor norm maleng about reopening 
a criminal investigation of the case 
three men were convicted in 1981 and 1982 of murdering domingo 
and viernes but those trials did not conclude the existence of a 
marcoslinked conspiracy although testimony indicated baruso 
traveled to san francisco and picked up 15000 from a philippines 
intelligence fund to pay for the killings 
malabed in depositions admitted he maintained a fund through 
the mabuhay corp from which he made payments to a philippines 
official for broadcast projects in this country he maintained 
that he did not know specifically where that money went 
malabed also admitted he signed a mabuhay expense account that 
listed several special security projects including a may 17 
1981 entry for 15000 that plaintiffs claimed was used to pay for 
the murders 
baruso denied he knew malabed but rothstein said she found the 
plaintiffs presented overwhelming evidence that baruso was directly 
involved in the murders of domingo and viernes 
she said baruso promised to pay 5000 to the killers and that 
the murder weapon was barusos 
the civil trial had a lower standard of proof than the beyond 
a reasonable doubt proof required in criminal trials the 
conspiracy count required a showing of clear cogent and 
convincing evidence and the negligence count a showing of a 
preponderance of evidence

british foreign secretary douglas hurd said 
today that a timetable for direct elections in hong kong would be 
set in the next few weeks despite worsening ties with china 
arriving in hong kong hurd also said the colony will continue 
its forced repatriation of vietnamese boat people even though the 
move has prompted widespread international condemnation 
hurd said he expected ground rules to be set soon for elections 
in hong kong next year china which takes over the colony in 1997 
has called efforts to speed up the democratization of the territory 
a plot to bring the chinese government to its knees 
hurd said that while britain would consider beijings views it 
would decide by itself how to proceed with the voting 
we are not going to sit back as the british government 
passively and let the clock tick on he told reporters at hong 
kongs international airport 
cool and considered was how he described the way decisions 
will be made that will critically effect the lives of hong kongs 
57 million people 
communist china takes over hong kong in 1997 and has promised to 
preserve hong kongs freewheeling economic and social system for 
at least 50 years but confidence in chinas promise evaporated 
after the bloody crackdown june 34 on the movement for democracy 
in beijing 
relations between hong kong and the mainland have sunk to their 
lowest level since the ultraleftist cultural revolution of the 
1960s a series of disagreements between london and beijing and 
prodemocracy agitation in hong kong have further worsened ties 
to complicate the issue many in hong kong feel britain has 
abandoned the colony and is kowtowing to the beijing government 
protests are expected during hurds visit and security will be 
tight 
his visit his first to hong kong as foreign secretary follows 
unproductive meetings between hong kongs governor sir david 
wilson and chinese leaders in beijing wilson returned friday and 
will confer with hurd 
the governor had sharp exchanges with several chinese leaders 
over the pace of democratic change in hong kong wilson called the 
talks frank and hurd described them as workmanlike 
diplomatic buzzwords for unsuccessful 
time is running out for determining the future of the colony a 
committee of chineseappointed officials is expected to complete by 
march the basic law the blueprint for the territory after 1997 
the main point of contention concerns the pace and extent of 
democraticization in this colony one of asias economic successes 
china wants only 30 percent of the legislature or 18 seats 
elected after 1997 but britain has been pushing for about 50 
percent 
the executive and legislative branches of hong kongs current 
government have called for at least 20 seats to be put up for 
election in 1991 
british and hong kong activists say a quicker transition to 
democracy would create a political system better able to withstand 
an unstable government in beijing 
but with hardliners firmly in power chinas leadership views 
talk of more democracy in hong kong as a threat hong kongs 
economy and society have far greater influence on chinas 1 billion 
people than its comparatively small population would suggest 
hurd said the ground rules for the 1991 elections would be the 
first step on a new path for hong kong direct elections 
hurd also pledged that britain would continue sending vietnamese 
boat people home against their will 
we have set the policy he said we have decided 
united nations talks on the boat people question originally 
scheduled for next week were postponed friday in geneva the 
united states which opposes britains policy reportedly asked for 
the delay 
more than 40000 vietnamese are languishing in squalid detention 
centers and will be sent back to vietnam unless they can prove they 
face political persecution in their communist homeland

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee wants congressional auditors to investigate the food and 
drug administrations approval of a genetically engineered hormone 
to boost cows milk production 
sen patrick leahy dvt asked the general accounting office 
to investigate a complaint by a fired fda veterinarian dr richard 
burroughs that the agency ignored flaws in a safety study of a 
genetically engineered version of bovine somatotropin 
congress is being asked with increasing frequency to reach 
conclusions about whether particular products of biotechnology have 
been adequately reviewed and whether use of these products may 
present unacceptable risks leahy said in a letter to the gao 
a copy of the letter was provided to the associated press on 
friday 
burroughs told leahys staff that he noticed problems with 
reproduction and mastitis inflamed udders in cows injected with 
the genetically engineered version of the hormone when he was 
assigned in 1986 through 1988 to review private research on it 
he said fda toned down his criticism of the research at the 
request of chemical companies seeking approval to market the 
hormone commercially 
richard lehmann director of the division of production drugs at 
fda said milk from cows injected with the genetically engineered 
hormone contained no more than normal amounts of bovine 
somatotropin and is safe to drink

us travelers in china can feel free again to 
go out after dark in beijing as a result of lifting martial law 
there according to the state department 
responding to chinas lifting of marital law on thursday us 
officials said precautions recommended beforehand are no longer in 
effect 
prior to chinas announcement thursday the department had 
warned travelers to exercise caution in sections of beijing where 
there was a significant presence of armed security forces because 
of martial law visitors also were advised to refrain from 
photographing troops or military installations 
the new advisory deletes these references to the need for 
precautions in beijing but notes the travelers should still be 
aware that visits to certain areas of the country are prohibited 
without permission 
it also notes that there are special restrictions on travel to 
the tibetan capital of lhasa 
chinese authorities imposed martial law on sections of central 
beijing last june as part of an effort to quell antigovernment 
demonstrations

demonstrations and gunfire were 
reported in albania but a senior albanian communist denied the 
accounts and others that emergency security measures had been 
imposed 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug and belgrade television said 
friday that something is apparently happening over the border 
in hardline albania and that authorities had taken brutal 
measures against dissent the reports did not elaborate 
tanjug said the new security measures can be termed a state of 
emergency but did not say when they were imposed 
the news agency did not attribute its information belgrade 
television cited unconfirmed reports from diplomats and travelers 
from albania who are rare 
milisav milic a reporter for belgrade tv in yugoslavias 
southern kosovo province that borders albania told the associated 
press the frequent sound of firearms was heard friday from the 
direction of albania 
milic in a telephone interview quoted an ethnic albanian 
returning home to kosovo from albania as saying demonstrations took 
place in the towns of durres shkoder and korcha the last couple 
of days 
the witness also was quoted as saying leaflets by dissatisfied 
albanian military officers appeared in tirana the capital no 
details of their contents were available 
the yugoslav newspaper politika said thursday a state of 
emergency was declared in shkoder it said shkoder about 60 miles 
northwest of tirana on the yugoslav border is the center of 
albanian dissent 
foto cami a member of albanias ruling communist party 
politburo rejected recent reports in yugoslav greek and other 
foreign media of unrest in his country as slander and 
antialbanian inventions 
his remarks came in an interview with albanian state radio and 
television carried by the official albanian news agency ata and 
monitored in vienna austria 
most of the east blocs hardline leaders lost power last year 
and albania is viewed as the last bastion of stalinism in eastern 
europe 
some western analysts see it as the next country to undergo 
radical change but its isolation and small population of 3 million 
are among the factors that make albania different from other 
communist countries in the region 
relations between albania and yugoslavia have long been strained 
over unrest in kosovo where ethnic albanians make up 85 percent of 
the yugoslav provinces population

antiabortion activists said they were 
pleased by the recovery of a new york woman who had an abortion 
while she was in a coma after a long fight by her husband to 
counter their efforts to save the fetus 
doctors of nancy klein initially believed her recovery prospects 
were slim and her physician said friday that the gradual 
improvement she has made would have been impossible if she remained 
pregnant 
doctors performed the operation 11 months ago after her husband 
martin klein fought abortion foes all the way to the us supreme 
court eventually becoming his wifes legal guardian and gaining 
the authority to approve the abortion 
dr caroline o mccagg said the womans recovery has been 
spurred by her determination to get home to her husband and their 
4yearold daughter arielle in upper brookville ny 
she likes seeing arielle that really perks her up said 
mccagg 
mccagg said mrs klein doesnt remember the dec 13 1988 car 
collision that put her in a coma when she was 18 weeks pregnant 
she also knows nothing about the controversy surrounding her case 
the doctor said 
but she can now recall some things from before the accident and 
has recovered her speech the ability to feed herself and learned 
to use a wheelchair to get around the robert wood johnson jr 
rehabilitation institute 
mccagg said mrs kleins pregnancy would have ruled out the use 
of antibiotics and antiseizure medicines that have contributed to 
the womans recovery 
the abortion has facilitated her rehabilitation the doctor 
said because of it she said we could be more vigorous with her 
physical therapy 
john short one of the activists who tried in court to stop the 
abortion said from his farmingdale ny home naturally im 
happy for nancy klein i just feel sad the child wont be there to 
help her in her recovery 
i hope she doesnt have to go through the trauma of asking 
where is my child and having to be told it was killed he said 
mrs klein was admitted to the institute in march she began to 
communicate last summer answering yesandno questions by pressing 
a button and learned to spell out words on a letter board shortly 
after that 
mccagg medical director of the institutes center for head 
injuries said mrs klein is able to make it through the tough 
therapeutic program when hospital workers tell her this is going 
to get you home 
three months ago she began using a wheelchair and began talking 
about two months ago mccagg said 
mrs kleins mother anne zusselman of delray beach fla 
termed the recovery a miracle 
zusselman said her daughter has made two weekend visits to her 
long island home and has visited her sister who lives in new 
jersey about a 40minute drive from the hospital 
we are pleased about nancys recovery up til now martin 
klein said we remain hopeful that she will continue to recover 
as well in the days ahead 
mccagg said complete recovery is unusual in cases involving such 
severe head injuries he said mrs klein is expected to remain in 
the hospital for at least six more months 
mrs kleins treatment has cost at least 250000 according to 
a hospital spokesman and she still has a long way to go its 
been very slow very persistent progress mccagg said

a teenager said police threatened him with a 
20year prison sentence to pressure him into implicating a black 
man in the shooting death of pregnant carole stuart and the 
wounding of her husband 
blacks in boston have criticized police for not initially 
considering stuart a suspect in the oct 23 shooting of his wife 
stuart who had blamed the attack on a black mugger committed 
suicide jan 4 when police got new information that he had shot his 
wife and himself 
the case drew widespread attention because of a dramatic 
conversation between charles stuart using his car telephone and a 
police dispatcher in which stuart eventually directed police to him 
and his wife 
dereck jackson 17 told reporters for two newspapers friday 
that boston police investigators intimidated him into saying he had 
heard william bennett 39 confess to shooting the stuarts in a car 
in the citys mission hill neighborhood 
bennett who was arrested on an unrelated charge was never 
charged in the stuart shootings but was frequently named in police 
leaks to reporters in the stuart case 
the boston globe and boston herald today quoted jackson saying 
the only true information he gave authorities was relating a 
comment made to him by a friend bennetts 15yearold nephew joey 
bennett jackson said he asked if william bennett was involved in 
the stuart shootings and joey replied yeah and laughed 
he said that when he initially refused to go beyond that 
statement boston police detective peter j omalley called him a 
liar and told him he could go to the states maximum security 
prison at walpole for 20 years 
jackson said he then told police he heard bennett confess to the 
shootings jackson said he went to police to recant his false 
statements one day later but eventually went back to saying 
bennett confessed 
boston police reached for comment today referred questions to 
suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan the telephone at 
his office went unanswered early this morning spokesman john 
julian told the herald on friday that flanagan would have no 
comment 
jackson said he told the same false story nov 21 before a grand 
jury convened to hear evidence against bennett an exconvict with 
a record dating to 1964 he said he returned to the grand jury the 
next day and recanted his testimony even though his lawyer warned 
him he could be charged with perjury 
i wanted to do the right thing jackson told the herald i 
didnt want this guy to go to jail he was my friends uncle and i 
dont care what he did in the past he did his time for that 
another grand jury began hearing testimony friday as it searches 
for missing links in what police say was stuarts plot to kill his 
pregnant wife 
carol stuart 30 who was seven months pregnant died hours 
after the shooting and her premature baby christopher died 17 
days later 
affidavits police released to the associated press on friday 
said carol stuart was shot in the left side of the head which 
would be consistent with the current police theory that charles 
stuart sitting in the drivers seat shot his wife and himself 
the affidavit was part of searchwarrant applications filed in 
roxbury district court by police investigating bennett as a suspect 
in the shootings 
the affidavits also say that on nov 1 bennett took it on his 
own to flag down a patrol car and tell an officer he knew he was a 
suspect but that he had been out of town at the time of the 
shooting 
investigators learned of the apparent hoax when a younger 
brother matthew stuart 23 told authorities jan 3 that he met 
charles at the murder scene and retrieved mrs stuarts handbag 
which contained a gun and some personal items 
matthew stuart has said he was not aware mrs stuart was shot 
when his brother passed him the bag prosecutors have declined to 
say whether he or anyone else might face charges

bulgarian nationalists provisionally 
agreed not to stage demonstrations against the granting of rights 
to ethnic turks after the communist government guaranteed that 
bulgarian is still the official language 
the guarantee came in a declaration friday by representatives 
from the nationalist communist and opposition camps aimed at 
defusing ethnic tensions that have swept bulgaria for two weeks 
the draft document upheld a dec 29 decision of the communist 
leadership restoring religious and other rights to minority ethnic 
turks it also reaffirmed bulgarian as the official language and 
guaranteed this balkan nations sovereignty and territorial 
integrity 
the provisional declaration was issued by a 19member commission 
of representatives on the last day of weeklong negotiations and 
must still be submitted to parliament for final approval 
parliament meets monday 
nationalist mincho minchev spokesman for the commission for the 
protection of national interests told reporters friday the 
declaration had his unreserved support he said his movement 
will not push for strikes or demonstrations over the weekend 
bulgarian protesters and strikers originally urged that the 
decree be revoked pending a national referendum and threatened 
more unrest if their demands were not met 
the dec 29 decision allowed ethnic turks and moslems here to 
reassume their own names and practice their religion without 
restrictions 
it reversed an assimilation policy pursued by ousted communist 
leader todor zhivkov that forced ethnic turks to assume bulgarian 
names and restricted their practicing islam or using their native 
language 
an exodus to neighboring turkey began last summer and about 
300000 of bulgarias estimated 15 million ethnic turks still are 
in that country 
the forum was convened after thousands of nationalists converged 
on the capital last week to protest changing the assimilation 
policy many expressed concern that bulgarian national unity would 
be imperiled 
officials said a parliamentary commission will be formed to work 
out a final national program based on the declaration it will be 
headed by communist party chief petar mladenov who replaced 
zhivkov on nov 10

a couple who sued the navy over the loss of 
their cattle ranch have found it difficult to prove that the 
thousands of jets screaming overhead are what caused their cows to 
lose their enthusiasm for breeding 
don and barbara nonella sued the navy for 87 million claiming 
flights out of the fallon naval air station ruined their business 
and drove them off the land which they couldnt sell and the navy 
wouldnt buy don nonella now drives trucks out of elko in eastern 
nevada 
the couple claims that increased jet training activity over 
their ranch 60 miles east of the naval air station killed some of 
their cattle and caused other cows to reproduce less 
but the navys laywer lt mike quinn said friday the couple 
had failed to prove their claim 
things happen that only god can explain quinn said 
fluctuations in production are normal and to be expected theres 
no evidence to suggest that noise did it 
bob alexander who represents the couple said he had proved the 
cattle were not diseased and were fed properly ruling out 
everything but stress from the earpopping sonic booms caused by 
the jets to explain why the cows were not reproducing 
closing arguments in the fiveday trial ended friday and it was 
left in the hands of us district judge bruce thompson 
quinn said the nonellas ranch lay beneath both a military 
operations area and a supersonic flight range and with more than 
64000 flights out of the naval air station each year in the late 
1980s it was logical there would be noise 
the pilots must train somewhere and that somewhere is central 
nevada clearly our operation at times affects the people of 
central nevada they bear part of the burden of making sure our 
nation is prepared he said 
alexander argued that the nonellas would have had 1 million in 
livestock sales each year from 1985 to 1988 if production hadnt 
dropped off but quinn said the couple bought the ranch when cattle 
prices were high and interest rates were low then lost it as 
livestock prices declined and interest rates rose 
the couple said the conception rate of cows on their property 
was more than 90 percent from 1979 when they bought the ranch but 
fell to about 67 percent after 1984 they left the land in may 1988 
james cothern an agricultural economics professor at the 
university of california in fresno and davis testified that a 
computer analysis he performed showed the ranch was just 
accumulating debt and would have failed no matter what 
nonella 58 disputed that outside the courtroom 
you dont run a ranch by computer you run it by the seat of 
your pants he said patting the bottom of his blue jeans 
a government expert testified that cattle might become startled 
and even run a bit when fasterthansound military jets fly 
overhead to set off sonic booms but the animals arent adversely 
affected by the noise 
james bond a retired noise expert for the us department of 
agriculture said he conducted and reviewed several studies during 
the 1960s and early 1970s that concluded animals quickly get used 
to sonic booms and military overflights 
humans are definitely affected by sonic booms but beef cattle 
get used to it quinn said

nurses said a woman who is charged with 
killing one daughter and implicated in the death of another was 
cold and emotionless toward the infant girls but thrilled and 
adoring of her son 
nurse bernice stupperich testifying friday in the trial of 
paula marie sims recalled her cold blank stare when she saw 
newborn heather mrs sims is accused of suffocating the 6weekold 
girl in april her first child loralei marie died after two weeks 
of life in 1986 
mrs sims in both cases told authorities a masked gunman had 
entered her home and snatched the babies later discovered dead 
she is charged with firstdegree murder in the death of heather 
and could face the death penalty if convicted she faces trial 
later for obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide in 
the death of loralei in june 1986 no one has been charged in 
loraleis slaying 
defense attorney donald groshong spent hours friday attacking 
the testimony of stephanie werner cook who shared a hospital room 
with mrs sims in march when heather was born 
mrs cook said mrs sims described what she said was the 1986 
kidnapping of loralei to her using details of the story mrs sims 
later told police when heather disappeared 
madison county prosecutor donald weber said mrs sims was groggy 
from her caesarean section and slipped up in describing loraleis 
death to mrs cook providing proof that mrs sims already was 
planning to kill heather 
groshong accused mrs cook of fabricating the story implying 
that she could not be believed because she was suffering 
complications from her own childbirth 
he also got mrs cook to admit that mrs sims was affectionate 
toward heather often talking and singing to the baby and kissing 
her 
mrs sims told police she was taking out the trash when a masked 
gunman knocked her out and kidnapped heather from their home in 
alton on april 29 
mrs sims said in 1986 that a masked gunman entered their rural 
home in brighton a few miles north of alton where the couple lived 
at the time and threatened to kill her before taking loralei 
her husband robert sims 37 was at work on both occasions and 
has not been charged in either case he has custody of their 
2yearold son randy 
when randy was born they were very excited said pam 
colley a nurse at the alton memorial hospital they cried they 
were so happy but their attitude toward loraleis birth was 
different they were quiet and reserved 
michael graham chief medical examiner in st louis testified 
friday that he believed both girls died of homicidal violence 
and rejected theories proposed by groshong that they could have 
been accidents 
the trial resumes tuesday it was moved to peoria because of 
pretrial publicity in the alton area

two japanese men who fought for their 
country in world war ii and then with communist guerrillas for 45 
years in the jungles of malaysia returned to japan today saying 
they had looked forward to coming home the entire time 
shigeyuki hashimoto 71 and kiyoaki tanaka 77 were greeted by 
a group of about 20 relatives and friends bearing flowers and candy 
at tokyos airport it was their first time home since they left in 
1944 to work in a wartime japanese iron factory in malaysia 
they later joined japans imperial army and then took up arms 
with the communist party of malaya now called malaysia when japan 
surrendered at the end of world war ii in 1945 they wanted to help 
the country gain independence from britain japans former enemy 
were japanese so we never forgot about japan even for one 
day tanaka told a crowd of about 70 reporters at the airport 
we looked forward greatly to returning to japan but as japanese 
we couldnt leave behind the people we were fighting alongside for 
all those years until this opportunity 
the two appeared on wednesday in hat yai a town in southern 
thailand near the jungled malaysian border where they and their 
comrades in the communist insurgency had fought for 45 years six 
weeks ago the insurgency was disbanded 
we fought for a long time hashimoto said we lost touch 
with all of our old friends now only the two of us are still 
alive 
several of their relatives including tanakas 51yearold 
daughter had earlier flown to thailand to meet them and 
accompanied the men back to japan 
doctors in bangkok had pronounced the two in satisfactory 
condition but hashimoto who suffers from high blood pressure 
traveled from the plane in a wheelchair with a nurse at his side 
in a weak voice hashimoto explained his years away from home to 
reporters and photographers who jammed a small airport conference 
room 
in 1957 when malaysia then called malaya gained independence 
from britain we could have returned to japan but it would have 
required our surrender to the malaya government and we chose not to 
do so he said 
they decided to fight until the insurgency was over last 
year a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we 
could come back to japan hashimoto said in a barely audible 
voice 
his account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against 
further efforts to speak 
i never doubted he was still alive but i did not hear from him 
or about him for nearly 50 years so of course i was worried said 
hashimotos sister kikuko ishiwatari 74 
hashimoto from kanagawa prefecture near tokyo and tanaka were 
scheduled to undergo tests at a hospital in tokyo before returning 
home tanaka whose wife is still alive is from kumamoto 
prefecture in the south 
while in the jungle the two men reportedly learned of the 
enormous changes in japan since world war ii from a shortwave radio 
british commonwealth forces fought bloody battles with the 
communist insurgents during what was known as the 19481960 
emergency fighting continued on a lesser scale but 
thaimalaysian military strikes and a thai amnesty badly hurt the 
guerrilla movement in more recent years 
in december leaders of the party and thai and malaysian 
government officials agreed to end the insurgency

three bombs exploded in the northern port 
of tripoli during the morning rush hour today killing one person 
and wounding 10 hours after an explosive charge went off near the 
saudi arabian embassy in beirut 
police said the tripoli bombs detonated at fiveminute 
intervals causing panic and traffic jams in lebanons 
secondlargest city 50 miles north of the capital 
the bombs each containing an estimated 6 pounds of tnt were 
planted on sidewalks in tripolis central business center 
the explosions shattered windows within a twomile radius 
leaving streets carpeted with glass shards and damaged 14 cars 
police said 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said a 65yearold electrical tools peddler was killed 
in the first blast and that the injured were pedestrians 
tripolis 850000 inhabitants are predominantly sunni moslem 
the city has been policed by syrian troops since dissident 
syrianbacked palestinian factions drove out palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat and his loyalists in 1983 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for todays 
bombings few such attacks throughout lebanons 14yearold civil 
war have ever been claimed by the feuding factions 
but tripolis coordination committee which oversees the citys 
daytoday administrative affairs blamed the bombings on the 
forces of rebel christian leader gen michel aoun who is opposed 
to the syrian presence in lebanon 
this is the way the outlaw general sees fit to carry on his 
socalled war of liberation the committee declared in a 
statement 
the bomb in beirut exploded late friday night under a car parked 
80 yards from the abandoned saudi arabian embassy in the manara 
residential district of the capitals moslem sector setting 
several other cars afire 
the embassy was closed in 1985 after it was ransacked and burned 
by militants of the proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
protesting saudi restrictions on the number of iranians allowed to 
make the annual pilgrimage to mecca islams holiest city 
christian army units and syrianbacked moslem militiamen clashed 
with automatic weapons and rocketpropelled grenades before dawn 
across the green line that divides beirut into moslem and christian 
sectors 
police said no casualties were reported in the onehour flareup 
that underscored the deterioration of a civil war ceasefire called 
by the arab league sept 22 
at least four people have been killed and 12 wounded in clashes 
along the threemile demarcation line in the last week 
the hostilities reflect the deepening political crisis resulting 
from aouns defiance of syrianbacked president elias hrawis 
government formed in november to try to end the civil war 
hrawi has dismissed aoun as army commander and interim prime 
minister but the 54yearold general is holding out with 20000 
men in the christian enclave north of beirut and refuses to quit 
the presidential palace that he has occupied since last march 
aoun has rejected an arab league peace plan that gives moslems 
an equal share of power with the christians he insists the plan

a communist party newspaper today criticized 
the communistdominated coalition government for adopting reforms 
too slowly and said the communists should consider becoming an 
opposition party 
only by quitting the coalition and acting as a opposition force 
the paper said does the communist party stand a chance of 
regaining its credibility and showing what it can accomplish in 
east germany 
ever since it was formed in december the coalition government 
led by communist premier hans modrow has been criticized by 
opposition groups and allied political parties for its approach to 
democratic reform 
the coalition took power after a popular revolution ousted 
hardline communist leader erich honecker touching off a wave of 
reforms that opened the berlin wall lifted travel restrictions and 
began an exodus to the west the coalition will govern the nation 
until multiparty elections can be held 
on friday modrow bowed to yet another opposition demand and 
announced that his government will not create the internal security 
agency before a democratically elected government takes office 
after the may 6 elections 
he also set a june 30 deadline for disbanding the stasi the old 
state security agency which the government said it would abolish 
last month 
modrow had argued previously that a new security agency was 
needed right away to guard against a purported threat by neonazi 
groups in east germany 
the opposition has threatened to hold general strikes in cities 
around east germany if the hated stasi is not disbanded soon 
secret police agents and informers in all areas of life were the 
communists preferred tool of repressing dissent and spying on 
citizens during their 40 years of unchallenged rule before the 
revolution late last year 
two of modrows coalition partners the liberal democrats and 
christian democrats also expressed opposition on friday to the 
proposed election law which would forbid campaign aid from abroad 
heated debate on those issues is likely at talks on monday between 
the government and opposition 
if modrows efforts at conciliation fail workers could expand 
warning strikes into major walkouts to show solidarity with the 
opposition 
in another problem for the government tens of thousands of 
frantic buyers jammed stores friday after the coalition announced 
limited price increases for monday and speculation was rampant 
that further increases were imminent 
a commentary today in neues deutschland the official communist 
party newspaper suggested the communists should consider becoming 
an opposition force as one way to regain credibility 
maybe the sedpds communist party should march out of the 
government coalition and into opposition ranks with clear eyes and 
an upright walk the paper said opposition groups then could 
show what they can do 
neues deutschland criticized the communistdominated 
governments efforts to use an alleged neonazi threat as a 
campaign issue and voiced concern about the slow dissolution of the 
dreaded secret police 
berliner zeitung another communist paper suggested that east 
germanys drive toward democratic reform is slowing down 
nothing is changing anymore whoever exercised power before 
still does so and makes sure he stays in power the paper said 
in another concession to the opposition modrow said late friday 
that he may name opposition members to deputy ministerial posts in 
the government to oversee areas such as health or the environment 
his remarks in an interview on west germanys zdf television 
network elaborated on a broadly worded offer thursday to bring 
reform groups into a government coalition

riot police fired tear gas to break up 
antigovernment rallies by hundreds of radical students at two 
universities in the opposition stronghold of kwangju city today a 
news agency said 
about 700 radical students and dissidents fought police with 
rocks and firebombs inside chonam university in the southern city 
the yonhap news agency said police arrested six protesters in the 
90minute clash the report said 
the fighting began after 1000 riot police supported by two 
armored vans with teargas launchers marched into the campus to 
break up the rally 
the students shouted slogans calling for the punishment of 
president roh taewoo and his predecessor chun doohwan radicals 
have long held both responsible for a government crackdown on a 
civil uprising in kwangju in 1980 that left at least 200 people 
dead and 1500 wounded 
opposition parties have been powerful in kwangju ever since but 
radical students who have repeatedly staged antidemonstrations 
since south korea adopted democratic reforms in 1988 do not enjoy 
much popular support 
a police helicopter hovered overhead today as riot police fired 
tear gas and swept through the sprawling campus to stop the 
protest the agency said 
no injuries were immediately reported 
the clash followed a 30minute demonstration at nearby chosun 
university earlier in the day police fired tear gas to disperse 
200 radical students occupying a rail crossing in front of their 
school yonhap said the clash forced a passenger train to screech 
to a halt 
no injuries or arrests were immediately reported 
the protesters at chonam denounced a recent political compromise 
between the governing and opposition political parties to end a 
long dispute over investigations into alleged corruption during the 
autocratic chun regime 
under the dec 15 compromise chun testified in parliament on 
alleged misdeeds during his sevenyear rule which ended in 1988 
the testimony on dec 31 was marred by repeated shouting matches 
and a melee among legislators 
roh was also criticized today because of his close ties with 
chun roh helped chun seize power with military backing in 1980

the recovery of a huge science lab 
by space shuttle columbia will help engineers design spaceships of 
the future the shuttles commander said today 
astronaut dan brandenstein said all the various types of 
materials that have been exposed to space on the long duration 
exposure facility for more than five years will now be studied 
and that will give us the capability to design better and more 
durable spacecraft and space stations 
brandenstein and his four crew members discussed their flight in 
a 20minute news conference from their distant orbit answering 
questions beamed up from reporters at the johnson space center in 
houston 
mission specialist bonnie dunbar who snared ldef friday with 
the shuttles 50foot robot arm said that although some of the 
experiments were beaten up by the long exposure to micrometeoroids 
and other space debris they will serve as invaluable research 
tools 
it was the intent of this payload to find out which materials 
we should be building space stations and spacecraft out of she 
said 
mission specialist david low said the astronauts planned to 
spend the final days of the flight before their planned landing 
next friday working on experiments 
this is the second longest space shuttle mission and we can 
do some good materials sciences work and also get some good medical 
data he said 
pilot jim wetherbee said as a rookie space flier it took him a 
couple of days to get used to weightlessness he and the two other 
firsttime space travelers low and marsha ivins sometimes bumped 
into one another until they got acclimated 
its pretty neat to be floating around up here ivins 
commented 
the space travelers and ground controllers remained on an 
emotional high today after the retrieval of the satellite with 
mission control waking the crew with its version of hello dolly 
hello ldef its so nice to have you back where you belong 
youre looking swell ldef we can tell ldef 
your music this morning is courtesy of the ldef project who 
are obviously very happy the control center told the astronauts 
we enjoyed doing it and are equally happy brandenstein 
responded 
with the most dramatic part of the trip behind them the 
astronauts settled in for six days of experiments concentrating on 
materials processing and tests on how well the human body adapts to 
weightless space 
the planned 10day mission which began tuesday is the second 
longest in 33 shuttle flights and is a stepping stone to even 
longer shuttle missions and to monthslong trips aboard space 
station freedom in the mid1990s 
columbia is to return to earth friday with a landing scheduled 
for 257 am pst at edwards air force base calif 
the rendezvous just went famously flight director al 
pennington said friday it looks like we really have a valuable 
piece of science in our grasp 
brandenstein and wetherbee steered the shuttle so close to 
orbiting space lab that dunbar only had to move the 50foot 
mechanical arm about 2 feet to grasp a grappling device on the 
satellite pennington said 
after dunbar secured the wiry fingers of the robot arm to the 
orbiting space lab she turned the satellite slowly above the cargo 
bay so ivins and low could photograph it extensively for about four 
hours before it was secured in the cargo bay for the trip home 
bill kinard nasas chief scientist for the ldef project said 
he was pleased with the initial results of the rescue mission 
it was a beautiful sight kinard said after the satellite 
was stored the views were very much as we expected we expected 
to see some damage particularly on the leading edge of ldef 
essentially it looked very much as we expected were delighted 
the astronauts earlier reported that the nearly sixyear stay in 
the harsh space environment has taken its toll on several of the 57 
experiments in trays attached to ldefs multisided exterior 
some pretty interesting things on the space end some of the 
panels that had aluminum foil over look like theyve almost 
exploded i mean theyre just peeled back like a sardine can 
brandenstein said 
the satellite the size of a small school bus was being pulled 
to earth by atmospheric drag if the astronauts had not retrieved 
it trackers estimated it would have plunged to a fiery death in 
the atmosphere about march 9 its experiments lost forever 
scientists are eager to learn how the various experiments and 
materials have withstood the stay in space this will help them 
design the space station freedom and other future longduration 
spacecraft 
the retrieval ended a celestial chase that began with liftoff 
tuesday columbia covered 13 million miles and circled the globe 
50 times before making the pickup 
other orbiting satellites have been recovered before by 
astronauts but none as big as ldef

in order to build a series of 
hydroelectric dams turkey today cut the flow of the eurphrates 
river to syria and iraq in a move that could cause problems for the 
two arid nations over the next month 
invoking the name of allah president turgut ozal pushed a 
button that closed the hatches of the giant ataturk dam the action 
will allow engineers to fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet 
and build a concrete plug for a diversion channel as part of the 
construction project 
during the onemonth stoppage syria and iraq will get less 
water from the tributaries of the euphrates the river that has 
been the lifeblood throughout history for the area that once formed 
ancient mesopotamia 
the ceremony today was a moment of pride and accomplishment for 
turkey which views the southeast anatolia project to build more 
than a dozen dams as the key to the economic development of the 
backward region 
but the event is considered a cause for worry for iraq and 
syria which are highly dependent on the waters of the 1460mile 
euphrates river it was the lifeblood of ancient mesopotamia a 
part of modernday iraq 
for one month syria and iraq will receive about onefourth of 
the water they normally get from the tributaries of the euphrates 
turkey said that since november it has released extra water to 
syria and iraq to allow them to store water in reservoirs for use 
during the cutoff 
syria has made no statement on the water stoppage iraq sent its 
deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoun to turkey last month to ask 
for a stoppage of two weeks instead of the planned one month 
hamdoun said the cutoff would not provoke a major crisis in 
iraqi agriculture but it would cause damage in some areas 
iraqi irrigation and agriculture officials said today that first 
undersecretary abdul sattar salman will head a highlevel 
delegation to the turkish capital to discuss problems arising from 
cutting the euphrates flow 
turkey on monday sent a foreign ministry delegation to tour 
iraq syria egypt and saudi arabia to deliver a message that it 
does not intend to use its control of the rivers for political 
leverage 
syria is more dependent on the river because iraq has the 
tigris river in its territory but syria is in a position to divert 
more of the euphrates river water to its own reservoirs and allow 
just a trickle to iraq 
this is a problem they will have to solve among themselves 
said a turkish official who asked for anonymity 
ever since it started building dams on the euphrates in the 
1960s turkey has periodically reassured its neighbors they would 
all share the water 
once the project of 15 dams and 18 hydroelectric power plants is 
completed however turkey will have a stranglehold on the waters 
of the euphrates and tigris rivers 
the first generating unit of the ataturk dam is to start 
production in may 1991 the dam about 100 miles from the syrian 
border near sanliursa is the centerpiece of the massive southeast 
anatolia project designed to harness the waters of both euphrates 
and tigris with a chain of dams and hydroelectric power plants 
when completed in 2006 the project will produce 22 billion 
kilowatt hours of electricity annually and irrigate an area of 4 
million acres this would double the yield in many crops in turkey 
producing 5 billion in surplus food officials say

le van lich took a drag from his bamboo 
pipe and surveyed the grim oneroom home he has shared with 17 
other people since being forcibly repatriated from hong kong a 
month ago 
a forlorn expression his constant companion and his 2yearold 
daughter sitting on his lap lich summed up his new life i dont 
know about the future i only know the fact before my eyes i 
dont have enough to eat 
luck has been going against lich since he and his family set 
sail for hong kong in their 43foot wooden boat to escape grinding 
poverty 
they completed the 500mile trip to the british colony on june 
20 five days after hong kong authorities announced that newly 
arriving vietnamese boat people would be considered illegal 
immigrants unless they could prove they faced persecution in their 
communist homeland 
that doomed lichs chances of starting a new life in the west 
for as he acknowledged i have nothing to do with politics i 
just left vietnam for economic reasons 
the 37yearold fisherman and 11 other members of his family 
including his wife and five children were among the first group of 
51 boat people to be sent back home against their will in the 
predawn hours of dec 12 another 36000 vietnamese in hong kong 
camps are waiting to see if they will face a similar fate 
the forced repatriation triggered an international outcry in 
part because of concern that the boat people would be punished upon 
their return home 
haiphong officials insist that lich and other returnees need not 
worry timothy raison a british parliamentarian who visited 37 of 
the forcibly returned boat people last week said he found no sign 
of persecution 
i think we have been forgiven by the vietnamese government 
said le van tuoi another fisherman forced back on the same 
chartered flight as lich 
lich agreed that local authorities have been friendly and that 
he does not fear punishment 
but he sais now i have another worry we dont have money we 
dont have anything to live on we lost our fishing boat and our 
fishing equipment 
the boat that had been home and livelihood for three generations 
of lichs family was left behind in hong kong since returning to 
vietnam they have had to live in a friends tiny home tucked 
inside a maze of alleys in this gritty northern port city 
a large cabinet and two beds are the only furniture a makeshift 
altar with a faded picture of jesus rests on a rickety wooden loft 
clothes hang to dry from three lines strung across the room and 
stashed in a corner are the red white and blue bags that hold 
lichs meager family possessions 
britain and hong kong have promised to pay vietnam about 600 to 
help reintegrate each repatriated boat person but it is unclear 
how much cash each returnee will get 
im waiting for the money from the hong kong government so 
i can buy a boat or a house lich said the government also 
promised us when we arrived at the airport that it would help us 
build a house 
adults were given 30 and children 15 when they left hong kong 
although lich claimed they were promised more 
the fishermen will need far more money to build or buy a boat 
equipped with nets which raison said could cost up to 10000 
in the meantime lich is frustrated with being idle and remains 
bitter at the hong kong and british governments for puncturing his 
dream of a better life 
he remembered the three hong kong detention centers where he was 
imprisoned for nearly 18 months the crowded conditions stifling 
boredom and what he described as inadequate food he said his 
father died of lung cancer while languishing in the camps 
also fresh in his mind was the predawn swoop by hong kong 
security forces in riot gear who whisked lich and his family to the 
airport for the flight back to hanoi they didnt beat us but 
they pushed and dragged us he said 
added lich his sorrow unwavering im angry and i regret i 
ever left for hong kong

communist north korea on saturday 
proposed talks with south korea on allowing free travel between the 
rival countries south korea rejected the idea 
the proposal was made in letters sent to the border village of 
panmunjom they were delivered to president roh taewoo prime 
minister kang younghoon and three main opposition leaders kim 
daejung kim youngsam and kim jongpil 
according to south korean officials north korea repeated in the 
letters a proposal by its leader kim il sung that the two koreas 
hold toplevel political talks to discuss free travel on the 
korean peninsula 
they quoted the letters as saying in part as a first step 
toward opening the gate of unification the concrete wall set up on 
the southern side of the border should be torn down 
if the southern side destroys the concrete wall we will 
immediately remove a barbed wire fence on our side that marks the 
border line they futher quoted the letters as saying 
in a new years speech the north korean ruler called on south 
korea to tear down a concrete border wall along the 155milelong 
border to ensure free travel as a first step toward unifying the 
divided peninsula 
choi byongbo a spokesman for the south korean governments 
national unification board noted that north korea has repeated 
similar proposals on numerous occasions since its communist 
government was set up in 1948 the peninsula was divided at the end 
of world war ii in 1945 
choi said southern leaders would not attend the proposed talks 
in a nationally televised news conference last week roh 
proposed a facetoface meeting with his north korean counterpart 
to discuss possible free travel and ways to ease friction on the 
peninsula 
he suggested the conclusion of a free travel and communication 
agreement between the two koreas north korea rejected both 
proposals 
south korean officials accuse north korea of trying to create 
the false impression that there is a barrier along the border 
like the berlin wall 
there simply is no such wall along the border defense 
ministry spokesman brig gen kim jiwoo said 
the norths false propaganda shows how they are embarrassed 
in the midst of sweeping changes in east europe the ministry 
spokesman said 
ministry officials said there are tank traps along some portions 
of the border that were used by north korea when it invaded the 
south in 1950 to start the korean war

a supreme court ruling last week in a 
protracted racial desegregation dispute from yonkers ny 
reopened notsoold wounds for many in the civil rights community 
the decision while perhaps more symbolic than substantive is a 
painful reminder for civil rights leaders that the most likely 
champion of their aspirations now is congress not the high court 
the civil rights movements longstanding reliance on the court 
as an ally ended with a series of 1989 rulings that curtailed 
affirmative action made it tougher to prove employment bias and 
restricted remedies for onthejob racial harassment 
the clear signal was that a court made more conservative by 
appointees of former president reagan had swung the balance in 
civil rights lawsuits in favor of defendants and the white majority 
civil rights leaders still are smarting over those rulings and 
are asking congress for new laws to overcome them 
the yonkers decision limited judges power to crack down on 
civil rights violations 
the 54 ruling said a judge improperly fined yonkers city 
council members but acted within his authority in imposing coercive 
fines against the city for reneging on its agreement to desegregate 
housing 
the message is perhaps not a powerful one but a negative 
one said kerry scanlon of the naacp legal defense fund judges 
are going to be looking over their shoulder wondering if they are 
going too far in ordering remedies for past civil rights 
violations 
steven shapiro of the american civil liberties union said he is 
happy that last weeks decision authored by chief justice william 
h rehnquist was not written more broadly to pull in the judicial 
reins even more tightly 
there are indications that suggest rehnquist would have liked 
to go further but he couldnt hold the majority if he did 
shapiro said 
shapiro declined to speculate about which court members might 
have refused to join a broader ruling but he said obviously 
justice sandra day oconnor has been a swing vote in this area 
barbara arnwine executive director of the lawyers committee for 
civil rights under law sees some positive signs in the yonkers 
decision 
the court has yet to take a plunge against strong 
raceconscious remedial measures she said 
ms arnwine said last weeks ruling may bode well for civil 
rights forces in a kansas city mo case now awaiting decision by 
the justices 
in it a federal trial judge ordered the citys school district 
to raise property taxes to help pay for racially desegregating 
public schools the high courts decision is expected by july 
before ending its current term the court also is expected to 
decide what could be its most significant civil rights case of the 
year judging the validity of special preferences the federal 
government gives to women and minority members seeking licenses for 
radio and television stations 
the court last year limited similar affirmative action efforts 
by state and local governments ruling that a public works 
setaside program in richmond va violated the rights of whites 
the current case presents the court with programs initiated by 
the federal government and its ruling could affect federal 
affirmative action beyond the broadcasting industry 
compared with last year however the courts docket of civil 
rights cases is light 
maybe we all can be thankful this isnt a busy year for the 
court in this area said scanlon of the naacp legal defense fund 
others may share the opinion of one dejected civil rights 
attorney who when asked last july what future setbacks loomed 
replied whats left

opponents of prime minister benazir 
bhutto have turned her pregnancy into a political weapon 
complaining that the country will be left without leadership while 
ms bhutto takes maternity leave 
the baby ms bhuttos second is expected to be born before 
jan 20 some of the strongest objections have come from another 
woman abida hussein an independent member in the national 
assembly 
the feminist in me has been really outraged over this 
pregnancy it was wrong irresponsible and poses very serious 
difficulties for our nation said ms hussein a leading opponent 
of the bhutto government 
its a very extreme situation we will have no chief executive 
officer for a few weeks she alleged the constitution doesnt 
provide for maternity leave 
nasir aslam zahid a constitutional expert in pakistans law 
justice and parliamentary affairs ministry said official 
parliamentary rules cover ms bhuttos absence regardless of the 
reason 
the laws provide for a senior minister appointed by the prime 
minister to head the cabinet in her absence 
in the past particularly during her frequent travels abroad 
ms bhutto left her mother and national assembly member nusrat 
bhutto in charge 
the elder bhutto also shares the chairmanship of the ruling 
leftofcenter pakistan peoples party with her daughter 
no doubt she will have mom look after the shop while shes 
away said ms hussein a hint of sarcasm in her voice but 
running a nation is not a family concern 
ms bhuttos detractors criticize the ruling party as a family 
dynasty started in 1967 by her father zulfikar ali bhutto he was 
prime minsiter from 1970 to 1977 when he was overthrown by 
president gen mohammad zia ulhaq in a coup 
amina piracha a lawyer and member of bhuttos party dismissed 
opposition complaints and said she did not expect the 36yearold 
prime minister to be out of office for long 
until now she hasnt taken even one day of leave because of 
her pregnancy she said 
ms bhuttos first child bilawal was born less than a month 
before the november 1988 elections that gave her leftleaning party 
the largest bloc of votes 
she was campaigning the day before the birth and returned to the 
campaign trail less than a week later 
when ms bhutto assumed office dec 2 1988 becoming the first 
woman to leader a modern moslem nation and at 35 was the youngest 
world leader 
islamic fundamentalists condemned her leadership saying a 
womans rule ran contrary to the tenets of islam 
ms piracha said ms bhuttos leadership has debunked claims 
that having children puts serious limits on female ambitions 
she has shown to the world that it is not a constraint said 
ms piracha she has in fact been able to conduct herself with 
such dignity 
ms hussein dismissed speculation that ms bhuttos often 
hostile opposition will move against the government during her 
absence 
last november ms bhuttos government narrowly survived a 
noconfidence motion the opposition lead by an alliance of 
rightwing centrist and islamic fundamentalist parties has 
several times vowed to unseat the bhutto government

on a june day in 1985 marine lt col oliver 
l north then managing director of the us drive to aid the 
nicaraguan contra rebels boarded a yacht anchored off the pacific 
coast of panama for a secret meeting with the countrys military 
strongman manuel antonio noriega 
north needed noriegas permission to use panamanian military 
bases and personnel to train contra soldiers in their fight against 
nicaraguas sandinista government 
noriega enthusiastically joined in the effort to help the 
contras apparently betting that his cooperation would encourage 
us officials to turn a blind eye to evidence that he was involved 
in narcotics trafficking money laundering and gun running 
the ousted panamanian leader now claims that the us began its 
campaign to remove him only after he refused to allow panama to be 
used as a launching pad for contra attacks against nicaragua 
north who at that time was a white house aide held at least 
two further meetings with noriega a strand in a web of high level 
us government contacts with the panamanian ruler that included 
sessions with vice president george bush cia director william 
casey and vice adm john poindexter the reagan administrations 
national security adviser 
analyzing these meetings investigators for a senate foreign 
affairs subcommittee on narcotics concluded last year that noriega 
was following a divideandconquer strategy in his relations with 
the united states 
noriega eventually offered to provide military training and 
weapons for the contras and also to infiltrate panamanian troops 
inside nicaragua to sabotage key facilities and assassinate 
sandinista leaders 
noriega recognized that so long as he helped the united states 
with its highest diplomatic priorities the united states would 
have to overlook activities of his that affected lesser us 
priorities the democraticled panel said 
in the mid1980s this meant that our government did nothing 
regarding noriegas drug business and substantial criminal 
involvement because the first priority was the contra war it 
said 
noriega now awaiting trial in miami on narcotics charges after 
his ouster from power in a us invasion last month long has said 
he holds information highly embarrassing to key us officials 
information stemming in part from his facetoface conversations 
with them 
noriegas lawyers say they will ask the government to turn over 
many sensitive documents bearing on noriegas relationship with 
us officials documents which he contends will show the united 
states was aware of his narcotics activities for many years and 
chose to ignore them 
the senate subcommittee headed by sen john kerry dmass 
sought many of the same documents but never succeeded in obtaining 
them from government agencies earlier the congressional 
irancontra committees also sought to trace noriegas 
relationships especially with north and the contras 
jose blandon a former panamanian intelligence officer who was 
fired by noriega as panamas counselgeneral in new york city told 
the senate investigators that when noriega and north held their 
first shipboard meeting north was looking for ways to circumvent 
the congressional ban on us aid to the contras 
blandon testified that the meeting led to an agreement with 
noriega in which up to 250 contra soldiers received training at two 
panamanian military bases with contra leaders being given 
permission to enter and leave panama freely 
at a second meeting in october 1985 in noriegas office in 
panama city the general asked for a favor in return saying panama 
needed economic help to deal with more than 3 billion in foreign 
debt 
blandon told reporters panama received some 200 million in us 
and international bank loans during the next year 
in august 1986 noriega through an intermediary upped the ante 
with an explosive offer 
panamanian troops would infiltrate nicaragua and assassinate top 
sandinista leaders in exchange for a promise to help clean up 
noriegas image and a commitment to lift the ban on military sales 
to the panamanian defense forces according to documents made 
public at norths irancontra trial 
according to the documents poindexter responded that the 
administration was barred by law from involvement in 
assassinations but panamanian assistance with sabotage would be 
another story 
north and noriega met in london in late september 1986 and 
noriega agreed to take immediate actions against the sandinistas 
and offered a list of priorities including an oil refinery an 
airport and the puerto sandino offload facility 
the committee found no evidence the sabotage plan was carried 
out 
casey met with noriega in panama in november 1985 and according 
to the senate subcommittee report failed to raise the issue of 
noriegas involvement with narcotics 
the panel said casey later justified his failure to raise the 
issue with noriega with whom the cia had had a close working 
relationship for nearly two decades because noriega was providing 
valuable support for us policies in central america especially 
in nicaragua 
the drug issue never came up in a december 1985 meeting between 
noriega and poindexter the committee said 
noriega and bush first met in 1976 when bush headed the cia and 
noriega led the panamanian intelligence service they met again in 
1983 in panama when bush was vice president 
last february after noriega was indicted he alleged that 
poindexter had told panamanian officials in 1985 that the united 
states planned to invade nicaragua 
bush rejected that as pure fabrication and a lie 
noriega also alleged that immediately before the us invasion 
of grenada in 1983 bush called him and asked him to assure cuban 
president fidel castro that cuban soldiers and workers in grenada 
were not a target of the attack 
that claim also was labeled a total fabrication by bush 
noriega said last year that his troubles with the united states 
began only after he balked at escalating us requests to aid the 
contras 
in a speech last february shortly after his indictment noriega 
said that poindexter warned him to expect the consequences if 
he refused to cooperate further on central america 
noriega said he considered the indictment to be the 
consequences 
he gave another account of his encounter with poindexter to saul 
landau a senior fellow at the institute for policy studies a 
washington think tank 
in an article prepared for the februarymarch issue of mother 
jones magazine landau said noriega told him he had refused to 
allow panama to be used as a launching pad for the contras 
poindexter grew quite indignant right in my office landau 
quoted noriega as saying he took out his pipe and banged it on 
the table im not sure if he broke it after that incident the 
united states began its campaign to remove me

although it finished second in the nielsen 
ratings and lost to a television movie on rock hudson nbcs drug 
wars was a hit of sorts in mexico 
the government and national media protested last weeks series 
and one sensationalist newspaper even printed speculation that the 
subject of the movie a slain us drug agent was alive and well 
in la jolla calif 
mexican officials had been anticipating the series nervously for 
months well aware that the killing of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena in 1985 threw usmexico 
relations into a crisis 
president carlos salinas de gortaris priority has been to get 
his nations stagnant economy moving again he has tried hard to 
neutralize drug trafficking as an irritant to usmexico relations 
in order to focus on improving trade and reducing the foreign debt 
drug wars was unforgiving in its portrayal of a corrupt 
legal system that frustrated enforcement and covered up the 
camarena killing and officials feared it would damage salinas 
efforts to change mexicos image 
most defensive was attorney general enrique alvarez del 
castillo who was governor of jalisco state when caramena was 
kidnapped in the state capital of guadalajara he was criticized 
for tolerating official corruption and sitting on his hands as 
major drug dealers operated freely 
posted behind six tons of seized cocaine at a news conference in 
october the attorney general denied mexicos antidrug efforts 
were part of a show for the gringos and threatened to sue if 
drug wars contained any slander 
however javier coello trejo the assistant attorney general in 
charge of narcotics enforcement said the series would have no 
effect 
our image is bad its not right but there have been deeds 
that cant be mistaken what is changing our image is the vigor 
with which our president is fighting the problem he told the 
associated press 
like other nbc programs the sundaytotuesday series appeared 
in english on mexico city cable systems along with public service 
spots trumpeting salinas administration achievements in the drug 
war 
us officials are virtually unanimous in saying that mexico has 
indeed made progress and dea administrator john lawn said so on an 
nbc news segment that followed the first broadcast last sunday 
night 
nevertheless the mexican government protested the series and 
some of the comments that followed as unfair and perhaps in bad 
faith something nbc vigorously denied 
mexican officials pointed out that 34 tons of cocaine has been 
seized in the 13 months since salinas took office more than in the 
10 previous years put together mexican sources also said that 
fully 30 percent of the mexican antinarcotics force as it existed 
at the end of 1988 is now in prison 
and in december rafael caro quintero and ernesto fonseca 
carrillo were sentenced to 40 years in prison without parole for 
the killing of camarena whose bulletriddled body was found nearly 
a month after his kidnap 
with distraction provided by the visit of spanish king juan 
carlos to mexico the president held his tongue during the tv 
series but other mexicans in politics and the media were not so 
sanguine 
opposition politicians said the administration should vigorously 
protest it as an insult to mexico and mexican law enforcement 
the government wire service distributed and the government 
newspaper el nacional printed a story that raked up old and 
discredited accusations that camarena was somehow in league with 
the drug traffickers who killed him 
this is just a sort of desperate and rather pathetic effort to 
try to appease the mexican public to try to take the heat off in 
mexico said elaine shannon author of desperados the book 
on which the miniseries was based 
el nacional also printed a story that attacked the credibility 
of the us press summarizing allegations that reporters had 
smoked marijuana in the white house during the carter 
administration 
perhaps the most improbable article appeared under banner 
headlines in the sensationalist afternoon edition of el sol de 
mexico seriously discussing speculation that camarena was alive 
and living in la jolla calif 
some mexican officials asked if drug wars was part of a us 
plot to denigrate mexico noting comments made on the news segments 
that seemed to equate panama and mexico 
however salinas administration officials although critical of 
the programs content said it was unlikely to have any longterm 
effect 
now more than ever the relationship between our nations is 
friendly particularly among those dedicated to fighting drug 
trafficking said fernando arias chief spokesman for attorney 
general alvarez 
he like other officials thought the american public was 
sophisticated enough to recognize a hollywood production when they 
saw it 
it is part of the ratings wars not the drug wars said 
agustin barrios gomez mexicos consul general in new york 
nbc said the series won an average 153 ac nielsen co rating 
representing more than 14 million households it finished second 
overall in its time period on monday the programs second night 
it finished third to an abc television movie on rock hudson and a 
lineup of cbs comedies

president mikhail s gorbachev 
announced today that he is willing to accept a multiparty political 
system in the soviet union where the communist party he leads has 
ruled for 72 years 
his pledge came at the conclusion of a threeday visit to the 
restive baltic republic of lithuania aimed at persuading local 
communists to restore the ties they severed with moscow but top 
party members rejected his appeal saying union with the national 
party would mean death for theirs 
in previous public appearances gorbachev had ruled out 
permitting the existence of other parties which is already a 
political fact of life in lithuania since the local legislature 
voted last year to revoke the communists constitutional guarantee 
of power 
but gorbachev said in vilnius we shouldnt be afraid of a 
multiparty system the way the devil fears incense 
i see no tragedy in a multiparty system if and i can tell 
you this straightforwardly it arises as a result of a normal 
historical process and answers the needs of society he told a 
meeting of the lithuanias communist party which strengthened the 
republics independence movement when it voted last month to break 
from the national party 
however gorbachev said allowing more than one political party 
was no panacea for the nations ills and that his reforms of 
glasnost or greater openness and broader participation by 
soviets in public decisionmaking were more important 
he did not say when rival parties might be allowed to organize 
and run candidates nationwide but his reference to the normal 
historical process could mean such developments are not 
immediately in the offing 
since the 1917 russian revolution communists have firmly held 
the reins of power in the soviet union but they are being 
increasingly challenged by independent groups some calling 
themselves parties that have sprung up in the atmosphere of 
greater tolerance introduced by gorbachev 
reforms gorbachev put in place also led to popular uprisings 
throughout the soviet bloc and dramatic democratic reforms in 
poland hungary czechoslovakia east germany romania and bulgaria 
speakers at the meeting today told gorbachev they were 
unimpressed by his promises of greater autonomy as an alternative 
to lithuanias drive for full independence they said their 
communist party must also support independence to keep the peoples 
support 
our reality is that we lithuanian communists have no trump 
cards in our dialogue with the people said vasily yemelianov 
editorinchief of the newspaper soviet lithuania the majority 
of lithuanians are ready to sacrifice their material benefits for 
the sake of independence 
to reverse the december decision would mean death for the 
lithuanian communist party yemelianov said 
in 1940 dictator josef stalin absorbed lithuania and the two 
other baltic states estonia and latvia under a secret deal with 
nazi germany 
instead of the conciliatory views gorbachev came to elicit he 
heard at least two hours of speeches largely defending the local 
partys decision 
the speeches in the auditorium of the partys central committee 
were broadcast on lithuanian television and a text of remarks made 
by gorbachev and others was provided for the associated press by 
lithuanian tv correspondent eduardas potesinskas 
during his visit gorbachev repeatedly ran into crowds of 
proindependence protesters and he tried to persuade them to hold 
back in favor of staying in the soviet union but on new and better 
terms of sovereignty 
gorbachev has faced ethnic turmoil and other domestic problems 
as a result of his program of social and political reform but 
lithuanias independence movement is probably the most serious 
crisis during his five years in power 
on friday a leader of the movement accused gorbachev of laying 
a propaganda trap in saying a draft law to be approved by a 
national vote would provide the mechanism to secede 
gorbachev was greeted at the bridai collective farm in siauliai 
earlier today by protesters carrying banners that read we are 
for an independent lithuania and our aim is the independence of 
lithuania 
after an exasperating day of trying to get his message across 
gorbachev showed his sense of humor was intact telling the 
demonstrators ok i have read them all take a rest 
the crowd interrupted him frequently and by the end of the 
discussion his smile had disappeared and his face was grim the 
scene was broadcast by governmentrun tv 
with his wife raisa and lithuanian communist party chief 
algirdas brazauskas standing beside him gorbachev cited economic 
factors that he implied would make it better for lithuanians to 
remain in the union 
our ties within the country are very close he said 
the tiny republic of 37 million people receives 70 percent to 
100 percent of its energy oil and metals from the russian 
federation gorbachev told the farmers but brazauskas who 
supports the drive for independence chimed in that the prices 
lithuania receives for its goods are far below world levels 
foreign reporters were not permitted to accompany gorbachev to 
siauliai 125 miles northwest of vilnius because it is a military 
region closed to foreigners

now that they have overturned the 
stalinist systems imposed on them by moscow some east europeans 
are demanding the soviet troops that underwrote communist rule in 
their countries go home this year 
the demands underscore the soviets waning influence in eastern 
europe and they will prove a test of moscows willingness to 
relinquish control over a region where it has held sway for more 
than 40 years 
if realized the demands could also put pressure on nato to 
match the soviet troop pullouts with withdrawals of us and other 
allied forces in western europe perhaps escalating sharp cutbacks 
already envisaged at vienna talks on conventional arms reduction 
both superpowers already have signaled willingness at those 
talks for sizeable cuts in their european forces washington 
proposes a ceiling of 275000 men each for the united states and 
the soviet union while the soviets want slightly higher ceilings 
that would remove other nato forces from west germany 
the united states has about 300000 troops stationed in europe 
the soviets have 575000 according to us estimates 
the vienna agreement probably would envisage phased withdrawal 
over the next decade rather than the immediate soviet pullout this 
year sought by czechoslovakia and hungary 
east germany strategically most important to the kremlin has 
made more modest demands communist party leader gregor gysi 
proposed all foreign troops leave both germanys by 1999 a 
timetable and balance that probably matches moscows thinking 
romania and bulgaria with no soviet troops are silent on the 
issue while the prospect of german reunification leaves poland in 
the awkward position of viewing the warsaw pact as a guarantor of 
its current borders 
the most strident demand for swift soviet withdrawal has come 
from prague whose new coalition government opens negotiations jan 
15 with the soviets on the pullout of red army soldiers who arrived 
with the 1968 warsaw pact invasion and never left 
i suggest that the soviet troops should withdraw from 
czechoslovakia by the end of 1990 foreign ministry spokesman 
lubos dobrovsky like his minister and friend jiri dienstbier a 
former dissident said last week 
in hungary too soviet troops arrived to suppress revolution 
the 1956 uprising against stalinism and as in czechoslovakia 
stayed under bilateral agreements now declared void in prague and 
considered invalid by most hungarians 
after the foreign affairs and military committees of hungarys 
parliament demanded withdrawal by the end of this year hungarian 
premier miklos nemeth met soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov last 
week to arrange bilateral talks on the issue 
but nemeth unlike the current prague government has stressed 
the withdrawal depends on agreement on europewide troop reductions 
at the vienna talks 
some 10000 soviet soldiers already have left both hungary and 
czechoslovakia under the phased withdrawal of 50000 men from 
eastern europe which was announced by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev in december 1988 
an additional 6000 of the 52000 soviet troops said to be left 
in hungary are due to leave this year and an undisclosed number 
are scheduled to leave czechoslovakia where officials say there 
are some 70000 soviet forces 
a tank regiment of 1300 men an antiaircraft regiment a 
helicopter regiment and two battalions withdrew from poland in 
1989 with an additional brigade of landing and assault troops due 
to leave this year 
but poland in many fields an outspoken leader of eastern 
europes pull away from the kremlin has been quiet about demanding 
a full withdrawal of soviet troops 
poland is one of the strongest supporters of the warsaw pact 
left in eastern europe noted hans bennendijk director of 
studies at londons international institute of strategic studies 
poland has suffered throughout its history from being sandwiched 
between russia and germany with talk of german reunification 
growing the warsaw pact is protection against suggestions in west 
germany of reclaiming former german territory that became part of 
poland after world war ii 
east germany traditionally was viewed by red army chiefs as the 
biggest conquest in the vast chunks of territory won in world war 
ii protecting the russians from a repeat of the devastating nazi 
attack in 1941 and enabling the kremlin to threaten western europe 
moscow has about 380000 troops in east germany 
gysis 1999 deadline for all foreign forces to leave both 
germanys fits better with the kremlins thinking than quick 
withdrawals this year 
at the vienna talks the united states has proposed reducing 
us and soviet troops stationed abroad in the nato and warsaw pact 
nations to 275000 for each superpower 
the soviet union eager to see cuts bite into the british 
french and canadian presence in west germany is talking of 300000 
to 350000 troops stationed abroad in each alliance western 
diplomats at the negotiations say 
the diplomats speaking on condition they not be identified say 
that total alone suggests the soviets were considering withdrawing 
from less strategic nations such as hungary which has no border 
with nato to save most of their east german presence 
but the demands from prague and budapest mean the soviets lose 
the flexibility to scatter troop cuts as they want and can no 
longer make the withdrawals so gradual 
a preliminary agreement at the vienna talks is envisaged by the 
end of this year but negotiators expect it to take most of the 
1990s for east and west to slice the huge weapons arsenals and 
armies amassed in four decades of cold war 
this must come as an unpleasant surprise to moscow 
bennendijk said in a telephone interview but what choice do they 
have they are not in czechoslovakia for instance as occupying 
powers

dennis and cheryl avery were a quiet 
couple who never had much money but were devoted to their three 
daughters and their church 
unhappy with the ordination of women and other changes in the 
church they followed lay minister jeffrey lundgren to ohio and 
became allied with his breakaway fundamentalist cult they 
apparently became so controlled by him they turned over their 
paychecks and bought a gun for him on their credit card 
and it may have been that very gun that killed them and their 
daughters last spring police say lundgren and other cult members 
are charged in their slayings 
they were very sweet very familyoriented people said 
norma corkern a librarian who made friends with the averys more 
than 10 years ago in independence very loving it just didnt 
make sense for them to be there 
avery 49 mrs avery 42 and daughters trina 15 rebecca 13 
and karen 7 were last seen in april shortly after they told 
others in ohio that they were moving to wyoming 
their bodies were found jan 34 at the farm commune near 
kirtland ohio where the cult stayed after police received an 
anonymous tip they had been bound with duct tape shot and buried 
in a barn police theorize that the deaths were a ritual sacrifice 
to cleanse the cult 
lundgren 39 his 19yearold son and three other cult members 
are charged with their murders his wife and seven others are 
charged with conspiracy 
the deaths left those who knew them struggling to understand 
what went wrong 
i just think they didnt know what they were getting into when 
they went to kirtland said marie haworth a friend from 
independence 
avery and his wife both grew up on the west coast as members of 
the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints a 
church that has roots in common with the mormon church but is 
separate they were married in independence where the church is 
based in 1970 
avery who worked 17 years as a computer programmer for a kansas 
city bank was a deacon in one of the rlds congregations dotting 
the independence area mrs avery taught preschool and sunday 
school sewed her familys clothes and took her bookworm daughters 
to summer reading programs at the public library 
the family lived in a small house in an older section of 
independence the daughters attended public schools until may 1986 
then were schooled at home church records show 
when the rlds church voted to ordain women in 1984 the averys 
and many others were unhappy mrs haworth said they moved to a 
different congregation where they met lundgren who had grown up 
in independence and been ordained an rlds lay minister 
lundgren moved to kirtland in 1984 to become a volunteer guide 
at an rlds temple and the averys followed in 1987 
no one knows when lundgren and his followers made the switch 
from his fundamentalist rlds teachings to a cult whose members 
drank heavily trained for paramilitary activities and called their 
leader the prophet said grant mcmurry the rlds world church 
secretary 
mrs averys mother donna bailey of centralia wash said she 
telephoned and wrote her daughter frequently after the averys moved 
to ohio 
i caught on early on that these were the wrong types of 
beliefs mrs bailey said in an interview published friday in the 
kansas city times at one time she said people think were a 
cult but were not that made me concerned 
shortly after the averys arrived in ohio lundgren was asked to 
resign from the temple position and he was eventually defrocked 
after his teachings became unchristian said the rev dale 
luffman head of the northeast ohio chapter of rlds 
the averys broke all ties with the rlds church after lundgren 
was asked to resign 
unlike most of lundgrens followers the averys lived in town 
about three miles from the commune avery worked at a security 
company and did odd jobs his wife worked at a fast food 
restaurant dennis yarborough police chief in kirtland said cult 
members turned over their paychecks to lundgren 
lundgren often seemed irritated with avery according to john 
olivarez whose daughter once lived at the commune bonnie 
olivarez then 11 lived there with her mother in spring 1988 
until olivarez regained custody the mother is charged in the 
murders 
olivarez said according to his daughter lundgren would 
complain that mr avery could only do five pushups everybody else 
was doing 20 or 30 
the averys moved in the fall of 1988 to a home about 30 miles 
from the commune leaving several months of back rent unpaid said 
landlord stan skrbis in kirtland but the family apparently kept 
its ties with the cult 
avery used his credit card to buy a 45caliber gun for lundgren 
shortly before the killings authorities say a gun of that caliber 
was used in the murders 
no one knows why the averys were picked 
these were all people from nice families in our community 
not just the averys but the people who are in trouble too said 
mrs haworth 
mrs corkern added the worst thing is those little girls 
they never had a chance

the red cross announced saturday that iraq 
has agreed to free 50 disabled iranian pows clearing the way for 
the first prisoner exchange between the two countries in more than 
a year 
peace talks between iran and iraq have been stalled almost since 
they began in august 1988 and the deadlock has left an estimated 
100000 captives on both sides languishing in pow camps some have 
been held since the early stages of the war which began in 
september 1980 
the international committee of the red cross said 50 iranian 
pows will be released and returned to iran after iran returns 50 
iraqi prisoners to baghdad 
irans un ambassador kamal kharrazi announced in new york 
last week that iran would release the ailing iraqis 
the iraqi authorities have promised to reciprocate with the 
release of an equal number of pows a red cross official said 
saturday 
the iraqis are scheduled to be set free wednesday said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity they said a swiss 
airliner had been chartered to fly the iraqis home 
un officials have registered 55000 pows held by iran and 
19500 by iraqi but they believe the total held by both sides is 
about 100000 both sides hold a total of about 1000 ailing or 
disabled prisoners 
the 1948 geneva convention stipulates that all prisoners of war 
should be released when hostilities cease 
a ceasefire halted fighting between iran and iraq in august 
1988 but the pows have become pawns as both sides quarrel over 
details of the un resolution that cleared the way for the 
ceasefire 
in 1988 the two sides exchanged about 400 disabled and ailing 
prisoners the operation collapsed in november of that year as each 
country accused the other of lying about the number of captives 
they held 
this month iraqi president saddam hussein offered to restart 
the peace talks and said iraq was ready to exchange all disabled 
and sick prisoners as a first step toward a total prisoner exchange 
iran countered that it would not agree to total swap or to 
implement other clauses of the ceasefire resolution until iraq 
withdrew from iranian border areas captured during the final days 
of fighting 
but iranian officials have expressed support for a soviet offer 
to mediate a new round of peace talks 
the soviets have close links with iraq and were its main arms 
supplier during the war relations between moscow and tehran have 
improved considerably since the war ended 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati said tehran would 
consider any soviet proposal containing a systematic and clearly 
defined formula for the implementation of un security council 
resolution 598 the ceasefire resolution 
the iraqi foreign ministry also welcomed the soviet offer

salvador was discovered friday night in jalpatagua a city 60 
miles east of guatemala city his party said

was found dead according to the party official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
mario solorzano martinez secretarygeneral of guatemalas 
social democratic party confirmed the partys report and deplored 
the slayings 
we energetically condemn this act which shows that the 
authorities are inefficient he said this is an combined 
action of guatemalan and salvadoran paramilitary forces its 
obvious this was well planned 
he said the victims bodies were taken to a hospital in cuilapa 
40 miles east of guatemala city and would be moved to a funeral 
home in guatemala city 
oqueli and ms flores were abducted by armed men early friday

march elections in el salvador ungo could not immediately be 
reached for comment today 
before his body was found oquelis party condemned his

exists in our country

1979 until march 1980 when a military coup overthrew the 
government like many other leftists he quit el salvador after the

cuba continues to be an important military and 
intelligence asset for the soviet union and the longstanding 
moscowhavana alliance is expected to survive deepening ideological 
differences according to analysts 
there is little question that the relationship is far less 
relaxed than it was before soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
assumed power but the consensus among experts is that cuba is too 
valuable for the soviets to cast aside 
still as us officials see it there is evidence of a decline 
in soviet assistance to cuba a trend that may continue but not to 
the point where the survival of the regime is threatened one 
example of the strength of the relationship was the recent delivery 
of soviet mig29 jet fighters to cuba the officials say 
says cornell university professor rhoda rabkin there is 
little sign that the gorbachev era leadership considers cuba an 
expendable soviet commitment 
among other assets she notes the soviets have an extensive 
electronic intelligence gathering facility in cuba and 
installations that enable soviet longrange reconnaissance aircraft 
to monitor us east coast military activities thanks to cuba the 
soviets also are able to maintain a strategic naval presence in the 
caribbean 
professor jaime suchlicki of the university of miamis institute 
of interamerican studies points out that these soviet activities 
have forced the united states to install expensive surveillance and 
tracking facilities to keep an eye on the soviets 
gillian gunn an associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace a washington research group says soviet 
leaders have been cool to us admonitions that they distance 
themselves from castro 
gorbachev has left the impression he opposes castros effort to 
promote subversion in the hemisphere but the soviets have told 
us officials privately they have no way of knowing how castro 
would react if they pushed him too hard according to ms gunn 
if they tinker with his aid he could mess around with their 
military access she says summing up soviet concerns 
soviet bloc arms continue to find their way to central america 
via cuba but the bush administration is more inclined to blame 
havana than moscow 
uncertainty about sovietcuban relations has arisen as a result 
of castros repudiation of perestroika and glasnost and gorbachevs 
willingness to nudge hardline regimes from power in eastern europe 
a strain in relations was evident last summer when castro banned 
two soviet spanishlanguage publications because he was offended by 
their irreverent comments about socialism castro has said that 
death is preferable to abandonment of socialism 
us officials say there is one area in which soviet aid to cuba 
appears to have dried up the soviets used to provide cuba with 
surplus oil enabling castro to sell the commodity at world market 
prices for a handsome profit 
according to the economist newsletter revenues from oil exports 
reached 621 million in 1985 and then fell sharply last year the 
earnings were almost certainly nothing it said 
gorbachev has called for stricter accountability in the way 
cuba uses soviet aid estimated at 43 billion by us officials 
no recipient of us aid gets nearly as much 
one official said that given gorbachevs emphasis on improving 
living standards in the soviet union he would like to reduce his 
economic burden in cuba further but not to be point where the 
survivability of the regime comes into doubt 
one test of the durability of the sovietcuban relationship will 
come next year when payments on cubas substantial soviet debt 
estimated at 10 billion fall due 
it is widely expected that cuba will ask for lenient terms just 
how accommodating the soviets will be remains a question mark

vice president dan quayle said saturday 
he will press latin american nations to recognize the usinstalled 
panamanian government when he travels to the region 
quayle in utah for a fundraising ski race told a news 
conference he intends to go beyond fencemending during three trips 
he plans to central and south america over the next two to eight 
weeks 
the president wants me to go down and have a very strong 
consultation process with our latin american friends quayle 
said the mission is one to not only have consultations but to 
talk about the liberation aspects of the people of panama 
many latin american officials say quayle will have a tough time 
explaining the dec 20 invasion by 14000 us troops as anything 
other than a violation of panamas sovereignty especially while an 
invasion force remains 
but the vice president said from his talks with latin leaders 
he is convinced they understand that president bush ordered troops 
into panama as a last resort 
quayles itinerary is still being put together with the only 
announced stop his attendance at the jan 27 presidential 
inauguration in honduras 
as for shoring up the civilian government of guillermo endara 
installed as panamas president after the ouster of gen manuel 
antonio noriega quayle said one of the first things the united 
states can do is to attempt to have other governments recognize 
the endara government 
endara was a presidential candidate in a may 7 election that 
independent observers said he won handily but which was 
subsequently invalidated by noriega some latin american nations 
contend endara to earn authority on his own must be installed 
either by a new election or by the panamanian congress 
quayle said the new government has the support of the panamanian 
people but must now make strong efforts to build a judicial 
system reform the panamanian defense force and strengthen the 
economy 
whats important now is that endara moves forward to hold and 
maintain the support he has now quayle said 
the vice president made these other comments 
he said soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is in full control 
of the political situation in his country and is doing his best to 
reform a situation that desperately needs to be reformed 
he predicted disappointment for those who have suggested that 
changes in eastern europe will save the united states money on 
defense obviously there will be modest changes in expenditures 
for national security but no huge shift in domestic and 
nondomestic spending quayle said 
he took issue with use of the word blockade to describe 
the recent presence of us naval forces off the coast of colombia 
he said the vessels went to the area only in the event the 
colombian government needed assistance in cracking down on the drug 
trade we will not impose ourselves on the colombians he said

the reported impending shutdown of a 1 
billion private consortium to produce computer memory chips points 
to the need for new government policies to help encourage longterm 
investment by hightechnology companies a congressman said 
saturday 
the sevencompany joint venture us memories had been 
launched last summer as an effort to challenge japanese dominance 
of the memory chip market 
rep robert s walker rpa ranking minority member of the 
house science space and technology committee responded to 
published reports that us memories would announce monday it was 
folding because it had failed to attract enough investors 
i think what it indicates is the need for national policies 
that encourage a better investment climate for hightech 
industries walker said 
he added part of the problem right now is that our investment 
climate in this country is not such that most businesses want to 
take longterm risks and that is apparently one of the 
considerations here 
walker said that to help deal with this situation congress 
should enact the capitalgains tax reduction being advocated by the 
bush administration and also should approve a permanent extension 
of the research and development tax credit 
the new york times the washington post and the austin texas 
americanstatesman carried stories saturday citing unidentified 
electronics industry sources as saying the dissolution of us 
memories would be announced at a news conference monday in santa 
clara calif 
the times said that while sanford l kane president of us 
memories would not comment on the reports he did say he was 
extremely frustrated by his failure to persuade computer companies 
to sign up for the venture 
one can only bang their head against the wall for so long 
sooner or later you get a headache the times quoted kane as 
saying 
us memories had planned to raise 500 million in equity from 
computer and semiconductor companies and 500 million in debt to 
build a largescale memory chip plant 
however the venture has not been able to sign up any investors 
beyond the seven companies that launched us memories last june 
those members were three computer companies ibm digital 
equipment corp and hewlettpackard and four semiconductor 
companies advanced micro devices intel lsi logic and national 
semiconductor 
today us companies rely primarily on japanese manufacturers of 
dynamic randomaccess memory chips or drams in 1988 japan 
controlled about 80 percent of the 64 billion market 
currently drams have been in ample supply and prices have 
plummeted thus removing the urgency for a new domestic source such 
as us memories 
however us memories supporters had warned that companies 
rejecting the idea merely because of the current market glut were 
being shortsighted 
on that issue the washington post quoted brookings institution 
analyst kenneth flamm as saying the bottom line is that the 
great memory glut is going to be a shortterm phenomenon

three bombs exploded near syrian army 
checkpoints in a commerical district of tripoli on saturday 
killing one civilian wounding 10 and causing panic among commuters 
during the morning rush hour 
elsewhere scattered clashes were reported saturday between 
rival forces in beirut and south lebanon but no casualties were 
reported 
late friday a bomb exploded near the abandoned saudi arabian 
embassy in a residential neighborhood of west beirut but no 
injuries were reported 
none of the feuding factions in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
claimed responsibility for the explosions at three different 
locations on the sidewalks of tripoli however a police spokesman 
who demanded anonymity said they were probably a protest of the 
syrian military presence in the city 
police said panic swept tripolis central business section when 
the bombs detonated a few minutes apart around 9 am police said 
frightened motorists caused major traffic jams trying to flee the 
area 
tripolis 850000 inhabitants are mainly sunni moslems who work 
on saturday and take friday off 
each bomb contained about six pounds of tnt and exploded within 
15 yards of syrian checkpoints in lebanons secondlargest city 50 
miles north of beirut 
tripoli has been policed by the syrian army since 1983 when 
syrianbacked dissident palestinian groups forced yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organizaion from their last stronghold in 
lebanon after israels 1982 invasion 
a bombing campaign also occurred in moslem west beirut after 
syrian troops arrived there in 1987 to end three years of anarchy 
by feuding moslem militias 
saturdays explosions shattered windows within a twomile 
radius leaving streets carpeted with glass shards and damaged 14 
cars police reported they said the fatality from the first blast 
was a 65yearold electrical tools salesman the other casualties 
were passersby 
tripolis coordination committee which runs daytoday 
administrative affairs blamed the bombings on the forces of the 
rebel christian leader gen michel aoun who seeks to force the 
syrian army out of lebanon 
this is the way the outlaw general sees fit to carry on his 
socalled war of liberation the committee declared in a 
statement 
aouns mainly christian army units and syrianbacked moslem 
militiamen clashed with machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades 
before dawn across beiruts dividing green line saturday police 
reported no casualties in the onehour firefight but it underlined 
a marked increase in tension in the divided capital 
at least four people have been killed ans 12 wounded in 
gunbattles along the threemilelong demarcation line in the last 
week 
the violence violates a ceasefire that took effect in 
september ending six months of fierce artillery battles between 
aouns troops and the syrians 
the fourpound bomb in beirut exploded late friday night under a 
car parked 80 yards from the abandoned saudi arabian embassy in the 
residential manara neighborhood of west beirut 
the embassy was closed in 1985 after it was ransacked and burned 
by shiite moslem militants of the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god 
they were protesting saudi curbs on the number of iranians 
allowed to make the annual pilgrimage to mecca islams holiest 
city after riots there in 1987 that the saudis blamed on iranian 
instigators

when arizona lawmakers ended years of bitter 
debate in september by creating a state holiday to honor the rev 
martin luther king jr it seemed the issue finally had been put to 
rest 
but four months later as 46 other states and the federal 
government prepare to honor the slain civil rights leader on 
monday arizonas holiday is on hold and the state faces more 
months of divisive debate before voters settle the controversy in 
november 
democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a holiday by executive 
order in 1986 but it was rescinded by his successor republican 
evan mecham after the state attorney general ruled that babbitts 
order was illegal 
year after year the republicancontrolled legislature refused 
to enact the holiday but offered to put it before the voters 
supporters rejected that option saying privately that they feared 
it would be rejected and that the campaign would divide the state 
and cause further harm to its image 
democrat rose mofford who became governor when mecham was 
removed by impeachment convictions finally found the key to 
getting a king holiday bill through the legislature during a 
september special session 
she got business leaders to spur lawmakers into action by 
arguing that not having a king holiday was hurting the states 
economy and could kill its chances of landing the 1993 super bowl 
dozens of conventions and meetings had been canceled in 1987 and 
1988 in a boycott to protest mechams cancellation of the holiday 
the state estimated the lost convention and tourism receipts at 
more than 25 million 
the legislature agreed to the holiday but only if it supplanted 
columbus day so that state employees would not be given an 
additional paid day off 
that set the stage for two groups those who didnt think king 
deserved a holiday and the italianamericans who wanted columbus 
day preserved to launch a petition drive to put the issue on the 
november ballot 
they collected nearly 80000 petition signatures nearly twice 
the number required in only three months 
the king holiday was put on hold in december pending the outcome 
of the referendum effort among other things that means arizona 
still will observe columbus day in 1990 
julian sanders a conservative activist who spearheaded the 
petition drive said he was convinced that a majority of arizonans 
dont want a king holiday 
the people in arizona are really angry about whats 
transpired he said it will still go down 2 to 1 
supporters of the holiday have begun organizing for what many 
believe will be a bitter campaign and say they fear the rejection 
of the king holiday here could strengthen opposition to the holiday 
elsewhere 
should arizona rescind the king holiday this will simply be 
the first state to put that issue on the ballot said sen 
carolyn walker the only black in the state senate then it will 
go like dominos 
noting that pressure from the business community was a key in 
passing the king holiday bill in september supporters hoped for 
continued support from that sector 
for me its the wrong motivation said dr paul eppinger 
pastor of the first baptist church of phoenix and a leading 
proponent of the king holiday but if thats the motivation that 
stimulates people ill take it 
business leaders pledged support friday at a martin luther king 
breakfast in phoenix 
the business community is very eager to get the holiday 
passed whatever the cost is to the legislature said bill 
shover director of public affairs for phoenix newspapers inc 
which publishes the arizona republic and the phoenix gazette 
shover who also is chairman of the phoenix 93 committee thats 
bidding to bring the 1993 super bowl to phoenix said business 
leaders fear a renewed economic boycott of the state 
sanders argues the state has not suffered economically because 
of the king controversy and even if it had that is not the issue 
if we dont have a majority in this state that wants to honor 
martin luther king for what he was as a man then the whole thing 
is a fraud and a sham sanders said 
state lawmakers say it is unlikely any legislative action will 
be taken on the issue before november 
this is an election year said state rep sandra kennedy a 
supporter of the king holiday no one wants to say anything about 
the king holiday theyre all saying lets let it go to a vote of 
the people

l douglas wilder was inaugurated today as 
americas first elected black governor which he called a triumph 
for the principles in the declaration of independence 
wilder a grandson of slaves said he wanted young people to 
hear thomas jeffersons words about freedom so he included them in 
his remarks as he became virginias 66th governor on the grounds of 
the former capital of the confederacy jefferson himself served as 
virginia governor in revolutionary war times 
wilder said he wanted young listerners to know that oppression 
can be lifted that discrimination can be eliminated that poverty 
need not be binding that disability can be overcome 
he reminded them though that the offer of opportunity 
carries with it the requirement of hard work the rejection of 
drugs and other false highs and a willingness to work with others 
whatever their color or national origin 
retired justice lewis f powell jr of the us supreme court 
administered the oath of office to wilder who had been lieutenant 
governor before 15000 guests at the capitol 
the 58yearold wilder a selfproclaimed mainstream 
democrat won the closest gubernatorial election in virginia 
history on nov 7 a recount demanded by republican opponent j 
marshall coleman resulted in a dec 21 certification of a 
6741vote victory margin or less than half a percent 
he is the first black elected governor in any state but one 
black pbs pinchback served temporarily as louisiana governor 
for 43 days in late 1872 and early 1873 after the governor was 
impeached and removed from office 
the inauguration was preceded by a prayer service at st pauls 
episcopal church where confederate president jefferson davis was 
confirmed and the ceremonial presentation of the keys to the 
executive mansion by outgoing gov gerald l baliles 
jesse jackson and former tennis star arthur ashe attended the 
prayer service wilder hadnt let jackson campaign on his behalf 
but wilders press secretary laura dillard said jackson was 
invited to the inauguration because its appropriate hes a 
leading national figure in democratic circles 
jackson described the inauguration as a historic moment 
to go from the hull of a slave ship to governor is a great 
american story he said its a great world story 
wilder said virginians are witnessing times when the whirlinds 
of rebellion shake all shores where tyranny once ruled and we are 
redeemed in our deeply held and treasured beliefs in the 
development of the high possibility of every individual who 
breathes the sweetness of libertys air 
wilder said his administration would be challenged to maintain 
freedom because of the slowing economy 
but progress will be possible he said resources 
employed in the past for the finer things in life can be and will 
have to be deployed for the more serious of our needs for we 
know that freedom is but a word for the man or woman who needs and 
cannot find a job 
about 12500 tickets were sold for the inaugural ball at the 
richmond coliseum and a huge tent was erected outside to handle 
the overflow crowd tickets cost 50 and box seats went for 2500 
to 7500 
wilder who is divorced said his son and two daughters would 
accompany him to the ball 
he was to deliver his first gubernatorial address to the general

two men who served japans war effort in 
malaysia during world war ii and remained in a remote jungle to 
help communist rebels for 45 years returned home saturday saying 
they hope to help modernday japan 
relatives and friends greeted shigeyuki hashimoto 71 and 
kiyoaki tanaka 77 with flowers at tokyos narita airport as the 
men appearing frail and weary were taken from their plane in 
wheelchairs 
the two who left in 1944 to work in a wartime japanese iron 
factory in malaysia then called malaya said they joined 
communist guerrillas after the war in 1945 to help the country gain 
independence from britain japans former enemy 
we fought for a long time and faced a range of difficulties 
hashimoto told reporters we lost touch with all of our old 
friends now only the two of us are still alive 
on wednesday the two men left the malaysian border jungle where 
they and their comrades in the communist party of malaya fought for 
45 years 
the insurgency ended in december when communist leaders reached 
a peace agreement with malaysian and thai government officials 
were japanese so we never forgot about japan even for one 
day tanaka said we looked forward greatly to returning to 
japan but as japanese we couldnt leave behind the people we were 
fighting alongside for all those years until this opportunity 
tanakas wife haruse 72 was unable to travel to the airport 
because of illness but she watched her husbands return on 
television 
several other relatives had flown earlier to thailand to meet 
the men and accompanied them back to japan 
i never doubted he was still alive but i did not hear from him 
or about him for nearly 50 years so of course i was worried 
said hashimotos sister kikuko ishiwatari 74 
both will be hospitalized for about 10 days for medical 
checkups a health and welfare ministry official said 
i dont know anything about modernday japan hashimoto told 
reporters in a weak voice but i hope to learn as much as 
possible and do what i can to help the nation 
when malaya gained its independence from britain in 1957 
hashimoto said we could have returned to japan but it would have 
required our surrender to the malaya government and we chose not 
to do so 
he said they decided to fight until the communist insurgency 
ended and they succeeded in establishing a maoist state but last 
year a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we 
could come back to japan 
his account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against 
further efforts to speak 
while in the jungle the two men reportedly learned of changes 
in japan from a shortwave radio 
during the insurgency the communists fought against british 
commonwealth forces in bloody battles during what was known as the 
19481960 emergency fighting then continued on a lesser scale 
more recently thaimalaysian military strikes and a thai amnesty 
badly hurt the guerrilla movement leading to decembers peace 
agreement 
over the years a number of former japanese imperial army 
soldiers have emerged from long periods of isolation in remote 
areas of asia controlled by japan during world war ii 
the government is investigating the cases of 48 former japanese 
soldiers who could still be alive according to the health and 
welfare ministry

a satellite designed to detect patterns of 
cosmic creation has found nothing to explain how basic structures 
in the universe such as galaxies and stars came to exist 
researchers said saturday 
in a news conference announcing first results from the cosmic 
background explorer satellite launched last november four 
scientists said instruments detected none of the patterns of 
microwave and infrared radiation that would help to explain how 
stars and galaxies started forming shortly after the big bang 
primordial explosion 15 billion years ago 
the scientists presenting their findings on the final day of 
the 175th national meeting of the american astronomical society 
said the satellite found nothing that would disprove the big bang 
but the data did not unravel mysteries of the processes since 
i am completely mystified how the present structures in the 
universe came to exist without leaving some trace said john 
mather an astronomer at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations goddard space flight center he said the finding 
adds to the puzzle but he believes more data from the satellite 
may eventually produce a solution 
we have not eliminated our existence yet we are here he 
said this existence alone he implied proves that there was a 
process releasing energy after the big bang 
the 150 million cobe satellite launched nov 15 carried into 
space for the first time instruments designed to detect microwave 
and infrared radiation created shortly after the big bang the 
explosion that started formation of the universe 
it was expected that the three satellite instruments one for 
microwave and two for infrared would find energy traces of the 
violent superheated processes that formed the stars galaxies 
black holes quasars and other structures in the universe 
current theories are that bits of matter at many points in the 
universe formed small centers of gravitational attraction that drew 
more and more bits of matter together until the centers became so 
dense that stars were born once a group of stars were formed 
their mutual attraction in turn led to galaxies and then to 
clusters of galaxies and eventually to structures that form 
patterns reaching hundreds of millions of light years across the 
sky 
according to the theories the tremendous heat from such 
processes would produce microwave and infrared radiation some of 
which should still be detectable in the vast reaches of space 
in order for these models to be correct however scientists 
expected that cobe would detect lumps or seeds the 
radiation signatures of dense pockets of matter that came together 
very early in time 
instead nasa researchers said they so far have found that the 
infrared and microwave background is completely smooth from one 
year to 1 million years after the big bang the period in which 
star formation is believed to have begun 
we have detected data for a smooth early universe said 
george smoot of the university of california berkeley he said it 
was hoped that by studying the fossil radiation from that distant 
time cobe investigators would have answers to what shaped the 
current universe but instead we just keep making the problem 
worse 
an infinite universe that is as smooth as a babys bottom 
wouldnt have any way to go said mather theres got to be a 
seed or nucleus to pull things together we didnt find anything 
michael hauser of goddard the principal investigator on a broad 
spectrum infrared instrument designed to look for what he called 
relic radiation of primordial luminous objects said it was too 
early to draw conclusions 
all of the cobe investigators emphasized that the current 
information is very preliminary and more readings during the 
yearlong life of cobe may change the picture completely 
but ned wright an astronomer at the university of california 
los angeles said the finding rules out any great cataclysmic 
events at any time after the big bang 
stephan p maran an astronomer associated with nasas space 
telescope project said the cobe findings are not consistent with 
those theories on the origin of the large scale structures that we 
observe in the universe now 
he added this may mean that some new kind of physical 
phenomena may have to be recognized as the origin of these 
structures or the theories need to be improved 
nancy boggess another member of the cobe science team said all 
instruments on the satellite worked perfectly 
a nasa statement said the instruments are performing 
exquisitely with precision never before achieved

groups of people went on a rampage saturday night 
in the capital of soviet azerbaijan causing an unspecified number 
of deaths the official tass news agency reported 
tass said government and communist party authorities in the 
caucasus republic of azerbaijan called on citizens to aid law 
enforcement authorities indicating the events in the capital of 
baku were serious 
the latest violence in the ethnically torn southern republic 
occurred as president mikhail s gorbachev concluded a threeday 
visit to lithuania in which he failed to turn back the baltic 
republics independence movement 
gorbachev has repeatedly warned that regional independence 
movements and ethnic conflicts could doom his political and 
economic reform movement 
telephone calls from moscow to baku an oilproducing center and 
port on the caspian sea did not go through saturday night so 
independent confirmation of the tass report was not immediately 
possible 
tass said groups of hooligan elements had rampaged in the 
city of 17 million people tragic events ensued there are human 
victims it said soviet authorities use the phrase human 
victims to refer to deaths 
the report said authorities had taken steps to restore order in 
baku and that police had arrested people suspected of committing 
acts of violence 
it gave no details 
other official reports told of weapons being seized in 
azerbaijan on saturday and of villages besieged by assailants 
in another caucasus republic georgia activists said scattered 
strikes continued saturday to press communist party leaders to come 
to the republic and consider demands for it to secede from the 
soviet union the georgian capital tbilisi has been the scene of 
political rallies for days 
the violence in azerbaijan began in 1988 when the mostly moslem 
republic began arguing with neighboring armenia over who should 
govern the enclave of nagornokarabakh the enclave is in 
azerbaijan but dominated by armenians who are mostly christians 
the dispute ignited a virtual civil war between the republics 
tass said arms were seized saturday by police in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs administrative center 
the cache included two homemade mortars a machine gun 17 
rifles and dozens of explosive devices the report said the 
weapons arrived in mail brought to the city aboard a jet from 
yerevan armenias capital tass said 
elsewhere ethnic armenians tried saturday to surround several 
mostly azerbaijani villages in nagornokarabakh according to the 
azerbaijani news agency azerinform 
the news agencys deputy director savili peretz said he knew 
of no casualties 
on friday azerbaijanis wearing bulletproof vests and armed with 
machine guns caused unspecified casualties in the armenian village 
of manashid tass said 
the news agency said friday that lt i tsymbalyuk of the 
interior ministry which is trying to keep order in the region was 
shot and killed in the azerbaijani village of akhullu apparently 
by an azerbaijani policeman 
nagornokarabakh an enclave of 160000 people has been under 
azerbaijani control since 1923 attempts to annex it to armenia 
spurred unrest that has left about 200 people dead over the last 
two years 
azerbaijan last week renewed a railroad blockade of armenia 
which gets most of its supplies through azerbaijan 
with fuel and foo in armenia running dangerously low and 
temperatures several degrees below freezing the people are 
furious because the central authorities are not paying adequate 
attention to events said eduard shakhnazaryan an editor at the 
governmentrun armenpress agency 
this will lead to unpredictable consequences if it 
continues he said in a telephone interview from yerevan i 
mean military conflict between us if they continue like this 
azerbaijani unrest broke out earlier this month as well on the 
border with iran including in lenkoran azerbaijanis who wanted to 
be united with their ethnic brethren across the frontier rampaged 
for several days over new years tearing down border fences 
sovietiranian talks were held saturday in moscow and baku 
during a visit by iranian deputy foreign minister mahmoud vaezi and 
tale massule head of the iranian foreign ministrys passports and 
visas department 
tass said the iranian representatives agreed to consider soviet 
proposals to facilitate crossborder contacts

a bullet whizzed through a kitchen cabinet 
and put a 6inch hole in the ceiling of a woman at home with her 
two young sons apparently because of a training video being 
filmed 1 miles away authorities said 
kim robinson and her neighbors were pinned down for nearly two 
hours as automatic gunfire ripped through their rural community 
thursday hitting several mobile homes about an acre apart in 
keysville estates 
several squad cars and a police helicopter responded to 
residents cries for help 
as hillsborough county sheriffs deputy ron cain walked around 
the robinson yard several more rounds landed nearby and cain 
thought he was under attack capt robert deluna said friday 
by the time the commotion subsided police discovered neighbors 
and officers had been dodging stray bullets from two outoftown 
businessmen who said they were making a law enforcement training 
video at a private gun range 1 miles away 
it was like being in a war said mrs robinson whose 
children are 3 and 4 we didnt know where the bullets were 
coming from 
the men making the video thomas g bailey and steven p nelson 
said they had been told there were no homes for at least two miles 
they had an m16 rifle a 9mm heckler and a koch mp5 assault 
weapon deputies said 
we took all precautions we had to rely on folks familiar with 
the area nelson said its unfortunate we were misled 
the state attorneys office is reviewing the case but 
prosecutors said no charges were filed immediately because no one 
was injured and the stray bullets were apparently unintentional 
bailey who makes training films for a living and nelson a 
chiropractor said they were testing weapons and videotaping them 
for evaluation the tapes are used for training special police 
units such as special weapons and tactics teams 
darrell vogel said his mobile home was hit twice 
it put a hole clean through the doublewide big enough to 
put your little finger through one put a hole right over my little 
boys desk vogel said if he had been doing homework hed be

east germans went on a frantic shopping spree 
saturday after plans for limited price rises triggered widespread 
speculation about further price increases in their economically 
troubled nation 
also saturday east germanys economics minister became the 
highestranking government official to urge transforming the 
statecontrolled economy into a freemarket system something 
demanded by potential western investors 
the communistdominated government said price increases are 
needed to begin dismantling the costly and inefficient state 
subsidies for dozens of basic goods including clothing and food 
late friday the government said prices would double or triple 
for childrens clothing and related items monday 
that triggered a nationwide shopping rush during the four hours 
the stores were open saturday despite the governments promise to 
raise state child support payments in return 
the increased state aid wont cover all of the difference in 
prices said one man his arms loaded with purchases at the 
centrum department store in downtown east berlin 
the price increases are aimed mainly at making statesubsidized 
goods less attractive to foreigners who can acquire east german 
marks cheaply on the black market and then buy items at a fraction 
of the price they would pay in the west 
east berlin leaders also have wiped out state subsidies for 
flowers christmas trees and other plants while announcing plans 
to close several diplomatic missions abroad 
such measures are aimed at cutting a budget deficit of nearly 
13 billion 
east germans braced for price increases for other essential 
goods including groceries after hearing reports on west german 
radio that such plans were in the works 
the fdgb labor federation which has been seeking greater 
independence after decades of government control demanded 
negotiations over any further price hikes or reductions in state 
subsidies 
we will use all of the labor union means at our disposal to 
have a say in this the fdgb said in a statement 
economics minister christa luft said east germany should adopt a 
freemarket economy as a way out of its economic woes 
it must be an efficient freemarket economy that proves itself 
to be internationally competitive mrs luft told leading west 
german industrialists including daimlerbenz chief edzard reuter 
such an economic system must also take into account social and 
environmental concerns she said 
a recent series of warning strikes has increased the pressure on 
communist premier hans modrows shaky coalition government 
modrow during a cabinet meeting cautioned about what he sees 
as the dangers of the growing number of politically motivated 
strikes according to west germanys zdf television network 
modrow offered the social democratic party the post of deputy 
environmental minister marking the first time the growing 
opposition has been invited to have any direct role in the 
government 
the official news agency adn said modrow had offered the job to 
social democratic leader ibrahim boehme but there was no immediate 
word on whether he accepted 
in a highly symbolic move on saturday boehmes party approved a 
modification of its name to adopt the same title as west germanys 
leftist social democrats whose members include popular former 
chancellor willy brandt 
several prominent west german social democrats attended the 
session and promised campaign support before east germanys first 
free elections east germanys social democrats who claim to have 
32000 members are expected to be a major force after the may 
elections 
a commentary in neues deutschland the official communist party 
newspaper suggested the communists consider becoming an opposition 
force to regain their credibility 
maybe the communist party should march out of the government 
coalition and into opposition ranks with clear eyes and an upright 
walk the newspaper said opposition groups then could show 
what they can do 
with a halfdozen major opposition groups running against the 
communists during the elections there is a good chance the 
communists will be in a distinct minority anyway in less than four 
months

the celebration of martin luther kings birthday 
may be muted in miami this year because of the remembrance of three 
nights of rioting after the police shooting of an unarmed black 
motorcyclist a year ago tuesday 
a manslaughter verdict against miami police officer william 
lozano eased animosity slightly in miamis innercity black 
community 
but the jurys verdict against the colombianborn policeman 
angered hispanics and black leaders say little progress has 
occurred in the past year to substantially change problems that 
erupted into racial violence four times in the 1980s they also 
worry about the possible reaction to lozanos sentencing set for 
later this month 
all of the disturbances were triggered by the deaths of black 
men at the hands of police or the subsequent acquittal of those 
officers 
were riotprone here by virtue of our legacy alone said 
marvin dunn a professor and community psychologist 
i dont think that the circumstances that have taken us to the 
brink time and time and time again have significantly changed 
said dunn who has written extensively about the 1980 riot miami 
today is just as likely to have a policecommunity confrontation 
erupt into violence as it was a year ago or even 10 years ago 
city officials not surprisingly paint a more positive picture 
hopefully weve outlived these things said mayor xavier 
suarez i think there has been a coming together to some extent 
of government and the affected neighborhoods 
the city was celebrating the martin luther king jr holiday last 
jan 16 when lozano shot at a speeding motorcycle killing the 
driver and sending his passenger to his death in the resulting 
crash in the povertystricken overtown neighborhood 
the deaths of allan blanchard and clement lloyd led to looting 
sniping and firebombings that left one other man dead 11 people 
injured 372 arrested 13 buildings burned and other buildings 
damaged 
barry greff who represents the lloyd family in a 10 million 
wrongful death suit against lozano and the city believes the 
severity of the sentence to be issued jan 24 will dictate 
community reaction 
although the family certainly doesnt advocate it my 
impression is the mood definitely shows the possibility of a 
community reaction a negative community reaction greff said 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
went so far as to ask gov bob martinez to send in the national 
guard to replace miami police after a handful of officers on the 
1100member force wore black bands on their badges or wrists to 
protest the conviction of a fellow officer 
lozano 31 faces a sentence ranging from probation to 45 years 
in prison with state guidelines recommending 12 to 17 years 
factors to be considered include on the one hand his high ratings 
by the police department before the shooting but also his lack 
of remorse prosecutor john hogan said 
rabbi solomon schiff chairman of the dade county community 
relations board said he expects a peaceful acceptance of the 
sentencing because of extensive media attention to the judicial 
process including televising of the entire trial 
dunn is less certain because he sees poor policecommunity 
relations as the root of miamis repetitious violence 
the problem is overzealous particularly young inexperienced 
officers with a certain attitude toward black youths he said 
poverty and alienation in overtown also are factors some black 
leaders say the southern edge of the neighborhood a black 
community since 1896 has seen a wealth of construction including 
the 52 million miami arena and a 33 million highrise complex 
that displaced 260 families 
some people believe theres master plan afoot to wipe out 
overtown and put in highrises said the rev willie sims a

president turgut ozal cut the flow of 
the euphrates river with the push of a button saturday diverting 
its waters to a reservoir and raising fears of tension with 
turkeys arid downstream neighbors 
starting with the name of allah allforgiving and for the 
benefit of our people ozal said as he pushed the button at the 
end of a cord extending from a channel at the giant ataturk dam 
during the onemonth stoppage syria and iraq will get 75 
percent less water from the tributaries of the euphrates the 
1460milelong river that has been the lifeblood throughout 
history for the area once ancient mesopotamia the river already 
slows to become a sluggish stream before joining the tigris at the 
shattalarab waterway in iraq and emptying into the persian gulf 
commando forces stood guard on heights in the reservoir area 
while 10000 people watched the ceremony at the dam site about 60 
miles north of the syrian border 
white blue and pink clouds mushroomed from smoke bombs exploded 
on the opposite side of the river during the ceremony as water 
gushed down the middle of the dams three derivation channels 
once the southeast anatolia project of 15 dams and 18 
hydroelectric power plants is completed turkey will have a 
stranglehold on both the euphrates and tigris rivers 
but in a speech ozal promised syria and iraq that turkey 
would never use the water of euphrates as a threat 
this was a technical necessity but we have taken all possible 
care not to cause any damage to our neighbors ozal said 
ozal proposed that turkeys neighbors invest together in 
infrastructure projects as he said european countries had done he 
did not give details 
turkey views the dam and a chain of others to be built in the 
future as crucial for the economic development of its backward 
southeastern region providing muchneeded electricity and water 
for crop irrigation 
it says the monthlong stoppage of water will allow engineers to 
fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet and build a concrete plug 
for a diversion channel as part of the construction project 
syria is more dependent than iraq on the river because iraq 
also has the tigris running through its territory but being 
upstream syria could keep more of the euphrates waters in its own 
reservoirs and allow a trickle to iraq 
syria has made no public statement on the water cut iraq said 
it would send a senior envoy to ankara on sunday to discuss 
problems arising from the reduction in the euphrates flow 
iraq sent its deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoun to turkey 
last month to ask for a cut in the euphrates flow of two weeks 
instead of the planned one month turkey said two weeks was not 
enough time 
hamdoun told reporters that the cutoff would not provoke a 
fullblown crisis in iraqi agriculture but it would still cause 
damage in some areas 
turkish officials have taken an iraqi delegation to the dam 
construction site to explain the situation foreign ministry 
officials said 
turks maintain that since november they have released extra 
water to syria and iraq to allow them to store water in their 
reservoirs for use during the shortfall 
a state waterworks official at the dam site said that since 
november turkey had released 442 billion cubic yards of water 
downstream and 11 billion cubic yards of it had been allowed into 
iraq by syria 
ozal said the construction of the massive dam by turkish workers 
and engineers showed what we are capable of doing 
there has been talk in newspapers and diplomatic circles of 
possible future strains among the countries of the mostly arid 
region since ozal said last summer in an offthecuff remark that 
turkey could block the euphrates river waters to punish syria for 
providing support to kurdish guerrillas waging war for independence 
in southeast turkey 
when completed in 2006 the southeast anatolia project will 
produce 22 billion kwh of electricity annually and irrigate an area 
of 4 million acres 
the additional energy should double the yield of many crops in 
turkey and produce 5 billion worth of surplus in the country 
which is agriculturally selfsufficient officials say 
the first of the ataturk dams eight electricitygenerating 
units is scheduled to go into operation may 1991

communist authorities saturday 
banned a new serbian independent political group and denounced its 
program as nationalist the tanjug news agency reported 
the name of the group is society for the preservation of 
historical truth the serbian language the cyrillic alphabet and 
for the defense of kosovo 
its chairman mirko jovic was briefly detained friday in nova 
pazova 18 miles northwest of belgrade and its leaders were 
harassed by police the groups sources said 
authorities said they banned the society because it abused the 
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of association and fomented 
yugoslav nationalist hatred and intolerance and called for the 
toppling of the foundations of the socialist selfmanaged 
democratic system 
group representatives said a week ago they were planning to 
formally constitute themselves as a party of serbian national 
renewal on jan 27 
vuk draskovic a member of the newly formed partys leadership 
and prominent serbian writer said friday he and jovic had received 
threats after they announced their plans to form a political party 
yugoslav staterun media have launched a campaign against the 
group accusing it of advocating nationalism and bloodshed with 
other yugoslav nationalities especially with the croats 
draskovic denied that his party is nationalist and said the 
campaign represents an organized hysteria by serbian communists 
and their leadership 
even though yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing 
independent political groups and parties to form numerous such 
groups have mushroomed in the past few months 
communist authorities claim some of the new parties have clear 
nationalist programs leading to open clashes between rival yugoslav 
republics

a highliving northern virginia couple 
who lured consumers to visit timeshare resorts with false promises 
of expensive prizes was sentenced to prison for bankruptcy fraud 
and money laundering 
us district judge claude hilton on friday sentenced david a 
defusco 34 of great falls to five years in prison and his wife 
annette 28 to 35 months 
the defuscos hid large sums of money by laundering funds through 
fake corporations rather than tone down their gourmet lifestyle and 
pay off 25 million in debts us attorney henry hudson said 
hudson said the couple fled northern virginia in march 1989 
leaving behind nearly 100 creditors in the washington area as well 
as a stack of lawsuits and consumer fraud complaints their flight 
came shortly before bankruptcy officials acted to seize their 
assets 
they later were discovered in california living in a haven for 
millionaires outside san diego and operating a business similar to 
one that brought on a barrage of consumer complaints here 
hudson said the defuscos received up to 100 each for potential 
customers they lured to visit timeshare condominium resorts with 
promises of nonexistent gifts such as bmw cars and gold bullion 
david defusco in october pleaded guilty in beaumont texas to 
mail fraud and conspiracy charges and is awaiting sentencing there 
under a court agreement he will spend an additional 70 months 
to 87 months in jail for organizing what prosecutors said was a 
720 billion fraud scheme 
prosecutors arrived at that figure by multiplying the average 
34000 prize offering times the 24 million pieces of mail 
delivered during the scheme 
a business he operated in washington state also has been the 
target of an investigation in recent years 
before sentencing defusco said his success as measured by 
opulent jewelry and luxury cars was the product of what we still 
believe were legitimate business practices prosecutors rejected 
that notion 
these people lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of many 
consumers and many other creditors hudson said 
in the virginia case the defuscos pleaded guilty on oct 20 
prosecutors said the couple used phantom corporations and aliases 
to hide money frozen in bankruptcy proceedings from creditors who 
claimed unpaid debts of 25 million from the defuscos and their 
companies 
after a bankruptcy trustee ordered liquidation of their assets 
last spring the couple sold two cars and moved 250000 worth of 
personal possessions to california and opened their new business 
under assumed names authorities said 
fbi agents who raided their rancho santa fe calif home on 
july 5 found jewelry furs a persian rug worth 15000 and art 
work valued at more than 10000 
defusco admitted diverting 1 million worth of corporate and 
personal assets that had been frozen by a bankruptcy trustee 
mrs defusco admitted diverting 290000 worth of assets as part 
of the scheme with her husband

air force officials are calling for retirement 
of all 450 of the nations minuteman 2 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles in a move to save 400 million a year according to a 
published report 
defense secretary dick cheney has received the green light to 
discuss the proposal with congressional leaders this week before 
any final decision the washington post reported in saturdays 
editions 
an air force spokesman col patrick maloney said saturday when 
asked about the plan that the service does not discuss budget 
proposals until the budget becomes final 
the post quoted officials as cautioning that president bush 
might veto the idea before unveiling his fiscal 1991 budget to 
congress on jan 29 
in another costcutting move cheney on friday froze civilian 
hirings at the defense department saying it was made possible by 
eased world tensions 
department officials however said they did not know how much 
the work force will be reduced by the freeze 
the freeze lasts until sept 30 and applies to all defense 
department civilians worldwide including parttime and temporary 
employees the department currently employs 927000 civilians 
fulltime and another 123000 on a temporary or parttime basis 
up to 80000 workers retire or otherwise leave that work force 
each year the pentagon said 
the minuteman 2 carries a single warhead with an explosive force 
estimated at 12 megatons or the equivalent of 12 million tons of 
tnt the missiles are based at malmstrom air force base mont 
ellsworth air force base sd and whiteman air force base mo 
the minuteman 2 is relatively inaccurate compared with later 
missiles published estimates say half the missiles launched would 
land within 1200 feet to 2000 feet of the point of aim 
similar estimates for the 550 deployed minuteman 3 missiles 
which carry three smaller warheads are from 600 feet to 700 feet 
besides the minuteman the nations landbased missiles include 
50 mx peacekeeper missiles with 10 warheads each counting other 
missiles and bombs the minuteman 2 force represents about 35 
percent of the nations strategic nuclear warheads 
the bush administration has proposed building a new midgetman 
singlewarhead missile that could be moved about on giant trucks 
midgetman proponents say the mobile missiles would be much more 
difficult to hit than known fixed positions such as current 
minuteman silos 
because they are old and inaccurate the minuteman 2 missiles 
have been candidates for retirement for some time the 
administration told congress last summer that a likely strategic 
nuclear arms treaty with the soviet union would mean significant 
reductions in missiles on both sides

president mikhail s gorbachev said 
saturday he no longer objects to the legalization of multiple 
political parties in the soviet union where his communist party 
has held a monopoly on power for 72 years 
i see no tragedy in a multiparty system if and i can tell 
you this straightforwardly it arises as a result of a normal 
historical process and answers the needs of society gorbachev 
told lithuanias communist party 
it was a surprising reversal by gorbachev who had remained 
opposed to the idea of rival political parties even as 
prodemocracy movements forced an end to oneparty communist rule 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
soviet police routinely have broken up demonstrations by the 
democratic union until recently the only soviet organization 
trying to establish itself as an opposition party 
a reason for gorbachevs turnaround could be that multiparty 
systems already exist in lithuania and latvia the party ideology 
chief in the third baltic republic estonia has said the same is 
inevitable there 
lithuania was the first to legalize other political parties and 
lithuanian communists will face them in february elections to the 
lithuanian parliament 
gorbachev came to the baltic republic in an effort to persuade 
the lithuanian communist party to reverse its decision last month 
to break with the central communist party 
the threeday visit ended with the lithuanians refusing to 
budge the president concluded saturdays party meeting with the 
statement we have laid a good foundation for continuing the 
dialogue he then returned to moscow 
gorbachev pleaded for unity in both the party and the soviet 
union but faced proindependence demonstrators at every stop and 
clearly had no significant effect on public opinion 
lithuanians strongly support independence for the republic 
which was forcibly annexed in 1940 while occupied by the red army 
the communist party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a 
news conference after the meeting that elaboration on gorbachevs 
statement on multiple parties will be contained in an article 
written by gorbachev and due to appear in the soviet press 
possibly as early as sunday 
communists have held exclusive power in the soviet union since a 
few months after the 1917 russian revolution a number of parties 
operated in the last years of the czars reign but had little 
power and a number competed for control during the turbulent year 
of revolution itself 
gorbachevs statement was the first indication the soviet union 
might catch up with the wave of political reform that has been 
sweeping eastern europe in recent months 
poland east germany hungary and romania have all eliminated 
the communists guaranteed hold on political power and either 
formed multiparty systems or scheduled free elections 
gorbachev has made clear his willingness to end the communists 
legal guarantee on political power codified in the soviet 
constitution but until now he expressed scorn for a multiparty 
system 
on friday he told an audience in siauliai lithuania havent 
you and i seen and known during our long life that even with 10 or 
20 parties the most cruel dictatorships formed and flourished 
and will a multiparty system save society no it is the 
regime that determines who lives how and who breathes how 
gorbachevs reversal was his second surprising announcement on 
the lithuanian tour on thursday he said a law was being drafted 
to set up a mechanism for republics to secede from the soviet union 
he promised that the lithuanian people would be allowed to 
choose their own fate and predicted they would remain in the union 
once they realize the financial costs and human dislocation that 
secession would cause 
in a long speech to the lithuanian communists gorbachev said 
separatists were in too much of a hurry 
think a thousand times before embarking on an independent 
drift without a compass without a map a fuel reserve or a 
competent crew he said 
in a lecturing tone gorbachev also warned there is no 
absolute freedom and you wont find absolute independence 
anywhere everything in the world is interrelated 
lithuanian communist party chief algirdas brazauskas said in his 
speech that events forced his party to split with the national 
communist party 
comprehensive analysis of the political situation throughout 
the republic convinced us that only an independent communist party 
could hold the trust of the residents of lithuania and only on 
that basis could it remain a serious political force he said 
in the end gorbachev invited the breakaway lithuanians to the 
next national party congress in october implying the meeting might 
adopt enough reforms to bring them back into the fold 
the invitation might be to gorbachevs advantage since the 
lithuanians are likely to back him against conservative opponents 
in the congress

l douglas wilder became the nations first 
elected black governor saturday and said his inauguration at the 
spot where the confederacy collapsed almost 125 years ago shows 
oppression can be lifted 
we mark today not the victory of party or the accomplishments 
of an individual but the triumph of an idea wilder said in his 
inaugural address outside the virginia capitol which was capital 
of the confederacy in the civil war the idea that all men are 
created equally 
wilder a lawyer and democratic former legislator and lieutenant 
governor who turns 59 wednesday took the oath of office from 
retired us supreme court justice lewis f powell jr a richmond 
native who headed the citys school board during the period of 
resistance to school integration 
wilder who is divorced was flanked by his two daughters and 
son as he took the oath a largely black crowd estimated by police 
at more than 35000 was more than double attendance at the 1985 
inauguration 
wilder said his inauguration represents a triumph for ideals 
expressed in the declaration of independence by thomas jefferson a 
virginia governor during the revolutionary war 
if these words about freedom are to be heard at all today i 
hope they will be heard by the young people of this commonwealth 
wilder said 
i want them to know that oppression can be lifted that 
discrimination can be eliminated that poverty need not be binding 
that disability can be overcome he said 
and the offer of opportunity in a free society carries with it 
the responsibility of hard work the rejection of drugs and other 
false highs and a willingness to work with others whatever their 
color or national origin he continued 
cheers interrupted wilders 15minute address five times once 
when he proclaimed freedom is meaningless when a womans right to 
choose is regulated outside the dictates of her own faith and 
conscience 
wilders support of abortion rights was a prominent issue in his 
fiercely fought campaign against republican j marshall coleman 
who opposes abortion a recount showed that coleman lost by 6741 
votes or less than half a percent in the closest race for 
governor in the states history 
wilder became the states 66th governor and the first black to 
be elected governor in any state black lt gov pbs pinchback 
served as louisiana governor for 43 days in late 1872 and early 
1873 after the elected governor was impeached 
music for the inaugural ceremony included god bless america 
and america the beautiful but not a note was heard of the 
states official song carry me back to old virginia as a 
freshman state senator in 1970 wilder sought to have the song 
abolished because its lyrics contain the word darkies 
the inauguration was preceded by a prayer service and the 
ceremonial presentation of the keys to the executive mansion by 
outgoing democratic gov gerald l baliles 
jesse jackson and former tennis star arthur ashe a richmond 
native attended the prayer service wilder hadnt let jackson 
campaign on his behalf but wilders press secretary laura 
dillard said jackson was invited to the inauguration because 
its appropriate hes a leading national figure in democratic 
circles 
jackson described the inauguration as a historic moment 
to go from the hull of a slave ship to governor is a great 
american story he said its a great world story 
wilder said an economic slowdown would challenge his 
administration but progress will be possible 
resources employed in the past for the finer things in life 
can be and will have to be deployed for the more serious of our 
needs for we know that freedom is but a word for the man or woman 
who needs and cannot find a job 
wilder said he will tell the state legislature on monday his 
ideas for handling the states projected 900 million revenue 
shortfall over the next two years 
the weekend however was devoted to celebrating his 
inauguration with a parade public reception and inaugural ball 
about 12500 tickets costing 50 or more were sold for the ball 
at the richmond coliseum a protest sign at the inauguration 
referring to the largely poor neighborhood in richmond where wilder 
grew up read is there a ball for church hill 
the eyes of the nation are on virginia said mildred swann 
a hampton social services worker in her 40s during her fourhour 
wait for the ceremony to begin she recalled how she evaded klan 
gunfire as she tried to get fellow blacks in mississippi to 
register to vote in the early 1960s 
for me to see something like this in my lifetime theres 
some hope for the world she said when wilder was introduced 
she bowed her head and cried

president ion iliescu on saturday 
reversed a decision to ban the communist party calling it a 
hasty decision and instead said the issue will be decided in a 
national referendum 
iliescu responded to widespread protests friday by announcing 
that the communist party the sole ruler of romania from 1948 until 
last month had been outlawed 
in a nationwide television and radio broadcast iliescu said the 
governing national salvation front had been criticized for the 
action and he said the people will decide the fate of the 
communists in a jan 28 referendum 
it was a hasty decision contrary to the democratic spirit 
iliescu said of fridays announcement 
iliescu complained that popular pressures had even led some 
front members to consider resigning 
then we realized that in this way we would leave an open road 
to anarchy and chaos in the country which would be a genuine 
national disaster said iliescu who took office after the 
popular revolution that ousted ceausescu we need the massive 
support of the whole country 
the communist party selfdestructed or was removed from 
political life on dec 22 he added referring to the day 
dictator nicolae ceausescu was overthrown 
the front is against any leading role of any party we are in 
a dramatic moment because we inherited an extremely difficult 
decision from the dictatorship we need patience wisdom and 
unity he said 
the jan 28 referendum also will include the question of whether 
to reinstitute the death penalty which was abolished by the 
revolutionary leadership after the executions of ceausescu and his 
wife elena 
there have been nationwide calls to bring back the death penalty 
by those who feel life imprisonment is too lenient a punishment for 
crimes committed by ceausescu cronies as well as by members of the 
securitate ceausescus dreaded special police 
police said 11 securitate members will stand trial monday in 
timisoara the birthplace of the revolution where street protests 
of official footdragging led the army to assume control friday 
night 
the army controlled the city the birthplace of romanias 
revolution on saturday after local leaders were forced to resign 
amid street protests demanding the ouster of communists from the 
revolutionary government 
the army takeover apparently was an administrative measure and 
did not mean the region was under martial law the armys support 
was crucial to ceausescus overthrow 
shooting continued until friday in timisoara and the city of 
arad near the hungarian border between army units and members of 
ceausescus securitate the yugoslav state news agency tanjug 
reported 
thousands of people took to the streets on friday in bucharest 
timisoara and brasov to demand reinstatement of the death penalty 
for securitate members and to protest the participation of 
communists in the interim government 
no demonstrations were reported in romania on saturday 
lorin fortuna the leader of timisoaras local national 
salvation front council resigned after demonstrators complained 
the council was doing nothing about securitate forces being held 
according to a police official who identified himself only as capt 
streza 
the securitate defendants to be tried in public on monday in 
response to the popular pressure include a general whom streza did 
not name 
the army took power to guarantee law and order and uninterrupted 
municipal services until elections planned by jan 19 streza said 
in a telephone interview quoting maj gen gheorghe popescu 
commander of the armed forces in timis county the countys chief 
city is timisoara 
a new administrative council will be elected by representatives 
of factories and other organizations and institutions within the 
region according to a tanjug report 
all leading members of romanias communist party are under 
arrest for investigation of their role in the regime run with an 
iron hand by ceausescu who was overthrown dec 22 and executed 
christmas day 
the ceausescus threehour trial at an undisclosed location 60 
miles from bucharest was described saturday in the newspaper 
libertatea which carried an interview with niki tedorescu whom it 
identified as their attorney 
they refused any cooperation with us they did not understand 
what we said tedorescu recalled ceausescu kept repeating that 
he did not recognize the tribunal 
they denied they had any property or any luxury property 
said tedorescu who was interviewed at a military hospital where he 
was recovering from a bullet wound received in the fighting in 
bucharest 
after his overthrow romanian media reported the feudal splendor 
in which the ceausescu family lived while their countrymen did 
without the most basic commodities 
i didnt expect them to be so uneducated tedorescu said 
both of them but especially her mrs ceausescu were 
disobeying all the laws of grammar 
mrs ceausescu was touted by the regime as a key intellectual 
with major scientific achievements officially she held a 
doctorate in chemistry 
i was surprised they looked so well even in the state they 
were in trembling with fear i thought that in spite of their age 
they looked better than me and i am much younger 
asked his last words to ceausescu after the death sentence was 
passed tedorescu answered 
according to the law i asked him if he objected to the 
death sentence and he indicated no he was convinced in my 
opinion that he would not be executed 
the ceausescus were executed shortly after the trial

president mikhail s gorbachevs dropping of his 
staunch opposition to oneparty communist rule is a logical 
extension of his drive to permit broader expression of views and 
competitive elections for public office 
but while gorbachevs statement saturday that he can see no 
tragedy in a multiparty system constitutes a recognition of 
existing political reality in some soviet republics it could spawn 
fractious ethnicoriented parties with little concern for the 
union 
and of course it may eventually doom the 70yearold communist 
political apparatus that operates parallel to and wields more 
power than the government at all levels of soviet society 
the kremlins eastern european allies have challenged their own 
communist leaders in recent months and those countries have moved 
far away from the monopolies that used to be held by the ruling 
political cliques 
but in the soviet union where the first democratic reforms 
began nearly five years ago gorbachev and the top leadership have 
steadfastly refused to relinquish the partys position as the only 
legally recognized political entity 
members of the democratic union a tiny but outspoken group that 
brazenly calls itself an opposition party have been routinely 
subjected to detention arrest and even beatings by authorities 
who have learned to tolerate many other forms of dissent 
since the communists obliterated their political opposition in 
the first years after the bolshevik revolution in 1917 the ruling 
party has controlled not just the political sphere but all walks of 
life party membership was a prerequisite to professional 
advancement party officials determined what children were taught 
what people could read and where they could work 
the party now 20 million strong also served as a strong 
unifying force bringing together and exercising power over the 
more than 100 nationalities and ethnic groups that make up the vast 
soviet union 
opponents of multiparty rule have suggested that if the 
communist monopoly were broken the union would disintegrate into 
dozens of parochial parties playing for the support of the narrow 
ethnic groups that concentrate in each republic and region 
the opposing interests of those groups are at the heart of much 
of the unrest that has shaken the country for two years 
as recently as friday only a day before conceding he would be 
willing to tolerate other political parties gorbachev was warning 
of the hazards of such a system and arguing that the communist 
party could serve as a forum for multiple views 
havent you and i seen and known during our long life that 
even with 10 or 20 parties the most cruel dictatorships formed and 
flourished he asked during a visit to a collective farm in 
independenceminded lithuania 
and will a multiparty system save society no it is the 
regime that determines who lives how and who breathes how 
just look he added with only one communist party of the 
soviet union how many opinions we have and how much plurality 
democracy under a oneparty system how many public movements i 
welcome it 
but de facto lithuania already has at least two political 
parties vying for official recognition 
one referred to as the independent communist party of 
lithuania is the majority party in the republic that voted to 
break with moscow and pursue its own course prompting the visit of 
gorbachev and other party leaders in an unsuccessful attempt to 
mend the break 
the other calling itself the communist party of lithuania 
platform cpsu is made up of party stalwarts still loyal to 
moscow who left the republics party and set up their own 
contingent that continues to follow the platform of the soviet 
communist party 
in other republics local popular front groups have fielded 
candidates for legislative posts in opposition to communists and 
in latvia on saturday about 200 environmental activists announced 
the formation of a greens party with goals similar to those of the 
greens in western europe 
in estonia social democrats from several european countries 
held an international conference sponsored by the social democratic 
political organization in that baltic republic 
gorbachev who last may was elected to a fiveyear term as 
president but whose real power still resides in his leadership of 
the party which has no certain tenure refused during the 
congress of peoples deputies session last month to permit the body 
to consider revoking the partys constitutional monopoly on power 
and he has been quick to put down the congress fledgling and 
loosely knit opposition which calls itself the interregional 
group 
but the kremlin chief is by his own account a political realist 
and his comments saturday reflected more an acknowledgement of the 
political forces at work than an endorsement of the concept 
i see no tragedy in a multiparty system and i can tell you 
this straightforwardly if it arises as a result of a normal 
historical process and answers the needs of society he said 
we shouldnt be afraid of a multiparty system the way the devil 
fears incense 
still a multiparty system is no panacea what we really need 
is glasnost and democratization and genuine participation of the 
people

tens of thousands of ambulance workers and their 
backers rallied with banners and a brass band saturday to support 
pay demands of the emergency crews in an 18weekold dispute with 
the government 
london ambulance workers who earn 16906 a year after five 
years at work began job actions more than four months ago they 
were suspended on nov 8 and replaced by police and military staff 
when they decided not to respond to nonemergency calls 
although management stopped putting emergency calls through to 
the ambulance workers in many cases the depots remained staffed 
and unpaid crews responded to such calls from hospitals or fire 
stations 
the pay dispute spread through the country and on thursday 60 
workers in west sussex county south of london went on unofficial 
strike 
the death of a man in that district saturday received wide news 
coverage when it was announced it had taken 31 minutes for a fully 
equipped ambulance to reach him 
an estimated 15000 ambulance crew members and their families 
marched saturday along whitehall and into trafalgar square to 
cheers and applause from crowds estimated at 15000 or more 
the march which included banners a brass band and young 
children lent a carnival atmosphere to the government center of 
the capital 
a police inspector said it was one of the biggest rallies held 
in london for many years we could not fit everyone into the 
square so people are packed onto surrounding pavements he said 
ambulance workers have demanded an 11 percent raise and a pay 
formula like those of police and firemen guaranteeing automatic 
raises the government has offered an increase of 9 percent over 18 
months but it says it wont accept the pay formula

four suspected irish republican army guerrillas 
accused of trying to buy a stinger missile in an undercover sting 
may have been attracted to south florida by its reputation for arms 
deals federal officials suggested 
the sting that began last fall culminated in the arrests friday 
of three irishmen and a canadian on arms charges 
all four were being held without bond saturday at the palm beach 
county jail and were to be arraigned tuesday before a us 
magistrate in west palm beach 
the region has never been known for a significant ira presence 
but it usually leads the nation in gun cases said bruce snyder a 
spokesman for the us bureau of alchohol tobacco and firearms in 
miami 
traditionally we are the no 1 area especially for machine 
guns and other highpowered weapons snyder said 
although the miami area has its share of international intrigue 
involving latin america other us cities such as new york boston 
and san francisco have reputations as sympathetic havens for ira 
members and fundraising 
last july 12 authorities arrested three ira technical 
experts in massachusetts new hampshire and pennyslvania and 
seized radar and missile parts 
this is the first one i remember in south florida and ive 
been here since 1969 snyder said this is the first one weve 
had with the ira 
the investigation by the atf the fbi and the customs service 
began in late october after agents received reports that the men 
three of whom lived together at a trailer park in riviera beach 
near palm beach were looking to buy weapons agents said 
south florida certainly has a reputation as a place where 
weapons can be provided atf agent robert creighton said friday 
seamus moley 30 of ireland was arrested outside a west palm 
beach warehouse after handing over 50000 for the 
shoulderlaunched heatseeking stinger which rebels in 
afghanistan used to shoot down soviet warplanes and helicopters 
snyder said 
kevin joseph mckinley 33 and joseph mccolgan 39 also of 
ireland and sean john mccann 39 were arrested a short time 
later the spokesman said 
the missile was borrowed from the military for the sale and 
was supposed to be the first of several transactions with the 
provisional ira or provos the guerrilla arm of the 
nationalist group fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
according to snyder 
they were talking about other military weapons and military 
high explosives he said 
customs and atf agents concocted a similar sting involving 
sophisticated weapons in west palm beach last june when two men 
allegedly sought machine guns and explosives to kill members of a 
rival colombian drug cartel 
i dont think you can take these two instances and draw the 
conclusion that this is a center for terrorist activities 
customs supervisor tim wagner said friday it is however one of 
several places where arms obviously can be purchased 
mckinley moley mccolgan and mccann were charged with violating 
the arms export control act possession of a destructive device and 
conspiracy if convicted each faces up to 25 years in prison and a 
750000 fine 
mckinley moley and mccann lived at the trailer park for at 
least a year and all four worked in the west palm beach area 
the three roommates shook their heads when asked if they were 
guilty as they were led to jail but mccolgan was more talkative 
im just a poor irishman here on holiday and i was entrapped 
by certain people here he said certain people have offered to 
sell me a piece of equipment for the irish republican struggle

pope john paul ii on saturday hailed 
prodemocracy uprisings in warsaw pact nations and the greater 
liberty in the soviet union but he accused western democracies of 
abusing their freedom 
in a wideranging address to diplomats accredited to the holy 
see the pontiff also appeared to indirectly criticize the american 
invasion of panama for the harm it caused civilians 
he praised us and soviet leaders for improvements in 
superpower relations and called for greater religious rights in 
islamic countries 
the popes annual address to the diplomats is generally his most 
detailed comment on the state of world politics 
the holy see has greeted with satisfaction the great 
transformations that particularly in europe have recently marked 
the lives of so many people the polishborn pontiff said 
warsaw moscow budapest berlin prague sofia and bucharest 
have become like the stages of a long pilgrimage toward 
liberty john paul said 
we must render homage to the people who at the cost of 
immense sacrifices courageously carried this out and to the 
political authorities who favored it 
the pope did not mention any leaders by name but he appeared to 
be extending clear support for the liberal policies of mikhail s 
gorbachev whom he met in december in the first encounter between a 
pontiff and a soviet leader 
in contrast to the glowing comments about eastern europe the 
pontiff said western democracies often do not know how to use their 
liberties and instead embrace such countervalues as egoism 
hedonism racism and materialism 
the newcomers to freedom and democracy should not be let down 
by those who are considered veterans john paul said in french 
while praising the uprisings in eastern europe the pontiff 
warned of ethnic and nationalist passions unleashed by movements 
for greater liberty 
the consequences of the second world war call us to 
vigilance he said centuryold rivalries can still resurge 
conflicts among ethnic minorities can inflame anew nationalist 
feelings can be exacerbated 
turning to superpower relations the pontiff said his contacts 
with us and soviet leaders had revealed their will to build 
international cooperation on a more secure foundation 
on the subject of panama he appeared to criticize the us 
invasion that ousted dictator gen manuel antonio noriega 
there once again it is the civil population that has 
suffered the most john paul said it is to be hoped that 
without delay the panamanian people can recover a normal life 
with the dignity and liberty that are the right of a sovereign 
people 
the pontiff called on islamic countries to provide greater 
religious rights and a bigger role in public life for their 
christian minorities 
the pope also touched on the following areas 
africa john paul praised the holding of elections in namibia 
and the negotiations to end conflicts in angola and mozambique he 
said political reforms in south africa had to be better 
translated into reality 
he also decried the wars in the sudan and ethiopia that were 
aggravating famines there 
latin america the pope said the holding of democratic 
elections in chile and brazil were an important step he 
condemned the slaying of six jesuit priests in el salvador and said 
it was a suicidal illusion to think that violence could solve 
the countrys problems he also assailed violence and terrorism in 
peru and colombia 
middle east the pontiff said the situation of lebanon remained 
precarious and that the palestinians in gaza and the west bank 
were still submitted to suffering that is difficult to accept 
he said the israelipalestinian problem could only be resolved 
through negotiations recognizing the legitimate aspirations of 
both sides 
far east john paul called for a peaceful resolution of the 
cambodian and sri lankan conflicts he encouraged vietnams recent 
opening toward the west and greater tolerance of religious 
activity the church and the holy see are obviously ready for all 
dialogue that could improve the situation in that country he 
said

the first surgeon to implant the jarvik 
artificial heart says he might use it again if a patients life 
were threatened even though the food and drug administration has 
withdrawn its approval 
i have an option of either disobeying the law and helping a 
dying patient or letting the patient die because im scared of 
what the fda will do to me said dr william c devries 
if it comes to a matter of you getting slapped on your wrist 
and saving a patients life youd rather get slapped on the 
wrist 
the fda said last week it was withdrawing approval of the 
devices use after inspections revealed serious deficiencies in 
the way symbion inc the jarviks manufacturer was carrying out 
studies with the device 
the fda cited shortcomings in quality control researchsite 
monitoring training of personnel and reporting of adverse 
reactions 
devries said friday he believes the jarvik is scientifically a 
sound device and it keeps people alive that would normally die 
he would refuse to use the device if he found problems affecting 
the quality of the artificial heart he added 
but i dont intend to have my patients suffer because i dont 
have a device available the louisvillebased surgeon said 
the head of the transplant and artificialheart program at the 
university of arizona dr jack copeland also said last week he 
would consider continued use of the artificial heart because he 
believes there is no scientific basis for the fdas decision 
devries said he asked the fda what he should do about carl e 
bryant a suburban louisville man who received a jarvik 770 on 
dec 22 as a bridge to a heart transplant he said the fda told 
him you go ahead with what youre doing 
devries said the jarvik has been used by 37 clinical 
investigators and implanted as a bridge to a transplant more than 
150 times making it one of the leading devices being used to buy 
time for patients who need heart transplants 
devries was the only surgeon in the united states authorized by 
the fda to perform permanent implants of artificial hearts 
he implanted the jarvik7 into the chests of barney clark the 
worlds first artificial heart patient william schroeder murray 
haydon and jack burcham schroeder of jasper ind lived 620 days 
after receiving his jarvik7 nov 25 1984 becoming the longest 
living receipient of the artificial heart 
the last permanent artificial heart recipient was burcham who 
died 10 days after the implant on april 14 1985 
devries artificial heart research is funded by humana inc a 
louisvillebased healthcare chain that lured him from the 
university of utah several years ago devries said humana supports 
his intention to explore the possibility of using other mechanical 
assist devices as well the jarvik 
but the surgeon notes it would take months to gain the 
necessary approval to switch 
humanas commitment is to research on artificial hearts and 
mechanical assist devices not to the jarvik specifically said 
company spokeswoman susan mcarthur

the number we find dead are obviously very conservative 
numbers said bruce freeman administrator for the marine 
fisheries division of the new jersey department of environmental 
protection 
the ones you find arent necessarily all the ones that died 
some of these may fly into another area and die weeks later or 
months later he said 
exxons wildlife coordinator john launchi said saturday that 
the waterway is clean and the cleanup crew will focus on sopping up 
oil in the marshlands 
the cleanup effort is lessening because weve recovered all 
the oil from the arthur kill he said but the maintenance work 
will go on for a long time 
the fish and other organisms that have evolved to survive in the 
longpolluted waterways may not be able to take this latest punch 
said judith weis a rutgers university doctor of zoology who has 
studied the waterway for 10 years 
they may not be able to produce as well their eggs may not 
hatch properly she said we are looking at the few survivors 
as it is think of them as the heroes who have managed to persist 
in this dreadful place 
now they could be pushed over the brink 
ms weis who is on leave from rutgers and working at the 
national science foundation in washington said i would 
certainly not predict that the populations will be totally wiped 
out i can predict that their populations will be sharply reduced 
as the food supply becomes more scarce birds will be forced to 
fly to areas such as the hackensack meadowlands to survive said 
peter dunne spokesman for the new jersey audubon society that 
will force birds that normally migrate there to make room for the 
arthur kill birds 
you can think of it as musical chairs and somebody just pulled 
one of the chairs out of the room dunne said eventually 
someone lands on the floor 
new jersey sued exxon on friday to recover damages from the oil 
companys spill and officials left open the possibility of filing 
criminal charges 
exxon in response to the threat of a lawsuit by new york said 
it will pay for appropriate environmental studies of its oil 
spill and that it has accepted responsibility for damages for 
which it is liable 
new york attorney general robert abrams held off on the suit but 
said he would not hesitate to file court papers if exxon goes back 
on its word 
exxons violations of new york states navigation and 
environmental conservation laws and the federal clean water act are 
obvious and incontestable and have created a minialaska in the 
arthur kill abrams wrote to exxon 
last march an exxon tanker ran aground on a reef an spilled 11 
million gallons into alaskas pristine prince william sound 
in new jersey officials say exxon has not refused to pay for 
costs involved with the cleanup and restoration of the area but 
the company has not agreed either 
the state is incurring substantial costs said john hagerty 
spokesman for the new jersey department of environmental 
protection whatever we spend we anticipate exxon paying for 
either voluntarily or pursuant to a court ruling we havent been 
able to put a pricetag on our environment yet 
the epa gave exxon until wednesday to explain how the spill 
occurred what the companys response was to protect the 
environment and what is being done to restore the environment epa 
spokeswoman kim helper said her agency was particularly concerned 
that exxon initially estimated only 5000 gallons of oil had 
spilled 
exxon officials originally blamed a faulty leakdetection alarm 
for allowing so much oil to spill undetected but on tuesday they 
revised that assessment saying the device was oversensitive but 
not faulty and said its attorneys advised them not to say anything 
further on the cause 
exxon spokesman phil wetz said the company also would not 
comment on the proposed epa fines or on the new jersey lawsuit

a top justice department lawyer who played a role 
in the oliver north case was named saturday to help lead the 
prosecution of ousted panamanian dictator manuel noriega on drug 
charges 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said deputy us solicitor general 
william c bryson and two miami assistants would lead the 
prosecution team and removed himself from the case 
lehtinen said at a news conference that he never planned to 
prosecute noriega despite appearing as cocounsel at noriegas 
arraignment 
my approach has always been to assemble teams of experienced 
assistants to win the many long complex cases we face here the 
prosecutor said the noriega case has been no different 
noriega who surrendered jan 3 to us troops who invaded 
panama is accused of using his country to protect shipments of 
cocaine drugprocessing chemicals and drug money he is believed 
held in a basement apartment at the federal courthouse the 
february 1988 indictment named 15 other people 
bryson will coordinate the drafting of briefs and argument of 
legal issues in the case lehtinen said 
bryson is a former law clerk to supreme court justice thurgood 
marshall and has been with the justice department since 1978 he 
was named deputy solicitor general in 1986 after heading the 
criminal appellate section 
he was acting solicitor general last year and during that time 
wrote the governments supreme court brief urging the justices to 
overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision guaranteeing a womans 
right to an abortion 
bryson was also involved last year in the attorney generals 
effort to prevent leaks of classified information at former white 
house aide norths irancontra trial 
classified information is a concern in the noriega case because 
of the fallen panamanian rulers long association with the cia 
lehtinen said all information needed to successfully prosecute 
the case will be provided to prosecutors 
the united states government has every intention of providing 
all material necessary for the prosecution he said mr bush 
has said that 
defense attorneys already are asking for classified materials 
lehtinen has said 
also named to head the team were assistant us attorneys 
michael patrick pat sullivan and myles h malman both longtime 
miami prosecutors 
lehtinen said attorney general richard thornburgh did not order 
him off the case although unidentified justice department sources 
in washington expressed reservations last week about lehtinens 
ability to run the busy miami office and handle a trial expected to 
last up to six months 
lehtinen said it was his decision to not try the case 
there are a number of other major drug whitecollar crime 
public corruption and other cases pending in the southern district 
of florida and in my role as chief federal prosecutor for this 
district i could not devote the time to the noriega case that would 
be needed for its proper presentation to the court he said

some of the estimated 35000 people who 
jammed the capitol grounds for gov l douglas wilders 
inauguration couldnt see the ceremony and had to strain to hear 
the oath of office but it didnt matter 
they got what they came for a feeling of being a part of 
history seeing the nations first elected black governor take 
office 
im a little disappointed we couldnt get any closer said 
lillian wiggins of washington dc but the fact that i brought 
my grandchildren and that its an historic occasion makes it 
important that we stay 
she added well go home and see what happened on television 
the crowd was more than twice as large as the one that saw 
wilders predecessor gerald l baliles take office four years ago 
as they waited for the ceremony to begin many in the crowd 
commented that the weather was ideal temperatures were in the 30s 
but seemed warmer to bundledup spectators who were jammed 
shouldertoshoulder in bright sunshine 
security was tight with police guarding entrances to the 
grounds and ushering spectators to ropedoff areas latecomers were 
stuck with bad vantage points even if they had tickets for 
bleachers reserved for 3500 invitees 
we had tickets but we showed up late and they wouldnt let us 
in said nolan dawkins a judge from alexandria the dawkins 
children were glad they came anyway because they got to see the 
parade of marching bands and military units that followed the 
swearingin ceremony 
i wanted to come because i want to tell my kids about this 
when i grow up said kelli dawkins 9 i want to tell them i 
was there to see the first black governor 
kellis sense of history was lost however on 3yearold sister 
ashley asked if she knew who doug wilder was ashley replied 
kellis friend 
rachel wheaton didnt make the mistake ms wiggins and the 
dawkins family made the petersburg high school history teacher and 
72 students staked out places front and center at 8 am four 
hours before the ceremony 
some of these kids got up at 430 this morning ms wheaton 
said some of them asked off their weekend jobs so they could 
attend and others gave up their free saturdays because they know 
this is historic not only for virginia but for the nation 
savannah williams a cultural anthropologist from surry was 
first in line for one of about 300 available seats for a 9 am 
prayer service at st pauls episcopal church across from the 
capitol 
ive been standing here in the cold since 715 ms williams 
said africans first came here in 1619 and now its 1990 i

for months american red cross officials 
were mystified by weekly donations of 1 or less from an anonymous 
contributor who has sent in 17 thus far for victims of hurricane 
hugo 
recently they discovered the benefactor is dalbey marsh 51 a 
mentally handicapped man who lives in rossiter and ekes out the 
contributions from his social security income now the red cross 
wants to give him special thanks 
we are going to send him some stuff and a certificate thanking 
him for helping us out said glenn ellis executive director of 
the charleston sc red cross 
what i told him is how much we appreciate that dollar we got 
from him each week even more than the big donations because we 
knew it really came from his heart he may have his troubles but 
he really cares about people said ellis 
im glad to humbly do good to help the poor and help end 
suffering marsh said saturday i just wanted to be generous 
and help out its just because i want to be nice i have my 
troubles too and some of those used to be pretty bad but i am a 
christian and i try to be kind 
marsh moved to a personal care home 3 years ago after spending 
20 years at a state hospital in torrance 
red cross officials had been baffled about the donations since 
they began arriving in september the drawnout scrawl on the 
envelopes led them to believe that the mystery donor was a child 
marshs identity was learned with the help of dolores comstock 
rossiters postmaster 
ms comstock said marsh has made many trips over the past few 
years to her main street post office to mail money to various 
charities when he was unable to donate a dollar bill she taped 
his change to a piece of cardboard 
id notice he would send a dollar or change to the helen 
keller foundation she said he had seen ads on tv that money 
helps buy vitamin a to eradicate blindness in children in third 
world countries he was concerned about children becoming blind 
after hurricane hugo ripped costal south carolina in september 
claiming 29 lives and causing nearly 6 billion in damage marsh 
asked ms comstock where he could send contributions 
i thought of a couple of agencies and he chose the red 
cross she said hes on a limited disability income but he 
sends off little bits and pieces of what he has 
marsh said he also sent money to help earthquake victims in san 
francisco 
i like to think what i send helps but if i cant do it i 
pray about it marsh said i hug the bible and say lord 
someone needs your comfort in some ways the lord has watched 
over me 
because of publicity over the past few days marsh has been busy 
taking telephone calls from reporters but he said he wont let the 
attention go to his head 
i even got my face on tv he said but my reward will be 
in heaven i prefer to wait until heaven for a great reward awaits 
me there

donald trump said saturday he and partners 
will raze the landmark ambassador hotel site of robert kennedys 
murder and a faded glamor palace to build a major office hotel 
and residence complex 
the new york billionaires plan and endorsements by mayor tom 
bradley and two key city councilmen seemed to spell doom for the 
oncegrand edifice which closed a year ago 
residents concerned about vanishing cultural heritage had urged 
preservation of the hotel and school district officials wanted to 
buy the 23acre site on wilshire boulevard for a badly needed new 
high school 
the project which was portrayed as in the earliest stages of 
planning will probably include a hotel office space shopping 
areas and residential buildings trump said 
the new york citybased real estate magnate revealed his 
investment in the project at a news conference in the east garden 
room of the 494room hotel which opened in 1921 
it was in an ambassador kitchen on june 5 1968 that kennedy a 
new york senator and democratic presidential candidate was 
assassinated by sirhan sirhan moments after claiming victory in the 
california primary 
though it once counted us presidents among its guests and its 
famous cocoanut grove nightclub was a watering hole for hollywood 
legends the lobby area was now the only place fit for people to 
gather trump said 
the hotel site was purchased last september for 64 million by 
wilshire center partners who include irish real estate developer 
robin power and new york developer and investor scott malkin 
trump whose involvement was rumored a month ago was announced 
as the new managing partner of what is now trump wilshire 
associates 
he would not estimate the projects cost but anticipated no 
problem in financing it 
ill be investing a substantial amount of money in the project 
over a period of years he said i think were going to have a 
very very easy time getting the financing 
the only specific structure envisioned by trump is a 
50000squarefoot cocoanut grove ballroom to fill what he said 
was the need for a really big ballroom in los angeles it would be 
twice the size of the biggest ballroom here 
the plan was firmly backed by mayor bradley councilman nate 
holden whose district includes the ambassador and council 
president john ferraro 
the officials characterized the plan as a way to revitalize the 
declining neighborhood a few miles west of downtown and link the 
downtown business district with the century city complex on the 
citys west side 
i believe it has great potential this stretch of wilshire 
boulevard needs to be reborn said bradley he noted he had asked 
the developers to help find an alternate site for a school in the 
area 
why did it take you so long to find la ferraro asked 
trump 
trump and holden said the land was too expensive for a school 
even if the los angeles unified school district sought to acquire 
it through eminent domain you would have the worlds most 
expensive school trump said 
trump said it was very unlikely that any portion of the 
original structure would be preserved and soundly bashed what 
remained of the ambassadors character 
this is not a good building to be in if there was an 
earthquake it is an old structure and from the safety standpoint 
you wouldnt be allowed to build a building like this today 
he said 
second of all its not according to most the aesthetic 
building that really we should have at this site its so old and 
so dilapidated and so run down and its been leaking its 
really in very bad shape 
he said virtually every world class architect was vying for the 
job of designing the new project and he expected cultural heritage 
buffs would love the result

maoist guerrillas stopped a bus in the 
southern andean highlands ordered the passengers out and shot and 
killed two french tourists police said saturday 
four other foreign tourists were killed under similar 
circumstances in the same area last year

the two french tourists left lima four days ago police said 
the region where the two were traveling has been declared an 
emergency zone by the government giving broad powers to the 
military to fight leftist rebels 
the us embassy and other embassies have issued warnings urging 
tourists not to travel to the emergency zones which account for 
nearly a third of the territory of peru 
two german tourists were killed in the same area in may last

twelve people who were exposed to the metal 
beryllium while working at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
have contracted a deadly lung disease according to an energy 
department study obtained by a newspaper 
eight current rocky flats workers and four retired employees 
tested positive for berylliosis the denver post reported in its 
sunday editions 
they were among more than 750 employees at the federal complex 
16 miles northwest of denver who have handled beryllium a metal 
used in the manufacture of plutonium triggers so far diagnostic 
tests have been given to 391 of those workers 
no deaths have been reported but the incurable disease usually 
proves fatal to 30 percent of those who contract it doctors said 
the disease was discovered during a 2 million medical study of 
rocky flats financed by the energy department and the national 
institutes of health 
researchers say it is the biggest workforce study of berylliosis 
to date and is scheduled to be completed in 1993 
the study is being overseen by denver doctors from the national 
jewish center for immunology and respiratory medicine and the 
university of colorado medical school 
this study will have an impact on every beryllium operation in 
the world said dr lee newman an assistant cu medical professor 
leading the research with dr kathleen kreiss of national jewish 
the energy department released records on the study after the 
post requested them under the freedom of information act 
beryllium is a strong lightweight metal that increasingly is 
being used in nuclear aerospace telecommunications and computer 
industries as well as in ceramics dental alloys car parts and 
golf clubs 
berylliosis is difficult to detect because it usually remains 
dormant for 10 years after the metal lodges inside the body the 
denver researchers are trying to develop tests that will warn the 
energy department if a worker is susceptible to the disease 
contact with finished beryllium products isnt hazardous newman 
said but an estimated 800000 american workers have been exposed 
to beryllium dust in 93000 private and government plants across 
the nation and are considered at risk for the disease 
the environmental protection agency ranks beryllium 28th among 
the mostused substances linked to cancer in industry 
at rocky flats the energy department has spent 2 million in 
the past four years on a program to improve safety conditions and 
reduce airborne beryllium concentrations in manufacturing areas 
said department spokesman pat etchart at rocky flats 
weve installed highvelocity lowvolume ventilation systems 
and more efficient containment hoods in process areas etchart 
said a safety training program for all workers in those areas 
has also been initiated and medical monitoring was strengthened 
but during an environmental audit of the plant last summer 
energy department investigators cited rocky flats for not following 
federal and state procedures in monitoring beryllium emissions from 
smokestacks 
rocky flats new operator egampg inc said it is protecting 
workers from airborne beryllium dust by insisting on a factory 
standard twice as tough as the guideline set by the occupational 
safety and health administration 
newman said protection programs at rocky flats were improved 
after the first case was discovered there in 1984 he believes 
the safety setup is pretty good now for beryllium at rocky 
flats 
about 2 percent to 5 percent of all workers exposed to beryllium 
eventually develop the disease researchers say

more than a year after pan am flight 103 
blew up over lockerbie police officials from that scottish town 
came to the united states to brief relatives of the bombings 
victims on saturday 
about 130 people showed up at the st charles hotel in this town 
about 30 miles south of albany to hear chief constable george esson 
of lockerbie give details of his departments investigation 
better late than never said bert ammerman president of 
victims of pan am flight 103 
the group ammerman heads is made up of relatives of the 259 
people killed when a bomb smuggled aboard flight 103 exploded over 
lockerbie on dec 21 1988 eleven more people were killed on the 
ground as debris from the exploded jet rained down on the scottish 
village 
esson said he and two other investigators traveled to the united 
states because ammerman a resident of river vale nj requested 
that they inform families individually in a way the us government 
had seemed unwilling to do 
victims of pan am flight 103 came together after the crash in 
part because the families were frustrated by the lack of 
information coming from their own government 
weve not only lost loved ones but the love of our country 
and the feeling that our country would be there for us said bill 
monetti of chatham nj whose nephew rick monetti was killed in 
the crash 
we have a government that would like this to be an invisible 
episode said georgia nucci of hudson who lost her son chris 
jones 
however many family members who showed up said they were 
encouraged that agents from the fbi and a member of the 
presidential commission on security aviation and terrorism showed 
up at the briefing 
ammerman whose brother tom was killed in the bombing said he 
would like to see us law enforcement agencies act more like their 
counterparts in scotland 
todays meeting was a major step forward in having appropriate 
agencies extending themselves to the families he said 
informational packets were handed out to the families at a 
closeddoor briefing saturday morning the contents of the packets 
were not revealed but esson said that catalogues were included 
listing items recovered at the crash site that are still unclaimed 
about 15 percent of the personal effects of the victims is still 
in storage in lockerbie esson said 
nucci said the closeddoor meeting also featured videos showing 
a reconstruction of the bombed out portion of the plane and the 
memorial service held last dec 21 in lockerbie to mark the 
oneyear anniversary of the crash 
a presidential commission has been investigating the disaster 
since last august their report is tentatively due on may 1

suburban baltimore residents were shaken by 
tremors from a rare light earthquake on saturday said a 
spokeswoman for the us geological survey 
an earthquake with a magnitude of 25 on the richter scale 
occurred at 448 pm est in the baltimore area said usgs 
spokeswoman pat jorgenson 
the epicenter of the quake was about 15 miles northwest of 
downtown baltimore she said 
the richter scale is a measure of the energy released during 
ground motion caused by an earthquake an earthquake of magnitude 2 
is the smallest normally felt by humans and usually causes no 
damage 
california probably has several hundred daily in this range 
said jorgenson explaining there were no damages or injuries 
reported 
jorgenson said scientists at the national earthquake center in 
golden colo were a bit surprised when they began getting 
calls from residents in randallstown and ellicott city md who 
felt the tremors 
scientists are very sure this was an earthquake because they 
verified it on seismograms from the east coast the spokeswoman 
said 
the last probable reported earthquake in the baltimore area was 
in 1939 according to usgs records 
im surprised they area residents even knew it was an 
earthquake since it wouldnt feel like anything more than a truck

louisiana republicans on saturday endorsed a 
new orleans state senator to challenge incumbent us sen j 
bennett johnston decisively rejecting a bid by a former ku klux 
klan leader to gain the nomination 
delegates at the statewide convention picked state sen ben 
bagert over three other announced candidates secretary of state 
fox mckeithen state rep quentin dastugue of metairie and state 
rep david duke of metairie the former klan leader 
the final vote showed bagert with 451 of the conventions 792 
delegate votes followed by dastugue with 183 mckeithen with 99 
duke with 52 and new orleans businessman pat taylor with three 
there were four abstentions 
we have the energy and experience and the guts to lead a 
willing campaign bagert said in accepting the nomination 
bagert 46 had been considered the frontrunner for the party 
nomination after winning commitments from than 350 of the 540 
delegates chosen at party caucuses statewide on dec 9 
the delegates elected at the caucuses however had not been 
required to support the candidate they said they would vote for 
duke 39 won no more than 50 delegates at the caucuses and 
party officials said previously he had little support among party 
regulars he said he would oppose johnston regardless of whether he 
won the gop endorsement 
i believe that i can beat bennett johnston i believe that i 
can attract people who have not come to our party yet duke said 
after bagert was nominated 
duke elected to the state house last year as a republican has 
ties to neonazi groups and currently is president of the national 
association for the advancement of white people 
the partys endorsed candidate for next octobers general 
election could gain access to many resources from both the state 
and national republican party campaign committees including lists 
of potential donors and volunteers 
political analysts have said it would take such a major 
commitment to beat johnston a threeterm democrat who heads the 
senate energy and natural resources committee he has been in 
office since 1972 and won reelection with 86 percent of the vote 
in a 1984 race against minor opponents 
however state gop chairman william nungesser has said johnston 
can be beaten this time in spite of a multimilliondollar campaign 
treasury 
we have all these people wanting to run because bennett is 
vulnerable said nungesser 
any republican or democrat can run in the oct 6 open primary 
against johnston each gop candidate except duke had said he 
would not run unless he is the partys nominee 
the nonpartisan primary serves as the general election unless 
no one receives a majority then the top two votegetters enter a 
runoff regardless of party affiliation

fraternities on the middlebury college 
campus must admit women or close the schools board of trustees 
voted unanimously on saturday 
i think it represents an imaginative creative thoughtful and 
workable approach to a series of concerns on this campus that have 
been with us for a long time said college president olin robison 
a review of the role of fraternities on campus was prompted by 
outrage more than a year ago when members of the delta upsilon 
fraternity hung a bloodied female mannequin over the balcony of 
their house during a party 
robison said while there had been other concerns about sexism on 
campus in recent years the incident with the mutilated mannequin 
certainly galvanized campus opinion that something needed to 
be done 
in a statement the board said any social organization that 
discriminates on the basis of gender or whose practices have the 
consequences of exclusion on the basis of gender are antithetical 
to the mission of the college and not appropriate as a mode for our 
society at large 
tom dubreuil house director of the delta upsilon fraternity 
said in a prepared statement that the trustees decision has given 
the local and national chapters an extremely challenging task 
the decision does show that the majority of students want to 
keep fraternities on campus dubreuil said i expected a much 
more negative response to the future of fraternities and i think 
the trustees have made the fairest decision they could 
under the boards decision fraternities must have had their 
national rules changed on exclusionary policies or have severed all 
connections with their national organization to be allowed on 
campus after dec 31 
if a fraternity succeeds in getting its national organization to 
change the rules to admit women with equal rights it may retain 
its greek letters if not the fraternity buildings will be offered 
to other coeducational student groups and be known as houses 
robison said 
fraternities have until the end of march to decide whether to 
comply with the boards decision 
middlebury college a small liberal arts school located about 
35 miles south of burlington has featured fraternities since the 
turn of the century sororities have not been part of campus life 
since the 1960s although middlebury has been coeducational for a 
century robison said 
robison who is retiring as president this year said 
endorsement of the trustees action by directors of the alumni 
association board of directors gives the decision more weight 
the association said president william kieffer in a statement 
believes that all middlebury alumni will accept this as an 
excellent solution to a very difficult issue

a prominent leftist salvadoran politician 
who fled his nation because of threats on his life was found shot 
to death near the guatemalael salvador border after he was 
reported kidnapped officials said saturday 
a guatemalan politician and lawyer who was with the salvadoran 
when he reportedly was abducted also was found dead officials said 
no one claimed responsibility for the slayings salvadoran and 
guatemalan politicians blamed rightwing paramilitary groups that 
operate in both countries but el salvadors leftist guerrillas 
blamed salvadoran president alfredo cristianis rightist republican 
nationalist alliance party and its founder roberto daubuisson 
the guerrillas who last week said they were willing to renew 
peace talks with the cristiani government said they now are having 
second thoughts 
guatemalan police confirmed the deaths but would not comment 
further 
the body of hector oqueli colindres 45 deputy 
secretarygeneral of the national revolutionary movement in el 
salvador was discovered friday night in jalpatagua a city 60 
miles east of guatemala city officials said 
oqueli had been shot in the head a spokesman for the leftist 
national revolutionary movement said in el salvador the other 
victim was identified as gilda flores a guatemalan who was driving 
oqueli to the airport in guatemala city when they disappeared early 
friday 
party officials said both were kidnapped by armed men 
we are not interested in helping the fascist regime wash its 
face to seek us military aid and further its plan of annihilating 
all types of opposition said the salvadoran rebels the 
farabundo marti national liberation front in a statement made 
public in mexico city 
the statement referred to cristianis scheduled visit to 
washington this week el salvador depends heavily on us economic 
and military assistance 
the fmln said it doubted justice will be done in oquelis 
slaying or the killing of six jesuit priests nov 16 and this 
leads us to revise our offer for a dialogue 
with his us visit about to start cristiani on saturday 
identified four officers and five enlisted men as the prime 
suspects in the jesuit killings 
the fmln had proposed a meeting within 30 days to renew 
ceasefire talks and the government accepted the offer it was one 
of several unsuccessful meetings that government representatives 
and guerrilla leaders have held since 1984 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo said in a news release his 
administration severely condemns the assassination of both 
oqueli and flores and pledges to clarify the slayings so that 
such a grave act of violence does not go unpunished 
cerezo also extended condolences to latin american leaders of 
the socialist international currently meeting in managua the 
nicaraguan capital 
oquelis party was part of the socialist international and he 
was its secretary for latin america the organization groups 
moderate leftist noncommunist parties including major european 
parties like west germanys social democrats 
mario solorzano martinez secretarygeneral of guatemalas 
social democratic party to which ms flores belonged said the 
slayings were a combined action of guatemalan and salvadoran 
paramilitary forces 
he said the victims bodies were found along the highway from 
guatemala to the salvadoran border 
the slayings come at a time of increasing political violence in 
el salvador and guatemala where rightist factions have 
longstanding ties the governing rightist party in el salvador 
known by the spanish acronym arena was founded in guatemala in the 
1970s 
the salvadoran politician was reportedly on his way to managua 
where he was to help monitor preparations for the nicaraguan 
election feb 25 
oqueli who arrived thursday in guatemala also was reportedly 
planning to attend a meeting of latin american socialist leaders in 
ecuador 
the leader of the national revolutionary movement guillermo 
ungo was the presidential candidate of a leftist coalition in the 
march elections in el salvador 
ungo blamed both the guatemalan and salvadoran governments for 
the killings 
this crime helps the salvadoran right wing to impede the 
development of democracy in el salvador ungo said in an 
interview with the associated press in managua 
in london visiting leftist leader ruben zamora of el salvador 
said saturday he believed rightwing death squads were responsible 
for killing oqueli 
he did not specifically accuse any group of the killing but he 
claimed that roberto daubuisson the founder of arena was working 
with guatemalans to kill government opponents 
zamora added that in early november there was information mr 
daubuisson was in guatemala working with his rightwing associates 
from there and the minister of defense of guatemala has 
information that mr daubuisson was proposing to take the 
opportunity and to kill all the political opponents of the 
government 
daubuisson has been linked to death squads that killed tens of 
thousands of people over the past decade 
oqueli was a deputy foreign minister in el salvador from october 
1979 until march 1980 when a military coup overthrew the 
government like many other leftists he fled el salvador after the 
coup but he returned in 1987 to participate in politics 
he left again in november as did many salvadoran leftists 
under protection of the venezuelan embassy after he was threatened 
during a major offensive by the farabundo marti national liberation 
front guerrillas 
he had reportedly planned to return jan 20 he is survived by a 
wife and two children

using the invasion to argue that the united states must keep a high 
state of military readiness 
this is not a time when we should naively cut the muscle out 
of our defense posture bush said friday in a speech aimed at 
congress which reconvenes jan 23 after its winter recess 
bush cautioned that despite a relaxation of military tensions in 
eastern europe lawmakers should not expect a peace dividend in 
which defense savings could be funnelled into domestic programs 
unfortunately what is being packaged as a dividend is not 
money in the bank it is more like a possible future inheritance 
bush said in his speech to the cincinnati chamber of commerce

american investors soon might be asked to change 
their personalities to think long term rather than short term to 
invest rather than trade to be patient rather than excited and 
expectant 
its a large order similar in ways to asking a junkie to get 
off the stuff it can be done but it will take lots of time and 
enormous willpower with great temptations and failures along the 
way 
since the 1960s at least americans have been weaned on the 
dreams of quick returns by brokers analysts advisers tipsters 
letterwriters the media and tax laws with enough success 
stories to make it seem the way to go 
you might even add that the proliferation of state lotteries has 
added to the shortterm speculative easy money gambling 
mentality 
oldtime brokers and advisers who taught the other ways were 
left in the shadows their techniques required effort choose 
quality understand the company reinvest dividends be prepared to 
wait five years for a good return 
they warned that inout trading was foolish because the 
temptation to sell was great when the stock was at the bottom and 
to buy when the stock was near the top you cant win that way 
they said besides commissions will kill you 
but they were up against something bigger than they could 
handle whenever people talked about the market somebody would tell 
the story of a friend who made a fortune on a tip of shoeshine 
boys who hit it big of easy money 
besides the big investors were inout traders and look how 
they lived it didnt matter that they were featured in magazines 
only when they hit it big disappearing from view when they lost 
it people love winners not losers 
every day the newspaper brought more excitement featuring the 
winners and how they did it with interpretations and broker 
forecasts of bigger things to come brokers like lots of action 
because action makes commissions 
the shortterm mentality is now pervasive not just in 
securities markets but in attitudes about how to run institutions 
of every sort including the family corporations and the federal 
government 
for millions of families instant gratification was made 
possible by easy credit and until recent years the cost of that 
credit was taxdeductible uncle sam succumbed too he maintained 
his lifestyle with foreign debt 
corporate executives might have wished to think longterm and 
build their companies for the future but to do so might have cut 
into shortterm profits and so they asked what will wall street 
think 
they still might want to invest funds in research and 
development to make a stronger company in the future but if 
shareholders expect dividends now how do you convince them that it 
is better to wait a few years 
some executives are in a different situation they want to spend 
today for a stronger tomorrow but they dont have the wherewithal 
their predecessor borrowed to make acquisitions and interest 
payments now take every nickel available 
bush administration officials especially treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady have indicated they would like to focus on the 
longer term but it will take a massive effort and that effort in 
itself will be long term 
among other things theyve suggested a family savings 
account where interest would accumulate taxfree a taxreduction 
for longterm capital gains would of that nature too but any such 
proposal still faces opposition 
perhaps the most convincing technique of all is to find ways of 
emphasizing the great returns that come from patient longterm 
investing in effect of teaching that time is as important in 
investing as interest rates 
in time and assuming investors do their homework it is 
difficult not to make money in an economy that keeps growing its 
all in the numbers as they say 
in every decade but two in this century the stock market has 
made solid gains far in excess of the inflation rate that is the 
gains were real in terms of spendable income except for the 
1930s and 70s 
in the past 90 years according to wright investors service 
stocks have provided a compound average annual return of 98 
percent or triple the annual inflation rate of 32 percent 
at that rate investments double every seven years and if 
theyre left to double again and again well thats how fortunes 
are made

bombings in the south and random acts of violence and vandalism 
across the country have given rise to fears that a new wave of 
racially and ethnically motivated crime is sweeping the united 
states 
nearly every day brings a fresh report from somewhere from 
portland ore where skinheads were charged with beating a 
15yearold hispanic girl from wellesley mass where two young 
men were arrested for spraypainting swastikas and racist slogans 
on walls from new york city where a gang of white youths was 
charged with killing a black man who crossed into their turf 
new organizations have sprung up to fight racism and police 
judges and legislators are taking a harder look at what they can do 
to prevent such crime 
but among those who closely monitor what are commonly called 
hate crimes there is disagreement about whether racism is 
really resurgent some argue that only the reporting of racial 
crime has increased not the crime itself 
the paradox is that the better you are at reporting the worse 
your picture is going to look said col leonard supenski who 
heads the police crime prevention bureau in baltimore county md 
supenski speaks from experience his police department whose 
beat ranges over 610 square miles from the industrial edge of 
baltimore to horse country near the pennsylvania border was one of 
the first in the nation to begin reporting hate crimes in a 
category of their own 
baltimore county has kept statistics on rres racial religious 
and ethnic incidents since 1979 and its figures show a slight 
increase last year after four years of decline 
the increase could be the result of a more sensitive police 
force quicker to recognize a racist motive behind a crime it 
could be the result of a more trusting public more likely to 
report a crime or it could just be part of what supenski calls the 
ebb and flow of crime 
only a handful of cities around the nation have kept track of 
hate crimes for very long one is new york city where bias 
crimes were down slightly during the first 10 months of 1989 
they had been down sharply until aug 23 when a gang of whites 
surrounded a 16yearold black youth yusuf hawkins and shot him 
to death on a brooklyn street ripples of lesser racial incidents 
tauntings beatings spread across the city 
inspector paul m sanderson who heads the new york police 
departments bias crime unit isnt persuaded that racist crime is 
really changing 
there is no pattern he said 
sanderson 54 is black and recalls hate crime in his youth 
although it wasnt called that 
i grew up here and i know what went on in this city he 
said and i know that if you went up to a cop and said i 
was hit in the head with a baseball bat and i got the injury 
because im black and i was in a white neighborhood hed say 
get out of here kid go on home 
still for every paul sanderson or leonard supenski there are 
others who say racist crime is getting worse they see neonazi 
skinheads pumping new life into the ku klux klan they hear about 
racism sprouting on college campuses and they can tick off lists 
of violent incidents around the country that have nothing in common 
but their motive prejudice 
one such person is bill tafoya who teaches longrange planning 
at the fbi academy in quantico va and moonlights at the 
congressional clearinghouse on the future a sort of institutional 
crystal ball his specialty is civil disorder 
tafoya has a simple test for gauging the ups and downs of 
racism every year he searches a computer database for references 
to four words or phrases racism or racist bigotry 
white supremacy and hate groups 
in 1980 those words appeared 767 times in the new york times 
and the washington post in 1988 the last full year for which 
tafoya has records they appeared 2122 times about a threefold 
increase 
tafoya concedes that those figures alone dont mean there has 
been an increase in racism it could just be increased interest in 
the subject but he believes the increase is real and says other 
researchers agree 
besides police have become interested in hate crime tafoya 
knows because hes constantly asked to lecture to them 
my warning to them is that if they turn away from the issue 
then theyre going to be in a very uncomfortable position of 
being in the middle when the lid blows off he said 
the message is not being ignored more police departments around 
the nation are beginning to follow the lead of baltimore county 
new york city and boston pioneers in establishing special 
programs to fight hate crime 
minneapolis started a bias crime program in 1987 philadelphia 
san francisco and portland ore are among other cities that now 
pay special attention to hate crime 
most such programs have two basic goals to keep separate 
reports on hate crimes so that investigators can spot patterns and 
to assure the public that such crimes will not be tolerated 
if the people dont have a sense that they can go the police 
and go to the courts theyre going to go to the streets 
explained sgt bill johnston who directs the boston police 
departments community disorders unit 
reporting is considered especially important there are no 
national statistics on hate crime now which is one reason that 
people disagree about it a bill pending in congress would require 
the justice department to collect such data 
those who follow the issue closely such as adele dutton terrell 
of the national institute against prejudice and violence say 
passage of the hate crime statistics act is essential 
people pay attention to hate group activity skinheads the 
kkk ms terrell said but when you read about crosses being 
burned into the lawn of a family that just moved in or asians or 
hispanics being harrassed people assume these are isolated cases 
we need the data to show thats not the case 
in the meantime at least 10 states have passed laws in the past 
few years requiring their police departments to collect data on 
hate crimes and lawmakers are finding other ways to battle racist 
crime 
according to the antidefamation league of bnai brith at 
least 31 states have passed laws making ethnic intimidation or 
harrassment a crime at least 34 states have made institutional 
vandalism a crime 
courts are also looking for innovative ways to combat racism in 
eugene ore last year a man convicted of racial intimidation was 
ordered to attend a racial awareness course in addition to serving 
60 days in jail 
and last july in montgomery ala seven ku klux klan members 
agreed to attend a similar course as part of an outofcourt 
settlement of a civil lawsuit filed by the southern christian 
leadership conference 
no one believes these measures are going to end racial hatred or 
stop racial violence that will require more basic social change 
some hold the economic system responsible others say the failure 
has been in the schools still others say any change must take 
place in homes in churches or in peoples hearts 
were doing badly in shaping people and preparing them to go 
out and get along in life and to exist and interact with other 
people in a civilized fashion said sanderson of the nypd 
were all responsible

one thing about your federal income tax return 
never changes you can bet it will never be the same from one year 
to the next 
this year is no exception there are changes affecting children 
as young as 2 and others that will alter the returns of millions of 
retirees there are new forms as well as changes in some familiar 
ones 
all taxpayers will find the bottom line their actual tax 
liability is slightly below what it would have been without some 
of the changes enacted in 1986 including inflation adjustments 
that are still taking effect 
here is a look at some of the changes 
exemptions this is 2000 for 1989 returns up 50 from 1988 a 
taxpayer is allowed one for himself or herself another for a 
spouse and one for each dependent who was alive for at least one 
day last year and meets certain tests a parent may no longer claim 
a fulltime student 24 or older whose income is 2000 or more 
standard deductions a single person who does not itemize 
deductions may claim a standard deduction of 3100 up 100 from 
last year because of inflation for a couple filing a joint return 
the deduction is 5200 for a married person filing separately 
2600 a qualified head of household 4550 a single taxpayer or 
head of household is allowed another 750 if at least 65 years old 
or blind or 1500 if both a couple gets another 600 for each 
spouse who is blind or at least 65 or 2400 if both are blind and 
at least 65 
tax brackets to offset inflationcaused bracket creep the 
brackets have been widened by about 4 percent so that more income 
is taxed at lower rates 
social security number you must list on your return the social 
security number of any dependent child who was 2 or older in 1989 
this requirement which previously applied only to children 5 or 
over is aimed at preventing both separated parents from claiming 
an exemption for the same child 
catastrophic coverage this medical program and the special 
surtax that helped finance it have been repealed ignore the lines 
on your return that refer to the surtax 
mileage the deductible mileage allowance for unreimbursed use 
of a personal car for business is up to 25 cents a mile for the 
first 15000 miles driven in 1989 and 11 cents for subsequent 
travel rates for mileage driven for charitable and medical 
purposes remain at 12 and 9 cents respectively 
telephone you may no longer deduct as a jobrelated expense any 
part of the basic monthly charge for your home telephone a second 
phone line may still be deductible 
interest deduction only 20 percent of consumer interest 
credit cards automobile loans education loans and the like paid 
in 1989 may be deducted there is a separate limit on interest paid 
to buy taxable investments you may deduct investment interest 
totaling up to the amount of net investment income plus 1000 for 
a married person filing a separate return and 2000 for all other 
filers 
earnedincome credit this benefit for lowincome working 
families with children has been raised to a maximum tax saving of 
910 with some credit allowed until income reaches 19340 
childcare credit two new restrictions on this credit which 
helps pay expenses of caring for children so parents may hold a 
job the credit now is available only if the child is under age 13 
any employerpaid reimbursement for child care must be subtracted 
from the expenses on which the credit is calculated 
child taxpayers a parent may file on his or her return the 
income of a child and thus free the child from filing under 
these conditions the child had not yet turned 14 on jan 1 1990 
had income of more than 500 and less than 5000 and all of it was 
from interest and dividends had no tax withheld and made no 
estimated tax payments in 1989

it is a fundamental of economics that when supplies of 
commodities tighten prices rise 
the market for winter wheat may prove another classic case with 
lower than expected plantings threatening to push up prices 
the verdict is already in for floridas orange producers the 
december freeze was more devastating than 1983 and production could 
be slashed to the levels of the mid1960s 
farmers planted about 57 million acres of winter wheat for 
harvest this year up 3 percent from the previous crop according 
to a us department of agriculture report released thursday 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
year it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat 
output 
two years of drought shrunk the nations wheat stockpile to 142 
billion bushels on dec 1 down 17 percent from dec 1 1988 
according to the usda that makes us supplies at their tightest 
since the early 1970s 
a lingering drought in the southern plains states apparently 
caused farmers to plant less acreage than they had the previous 
fall an unexpected development 
dale gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in 
chicago said the lingering dryness in pockets of the plains may 
have already adversely affected the size of the winter wheat crop 
gustafson said the tight supplies and smaller than expected 
planting could result in a bullish market for wheat 
that is something we are not going to know until we find out 
the status of the new crop he said we dont know the extent 
of the weather kill and we dont know what the moisture will be 
gustafson said the wheat inventory could remain tight and the 
market could turn bullish if the weather is uncooperative 
the usda estimated the 1989 corn crop at 75 billion bushels 
which was below expectations and soybean production at 19 billion 
bushels also lower than expected 
the weathers impact on floridas orange crop is already known 
the usda has slashed the 198990 orange harvest by 29 percent 
once projected before the december cold wave at only 130 million 
90pound boxes is now 92 million boxes the smallest estimated 
production since the 196465 season 
the orange crop last season was 146 million boxes 
usda officials say the full extent of the financial damage 
cannot be calculated for months until a full assessment is made of 
damage to trees 
floridas citrus crop was worth 14 billion last season

general motors corp already thickskinned 
about bad publicity from the critical movie roger amp me 
evidently had no qualms proclaiming more cutbacks in its sickly 
us operations while disclosing plans to expand into iberalized 
eastern europe 
gms moves this past week were among the most visible alarm 
signals in the us auto industry where factories are building too 
many cars for too few customers even japanese transplants a major 
competitive threat to the american automakers have said they would 
scale back production 
everyone is very worried about how they respond to the fact we 
can build 4 million cars more than consumers seem to be interested 
in buying said thomas kochan a massachusetts institute of 
technology professor who specializes in the auto industry so the 
companies are all struggling to deal with that problem it suggests 
theres going to be more employment reduction over time 
gm along with big three rivals ford motor co and chrysler 
corp announced shortterm plant closings that will idle nearly 
60000 workers previously announced closings temporarily idled 
more than 127000 workers 
but gm went a step further with a broad new costcutting plan 
that will offer thousands of whitecollar workers early retirement 
limit new hiring and cut advertising 
seprately the auto giant confirmed that it was negotiating over 
a possible joint venture to build cars and engines in hungary 
among the most progressive of the east bloc countries working to 
radically transform their economies 
if completed it would be the first such deal by a big three 
automaker behind what once was known as the iron curtain 
that investment reflected how prosperous gm has been in europe 
where strong demand and rising sales have counterbalanced the 
companys weak sales and declining market share in the united 
states 
but the timing of gms announcements cutting back at home and 
expanding abroad seemed to reflect what some critics of the 
company have called its insensitivity to american workers 
especially those who have been laid off 
gms treatment of its workforce was the subject of roger amp 
me the critically acclaimed documentary is about the impact of 
gm layoffs in flint mich years ago as seen through the eyes of 
filmmaker michael moore who tries to track down gm chairman roger 
smith to talk about it the film playing in theaters nationwide 
is considered a public relations nightmare 
the fact is gm has a history of doing things like that 
kochan said theyve announced bonuses for executives while 
demanding wage concessions from assembly workers 
arvid f jouppi an automotive industry analyst at the detroit 
investment firm keane securities agreed that gm had a reputation 
for illtimed layoff announcements but he said the hungarian deal 
reflected how the company was seeking to expand in areas of the 
world where the potential for growth is the strongest in the long 
run jouppi said that would benefit gm 
i think in a nutshell were seeing the globalization of the 
entire auto industry he said in the hungaryus situation 
there would not be a conflict creating jobs in hungary and taking 
them away in the united states 
in other business and economic news this past week 
stalled sales isnt the only problem confronting the 
automakers who also are heavily involved in defense work at a time 
when the pentagon plans radical cutbacks ford motor co announced 
plans to sell its aerospace subsidiary the second of the big three 
to plan divestment of a major nonautomotive business chrysler 
corp put its chrysler technologies unit up for sale last month 
renewed inflation anxiety and nervous markets overseas punched 
down the us stock market the dow jones average of 30 
industrials wall streets bestknown barometer tumbled 7146 
points friday the biggest oneday drop since its 19058 spill last 
oct 13 
major banks dropped their prime lending rate a half percentage 
point to 10 percent the first decline in a halfyear and a signal 
of cheaper loan rates for consumers and small businesses but the 
optimism over lower rates was tempered by a government report that 
showed december wholesale inflation rose 07 percent and brought 
the total 1989 inflation rate to 48 percent more than double the 
1988 rate that suggested the federal reserve wont ease interest 
rates further as many economists had expected 
the board of campeau corp debtswamped owner of some of the 
nations bestknown department stores moved to separate its 
troubled retailing operations from the parent company the parent 
of bloomingdales and other chains averted one default deadline by 
paying apparel bills and took other steps to appease creditors but 
by the weekend it was still unclear whether campeau would put the 
stores under bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
bond corp holdings ltd an australian conglomerate 
overwhelmed by debt rejected a questionable takeover proposal from 
an obscure texas businessman whose return address was a maildrop

wall streeters who learned to think 
international in the 1980s have grown increasingly edgy about the 
economic outlook taking shape at the start of a new decade 
before long they fear problems like inflation in great britain 
or rising interest rates in japan could start to cause real trouble 
for the business and financial climate in this country 
analysts say those misgivings have played a big part in the us 
stock markets shaky start on the 1990s 
many yearend forecasts called for lower interest rates for us 
consumers and business managers at least through the first several 
months of 1990 that optimism seemed to be validated early this 
past week as banks announced a longawaited cut in the prime 
lending rate from 105 percent to 10 percent 
interest rates in the us bond and shortterm money markets 
held steady even on friday when the government reported a larger 
than expected 07 percent increase in the producer price index of 
finished goods for december 
but stock traders didnt take the news so calmly confronted as 
they were with word of falling markets in tokyo and london 
while the federal reserve has been gradually relaxing its credit 
policy encouraging rates to fall in this country central banks in 
several foreign lands have tightened credit in an effort to 
restrain inflation 
as a result german and japanese interest rates in particular 
have been climbing narrowing a oncewide gap between yields 
available in securities of those countries and what global 
investors could get in the us treasury market 
these days yields of a little more than 8 percent on american 
government bonds must compete with 75 percent or so in west 
germany 65 percent in japan and around 105 percet in britain 
sooner or later analysts say this trend could force the 
treasury to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers of its 
securities in the world marketplace in other words american 
interest rates would rise because of a form of international 
competition 
i believe that any further moves by the other central banks to 
raise rates would be a very important factor in determining the 
investment outlook for 1990 said strategist greg smith in his 
current market commentary for prudentialbache securities 
taken to its extreme international interestrate competition 
could foster a global credittightening that might increase the 
chances of recession in most or all industrial countries 
such visions analysts say are a long way yet from becoming 
reality but the prospect alone was enough to stifle the stock 
markets early1990 rally before it got very far 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 8404 to 268921 
in the past week wiping out the previous weeks 2005point gain 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 632 to 
18832 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 1850 to 43972 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 1022 at 37223 
big board volume averaged 16192 million shares a day down from 
17248 million the week before 
of course a lot of optimism persists that the opening up of 
eastern europe and a new common market business alliance in 1992 
will help propel worldwide growth past any obstacles that might 
arise 
tom marsico portfolio manager of the denverbased janus twenty 
mutual fund says about 25 percent of his stock holdings are 
concentrated in europe and shares of us companies with a stake in 
the opportunities there 
though the economic promise of an increasingly democratic europe 
has been widely touted marsico takes the view that its full 
potential hasnt yet been realized 
we think events there are going to go at a much faster rate 
than most people realize he declares
