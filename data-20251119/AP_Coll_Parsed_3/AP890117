a young drifter wearing combat fatigues 
opened fire with an assault rifle at screaming children in an 
elementary school yard tuesday five children all refugees from 
southeast asia were killed and 30 people wounded before the gunman 
shot himself to death 
the gunman identified as patrick edward purdy 26 originally of 
stockton had an extensive criminal history but police had no 
idea of a motive said lucian neely deputy police chief of this 
agricultural city 60 miles east of san francisco 
he was just standing there with a gun making wide sweeps 
said lori mackey who teaches deaf children at the cleveland 
elementary school and ran to her window when she heard what she 
thought were firecrackers 
she said she saw a man standing in the schoolyard spraying 
gunfire back and forth from a russian ak47 assault rifle as 400500 
pupils from grades 13 played at recess she said when she realized 
what was happening she took her 10 students into a rear room where 
they couldnt be seen 
he was not talking he was not yelling he was very 
straightfaced it did not look like he was really angry it was 
just matteroffactly she said of the gunman whom she described 
as about 510 with short dirtyblond hair 
there was mass chaos there were kids running in every 
direction she said 
purdy also known as patrick west had lived most recently in 
lodi about 15 miles northeast of here prior to that he lived in 
sandy ore where he purchased an ak47 from the sandy trading post 
on aug 3 said sandy police chief fred punzel 
purdys criminal record was mostly in the los angeles area and 
included narcotics and weapons violations and soliciting for sex 
neely said 
punzel said purdy had lived with an aunt and uncle in sandy for 
several months until october and the aunt julie michael told me 
he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic he said purdy 
also had apparently been living in texas memphis tenn and 
connecticut since leaving oregon 
the gunman dressed in battle gear and wearing a flak jacket 
parked his car near the school then set it on fire as a diversion 
before entering the campus through a gap in a fence at about 1140 
am pst with two handguns and an ak47 with a full banana clip 
police said 
he opened fire on the west side of a group of portable 
classrooms then moved to the east side and continued firing across 
the blacktop yard towards the main buildings about 250 yards away 
neely said purdy was no closer than that when he shot himself in 
the head neely said 
about 60 rounds were fired in some cases the bullets went 
completely through the main school building and came out the other 
side to fall spent on the lshaped schools front lawn neely said 
as police cleaned up the carnage a large handgun and the ak47 
were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood written on the 
pistols handle was the word victory 
bruce fernandes a spokesman for the san joaquin county office of 
emergency services said five pupils were killed and 29 wounded in 
the schoolyard a teacher was also shot 
neely said two of the dead children were dragged inside the 
school by teachers at least 15 of the wounded were in critical 
condition he said 
neely said the dead children all belonged to refugee families 
from southeast asia he identified them as raphanar or 9 ram chun 
8 thuy tran 6 sokhim an 6 and oeun lim 8 thuy tran was from 
vietnam the others from cambodia officials said about 60 percent 
of the pupils at the school were from southeast asian refugee 
families 
three of the children were slain in the yard and the two others 
inside the school said deputy police chief ralph tribble he said 
at least one teacher was injured 
there were a dozen students lying on the ground it was very 
frightening said cheryl torres who rushed to the school where 
her 11yearold daughter leanne sundstrom is a pupil 
fernandes said the wounded were evacuated to eight hospitals in 
the area two helicopters and a fleet of ambulances were pressed 
into service to transport the victims 
ramon billedo iii a pupil at the school described seeing a 
schoolmate shot 
i just saw him fall down said billedo his head hit the 
ground the teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other 
classroom 
some kids were outside and some man came over here shooting 
like crazy a few kids got shot said ricardo rivera 10 a fifth 
grader 
they were shooting at my classroom and at riveras classroom 
at reading time said another pupil roberto costa the bullets 
were hitting the walls everybody got scared 
brian griggs visiting a friend across from the school when he 
heard gunfire ran to the scene 
when you see bodies lying on a playground you know its you 
know griggs said his voice trailing off 
i tried to get a pulse couldnt get a pulse i was hoping an 
ambulance would show up it seemed to take forever 
the school about four blocks from the university of pacific 
campus is in a middleclass residential area several churches are 
nearby 
the ak47 is a russian design but chinese replicas are available 
in many gun stores for around 300 it is capable of firing about 
600 rounds per minute on full automatic 
lt fred nixon of the los angeles police department described the 
ak47 as a military assault rifle you use it for one purpose and 
one purpose only to kill a human being 
under federal law the purchase of a fully automatic rifle or 
machine gun requires a 46 month background check by authorities 
however a semiautomatic rifle can be bought over the counter by 
completing a standard form stating that the applicant has no 
criminal record among other requirements 
punzel said that the ak47 and other semiautomatic rifles can be 
easily converted into automatics 
other schools across the nation have been the targets for violent 
attacks in recent years 
last sept 26 a man walked into oakland elementary school in 
greenwood sc and opened fire with a gun in a crowded cafeteria 
and in a thirdgrade classroom two 8yearold girls died and nine 
other people were wounded including two teachers the gunman 
identified by police as jamie wilson 19 of greenwood was charged 
with murder and is awaiting trial 
last may 20 a young woman named laurie dann went on a rampage at 
hubbard woods elementary school in winnetka ill killing an 
8yearold boy and wounding five other children she fled to a 
nearby home where she wounded one man and then killed herself

within hours of the schoolyard shootings 
that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded tuesday 
dozens of translators rushed to assist the many southeast asian 
parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their 
youngsters 
i would imagine it is absolute panic they are not sure what 
happened not sure whats going on around them said laura dixon 
of the charterhouse center refugee program in stockton describing 
the scene translators found when they arrived at san joaquin county 
general hospital 
many of the parents speak no english and were unable to ask 
whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a 
heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded cleveland elementary 
school and opened fire before taking his own life 
they do have people on staff at the hospital but they are so 
overloaded they need every extra person they can secure said 
dixon whose organization began calling throughout stockton for 
volunteers speaking southeast asian languages about a dozen 
translators were sent to the county hospital after officials there 
called for help 
in recent years thousands of southeast asians have settled in 
stockton drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish in 
the area school officials said 60 percent of the children were 
southeast asian refugees either from cambodia laos or thailand 
all five of the children killed were of this background 
authorities said 
a stockton woman who runs an afterschool program teaching 
english to cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators including 
volunteers from all over the city to the school and the hospital 
dixon said 
the san joaquin county mental health department told dixon a 
grief center might be established at charterhouse to help survivors 
whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier 
charterhouse is funded by the episcopal church and private 
donations

fully equipped soviet troops left 
afghanistan by the planeload during the past week but the aircraft 
also left tons of new arms and ammunition for the kabul government 
diplomatic sources said tuesday 
western diplomats speaking in islamabad on condition they not be 
identified further said that at the current pace the red armys 
withdrawal could be completed by the end of the month 
however for political reasons the russians may wish to keep a 
military presence in kabul up to feb 15 said one source 
moscow pledged in a unsponsored accord last year to remove all 
of its more than 100000 combat troops from afghanistan in nine 
months from may 15 1988 
but the countrys ruling marxists still have not reached a 
settlement with moslem rebels known as mujahedeen or holy warriors 
who have battled them for more than a decade 
diplomats said takeoffs and landings of soviet il76 transport 
planes at kabul airport numbered about 40 between jan 9 and 14 or 
double the usual rate 
armed soviet troops in full kit were seen boarding the planes but 
only after afghan troops unloaded large quantities of military 
equipment and ammunition 
as many as 18 ss1 scud missiles were transported from the 
airport during the period according to reports from diplomats and 
western journalists 
soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the 
hindukush mountains along the snowbound salang road which runs some 
240 miles from kabul north to the soviet union the sources said 
they said that judging by convoys arriving in kabul 
sovietafghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route 
open despite harassment by the mujahedeen 
diplomats said workmen have been busy cutting down trees and 
leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the afghan defense 
ministry and soviet embassy in southern kabul 
one source speculated that the work was to prepare an emergency 
airstrip next to the soviet mission 
moscow and kabul continue to accuse islamabad and washington of 
violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the 
rebels many of whom operate from bases in pakistan

a gynecologist who faces charges from the 
state medical board in connection with what he calls love 
surgery has offered to surrender his certificate to practice 
medicine his attorney said tuesday 
lawyer earl moore said he and dr james c burt made the offer 
during a meeting with state officials in columbus 
we offered to surrender the license and dispense with the 
hearing said moore whether they do that or not i dont know 
otherwise well go ahead with the hearing 
the board has charged the 67yearold burt with gross 
immorality for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing 
drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries 
most of the charges against burt have to do with the 
controversial surgery in which he rebuilt womens genital areas 
allegedly to enhance their sexual responsiveness 
the surgery however instead caused sexual dysfunction 
emotional distress infection chronic pain incontinence and the 
need for corrective surgery in many patients the board charged 
last month burt sent a letter to the board denying the charges 
and requesting a hearing the board tentatively set a jan 30 
hearing date 
moore predicted that such a hearing would last six weeks and he 
said burt has in effect retired anyway 
hes not practicing any medicine at all said moore we 
offered to surrender the certificate to practice medicine and 
surgery im certain that he feels they will ultimately revoke his 
license he feels its a worthless cause 
calls to burts office went unanswered and no one answered the 
phone at the state medical board 
board spokeswoman lauren lubow has said the severest penalty the 
state board could impose would be permanent revocation of burts 
license the board limited burt to nonsurgical medical practice 
last november 
at least three of burts former patients have each filed 3 
million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist 
burt has denied performing the surgery without his patients 
permission the surgery was last performed in february 1987 at st 
elizabeth medical center

she wore black stretch pants a sequined vest and a 
top hat sister rena foley did not look like a nun 
sister brigid riley looked the part in full carmelite habit and 
veil but she didnt act it she took to center stage like a veteran 
performer and played snappy spoons to a bluegrass tune 
life imitated show business monday as about a dozen reallife 
nuns showed up at the charles street playhouse to audition for the 
musical nunsense a gentle spoof of convent life 
judging their performances was a panel of nunimpersonators the 
shows regular cast the habitwearing actresses sing clown and 
even tapdance in an offbeat comedy about nuns who stage a talent 
show to raise money to bury four of their sisters who died of 
botulism and are being temporarily stored in the convent freezer 
the five reallife nuns judged most talented will each be given a 
cameo role in the show for one week in february or march 
the producers billed the audition as nunsearch and advertised 
for real nuns in catholic and secular newspapers they have 
promised to donate 2 from every ticket sold for the special shows 
to a charity chosen by the performing nun 
were constantly getting mail from nuns and priests who love 
the show said coproducer ken biller were doing it to raise 
some money for charity and also of course to get publicity 
nunsense written by dan goggin has played in 30 american 
cities since its 1985 debut biller said its now playing in new 
york and philadelphia is entering its third season in boston he 
said 
some of the nuns who auditioned said they had dreamed of stage 
careers before taking the veil 
i always wanted to go to hollywood said sister marie 
fuhrman 37 who works with the elderly in south boston but i 
just knew i belonged in the convent 
when you get past 30 you start to say i wish id done this i 
wish id done that she said even if i dont make the part at 
least i can say i auditioned for an offbroadway show 
sister marie who confessed to sweaty palms delivered a comic 
monologue while her sisters and her mother superior cheered her 
bravery 
you see nuns on tv theyre such stereotypes of pious holier 
than thou types and theyre such stuffed shirts and prudes she 
said were not all that stuffy 
sister rena was a professional dancer and even owned her own 
dance studio before entering the sisters of st joseph convent at 
age 28 now greyhaired she performed a jazz number to the tune of 
city lights complete with shoulder rolls highkicks and the 
splits for a finale

south boston said she decided to perform her wooden spoon routine in 
hopes of attracting more young women to her order

did she said adding that she believes that nuns participation 
in a professional musical will show young women were not just 
behind the walls doing our work there is joy

two giant talents of the opera world soprano 
jessye norman and bass samuel ramey electrified a metropolitan 
opera audience many of whom usually would be happy to stay away 
from oneact operas by bartok and schoenberg 
on monday night the two americans sang judith and bluebeard in 
english in a striking theatrical new production of bartoks 
bluebeards castle and miss norman did the entire job a tour 
de force in the mets premiere of schoenbergs erwartung 
which can be translated expectation 
both miss norman of augusta ga and ramey of colby kan 
have big voices with beautiful lush tone in all parts of the 
register however much vocal control breath volume or musicianship 
is called for theyre equal to it and theres plenty more where 
that came from 
their characterizations as set by goran jarvefelt a native of 
bolinas sweden making his met debut were right on target 
as the curtain goes up newlyweds bluebeard and judith have just 
arrived at bluebeards dark castle as judith asks for the key to 
one door after another she goes from a cheery inquisitive girl to 
being imperially demanding bluebeard goes from pride to cringing 
knowing whats coming and dreading it 
as judith opens doors and takes from him parts of his past 
bluebeard takes off parts of his garb starting with the dark 
glasses that have given his white face a skeletal look through fur 
collar coat cloak shirt and finally wig 
the remarkable set is by hans schavernoch a native of gmunden 
austria making his met debut side walls extend inward meeting in 
a v so that one doesnt have to sit in the center to see the walls 
one wall folds back when bluebeard shows judith the world the 
other wall has the doors through which implements of torture a 
battering ram a big pile of gold and jewels and a tall tree appear 
when the last door opens revealing the three wives bluebeard 
murdered they appear as zombies who crawl forth and walk silently 
bluebeard puts the cloak of death on judith and she follows them 
moving like a queen 
her red gown and cloak were magnificent lore haas from vienna 
who has worked extensively with schavernoch also was making her met 
debut 
when bluebeards castle was performed by the met in 1974 the 
concept was nothing like this it was almost a concert 
james levine conducted with deliberate care the orchestral music 
contains some chilling moments 
miss normans singing was just as remarkable in erwartung 
but its a letdown after the other opera its sung in german and 
the plot is impenetrable the woman is searching for a man in a 
forest once she finds a corpse and puts his hand on her skin to 
warm it the next time shes at that part of the stage the corpse 
is gone is she crazy did she kill him is she hallucinating 
the same design team used the other operas backdrop plus three 
autumn trees a park bench flowers candles and a grand piano the 
only thing we objected to all evening was the piano and miss norman 
running between it and the bench erwartung is confusing enough 
the feb 1 performance will be videotaped for showing march 31 on 
pbs

eightyearold domingos casela was walking 
through a field to his familys small corn patch and stepped on a 
mine 
domingos and thousands like him are maimed reminders of a civil 
war neither side is able to win the conflict has gripped angola 
since independence from portugal in 1975 causing stagnation and 
desolation in one of africas most richly endowed nations 
several months after domingos stepped on the mine he hobbled up 
a ramp at the kuitobie rehabilitation center with a rubbertipped 
metal rod in place of his lower left leg undergoing physical 
therapy to prepare for the artificial limb he will wear the rest of 
his life 
his doctors say the mine was planted by the national union for 
the total independence of angola or unita the ussupported 
rebels are fighting a war of attrition against the marxist 
government of the angolan popular liberation movement known by its 
portuguese initials mpla 
south africa says it halted 13 years of aid to unita after 
signing a usmediated accord dec 22 with angola and cuba on 
withdrawal of the 50000 cuban troops in angola and independence for 
southwest africa also known as namibia which south africa has 
controlled since world war i 
all south african troops in southern angola moved back across the 
border to namibia when a truce between the two nations began aug 8 
dr sabino salongue director of the rehabilitation center in 
angolas fertile central highlands said most of amputees being 
treated were victims of mines planted by unita others lost limbs 
when gangrene set in because rifle wounds were poorly tended he 
said 
visitors to unita headquarters at jamba in southeastern angola 
near namibia see amputees of the other side who stepped on mines 
planted by the cubansupported army to impede rebel advances 
many victims of the war are ovimbundu the people of central 
huambo and bie provinces who in 1960 were 38 percent of the 5 
million living in a colony 14 times the size of portugal 
unita leader jonas savimbi 54 is an ovimbundu his father 
worked for the caminho de ferro de benguela the railway on which 
agricultural products and ores from zambia and zaire once rolled to 
the atlantic ports of benguela and lobito 
today the cunje railway station four miles outside kuito is a 
mass of broken bricks and shards of blueandwhite portuguese tiles 
target of a unita attack 
grass and wildflowers grow between the rails five huge steam 
locomotives built by bayer peacock and co ltd of manchester 
england rust on sidings with no place to go since unita blew up the 
bridges between huambo and kuito 
armando ferreira 54 years a railroader still shows up at the 
yard each day he said people on both sides are weary of war and 
eager for the railway to run again so their corn bananas and millet 
can go to market and they can receive goods from the outside 
an international conference is scheduled for jan 2526 in 
luanda capital of angola to raise funds for a 10year development 
plan in the lobito corridor including reconstruction of the 
benguela railway the conference is sponsored by the southern africa 
development coodination conference and the european economic 
commission 
the cost of reopening the railroad has been estimated at 
300600 million 
kieran j ocuneen the economic commission representative in 
angola fears potential donor nations may balk at committing 
substantial funds because the war has made it impossible to conduct 
a technical study in the region 
he and others involved in development projects feel withdrawal of 
cuban troops which began jan 10 and is to be finished by mid1991 
could lead to more economic aid and development if the civil war 
also ends 
president jose eduardo dos santos says angola will not negotiate 
with unita and seeks diplomatic relations with the united states 
his government has declared a yearlong amnesty to begin feb 4 
which spokesman paulinho pinto joao says will be open to all 
renounce violence and accept the constitution 
presidentelect george bush has written savimbi however 
promising continued us support until the government does negotiate 
with unita 
covert us military aid to the rebels was blocked for a decade 
by a 1975 congressional amendment but resumed in 1986 and is said 
to total about 15 million annually 
a western diplomat said washingtons policy toward unita was 
outdated and the marxism espoused by the ruling ruling party was 
only skin deep 
youll see this is not a marxist nation he said nearly 
all their trade is with the west when the cubans have left then 
theyll get rid of the russians

yasser arafats guerrillas have refrained from 
attacking israeli targets for the past two months observing an 
undeclared ceasefire that could give credibility to the plos peace 
initiative if it endures 
some israeli officials have called attention to the lack of fatah 
operations but have expressed doubt about arafats ability or even 
desire to make it last 
we have not identified any flagrant act on the part of the plo 
against the security zone or israel since arafat committed himself 
to end terrorism said uri lubrani a senior defense ministry 
official responsible for lebanon policy 
i think it is too early to judge if the truce would be 
lasting lubrani said on israel radio 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said in an interview it was 
not 100 percent clear whether the ceasefire encompassed only 
arafats own fatah guerrillas or all palestine liberation 
organization factions 
there have been two recent infiltration attempts by syrianbased 
groups one headed by abu nidal which is outside the plo umbrella 
and the other the palestine liberation front which is part of the 
plo israeli soldiers killed six of the guerrillas 
the last attack by arafats fatah came on the eve of the plos 
declaration of statehood in midnovember when a fivemember fatah 
squad took un soldiers and lebanese civilians hostage for 18 
hours the guerrillas shot to death one lebanese man before 
surrendering 
anat kurz a terrorism expert at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies said in an interview that a ceasefire 
would have to be more enduring to overcome israeli suspicion about 
the plo 
it will change peoples mind if it lasts longer she said 
kurz noted arafat had never renounced armed struggle or the right 
to attack targets in israel but said it was in arafats interest to 
suspend antiisraeli attacks to give his initiative credibility 
especially with western countries 
however she said there were serious doubts among israeli 
policymakers about whether fatah could tolerate a long period of 
inaction without clear political gains 
the center estimates fatah has about 8000 guerrillas or half 
the total number of palestinians under arms most are based in 
lebanon 
many israelis especially those on the political right view the 
13month palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as a form 
of terrorism aimed at destroying israel 
retired maj gen shlomo gazit former head of military 
intelligence said a plo ceasefire would not be effective in 
dispelling israeli doubts unless arafat specified its duration and 
made it comprehensive 
for israelis it doesnt matter which group stands behind an 
operation the question that counts if whether attacks continue 
he said in an interview 
gazit said the test of arafats credibility was whether he was 
willing or able to force dissident factions to observe a truce both 
in crossborder raids and in violent acts in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
if he cant then he is no authority we should be talking to 
said gazit noting arafat succeeded in forcing opponents to observe 
a military stand in 1981 along the israellebanon border 
the de facto truce already has touched off a public quarrel 
between prime minister yitzhak shamir and the armed forces chief of 
staff lt gen dan shomron who appeared to challenge shamirs 
policy by pointing out the de facto ceasefire 
shamir described as superfluous shomrons report to a 
parliament committee that arafats fatah and other guerrillas under 
his authority had in practice halted hostile operations as well 
as preparations for attacks 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman confirmed the prime minister 
disagreed with chief of staff over the issue and accused arafat of 
encouraging daily acts of terror 
mr shamir believes there is a lot of terrorism by arafat in 
the territories west bank and gaza strip and israel proper said 
pazner noting a fatah cell recently had been uncovered in northern 
israel 
there are acts of terrorism daily in the territories and 
attempts in israel and mr arafat encourages those he added 
the hawkish premier has opposed any conciliatory move toward the 
plo in response to arafats renunciation of terrorism and acceptance 
of israel 
shamir told the jerusalem post on friday that the plo sought to 
replace israel and could not be trusted i am sure there are those 
who understand that israel cannot trust what the plo says we know 
them too well he said 
the daily newspaper davar said security officials told the 
cabinet this month it was their assessment that certain plo groups 
were liable to attempt to carry out border raids but not under the 
plos name the purpose of such attacks would be to gauge the us 
response it said 
for israeli doves arafats declarations have been enough to 
trigger calls for the government to agree to talk to the plo four 
members of parliament participated in a conference in paris attended 
by plo members but avoided facetoface talks because of a 1986 
israeli laws outlawing such contacts 
yossi sarid a dovish lawmaker who supports negotiations with the 
plo wrote in the liberal daily haaretz this week that arafats 
change of principles was more difficult to achieve than a change in 
policy on attacks 
its generally easier to change the pratical than the 
rhetorical for yasser arafat it is much easlier to stop engaging in 
terror than to announce its end said sarid

imagine going off to combat only to find the 
civilian technician who keeps your sophisticated weapons working 
isnt interested in sticking around the pentagons inspector 
general is warning of such a potential problem 
the independent inspector general in a 24page audit that 
recently became available says the pentagons procedures for 
designating and staffing emergencyessential civilian jobs 
overseas need to be overhauled 
those are jobs critical to making sure military equipment 
functions at the battlefront many of the jobs have been described 
previously as involving the maintenance of highly sophisticated 
electronic and computer gear 
our audit showed that implementation of dods programs to 
retain emergencyessential civilians did not afford a high degree of 
assurance that civilian or contractor employees would continue to 
perform functions and services overseas that are essential to the 
support of combat forces during mobilization or hostilities the 
audit states 
the people now holding the jobs were not informed fully of 
their commitment or about their benefits the audit continues 
moreover of 228 civilian dod employees who were personally 
interviewed by auditors 28 had not volunteered to remain on the 
job during crises or hostilities because of family responsibilities 
and there was no evidence of contingency plans to replace these 
incumbents 
we also found that 2 of the 228 emergencyessential positions 
in this group were occupied by persons not physically fit to serve 
in a war zone 
on the flip side some of the positions designated 
emergencyessential appear to be more desirable to have 
filled than essential meaning those civilians might be asked to 
stay in a war zone when theyre really not needed the auditors said 
the number of people involved is relatively small the auditors 
continued exact totals arent available but it appears the defense 
department employs about 3700 civilians overseas in jobs designated 
emergency essential while contractors working for the military 
employ several thousand more 
nonetheless the military services had better address the issue 
because legally theyre depending upon volunteers 
under current law civilians cannot be required to stay on jobs 
during mobilization hostile action or an undeclared war the 
auditors wrote 
unless and until the congress declares war dod and contractor 
civilian employees may remain in or be sent to unsafe areas 
overseas only on a voluntary basis 
the audit states that defense department civilians assigned to 
emergencyessential jobs since 1985 are supposed to be volunteers 
who understand that if fighting breaks out theyll be expected to 
remain at their post 
and historically dod civilian employees and contractors have 
served in hostile areas in time of need the inspector general 
said however there are no absolute assurances that a dod 
civilian employee or a contractors employee would honor a 
commitment to voluntarily remain on the job during hostilities 
the inspector general recommended the services review the 
emergencyessential jobs to make sure they really are just that 
establish physical and medical standards for the positions explain 
the legal and administrative ramifications attendant to acceptance 
of the position and make sure every job holder knows his 
specific wartime duties 
the auditors said the military should use soldiers to carry out 
any function that is essential to fighting 
grant s green jr the assistant defense secretary for 
personnel responded to the audit by saying his office and the armed 
services concur in your assessment and endorse the positive 
recommendations

its already a rough winter for those cattle 
producers who have to buy higherpriced hay and grain to make up for 
last years droughtravaged pastures and feed crops according to 
agriculture department analysts 
the financial bind of recent years has forced cattle producers to 
cut back herds and delay new expansion plans that has reduced beef 
output sharply and sent prices to record levels at supermarket 
counters 
it will get worse before improving the analysts say cattle 
production prices are edging still higher and so are consumer beef 
prices which could threaten to make family shoppers think about 
pork and chicken instead of beef 
as of dec 1 according to usda surveys hay stockpiles 
nationally totaled less than 909 million tons down almost a fourth 
from more than 1198 million tons a year earlier 
prices of baled hay including alfalfa and other kinds averaged 
almost 97 per ton last month up from less than 65 in december 
1987 
moreover in some of the hardesthit drought states hay 
stockpiles are a fraction of their yearago level in north dakota 
for example dec 1 inventories were estimated at little more than 
23 million tons compared with nearly 53 million tons a year 
earlier 
cattle production costs may rise modestly in 1989 says a 
report by the departments economic research service decisions to 
open up this years feed grains programs to a larger acreage may 
ease the supply and price situation later on but prospects will not 
be firmed up before july and august 
meanwhile the agency said in the januaryfebruary issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 1989 beef production is expected to 
decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year the lowest level 
since 1980 however larger supplies of poultry and pork are 
expected 
that would leave this years total meat supply at only slightly 
below the 1988 record the report said even so retail beef prices 
are expected to reach a record level 
rising consumer incomes and high employment rates likely will 
provide continued support for meat prices the report said a 
favorable economic environment will have to be maintained if record 
retail beef prices expected in 1989 are to be met with little 
consumer resistance 
the us cattle inventory on jan 1 1988 dropped below 100 
million head for the first time since 1961 and the 1987 and 1988 
calf crops also were the smallest since 1961 
a new estimate on the size of the us cattle herd on jan 1 
1989 will be issued by usda on feb 8 and may show a further 
decline according to agency economists 
the decline in 1989 beef output will be abetted by a continued 
slide in the slaughter of nonfed cattle which includes culled 
cows and other animals that are sold without going through feedlots 
but the biggest impact on total beef supplies will come from 
sharply reduced fed cattle slaughter the report said us 
feedlot marketings for 1989 could decline 6 percent to 8 percent or 
about 2 million head 
the winding down of the placement of new animals in feedlots last 
summer and fall may have set the stage for record prices next 
spring the report said prices for choice steers on the omaha 
neb market in 1989 could average near the mid70s per 100 pounds 
of live weight up from 70 last year 
retail beef prices rose an average of almost 5 percent in 1988 
hitting a record peak last summer when they averaged 259 per 
pound as measured on usdas allcut basis further increases of 1 
percent to 3 percent are likely this year 
the higher price of beef relative to competing meats has always 
been a concern but 1989 may test consumer demand for beef the 
report said 
per capita consumption of all meat including poultry averaged 
2205 pounds in 1988 but could drop back to 2174 pounds in 1989 
those are retail weights before home trimming cooking and table 
waste is computed 
beef exports in 1988 rose 8 percent to an estimated 654 million 
pounds carcass weight equivalent the report said and another 
increases is expected this year mainly because of larger sales to 
japan even so this years greater exports would represent only 28 
percent of us production 
imports of beef in 1988 meanwhile totaled about 24 billion 
pounds carcass weight up 4 percent from 1987 but may decline this 
year because of smaller supplies in exporting countries mainly 
australia and new zealand the imports represent less than 9 percent 
of total us beef consumption

rariz helped make arrangements 
heart institute spokeswoman paula jennings said it wasnt 
immediately known what doctors could do for miss hlebkyna

for 50 cents charles o mutt walters 
will let you drive a car across his potomac river toll bridge for 
175000 hell throw in the bridge too 
walters has been trying to sell the bridge for more than a year 
but so far there have been no takers 
i could probably tell them all they had to know about 
maintaining the bridge or who could do it walters 69 said 
recently im retired i dont need it 
the onelane oakplank bridge 12 feet wide and 360 feet long 
connects this western maryland town of 550 people with green spring 
wva 
built in 1937 the bridge saves considerable time for oldtown 
residents who commute to work in green spring and for west 
virginians heading for maryland the alternative is a 40mile 
oneway trip via cumberland md or paw paw wva 
the span is submerged several times a year under high water but 
has survived more than 50 years of ice floes and floods 
bridge users drop their tolls into a tin cup bolted to a 
truncated barbecue skewer which toll takers hold out the window of 
a little brick house on the maryland shore cars pay 50 cents 
pedestrians a dime motorcycles a quarter and tractortrailers 
150 motorists can use the bridge free between 10 pm and 6 am 
walters a retired excavator and mail carrier had done 
maintenance on the bridge since 1954 in 1970 he bought it for 
53000 
if somebody wanted to run it themself they could make a good 
living he said i make 30000 to 34000 clear and i dont do 
nothing other than take the money to the bank

members of congress will receive a 45500 pay 
raise this year if lawmakers follow president reagans 
recommendations while a recently hired government typist would 
bring home just 250 more 
the thirdranking official in the commerce department or another 
cabinet agency would get a 42500 raise but a career federal 
specialist in the food stamp program would receive an increase of 
682 
and while a politically appointed agency bureau director would 
receive a 39500 increase a midlevel manager in the civil service 
system would only receive 1263 
the pay proposals in president reagans budget are noteworthy for 
their disparity there would be 50 percent increases for congress 
top political appointees and federal judges 165 percent for many 
junior career executves 36 percent for 21 million military 
personnel and just 2 percent for the 25 millionstrong civil 
service work force 
in addition reagan has proposed a oneyear freeze in 
costofliving adjustments for military and civilian retirees 
the 50 percent raises for 2498 people lawmakers judges and 
top executive branch personnel would go into effect on feb 8 
unless both houses of congress defeat the proposal house leaders 
have indicated there will be no vote in the chamber by the deadline 
a nonaction that would trigger the top raises automatically 
under the proposal rankandfile lawmakers pay would rise to 
135000 from the current 89500 
lawmakers supporting the pay raise have said if the increase goes 
through they will give up the right to earn outside income 
including speaking fees 
representatives of the governments civil service workers are 
careful not to oppose the raise for members of congress because 
these same lawmakers must decide later whether to give federal 
employees more than the 2 percent reagan proposed but theyre not 
bashful about attacking the administration 
what outrages me is that the people who are responsible for 
doing the work are ignored and insulted by the president said 
robert m tobias head of the national treasury employees union 
representing 145000 federal workers 
its the idea that some elitist group is solely responsible for 
accomplishing the mission of the federal government 
john sturdivant president of the largest federal employee union 
the 700000member american federation of government employees 
said i support the 50 percent if you listen to some of the 
rhetoric and look at the folks who have come out against it those 
are the same people who will be opposing pay raises for the people i 
represent 
taking cheap shots at highlevel folks is not going to do 
anything for the people i represent 
but sturdivant said reagan is going out like he came in 
bashing federal employees in his budget proposal 
joseph r wright jr director of the office of management and 
budget said it is incorrect to compare the proposed 50 percent 
increase at top levels with the 2 percent for civil servants 
he said that civil servants have received steady raises each 
year and are only three to five percentage points behind inflation 
since 1969 
the salaries of top officials he said are down 3540 percent 
compared to inflation over the past 20 years the administration is 
trying to let them recoup their losses all at once he said 
common sense and logic dont apply here he commented you 
reach tough personal choices where you want to send kids to college 
and cant afford to this is the only government weve got and it 
ought to be well managed we shouldnt buy executives on the cheap 
james lafferty spokesman for the governments personnel agency 
the office of personnel management said the presidents budget is 
not the key to determining the civil service pay scales 
more important he said is a government report due in august 
that will compare federal pay scales to those of similar jobs in the 
private sector based on that report he said opm will make a 
recommendation to the president on a pay raise 
civil servants are paid under the general schedule gs 
scale which has 18 different pay grades and 10 steps within most 
grades the lowest grade gs 1 begins at 10213 and the highest 
gs 18 has a single salary of 86682 theres also a senior 
executive service for government managers 
some lawmakers believe congressional pay is an issue that must 
stand on its own among them is rep augustus f hawkins chairman 
of the house education and labor committee who has been the chief 
congressional advocate of raising the minimum wage 
we should judge the congressional raise on whether it would 
improve the quality of representation and lead to other reforms in 
ethical conduct including honoraria the california democrat said 
i believe members should not have to vote on their own pay 
raise if i were required to vote on it i would vote in favor 
because i believe the responsibilities of a congressman certainly 
justify more than were now paid 
if a congressman doesnt think hes worth the amount 
recommended no law says hes got to take it

with only a few days remaining before he 
becomes vice president dan quayle has given few clues about how he 
will carry out his new role in effect telling americans to wait and 
watch 
since the november election the oncespotlighted quayle has 
deliberately kept a low profile while presidentelect bush remained 
at center stage with personnel and policy pronouncements 
until the end of last week the former indiana senator eschewed 
interviews rebuffing reporters attempts to learn what specific 
goals or projects he has in mind for his vice presidential tenure 
his standard reply is that he wants to do bushs bidding and become 
a close adviser to the president 
he told the washington post however in an interview published 
sunday that he plans crusades in such areas as education 
antidrug and crimefighting efforts that could include personal 
visits to crime victims drug users or school dropouts 
both quayle and bush have said they want to build an easyaccess 
relationship of the type bush had with president reagan bush met 
privately with the president once a week and said that was generally 
the opportunity he used to relay his views and advice 
but how much bush might rely on quayles advice is an open 
question 
his press secretary david beckwith summed up the situation this 
way quayle comes to the job with certain strengths but he also 
comes to learn and to work hard its not like hes 65 years old and 
has a wealth of experience across the board like bush had on the 
other hand he has a certain perspective that i think bush values 
quayle will be chairman of the national space council and wants 
to spend several hours a week on capitol hill working as an 
administration advocate with his former colleagues 
the energetic 41yearold politician also is expected to work 
with the republican national committee making the rounds of the 
speaker circuit raising money and courting supporters 
although a favorite of conservatives quayle has said he does not 
intend to be a mouthpiece for their interests with the more moderate 
bush rnc spokesman mark goodin contended that quayle appeals to a 
republican mainstream constituency beyond those who share his 
conservative ideology 
goodin noted that quayle managed to raise several million dollars 
for the party through highroller campaign events after weathering 
the spate of negative publicity following his nomination 
quayles focus in congress was on national defense as a member 
of the senate armed services committee and on job issues stemming 
from his coauthorship of jobtraining legislation 
but quayle spent most of the postelection period selecting his 
staff and meeting privately with officials and interest groups 
aides reject any notion that the bush team wanted to keep quayle 
under wraps but say quayle himself set the low profile during the 
period when he wanted to establish his relationship with bush 
weve been sensitive to not try and handle him said bush 
transition communications director dave demarest 
aides acknowledge that quayle has an image problem stemming from 
the postrepublican convention furor over his national guard service 
and poor grades in school opinion polls have shown that most 
americans are doubtful about quayles competence to assume the 
presidency should anything happen to bush 
quayles image isnt helped by the jokes perpetuated not only by 
latenight tv comedians but by fellow republicans one was told 
recently by a close associate of president reagan 
bush plans to issue quayle bonds the joke goes theres no 
principle no interest and they never mature 
when president reagan first took office in 1981 he assigned bush 
to head a commission on deregulating the government with that 
commissions work mostly finished quayle apparently wont take on 
anything similar 
in his campaign bush initially said he would want his vice 
president to head administration antidrug efforts but quayle was 
edged out of that responsibility by congressional legislation 
creating a separate cabinetlevel drug czar post 
bush last week named former education secretary william bennett 
to the job

president reagan pulled a rabbit out of his hat 
by bringing his proposed 1990 budget in under the grammrudman laws 
deficit ceiling but george bush will be wrestling with a larger 
less cooperative rabbit when he prepares his own spending plan 
reagan accomplished the trick with a 115 trillion budget plan 
that stuck close to his fiscal priorities of the past eight years 
domestic spending cuts and higher military expenditures 
the new president however has outlined a somewhat different set 
of priorities for how the government should be spending its money 
during his election campaign bush spoke about expanding programs 
for education the environment drug law enforcement the homeless 
needy children aids and federal prisons he also set goals of 
carving out tax breaks for child care oil and gas exploration and 
college savings among other things 
in addition bailouts of failed savings and loan associations 
could cost as much as 100 billion over the next several years 
while cleanup and renovation of the nations crumbling nuclear 
weapons plants could cost a comparable amount in the coming years 
all of this comes when there is very little breathing room in the 
federal budget bush must try to submit a budget that finances the 
governments operations next year without piercing the deficit 
target of 100 billion set by the grammrudman law 
the spending blueprint reagan proposed last monday would leave an 
imbalance of 925 billion but because the grammrudman law does 
not count 6 billion worth of proposed asset sales the reagan plan 
officially leaves 986 billion in red ink 
can bush squeeze his priorities in and still meet the 100 
billion grammrudman target and keep his campaign pledge of no new 
taxes republicans say he can although they concede it will take a 
lot of elbow grease 
i wont say he should have no problems rep dick armey 
rtexas a member of the house budget committee said friday but 
its eminently possible 
under one scenario bush could address his campaign promises by 
diverting only small amounts of money at them saving heavier 
spending for later years 
i dont see a whole lot of room and thats the bad news 
said peter j davis a former capitol hill budget aide who is now a 
vice president at prudential bache securities in rosslyn va the 
good news is bush isnt asking for a whole lot 
democrats however are convinced that bush cannot meet the 
deficit target without new taxes or harsh cuts in spending that will 
enrage voters 
theyve spent the first week of this years tax wars trying to 
goad the incoming chief executive into showing how hell do it in 
their analysis of reagans spending plan democrats on the senate 
budget committee called on bush to present a budget that will 
squarely face up to the challenges before us 
congressional democrats say bush has a harder deficit reduction 
job ahead of him than reagan admits the white houses office of 
management and budget says the deficit would be 127 billion without 
any tax or spending changes at all necessitating 27 billion in 
savings to reach the target but the congressional budget office 
estimated the figure at 141 billion leaving a much larger task 
bush is likely to accept about 2 billion less in military 
spending than reagan proposed leaving the pentagon with 301 
billion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
but hes also considered unlikely to accept reagans idea of 
eliminating next years costofliving increase for retired federal 
workers at a cost of 18 billion and could well decide to 
ignore other spending cuts advocated by the outgoing president 
richard darman who will be bushs budget director has visited 
congressional leaders in recent weeks apparently providing few 
details about the decisions the new administration might make 
bush has said he will address the issue shortly after his 
inauguration friday as the next president likes to say stay 
tuned

doctors have long recognized the power of 
female sex hormones to keep womens hearts healthy now theres 
evidence that abundant levels of testosterone may be good for mens 
hearts 
its attractive to think that being male is good for men and 
being female is good for women said dr elizabeth barrettconnor 
a physician at the university of california san diego 
estrogen the female hormone is believed to one of the key 
differences between the sexes that explains why women typically live 
seven to eight years longer than men 
barrettconnor presented evidence monday that men with high 
levels of testosterone the male hormone are in better shape than 
those with relatively low levels whether this means they are more 
likely to escape heart attacks is still unclear 
her work presented monday at a meeting of the american heart 
association is based on a followup of 5000 california residents 
who were first examined in 1972 
she found that men with high testosterone also have higher levels 
of high density lipoprotein or hdl the socalled good cholesterol 
that protects people from heart attacks they also have lower blood 
pressure and are less likely to be overweight 
in other words testosterone is good for men she said 
however despite these attributes that would seem to lower the 
risk of heart disease there was no clear evidence that the men with 
higher testosterone actually lived longer barrettconnor noted that 
the bodys levels of sex hormones fluctuate throughout the day and 
since her research was based on just one blood sample it might not 
have accurately identified differences between the mens hormone 
levels 
she also noted that even if testosterone turns out to be good for 
mens hearts she does not advocate taking extra doses of the 
hormone 
she said another major study has begun to see what effect 
estrogen pills have on womens risk of heart attacks after they go 
through menopause when their bodies natural production of the 
chemical drops sharply 
some of the women will take estrogen alone while others will get 
a combination of estrogen and progestin estrogen by itself can 
increase the risk of uterine cancer but while the estrogen and 
progestin combination eliminates this hazard some doctors fear that 
the extra progestin wipes out estrogens benefits for the heart 
among other research presented monday 
dr redford b williams jr of duke university said that anger 
not impatience is the key element of type a behavior that raises 
the risk of heart disease he said that those with a heart 
attackprone personality are more likely to get angry to become 
suspicious of other peoples motives and to show their hostility 
toward others 
according to dr wayne j katon of the university of washington 
panic attacks and depression are frequently mistaken for heart 
disease especially among young and middleaged women during panic 
attacks people may gasp for breath grow dizzy tremble feel chest 
pain and believe they are going to die 
strokes occur in two or three of every 100000 children dr 
dorothy m aram of rainbow babies and childrens hospital in 
cleveland has found that when the stroke is limited to one side of 
the brain these youngsters grow to have normal intelligence 
however they may have varying degrees of other problems including 
physical weakness on one side and trouble reading and talking 
dr louis r caplan of new england medical center in boston 
reported that cocaine use is becoming a major cause of strokes in 
young adults studies at one hospital found it to be the single 
greatest cause of strokes in those under age 40

a disputed libyan plant at rabta proves the 
difficulty of enforcing a treaty banning chemical weapons say a 
number of national security experts 
a conference of 149 nations meeting last week in paris endorsed 
a us proposal to reaffirm a 1925 geneva protocol against the use 
and spread of chemical weapons 
that declaration will not ban chemical weapons but was expected 
to give new impetus to longstalled negotiations in geneva on a 
proposal put forward in 1984 by vice president george bush for 
banning chemical weapons outright and requiring those nations that 
have them to destroy their stockpiles 
bush who succeeds president reagan on friday has expressed a 
wish to be remembered as the president under whom chemical weapons 
are eliminated 
lt gen colin powell reagans national security adviser is 
among those who say it would be hard to verify compliance with a ban 
on their production and even harder to verify their total 
destruction 
the problem we have is that nobody has yet determined how to do 
it in an effectively verifiable way because chemical weapons can be 
made in just about any kind of chemical plant powell said in a 
interview broadcast over the weekend on the syndicated television 
program john mclaughlins one on one 
and you can turn it back into an aspirin plant or a fertilizer 
plant with a few hours notice powell said its very 
troubling 
the paris conference gained publicity and momentum because of 
us charges that libya was building a chemical weapons plant at 
rabta 35 miles from tripoli libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
says the plant would make pharmaceuticals 
two former us diplomats with long experience in chemical 
weapons negotiations charles floweree and james leonard recently 
disputed powells pessimistic view arguing that any factory large 
enough to make a significant amount of chemical weapons could be 
detected by american intelligence 
clandestine manufacture is difficult to imagine said 
floweree who in 197779 directed the international relations 
division of the us arms control and disarmament agency 
frank gaffney deputy assistant secretary of defense in the first 
reagan administration said the dispute over the libyan plant 
illustrates the problems of verifying a ban on chemical weapons 
while the libyan plant is a dedicated chemical weapon facility 
gadhafis protestations that it is a pharmaceutical complex nicely 
illustrates the problem essentially any facility that actually is 
meant for production of civilian chemical products has the 
inherent ability to produce toxic chemical agents for weapons 
although about 15 countries are thought to have chemicals 
weapons only two nations acknowledge it the united states and the 
soviet union additionally the united nations concluded in 1984 
that iraq used chemical weapons in its war against iran 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has announced that 
his nation would begin destroying stockpiles of chemical weapons 
which he and other soviet officials have said since dec 26 1987 
totalled 50000 tons 
but on dec 2 1988 the reagan administration challenged those 
figures although us officials have not disclosed their own 
estimates outside experts have cited figures as high as 300000 
the united states did not produce chemical weapons from 1969 
until 1987 when the army with the approval of congress began to 
manufacture binary weapons which become lethal when two otherwise 
nontoxic chemicals are combined forming a lethal charge 
the army is destroying its stocks of old singlesubstance 
chemical weapons and although the us officials have not disclosed 
the extent of the stockpile outside experts estimate it to be about 
30000 tons of chemical agents the chemicals plus the artillery 
shells to deliver them would weigh several times more 
besides the united states and the soviet union more than a dozen 
other nations are thought to have chemical weapons said elisa 
harris a scholar at the brookings institution who carefully tracks 
the issue 
those nations able to make their own chemical weapons are thought 
to be iraq burma china israel libya north korea syria china 
iran israel taiwan vietnam and probably egypt which is thought 
to have used the weapons in its war against yemen said harris 
ethiopia is also thought to have chemical weapons she said 
ethiopia and a number of other sovietbloc nations are thought to 
have acquired chemical weapons at some point from moscow although 
that practice appears to have ended she said

george bush is bringing a tidal wave of texans 
with him to the capital city and they promise to make their way of 
doing things felt on the social as well as political scene 
in addition to a texas president albeit a transplanted yankee 
a texas speaker of the house appointees from defense 
secretarydesignate to fbi director and four committee chairmen in 
congress washington will have to reckon with their families 
batten down the hatches warns the washington post on 
sundays front page nervy sexy filthy rich georgette mosbacher 
wife of the incoming commerce secretary and a certified social 
cyclone is headed our way 
but mrs mosbacher wife of houston oilman robert mosbacher 
isnt the only sign that texas has arrived 
youll see more boots than youve seen youll see more hats 
than youve seen says texas republican sen phil gramm and if 
the emergence of texans into positions of power brings good mexican 
food to the capital the achievement will be miraculous 
the quality of the barbecue is going to pick up the quality of 
the mexican food is going to pick up says rep charlie stenholm 
a democrat and texas farmer the social scene is going to pick up 
and well have a little high culture the cottoneyed joe and the 
twostep are going to be right at the top of the list 
ac greene director of the center for texas studies at the 
university of north texas in denton that despite the influx the 
days of the wheelerdealer swashbuckling texas politicans are gone 
greene says hes not convinced bush and his coterie of 
nationalized texans will wield the same sort of behindthescenes 
clout as lyndon b johnson did as senate majority leader vice 
president and president as sam rayburn did when he was house 
speaker and john nance garner did as frankin d roosevelts vice 
president 
if any texan has real connections greene says its house speaker 
jim wright of fort worth who has has fought those battles in the 
corridors of power and may actually be more influential in 
washington than bush at least for now 
lbjs inaugural chairman 24 years ago dale miller isnt 
expecting any texas invasion at all he says because the state has 
always had a presence in washington in the 47 years hes been in 
here 
theres always been a pronounced texas influence here in 
town miller says ive known a very strong texas influence in 
washington for 47 years 
but others are expecting a flock of texans who will leave a 
texassize style imprint on the government 
texans are really going to be here in a big way texas will 
have a big part to play says veteran journalist sarah mcclendon 
who predicts less gobbledygook in government publications 
because of the texas preference for simple and direct language 
gramm says he thinks the four cabinet appointments and other 
highprofile jobs already awarded to texans are just the tip of the 
iceberg there will be literally hundreds of texans in 
decisionmaking positions people tend to hire people they know and 
people they trust 
but greene says a lot of these are cosmetic positions 
especially the appointed positions bush doesnt have the 
connections lbj did and there is just no substitute for onthehill 
politics in washington 
still gramm says its a plus for texas and america 
i know all of these texans care about our state and those who 
are not texans know the guy at the top cares about texas and thats 
obviously going to help gramm says

germany than in any one of the united states except california on 
military construction projects in fiscal 1990 
altogether the pentagon wants to spend almost 86 billion on 
such construction projects in fiscal 1990 with just five states 
accounting for almost 125 billion in work 
more than 1 billion would be spend on projects outside the 
united states with almost onethird of that 3161 million 
going for projects in west germany 
if presidentelect bush and congress go along the big winners 
domestically will be california with 4865 million in proposed 
spending texas with 2388 million florida with 1942 million 
new york with 151 million and virginia with 1417 million 
overseas work in england would total 1147 million projects in 
italy would cost 988 million those in the philippines 982 
million and those in south korea 892 million across europe 
some 5579 million would be spent on socalled nato infrastructure 
projects 
among the largest single proposals in the united states are 
1113 million for facilities to support the mx missile at fe 
warren air force base wyo 1005 million in new facilities at 
whiteman air force base mo to support the b2 stealth bomber 89

build warehouses in oman near the persian gulf and 119 million 
for continued improvements at the missile range complex in the 
kwajalein islands in the pacific to help support star wars 
experiments 
the military construction request is a small part of the defense 
departments 3152 billion spending plan for fiscal 1990 which 
president reagan proposed last week that compares with authorized 
spending of 2988 billion this year 
of the 86 billion total for fiscal 1990 the pentagon said it

rocks at officers in a black neighborhood monday after police shot 
at black suspects during a chase that ended with one man dead and 
another injured 
about 125 police officers in riot gear closed off an area about 
17 blocks by nine blocks in the impoverished overtown neighborhood 
just north of downtown which has been the site of major racial 
strife in the past

five hours later but late monday there was still sporadic gunfire 
and looting according to television reports school officials 
announced five schools in the area would be closed tuesday 
city manager cesar odio said prominent black community leaders 
had been called to walk the streets monday night seeking calm 
several officers and bystanders were hit by rocks and bottles 
police said at least two cars were set afire and two news vehicles 
attacked with rocks authorities said an auto parts store burned 
after firefighters were shot at and had to leave the area police 
said 
four people including one police officer were treated for 
lacerations and minor injuries at jackson memorial hospital and 
released said spokesman tony fallon other officers were treated at 
the scene police said 
all of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of 
the driver i blocked it with my elbow they were yelling get that 
white woman out of the car said lourdes ruiztoledo a 
27yearold wcixtv reporter 
miss ruiztoledo who had stayed in her car while an anchorman 
and camerman got out said she drove a block away and was rescued by 
an officer who led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield 
a waitress said her windshield was shattered by a fivepound 
concrete block when she drove through the area on her way home from 
work 
i had no idea it was going on said kay worthington of miami 
beach there were about 20 kids all throwing things i was worried 
that i was going to be hurt i didnt see any cops around there 
later monday miami police were placed on full alert with 
overnight shifts called in early and the florida highway patrol and 
metro police placed on standby

an air historian says he has unearthed evidence 
suggesting us aviator amelia earhart ran out of fuel and crashed 
about 30 miles short of a pacific island on her roundtheworld 
flight a halfcentury ago 
roy nesbit a former british air force navigator said monday he 
discovered a letter earhart wrote to britains aviation authority 
saying she intended to carry 1000 gallons of fuel aboard her 
lockheed electra on the flight over the pacific some of which 
crossed over british commonwealth territory 
he said earharts navigator fred noonan also was reported by 
the daily telegraph of sydney australia as saying the twinengine 
plane would be loaded with 950 gallons for the flight from lae new 
guinea to howland island a speck of land in the central pacific 
the recordsetting pilot never arrived on howland island 
disappearing near the end of a 2550mile flight over water on july 
2 1937 
no trace of the plane or its pilot and navigator were found and 
theories about their fate have since abounded including one that 
earhart landed on another island was imprisoned by the japanese and 
was executed as a spy 
with 950 gallons they could have made it just nesbit 67 
said in a telephone interview but unfortunately she experienced 
relatively strong head winds on the flight and her safety margin 
evaporated so she must have come down in the sea 
nesbit whose research was published in the february edition of 
aeroplane monthly magazine calculated that earhart was flying about 
35 miles west or northwest of howland island when her last frantic 
message that she was about to crash was received by the us coast 
guard cutter itasca 20 hours and 20 minutes after takeoff 
it is evident she must have come down in the sea a few minutes 
later when she believed she was nowhere near howland island 
nesbit wrote 
nesbit says other researchers have suggested earhart landed on 
the japanesecontrolled mili atoll 23 hours and 10 minutes after 
takeoff having turned back after failing to find howland island 
this suggests the flight duration was the maximum possible if 
the electra had been fueled to capacity he wrote 
the aircraft converted from a lockheed airliner had a fuel 
capacity of 1150 gallons he said but in a feb 13 1937 letter 
to the director of britains civil aviation authority earhart wrote 
that she intended to carry probably 1000 gallons of gasoline on 
her longest flight over the pacific 
nesbit said he found the original letter written by earhart on 
her headed notepaper and bearing her signature in londons public 
record office 
he said that according to fuel consumption figures supplied to 
him by lockheed 950 gallons would have given the twinengine plane 
an endurance of 20 hours and 13 minutes 
in her final message earhart said she was flying north and south 
on a line but did not give a reference point 
this sounds as though amelia was chasing shadows on the surface 
of the sea formed by the cumulus clouds above or was flying toward 
more distant clouds in the hope that these were the smoke which the 
itasca was making nesbit wrote 
he dismissed the notion that she was on a mission to photograph 
the japaneseheld island of truk saying she would have crossed it 
at night and nightphotography equipment had not yet been perfected 
he also wrote that contrary to the belief at the time that her 
plane would float the metal aircraft was likely to have sunk 
immediately

stuttering once thought to be 
psychological has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists 
who hope to understand many disorders by making 3d videotapes of 
the brain in action 
subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow were 
found in brains of 60 percent of stutterers whose speech is broken 
by abnormal pauses repetitions stststuttering or prolongations 
ssssstuttering of sounds said audiologist terese finitzo who 
directed the university of texas studies 
she said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percent 
of people with spasmodic dysphonia in which malfunctioning vocal 
cords produce a hoarse strained strangledsounding voice 
the dallas scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people with 
spasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging pictures 
of brain anatomy unlike cat scans which use xrays the technique 
uses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs 
the scientists also made maps of brain electrical activity as 
measured by electrodes on the head and images of brain blood flow 
but they also developed a way to process the twodimensional maps 
of brain electrical activity to pinpoint the location of that 
activity 
that let them superimpose the brain anatomy and electrical 
activity images then string them together on videotape to make an 
animated movie or cartoon so as electrical activity progresses you 
can see it moving through the brain in three dimensions said dr 
kenneth pool a neurologist in the texas group bloodflow images 
will be added later 
such technology might help scientists understand how the brain 
works and perhaps eventually how to better diagnose and treat 
speech defects mental illness epilepsy dyslexia alzheimers and 
parkinsons diseases poststroke speech loss and other disorders 
pool said 
the technique is expected to radically alter brain disease 
evaluation and management for neurologists psychiatrists and 
neurosurgeons said a news release from the american 
speechlanguagehearing association 
scientists have long believed that the speech impediments were 
psychological but in recent years many have linked the impediments 
to brain malfunctions that can be aggravated by psychological stress 
that view is supported by findings of the governmentfunded 2 
million texas research outlined by finitzo pool and colleagues 
monday at the annual meeting of the american association for the 
advancement of science 
the studies also suggest the speech defects have many causes 
because not all the patients had brain abnormalities pool said 
about 1 percent of americans stutter to some degree spasmodic 
dysphonia is uncommon although there are no reliable estimates 
finitzo said 
stutterers and people with spasmodic dysphonia often receive 
speech therapy to learn to slow down breathe differently or 
otherwise alter their speaking habits but for many the benefits 
are minimal pool said 
he said patients are relieved when told their stuttering or 
spasmodic dysphonia is physical 
weve had people say thank god its not my fault they dont 
have to feel responsible for it even if everybodys telling them 
if you just relax you can speak better he said 
arnold e aronson head of speech pathology at the mayo clinic in 
minnesota said there are several forms of the speech defects and 
that people whose stuttering is psychological may get improper 
treatment if they believe otherwise 
aronson questioned the reliability of the texas teams methods 
saying they were biased by preconceptions and studied too few 
patients he also accused them of making conclusions far beyond 
what the facts imply and of failing to conduct adequate 
psychiatric exams of their patients 
but he did say there is great merit in what they are doing 
louisiana state university speech scientist ray daniloff agreed 
more people should be studied but said he reviewed much of the 
texas research for the government and concluded the data are good 
the methodology is sound 
i think its good work said university of connecticut speech 
scientist peter j alfonso they are probably the only people in 
the world using a combination of new brainimaging techniques to 
investigate stuttering 
pool and aronson agreed the brain abnormalities arent 
necessarily the direct cause of stuttering and spasmodic dysphonia 
and that the abnormalities and speech defects could result from some 
other ultimate cause 
but because the abnormalities are in parts of the brain believed 
to control speech the texans believe the abnormalities cause the 
impediments even if they ultimately might be caused by a chemical 
flaw in the brain a gene injury tiny strokes or even pollutants 
pool said

lower on the tokyo stock exchange

yen from fridays close of 12665 yen after opening at 12793 yen

selected issues dipped 7086 points or 023 percent to close at

finance minister tatsuo murayama attributed the dollars strength 
to the difference in key interest rates between japan and the united 
states and to reported statements by west german monetary 
authorities that the dollars current level is acceptable 
murayama said the bank of japan will not intervene to stem the 
dollars rise because the situation does not require imediate 
countermeasures 
currency traders said the dollars remarkable strength against 
the yen followed the us currencys bullish advance in overseas 
markets overnight the dollar closed monday in london at 12805 yen 
and in new york at 12810 yen 
traders said the dollar also was strong because of reduced 
chances for central bank intervention in the united states and japan 
due to national holidays 
many us traders were absent from the market monday in 
observance of rev martin luther kings birthday while japanese 
banks and government offices were also closed monday in observance 
of the coming of age day 
there were strong demands for buying the dollar but traders 
fear over intervention prevented such a move said a dealer at a 
major commercial bank speaking on condition of anonymity then 
when they were freed from such a fear they all went out to buy the 
dollar 
but the traders added that the dollars gain is unlikely to 
continue ahead of us trade reports due wednesday in washington 
on the tokyo stock exchange dealers said the dollars steep gain 
sidelined many investors 
the market seems to be taking a break tuesday because of 
unstable currency rates said a dealer at a major brokerage house 
in tokyo but the underflow of the market is still bullish

edward zarnow jr came from australia to plan 
his fathers funeral now other relatives must plan funerals for the 
son and two other family members who authorities say died from fumes 
from the same faulty furnace 
it was a tremendous and gross loss of lives milwaukee county 
medical examiner jeffrey jentzen said monday i think it makes 
everyone humble to see this type of disaster happen 
after the 89yearold zarnow died wednesday autopsy results 
revealed extensive heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver the 
death was attributed to natural causes and no toxicological exams 
were believed necessary jentzen said 
theres not a medical examiners office in this country that 
would have handled this case any differently he said 
as relatives gathered for the funeral they stayed at his 
suburban greendale home 
sunday morning his niece audrey brennan called police when she 
telephoned the home and got no answer an officer knocked on the 
door but got no response 
hours later mrs brennan called police back to say she had found 
the three bodies in the house 
my wife could have been there too her husband frank said 
monday evening from their milwaukee home she was supposed to pick 
them up then the others said they would do it they were going to 
pick them up at the airport and then stay at the house 
jentzen confirmed monday that carbon monoxide poisoning killed 
edward zarnow jr 57 of new south wales australia zarnow jrs 
37yearold niece karen s martin of marshfield and her husband 
michael 38 
zarnow jrs wife rebecca 56 was in critical condition monday 
night after treatment in a hyperbaric chamber according to a 
nursing supervisor at st lukes hospital 
jentzen said further tests on the elder zarnows body showed he 
too died of carbon monoxide poisoning 
this was a very rare and unusual case because of the 
circumstances and the loss of lives jentzen said 
after the bodies were discovered investigators found the gas 
furnaces regulator was not properly adjusted causing too much gas 
to go into the furnace wisconsin natural gas co spokesman paul 
markovina said 
the overburning caused incomplete combustion that filled the 
house with carbon monoxide a colorless oderless and lethal gas he 
said 
the coroners report said five burners in the furnace were 
clogged causing improper burning although brennan said the unit 
had annual inspections 
brennan also said the senior zarnow was a machinist and worked as 
a supervisor at a factory before he retired 
the home was built as part of the original greendale development 
part of franklin delano roosevelts green belt program of the 1930s 
brennan said 
edward zarnow iii a resident of orange australia said his 
father was an elementary school teacher but had retired last month 
and hoped to spend time golfing woodworking and traveling 
he said his father who grew up in the house where he died moved 
to australia in 1971 with his wife and four children and they 
became citizens of that country 
at the time australia was bringing teachers over and my 
father was looking at a new place to teach and he thought it would 
be a good change so we came across zarnow 29 said from 
australia 
brennan said seven relatives planned to arrive today from 
australia 
this is so stupefying on the surface he said thankfully 
theres been so much activity at his home that its distracted my 
wife 
friends had stopped by bringing food for the family and 
talking about other things he said it helps keep the ball 
rolling

the western shoshone indians have vowed to 
press their claim to full grazing rights on a halfmillion acres of 
land despite an appeals court ruling limiting the number of horses 
and cows they can have 
this isnt the end to litigation we dont consider this issue 
resolved said thomas e leubben attorney for the western 
shoshone national council only congress can resolve the western 
shoshone land issue 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on wednesday reversed us 
district judge bruce thompsons september 1986 order that gave 
sisters mary and carrie dann members of the shoshone tribe the 
right to graze cattle and horses at their 180acre ranch in 
northcentral nevadas crescent valley 
thompson had ruled the danns had aboriginal and treaty rights to 
graze their livestock on 530000 acres without being regulated by 
federal agencies or paying grazing fees 
the appellate ruling limits the danns to grazing 26 cows and 79 
horses the number their parents had on the land when the 1934 
taylor grazing act took effect the sisters currently have 768 cows 
and 850 horses 
a tearful carrie dann said at a news conference monday she has no 
plans to reduce the herd 
im not really afraid of going to jail because i believe im 
right she said 
the us government sued the danns for trespassing in 1974 to 
prevent them from using the land for grazing the 14yearold case 
has been argued three times in federal court in reno twice in the 
appeals court and once before the us supreme court 
the sisters claim that an 1863 treaty with the united states 
gives them the right to use the land for grazing 
the government contends that the western shoshone lost its 
ancestral land in 1979 when the indian claims commission awarded the 
tribe 26 million for the acreage the indians have refused to 
accept the money 
this land was never given by the united states to us it is the 
creators land carrie dann said monday 
the creator put us on this land she said we were not placed 
here by the united states government our livelihood is tied to this 
land they wanted to do away with our livelihood theyre trying to 
destroy our beliefs our culture 
luebben of albuquerque nm said he would continue to argue 
the case in federal court but added he would try other avenues 
considering this decision by the 9th circuit court of appeals 
the shoshone people are going to have to appeal to the public and to 
congress luebben said 
we consider this decision to be wrong and extremely unjust 
he said there is still institutional racism in the united 
states

for a group of former us marines a return 
visit to vietnam touched off memories of their tense first trip to 
the war zone more than 20 years ago and also opened up sights they 
had never seen before ap special correspondent george esper on his

five former us marines stood at what 
was their military base two decades ago surrounded by unexploded 
shells they unfurled the stars and stripes and prayed and wept for 
their fallen comrades 
while mike wallace a 41yearold farmer from langdon kansas 
prayed for help to deal with the memories the pain and the 
loneliness poor women and children with hoes hacked away at the 
reddish dirt trying to uncover the casings of shells for scrap 
metal 
they said that two weeks ago an old man was killed when an 
uncovered shell exploded and that such shells had killed many 
others including children 
a vietnamese captain hoang van thanh stood with the americans 
at the ceremony just south of what was once the demilitarized zone 
that divided vietnam at the 17th parallel he verified that mines 
and other unexploded artillery and mortar shells were still killing 
and wounding civilians 
the former us marines had suspected that civilians were still 
being killed and wounded by unexploded shells and land mines that 
their engineer battalion the 11th marines planted to protect a 
string of us bases just below the dmz in the late 1960s 
the men who came back to check claims by vietnamese officials 
that all of the mines had been cleared were shocked to see the 
children picking at the shellings at the former us artillery base 
at gio linh 
i feel outrage said nate genna a 41yearold maintenance 
worker from boston as he looked out over the children this whole 
place should be quarantined fenced up only professional people 
not children look at them 
wallace said my legs are walking but my mind is not wanting to 
do this because for so long i spent time in this place watching 
people get killed 
its peaceful but im real nervous he said ive got to 
admit i could hardly get out of the van to come up here im scared 
to death the time i was here we was under attack and thats the 
only memories i have of here 
even though its in peace its still looks awfully threatening 
to me 
in the salute to the dead gene spanos a 39yearold police 
lieutenant from rosemont ill said on behalf of the men that 
lost their lives and women in vietnam during the conflict we 
present this small ceremony some token of appreciation in the lives 
that they gave for those who did not return eternal rest for 
those who did return gratitude and peace 
everywhere the former marines went they were greeted warmly as 
they retraced their steps northward along highway 1 where they once 
swept the road for land mines 
children followed them along the route and the americans stopped 
to snap photos 
this is the first time ive felt were performing our mission 
since ive been here said william johnson 41 of manchester 
conn this is for the people 
this is where it all began said fireman frank noe 40 from 
stoughton mass this is where we grew up this is where we became 
men 20 years ago

us secretary of education lauro f 
cavazos said minority students are getting an inferior education 
because of a lack of minority teachers 
cavazos on monday called the shortage a matter of true 
urgency pointing out that 30 percent of the nations students are 
minorities while only 13 percent of the educators are 
today the person that takes roll and assigns work is 
usually an anglo teacher doing the best he can do cavazos said 
in the keynote address to the national conference on recruitment and 
retention of minority students in the eyes of some minority 
students knowledge and education are equated with whites and 
perhaps minority students believe education belongs to one group 
or another he said 
national education association president mary hatwood futrell 
said earlier monday that the minority student population is expected 
to increase in the 1990s as the number of minority teachers in 
public schools drops to 3 percent 
futrell said a shortage of minority teachers will threaten the 
system because it deprives minority students of positive role models 
and creates an educational deficit for whites because it gives 
them a distorted view of the world and valuable contact with 
teachers who offer dramatic proof that adversity can be overcome and 
that the american dream is not a myth 
cavazos said more minority teachers must be recruited and that 
recruitment must begin in elementary schools by encouraging 
minorities in academia 
he also said parents should work with and encourage their 
children during the preschool years 
if we educators made it a top priority to enlist the aid of 
parents think what a difference it would make he said we must 
help all parents create a home environment that supports achievement 
and learning too often in lowincome homes education is 
undervalued 
futrell noted an anthropological study that found students at a 
predominantly black washington dc high school were limiting 
their academic success so their peers wont think they are acting 
white 
the teachers union president said educators have to do 
something to ensure that our children dont think this way and 
said schools should develop courses and programs aimed at helping 
build selfesteem 
futrell said students must be told its ok to be smart to use 
your abilities and excel

wonderful day of my life said kathy scifres who married larry

exconvict who was befriended several years earlier by scifres 
family 
deputy prosecutor brett niemeier maintained scifres shot cope at 
pointblank range after a heated argument over a gasoline spill at 
her tavern kathys lounge he argued for a tougher 30year 
sentence citing the extreme brutality of the shooting 
no one has the right to shoot someone while hes running point 
a gun almost directly at his heart and kill him he said shes 
getting married the day of her sentencing doesnt that tell you 
something about her arrogance toward the system 
scifres attorney william marshall argued someone else was 
responsible for copes death and said police pursued a 
halfbaked case against his client despite the existence of 
other suspects 
scifres and the groom sipped pink punch and ate white wedding

the council in unanimously approving the peacekeeping force on 
monday asked secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to identify 
possible tangible costsaving measures to the mission 
theres going to be a considerable reduction in money gen 
vernon a walters the us ambassador told reporters after the 
vote he said helicopters and sensors can monitor an area better 
that soldiers just standing shouldertoshoulder on the ground 
blackruled nations of southern africa had lobbied to deploy the 
7500 peacekeepers at least 360 military police and 2000 civilian 
administrators under un auspices at a cost of about 800 million 
a year 
but the councils five permanent members the united states 
soviet union china britain and france want to hold the cost to 
between 400 million and 500 million diplomats said on condition 
of anonymity 
the council must now determine the strength of peacekeeping 
forces and cost of their deployment under the un plan whereby the 
territory also known as namibia will become independent after 
elections in november 
in its resolution the council asked perez de cuellar to prepare 
a report estimating the size and needs of the un transition 
assistance group 
when the report is ready probably in about two weeks the

namibia is to gain independence under peace accords signed dec 
22 by angola cuba and south africa that also stipulate that 50000 
cuban troops in neighboring angola will leave by july 1991

from 7500 to 3200 because fighting has stopped between south 
african forces of the southwest africa peoples organization

president reagan saying hes bitter about 
former white house chief of staff donald t regans kiss and 
tell book has disclosed that he quietly prepared for his former 
aides departure for months before he left 
the president in an interview broadcast on cable news network on 
monday insisted there was no firing at all 
however the president added that he planned to use a letter of 
resignation regan had submitted months before i set out at the 
same time then to start quietly and hoping leakproof to have a 
successor on hand for when he announced the time he was going to 
go reagan said 
reagan acknowledged in the interview that regan had been having 
problems with nancy reagan the first lady and that one of his 
weaknesses as president is that i know that i have a soft heart 
regan who had been treasury secretary and thenwhite house 
chief of staff james a baker iii told the president they wanted to 
switch jobs in early 1985 and he approved the request 
regan left at the end of february 1987 at the height of the 
irancontra scandal and was replaced by former sen howard baker 
rtenn reagan insisted at the time he did not fire regan saying 
regan had indicated at some earlier time he wanted to return to 
private business 
in the monday night interview however reagan said he quietly 
hoped to be able use a letter of resignation which regan had 
submitted months earlier when the chief of staff indicated he would 
not likely serve through reagans entire second term 
there was one of those leaks that seems to be so prevalent in 
this institution the president said and it leaked publicly 
and i guess he felt insulted 
regan was infuriated when there were premature news reports of 
his resignation coupled with reports of bakers selection 
cnn anchorman bernard shaw at one point asked reagan about 
maureen reagans interview statement that allowing regan to become 
chief of staff had been her fathers biggest mistake 
i saw that happened to be watching television and saw that 
he replied asked if he disagreed with her statement the president 
said no i said thats my girl 
reagan said he is bitter about regans book for the record 
in which the former chief of staff harshly criticized reagans 
executive management style and also maintained that first lady nancy 
reagan played a heavy hand in white house affairs 
i was very displeased with that and yes it hurt reagan 
said none of the attack was leveled at me only at her and she 
didnt deserve it anyway 
if i can use some rather rough language ive had a belly 
full of these kissandtell books and so many of them that avoid 
criticizing me but lay into nancy he said 
in a separate cnn interview mrs reagan was asked to describe 
reagans reaction to regans comments in the book about the first 
lady 
he was upset mrs reagan said she added the president also 
didnt like it when she told him that his chief of staff had 
hung up on her twice 
he didnt know about the hanging up the first time because i 
didnt tell him she said the second time i told him 
mrs reagan charged that regan didnt tell the truth in his 
book and said that she intended to tell everything everything 
the way it really happened in her memoirs due to be published 
later this year 
reagan also was asked about reports that his administration had 
recently considered attacking a libyan plant that is believed to be 
producing chemical weapons 
i never like to talk about what the options might be that are 
considered in anything of that kind and no we had we were not 
planning such an option the president said

the chief executive of the 
countrys largest commercial bank who has long worked to end 
apartheid is leaving south africa to take a job with a european 
firm the bank announced 
chris ball 49 was one of several prominent south african 
businessmen who flew to lusaka zambia in 1985 for talks with 
leaders of the outlawed african national congress which is waging a 
bombing and sabotage campaign to overthrow the white minority 
government 
another member of the business delegation tony bloom emigrated 
to britain a year ago quitting his job as chief executive of the 
premier group conglomerate 
ball who has maintained open contacts with militant black 
leaders said he was going abroad for personal and societal 
reasons 
you know what my views are you can look them up all over the 
place he told business day a johannesburg newspaper 
first national bank formerly barclays of south africa said 
monday that balls resignation was effective immediately details of 
his new job were not immediately disclosed pending an announcement 
by his new employers 
in 1987 ball became entangled in a bitter confrontation with 
president pw botha in connection with newspaper advertisements 
that called for ending the ban on the anc 
speaking in parliament botha suggested ball had funded the 
newspaper ads ball challenged botha to repeat the remark outside 
parliament where he would not have immunity from prosecution for 
slander 
botha subsequently appointed a supreme court judge to conduct an 
inquiry in the matter the judge concluded that ball had lied when 
he denied knowing that a loan he had approved would be used to pay 
for the advertisement 
business day in an editorial today said both ball and bloom 
took up advance positions as opponents of apartheid 
the corporate executive who gets too far ahead of the crowd 
runs some severe risks not the least of which may be 
disillusionment and personal exhaustion it said fighting 
apartheid can be a lonely business 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
ball joined barclays of south africa in 1973 and became managing 
director in 1984 in 1987 the banks parent company in britain sold 
its shares and the south african management changed the banks name 
to first national bank

national weather service said in a statement monday night after the 
mercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country 
temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s 
the relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists joggers 
and municipal budgets but a bane for snowmobile dealers winter 
festival organizers and some ski resort operators 
weve really had to scrap with nature to get every bit of snow 
this year matt kelly said at brodie mountain ski resort in 
western massachusetts which reluctantly loaned grafton ny 
snow for its winter festival last weekend 
meteorologists say climatic conditions such as upperatmosphere 
winds havent encouraged the kind of storms that leave a heavy snow 
cover 
its pretty free of snow from the southern and central plains 
to the atlantic coast hugh crowther of the national severe storms 
forecast center in kansas city mo said today 
they have quite a bit of snow across the northern tier but 
its remaining up there 
much of the area from burlington vt to bangor maine was as 
brown and bare monday as it was last summer even in the regions 
far northern snow belt snowfall has been far below normal 
as of monday portland maine had received a paltry 42 inches 
of snow this winter compared with a normal 302 inches 
buffalo ny often the butt of snow jokes has received just 
16 inches 30 inches below normal 
were enjoying the weather right now said buffalo streets 
commissioner stan buczkowski but were not going to kid 
ourselves we know weve got two months of winter left and were 
going to get some snow 
in the midwest iowa received just 13 inches last month the 
seventh lowest december total in 102 years large areas of the state 
had no snow at all temperatures averaged 259 degrees 16 degrees 
above normal and on dec 2 sidney and indianola basked in balmy 
65degree weather 
illinois normally has had 16 inches of snow by now but only 6 
inches have fallen temperatures have been 6 to 8 degrees higher 
than the normal 29 degrees 
the 30day outlook calls for continued mild weather with 
temperatures averaging about 60 to 65 percent above normal allan 
morrison of the weather service said in chicago 
in some sections of the midwest hit hard by last summers drought 
and heat wave the low snowfall is not expected to hurt the 
replenishment of depleted water supplies officials said however a 
lack of snow cover can cause wind erosion they said 
in the west winter has been more familiar colorado for 
example has had an average snow year with ski resorts reporting 
bases of 30 inches to 86 inches 
while western ski resorts have had little to worry about some 
crosscountry ski resorts in the east have had to close officials 
said 
some eastern downhill ski resorts stayed in business by putting 
snowmaking equipment to use but others said bare ground in major 
cities has made it tough to persuade wouldbe schussers to head for 
the slopes crosscountry races at festivals in several new york 
communities have been canceled 
many of the new york festivals which bring in 5 million to 10 
million annually dont start until late this month or early 
february but organizers are worried syracuse where winterfest 
begins jan 27 and which normally gets 1099 inches of snow is 
barren 
the weather has also put the brakes on snowmobile sales in 
brunswick maine preseason sales were healthy but after december 
it just fell flat on its face said chris gould who said fellow 
dealers reported it was the worst season since 1980 
but for those who miss the snow theres always the chance of a 
change in the weather 
it can turn around in such a hurry that people may not be 
talking about lack of snow before long weather service 
meteorologist mike noble said in portland we could see a lot of 
snow in a hurry

the engineers of two trains that crashed 
headon in bangladeshs deadliest rail accident said today that they 
both had received clearance to continue their journey on the same 
track 
railway officials said at least 114 people died when a 10car 
express train and a mail train slammed into each other sunday 
outside the farming village of maizdi khan about 16 miles north of 
dhaka the capital 
as many as 1000 people were injured 
the government was investigating whether operators using a 
sophisticated signaling system installed five days before the crash 
gave the wrong signal or no signal 
the engineer of the mail train mohammad abdur rashid said the 
signal at a nearby railway station was not working but he received 
written clearance from the stationmaster to proceed 
i suddenly saw another train coming from the opposite direction 
on the same track he said 
i blew the emergency horn several times to draw the attention 
of the driver of the other train rashid told the associated press 
from his hospital bed 
the driver of the express train mostafa ahmed also said he had 
clearance and continued to drive at normal speed about 50 mph 
ahmed said he left the railway station after he was given a 
yellow signal which meant that the track ahead was clear 
the investigative commission has seized documents from the two 
railway stations and started interviewing witnesses and railway 
officials in an effort to determine the cause of the accident 
the government today said the death toll was 77 but its count 
generally is considered low because of bureaucratic delays dhaka 
newspapers said as many as 200 people had died 
officials estimated that more than 2000 people were aboard the 
trains many of them moslem pilgrims hundreds of thousands of 
people gathered in the city of tongi for the biswa ejtema or world 
congregation islams second largest pilgrimage after the haj in 
mecca saudi arabia

when miamis overtown neighborhood erupted in 
flames monday night city leaders immediately attempted to calm 
fears by talking to angry residents city commissioner rosario 
kennedy was escorted on a tour behind the roadblocks by two police 
officers and accompanied by associated press newsman will lester 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rosario kennedy was looking for a better 
understanding of the black rage that descended upon miami on the day 
that honors the rev martin luther king jr 
the cubanborn city commissioner found her answers early today on 
a dark corner of 20th st and nw 3rd ave in the heart of overtown 
miami guys auto parts had burned to a shell a torched car was 
turned on its side 
the riot started after by a motorcyclists death monday night at 
least two officers were pursuing the motorcycle for an alleged 
traffic violation one of the officers fired a shot the motorcycle 
crashed into a moving car killing the cycles 21yearold driver 
police said police refused to say whether he was hit by the bullet 
wary police in riot gear kept automatic rifles poised 
occasionally dropping the barrel toward any rapid movement 
on the corner was a group of about 15 young black men angry 
nervous watching every police move 
the 43yearold mrs kennedy just over 5 feet tall in her pumps 
and wearing a bright red pants and top walked over 
what caused this to happen she asked 
how can a person shoot a guy riding a motorcycle replied one 
man who would not identify himself do something about the ones 
that got the guns 
as his voice rose the others lost their shyness the crowd began 
to grow 
a young shirtless teenager stepped forward 
the blacks have been here since i dont know when he said 
but 10000 cubans a year they get jobs just like that and now 
the nicaraguans 
miami officials have been providing shelter at a stadium for 
about 250 nicaraguans seeking political asylum 
a stone clattered to the pavement and several police rifles 
leveled at the crowd 
dont you murder him came a cry from another teen were 
coming to your homes if theres another murder 
as the anger grew police quietly urged mrs kennedy into a 
waiting car 
during the ride through the streets of overtown with two officers 
and a reporter mrs kennedy got the scare of the night when her car 
approached a group of heavily armed policeman 
the police dropped behind the car doors and leveled pistols 
directly at mrs kennedy and the driver officer raymond carvil

dropped 
gunfire crackled in the early morning hours amid the housing 
projects and officers shouted reports of molotov cocktails one 
latin man living in a project with his wife was reportedly beaten on 
his front porch officers said 
mrs kennedy and other city leaders had hoped this weeks super 
bowl would polish up the image of miami a onetime tropical 
paradise tarnished by race riots in 1980 and 1982 the flood of 
refugees from cuba in 1980 and the colombian drug wars throughout 
the decade but she admitted the opportunity was fast slipping away 
its extremely unfortunate that its happening now she said 
and she found more anger than shed expected 
i was surprised by the depth of anger she said well be

new studies on type a behavior indicate 
that being an impatient workaholic doesnt necessarily hurt your 
heart but distrusting others and having a low boiling point does 
the term type a probably has outlived its usefulness and 
people should concentrate on understanding angers poisonous effects 
on the heart dr redford b williams jr of duke university medical 
center said at a meeting of the american heart association 
being a workaholic being in a hurry interrupting people are 
not necessarily bad for your heart williams said monday what 
is bad is if you have high levels of hostility and anger and you 
dont bother to hide it when dealing with other people 
experts for many years had thought classic type as aggressive 
rushrush people were setting themselves up for heart attacks 
many of us had thought that the definition of type a was too 
broad said dr wayne j katon of the university of washington 
dr williams is narrowing it down 
in a study to be published soon in psychosomatic medicine 
williams and colleagues described a followup study of 118 students 
who took a personality test during law school twentyfive years 
later 20 percent of those who scored in the highest quarter on the 
hostility scale had died compared with 5 percent of those who 
scored lowest 
the research showed that being paranoid or neurotic or avoiding 
social contact were not associated with heart attacks instead 
those at high risk tend to harbor a cynical mistrust of other 
peoples motives they get angry often and openly express their 
displeasure rather than holding it in 
williams said this makeup could be a problem for perhaps 20 
percent of the population and they probably have these tendencies 
from birth 
such people tend to get furious for instance in slowmoving 
bank lines they complain to themselves about why other customers 
havent filled out their deposit slips ahead of time and may show 
their unhappiness by making sour faces or even surly comments to 
those ahead of them 
im not talking about anxiety waiting in line williams said 
im talking about anger 
there is no evidence to support the common belief that people are 
better off expressing their anger rather than keeping it to 
themselves williams said 
whether people can help themselves by trying to control their 
feelings of rage is still not clear but williams said that such 
attempts at behavior change are harmless and may help 
researchers also are starting to understand the biological 
differences between angry people and calmer folks that may explain 
why they have more heart trouble 
in behavior laboratories researchers have measured peoples 
blood pressures while asking them to solve word puzzles they found 
that angry peoples blood pressures shoot up dramatically if they 
are deliberately harassed during the experiments while the blood 
pressures of people with cooler temperaments stay normal 
williams said other evidence points to basic differences in 
peoples nervous systems depending on whether they have hostile 
personalities the work suggests that the parasympathetic nervous 
system which counteracts the temperpumping effects of adrenalin 
is slow to kick in among angerprone people 
perhaps trusting hearts last longer because they are protected 
by the parasympathetic nervous system against the ravages of the 
adrenalinproducing sympathetic system said williams

martin luther king jrs battles for voting 
rights were remembered as the first black county commissioners 
elected in 112 years were sworn in by alabamas first black federal 
judge 
we bring home to dallas county the harvest of the martin luther 
king voting rights act said us district judge uw clemon who 
administered the oath of office monday to the three blacks and two 
whites in the countys new government 
the election of the first blacks to the dallas county commission 
since reconstruction followed 10 years of legal combat that 
abolished the old atlarge election system which had kept the panel 
all white for more than a century 
under the new election plan commissioners are elected from five 
districts three with large or nominal black voting majorities 
dallas county with a population of 55000 is about 56 percent 
black 
the three black commissioners erskine minor dl pope and 
perry varner were sworn in along with white commissioners deans 
barber and doug morrow at a courthouse ceremony in which the 
overflow crowd of about 300 sang the battle hymn of the republic 
the ceremony coincided with alabamas state holiday for both 
confederate gen robert e lee and king who led the 1965 
selmatomontgomery voting rights march the march took place with 
federal protection after a band of marchers were beaten and routed 
by mounted state troopers on the edmund pettus bridge which crosses 
the alabama river at selma 
bloody sunday as the bridge violence became known drew 
national attention to the next march led by king which helped 
inspire passage of the 1965 federal voting rights act 
i suspect there is no place on this planet that is more 
identified with dr king and his quest for american justice than 
right here in selma alabama james p turner said after mondays 
ceremony a few blocks from the bridge 
turner investigated violence against voting rights marchers in 
1965 and is acting head of the justice departments civil rights 
division for the reagan administration he and a team of justice 
department lawyers helped win the election system change in selma 
i predict that someday students of modern history will point to 
selma alabama as 20th century americas cradle of democracy where 
people of all races began to live doctor kings dream of 
brotherhood turner said

citing new evidence the government has reopened 
the case of four people jailed for life in two 1974 bombings of 
british pubs that killed seven people including three soldiers and 
injured 91 
the bombings occurred during a wave of ira terrorism and 
champions of the guildford four said the government had in its 
zeal to obtain convictions ignored evidence that pointed to other 
suspects 
the irish government welcomed mondays decision and the times of 
london said in an editorial today that it was as difficult as it 
was wise 
responding to pressure that made the case a cause celebre in 
britain and ireland home secretary douglas hurd told parliament 
monday that new information had emerged meriting that the case be 
heard by the court of appeal 
carole richardson 31 patrick armstrong 36 paul hill 34 and 
gerry conlon 33 were convicted of planting bombs in two pubs 
frequented by british soldiers in guildford a town southwest of 
london in october 1974 five people including two soldiers were 
killed and 65 injured 
armstrong and hill also were convicted of a pub bombing in the 
london suburb of woolwich a month later in which the bartender and a 
soldier died and 26 people were injured 
all four were sentenced to life imprisonment in october 1975 and 
two years later a court rejected their appeal 
in a written reply to a lawmakers question hurd said he was 
satisfied that there are new and substantial points which clearly 
are best considered by the court 
these he said included apparent alibis for hill and miss 
richardson that had never been put to a court and indications that 
miss richardson was injected with drugs during her interrogation and 
suffering symptoms of withdrawal from barbiturates 
the possible effects of these drugs on the reliability of her 
statements were not adequately exposed to the jury or the court of 
appeal hurd said 
however hurd declined to act on a point of law raised by two 
senior british judges who have argued that the appeals court ruled 
against the four despite being aware of confessions by two irish 
republican army men to the bombings 
the irish government in a statement said it has consistently 
conveyed the serious concern about the guildford four case to the 
british authorities grant mckee coauthor of time bomb a 
recent book on the case said we are very gratified that this is 
the first official recognition of the justifiable concern about this 
case which has attracted people of the eminence of two archbishops 
two law lords and two former home secretaries 
the archbishops are archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
spiritual head of the church of england and archbishop of 
westminster cardinal basil hume leader of roman catholics in 
england and wales the law lords two of britains most senior 
judges are lord devlin and lord scarman the two former home 
secretaries are merlyn rees and lord jenkins 
cardinal tomas o fiaich the roman catholic primate of all 
ireland called mondays move a culmination of the efforts of 
people in britain and ireland who have become convinced of the 
innocence of these people 
it is the second time in two years that the government has 
reopened a case involving people convicted of ira terrorism who 
claimed to be victims of a miscarriage of justice 
six irishmen serving life terms for pub bombings in birmingham in 
1974 that killed 21 people went before the court of appeal after a 
similar campaign but their convictions were upheld last year 
like the birmingham six the guildford four have figured strongly 
in angloirish relations they are held up as examples by those who 
claim british courts are biased against the irish or those who 
sympathize with the ira 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the 95 
percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule

voice of america it wont be but a state 
official is hoping to start a little voice of kentucky of sorts 
and little it will be if paul warnecke starts broadcasting 
governmental proceedings on 10 watts of power thats roughly a 
fivemile radius from the transmitter 
warnecke director of the division of telecommunications wants 
the am station to promote tourism in frankfort 
no disc jockeys have been chosen and no decision has been made 
about whether gov wallace wilkinson will figure in the programming 
however a contract to build the transmitter will be put to bid 
later this month and whoever gets the contract will have to apply 
for a licence from the federal communications commission on behalf 
of the state 
vicky dennis of the tourism cabinet said programming likely would 
include publicity about attractions in frankfort and franklin county 
motorists would be alerted to the broadcast by signs along the 
highway dennis said its hoped the message would lure drivers into 
the capital city 
the small coverage area would be similar to the lowpower 
broadcasts that some major airports use to keep travelers aware of 
traffic conditions

two human rights organizations have chastised the 
reagan administration for providing military and financial 
assistance to military groups with poor human rights records 
in particular the organizations cited aid to the contra rebels 
in nicaragua the unita insurgency in angola and the national 
armies of el salvador guatemala the philippines and the sudan 
the criticism was detailed in a report the reagan 
administrations record on human rights in 1988 issued monday by 
the lawyers committee for human rights and human rights watch a 
newyork based organization that monitors and promotes human rights 
worldwide 
the two groups praised the reagan administration for placing a 
greater emphasis on human rights during the last few years than it 
had earlier 
the report noted the administrations insistence that human 
rights occupy a prominent place in the ussoviet agenda which it 
said has led to improvements in human rights in the soviet union 
including the release of hundreds of political and religious 
prisoners 
while the report acknowledged that soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev was also responsible for these changes the reagan 
administration was credited with taking advantage of the gorbachev 
opening by placing consistent pressure on human rights issues 
but the report chastised the reagan administration for largely 
disregarding rights transgressions in a host of friendly countries 
which attract little public attention in the united states such as 
kenya somalia and the sudan in africa indonesia nepal pakistan 
and sri lanka in asia and jordan morocco and saudi arabia in the 
middle east 
according to the report human rights violations often were 
overlooked out of fear that criticizing an ally particularly allied 
militaries fighting leftist rebellions would create an opportunity 
for communist influence 
for example it said the united states was a vocal apologist 
for gross abuses in turkey because the country is seen as a 
frontline state against the soviet army 
the report said the administrations most conspicuous failing 
was that it rarely protested abuses committed by the military once 
a civilian occupied a presidential palace moreover in certain 
cases such as el salvador guatemala honduras and occasionally the 
philippines the administration minimized abuses or denied that they 
were taking place 
the administration also was attacked for refraining from 
criticizing human rights violations by israel against palestinians 
in occupied territories 
but the report praised the administration for providing 
pressure at key moments to nudge certain dictators and military 
juntas allied with the united states towards elections as well as 
to protect newly elected civilian governments against military 
coups 
for example the report stated that in el salvador guatemala 
the philippines and south korea the administration played a role in 
easing out dictators and military juntas and replacing them with 
elected heads of state it also praised us action in haiti 
paraguay and chile 
in argentina bolivia el salvador and the philippines the 
report gave the reagan administration credit for weighing in at 
key moments when restive militaries threatened to overwhelm newly 
elected civilian presidents 
the report called on the incoming bush administration to report 
human rights violations accurately and to speak out against serious 
abuses wherever they are found 
human rights watch includes the organizations americas watch 
asia watch and helsinki watch the lawyers committee is a public 
interest law center working to promote international human rights 
law and legal procedures in the united states and abroad

the civil defense siren that cold war 
symbol of the fear of a soviet nuclear attack is being silenced in 
some san francisco bay communities where officials feel its 
obsolete 
it blows and it tells you a bomb is coming but the bomb 
would be here already said jim moore of alameda countys office 
of emergency services 
the warning system is out of date moore said recently 
most people dont even know what its about it has outlived its 
usefulness 
alameda county is following contra costa countys lead san mateo 
and santa clara counties still use the sirens and will test them 
jan 27 but other cities including san jose have chosen silence 
in contra costa county the sirens were inoperable before 
officials did away with them in 1983 said janet grenslitt of that 
countys office of emergency services 
it was kind of silly to have them grenslitt said she said 
most people would probably clog up 911 emergency phone lines if they 
heard the sirens slow whine 
moore said people today are trained to go to a television or 
radio during an emergency like many cities and counties alameda 
plans to rely on the emergency broadcast system 
originally people who heard the sirens were suposed to evacuate 
to shelters moore said there are very few shelters being 
adequately maintained officials said 
still santa clara county sounds its sirens on a quarterly basis 
and that wont stop said earl thompson of that countys office of 
emergency services 
hopefully it will pique your interest enough to turn on the 
radio thompson said then it will serve its purpose

an austrian tourist was fined 1500 after 
pleading guilty to harassing whales off maui 
it seems perfectly clear that he was chasing the whales us 
magistrate daral conklin said monday in issuing the fine for peter 
gottwald were he a us citizen he would spend several nights in 
jail 
in exchange for the guilty plea the us attorneys office 
dropped its request for a jail sentence 
us attorney dan bent who attended the court session said he 
was satisfied with the fine 
although federal offices and courts were closed in observance of 
martin luther king day the hearing was held so gottwald could 
return to austria later in the day 
gottwald said he pleaded guilty in order to return home 
this is ridiculous the whole situation he said this is 
not the aloha spirit 
gottwald and his girlfriend rented a boat on maui on jan 3 and 
went to a protected area to get a good look at the whales 
he says he did not think he was harassing the whales and was not 
sure how close he was allowed to get

police are looking for an adult who may 
have been behind an alleged drugselling venture by two boys ages 
10 and 14 who were arrested with 226 cash and three vials of crack 
in their pockets 
the youngsters were charged sunday with possession of a 
controlled substance but the charges were reduced to juvenile 
delinquency because of their ages they were to appear in suffolk 
county family court today 
the boys told police they had been working with an adult they 
both had family court warrants against them on nondrug related 
juvenile delinquency charges 
its a crying shame said suffolk county police lt john 
lynagh these dealers are using whatever means they have to sell 
crack 
the youngsters were nabbed in a popular drugselling location in 
this city on new yorks long island where police periodically swoop 
in and arrest drug dealers lynagh said monday 
i was shocked when i saw them i could not believe how old 
they were said suffolk county police patrolman john castorf 
lynagh said police want to question the adult for whom the youths 
said they were working the adult is apparently known to police but 
they declined to identify him 
three weeks ago lynagh said another 10yearold boy was 
arrested for selling drugs in the same area in that case an adult 
who had hired the youngster was later arrested he said 
these people believe we will not arrest the children so they 
have them make the deals lynagh said the kids are told to run 
when they see a cop

evictions maintenance complaints and other 
landlordtenant disputes are plaguing a lowcost housing project for 
the formerly homeless that was called a miracle by former president 
jimmy carter 
carter helped put up the fourtownhouse complex in 1986 through 
his association with habitat for humanity a nonprofit christian 
organization based in americus ga that builds and rehabilitates 
houses for the homeless nationwide 
tenants who help construct the buildings are selected by a 
habitat screening committee 
in chicago tenants are complaining of verbal abuse poor 
construction and unanswered pleas for help 
habitat officials say the tenants arent meeting their 
obligations 
a family of eight was evicted earlier this month for not paying 
rent the second eviction in nine months at the fourunit complex 
none of us can believe what is happening said arbie nelson 
a mother of seven who owes 1000 in rent and is fighting in court 
to avoid seeing her family become the third evicted 
habitat cant be expected to pick up the tab said patrick keen 
an official with a habitat chapter in chicago 
its painful that we have to take these kinds of actions 
against families because its contrary to everything we stand for 
in trying to reform these people keen said but everyone that 
claims to need help doesnt deserve help and people who are not 
living up to the very basic obligation of the minimal amount 
expected of them well we had no other choice 
several families were threatened with eviction in july 1987 after 
falling behind in their rent they said heating and maintenance 
problems led to huge utility bills and other problems 
habitat founder millard fuller and the groups west side chapter 
reached an agreement with the families reducing rents from 300 to 
264 and promising to correct the problems 
keen said the group had no choice but to begin evictions when 
tenants continued to withhold rent 
the latest to lose their apartment were vivian and marvin abrams 
and their eight children 
mrs abrams said she returned home earlier this month to find her 
children huddled outside in the cold and the familys possessions 
strewn along the curb 
the family owed 1300 in rent but mrs abrams said she had 
withheld some payments to protest unfinished work on the building 
she said she had just found a job when sheriffs deputies arrived 
with the eviction notice 
we helped build that house my 14yearold and i she said 
when i heard what was happening i rushed home with my new boss 
and we begged and pleaded with mr keen 
my boss pledged to pay whatever keen wanted and the sheriff 
said it was up to mr keen but patrick keen said no mrs 
abrams said 
keen said he was told by habitat officials in chicago to throw 
the family out 
there was an error made in evicting that family fuller said 
monday people are going to think habitat is a heartless 
organization that throws mothers and children out in the street in 
the dead of winter that is not the case this is the first time 
anybody has been evicted 
fuller said the groups regional director will be directed to 
fully investigate just what the situation is in chicago so we can 
rectify it 
we are aware that west side habitat has had rental problems 
with these families fuller said but two wrongs dont make a 
right 
fuller said that of 324 cities in which habitat operates we 
have had more trouble in chicago than any other city only new york 
has had similar problems

israel will try to ensure free access to the 
resort of taba for israeli vacationers when it opens talks with 
egypt later this week on the disputed border area foreign minister 
moshe arens said 
taba a 250acre strip of land at the northern tip of the red 
sea has troubled egyptianisraeli relations since israel refused to 
give back the land when it completed its withdrawal from the sinai 
desert in 1982 
israels cabinet decided monday that the government will not set 
any preconditions for the negotiations which open thursday in taba 
and will involve israeli egyptian and us delegations 
israel occupied taba and the sinai desert in the 1967 middle east 
war and returned the desert to egypt in accordance with the 1979 
usmediated peace treaty 
the taba dispute went to international arbitration last sept 
29 a fivemember panel met in geneva and awarded egypt some 
disputed key border points but said it was not authorized to 
determine the final demarcation line 
the debate now hinges on the sovereignity over the actual beach 
area which has an israeliowned hotel and a cabana 
at the cabinet meeting rightwing trade minister ariel sharon 
insisted on linking the taba negotiations with full normalization of 
ties between the two countries the cabinet rejected the idea 
arens expressed hope the cabinet decision would pave the way for 
improved ties we have paid the price for peace and now we want to 
ensure the improvement of relations 
we hope to create conditions for the continuing presence of 
israelis in the area and to solve the problem of compensation by 
egypt to the owners of the hotel he said on israel army radio 
we hope the egyptians are interested in developing the ties in 
turning taba into an example of coexistence 
the radio said israeli negotiators were instructed to seek free 
access to taba for vacationing israelis and common management of the 
sonesta hotel there

president reagan once referred to as a lunatic and 
nazi by the soviet media got a respectful farewell from a 
government newspaper that credited him for helping to forge warmer 
superpower ties 
another leading soviet newspaper gave a glowing portrait monday 
of secretary of state george p shultz calling him one of the 
architects of the turning point in sovietus relations 
of course reagan has remained reagan the anticommunist and 
the troubadour of western society the government newspaper 
izvestia said monday in a frontpage article but the 
restructuring of international relations could not bypass the white 
house 
in 1984 reagan quipped into an open microphone that he would 
begin bombing the soviet union in five minutes in the last days of 
his presidency however soviets recall not those five minutes 
but his five summit meetings with mikhail s gorbachev the izvestia 
newspaper said 
and this is not because we have short memories but because a 
long road lies ahead of us which we can only overcome together 
wrote izvestias melor sturua a former usbased correspondent 
pravda the communist party daily carried an extraordinarily 
intimate profile of shultz reagans secretary of state since july 
1982 
in the recent warming between the superpowers pravda said 
shultzs realism had a telling effect as well as his sober 
recognition of the fact that in the nuclear age the 
selfpreservation of our two countries can be guaranteed only by the 
avenues of dialogue 
pravda also told its readers that the us secretary of state is 
a father of five an experienced gourmet cook an ardent golf and 
tennis player and an avid devotee of ballroom dancing surprising 
revelations in a country where most citizens know virtually nothing 
about the lives of their own leaders 
pravda did make one barbed criticism of shultz in its profile of 
the outgoing cabinet member saying he had been keener than former 
us defense secretary caspar weinberger to send us troops to 
different corners of the planet to defend american interests 
it also said his middle east policy had been a flop but that it 
was necessary to pay shultz his due for recognizing in the 11th 
hour of the reagan presidency that it was time to begin a dialogue 
with the palestine liberation organization 
in his eight years as president reagan has been labeled a 
lunatic by the official tass news agency in 1983 and likened by 
pravda to a nazi an explosive comparison in a country that lost 20 
million people in world war ii 
the staterun media also made much of reagans own harshest 
comments such as his march 1983 description of the soviet union as 
an evil empire and his quip the following year about launching a 
bombing attack 
the official image of reagan began to warm with the coming of the 
1985 geneva summit and with changes made in both domestic and 
foreign policy by gorbachev named communist party chief in march 
1985 
without our perestroika restructuring there would have 
been no perestroika of reagan izvestia said monday new 
political thinking and a new world view dictated our docking 
together 
during his eight years in the white house ronald reagan 
recognized this the newspaper said 
at the close of reagans presidency soviet media cast him as a 
trustworthy bargaining partner izvestia expressed the hope that 
presidentelect george bush who will be sworn in friday would 
continue in his footsteps 
the last film made by reagan the actor in 1964 was called 
the killers commentator sturua wrote he said he hoped the last 
episode of reagans political life where he leaves the white 
house and passes the baton to george bush would be called 
continuity

fourteen czech human rights activists were 
still in custody today after their arrests during demonstrations to 
commemorate a student who burned himself alive to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion 
the group included banned playwright vaclav havel and jana 
sternova a former spokeswoman for the charter 77 human rights group 
who last year had an audience with president reagan in washington 
also among the 14 identified by czechoslovak staterun media as 
being in custody were alexandr vondra and dana nemcova charter 77 
spokespersons 
the arrests monday came as hundreds of riot police and water 
cannons moved into pragues central wenceslas square for a second 
straight day to disperse demonstrators some of whom attempted to 
lay flowers in memory of jan palach who set himself alight there on 
jan 16 1969 and died three days later 
palach was protesting the august 1968 invasiton that crushed 
prague spring liberal reforms 
on sunday 5000 protesters had rallied throughout prague and an 
official report said 91 were arrested as police crushed the 
demonstration with clubs dogs and water cannon 
about 500 people attended a roman catholic memorial mass for 
palach in the city of brno on monday and the priest referred 
repeatedly to jan the martyr without mentioning palachs name 
participants said 
witnesses said they saw secret police inside and outside the 
church and riot police in side streets off brnos central freedom 
square where the crowd headed after the mass 
the demonstrations have coincided with a meeting of 35 north 
atlantic treaty organization and warsaw pact countries in vienna to 
mark a comprehensive human rights accord between east and west 
in a speech to the conference secretary of state george p 
shultz today condemned czechoslovakia for suppressing the 
demonstrators in prague 
shultz said the fact that police used clubs tear gas and water 
cannon on peaceful participants directly violated czechoslovakias 
commitment to 1975 helsinki accords the vienna agreement was a 
review of those accords 
the secretary also deplored what he called the timidity of 
east germany romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia in not granting a 
greater freedom of expression and assembly to their people 
witnesses in prague said most of the people on the square monday 
were passersby on their way home from work 
as activists attempted to lay flowers a crowd began to gather 
police then moved in in cars vans and with two water cannons said 
anna sabatova a charter 77 activist they were later joined by 
hundreds of riot police and the water cannon then began dousing the 
crowd 
police also have used force to break up demonstrations by 
thousands in august and october 
the prague daily vecerni praha charged that charter 77 was 
inviting people to wenceslas square and did not respect the wish 
of the majority to preserve peace 
in east germany church sources said monday that authorities 
released most of the 190 people detained after police used clubs and 
water cannon to break up a demonstration by human rights activists 
in leipzig 
about 800 human rights activists gathered at a downtown square in 
the southern city sunday to demand that communist authorities allow 
democracy 
in plovdiv bulgaria at least seven human rights activists were 
arrested jan 11 staterun media said they face prosecution 
probably for antistate activity all were believed members of an 
independent society for the protection of human rights

government soldiers today pushed back 
with clubs and tree branches a crowd that thronged soviet troops as 
they doled out emergency fuel rations in an impoverished section of 
kabul 
less than a month before the scheduled red army withdrawal the 
besieged capital is plagued by severe food and fuel shortages 
one woman was knocked to the ground as the crowd ignoring 
repeated shouts from megaphonetoting soviet soldiers to back away 
surged around the three armored personnel vehicles distributing fuel 
in the khairkhana section 
people banged on empty gasoline cans as the afghan soldiers 
shoved back the crowd one soldier a rifle under his arm kicked 
and punched several teenagers 
soviet troops five aboard each armored car looked uncomfortable 
as they poured gasoline for home heating into cans held up by people 
who waited in 19degree temperatures at the front of the line 
my children are cold ive never seen conditions so bad said 
one woman who gave her name as aziza a 35yearold with nine 
children 
another woman wailed as she held out her hands to a reporter and 
speaking through an interpreter pleaded for help saying she and 
her children were hungry 
asked if she thought the reporter was a soviet she said all i 
know is you are foreigners perhaps you can help us 
the soviet unit used the megaphones to spread word of the 
emergency distribution as the armored vehicles with 75mm cannons 
pointing skyward rolled into khairkhana in other parts of the 
city lines of several hundred cars and buses snaked around entire 
blocks waiting for fuel 
children joined bread lines outside shacks owned by private bread 
sellers who get their dwindling wheat supplies from a staterun 
wheat silo western aid officials expressed growing alarm at the 
shortages 
they are blamed on increasing disruption of sovietescorted 
supply convoys by antimarxist moslem guerrillas attacking the key 
salang highway which runs north from kabul to the soviet border 
first signs of the latest shortages came after more soviet troops 
pulled out early this month western diplomats reported 
the situation appears to have worsened considerably this week 
diplomats say soviet troops are pulling out of the capital ahead 
of the feb 15 deadline set in a unmediated agreement the 
withdrawal comes nearly a decade after moscow intervened to prop up 
a marxist government 
under the agreement 50000 soviet troops left by aug 15 
the guerrillas who have ignored calls for a ceasefire by 
president najib appear to be tightening an economic blockade of the 
capital and are viewed as increasingly effective as afghan soldiers 
take over salang road defenses from departing soviet units 
officials of unicef the un childrens fund today said the 
struggle for scarce food and fuel has cut attendance at its 40 
mother and child welfare clinics in kabul by nearly half 
they say they cant come because they have to stand in bread 
and fuel queues said vincent oreilly of ireland who heads the 
unicef mission 
in the fuel line in khairkhana an old bearded man his hands 
trembling as he clutched his empty gasoline can said allah has 
brought this on us we are blackfaced in the sight of allah 
others blamed the fighting or said the guerrillas were trying to 
cut off the capital some said they now dont want the soviets 
about whom afghans in the street are usually openly hostile to 
leave

president roh taewoo said today he 
intends to meet communist leader kim il sung of north korea in the 
near future to end 40 years of bitter rivalry between the two 
nations 
south korea is preparing a realistic proposal to eventually 
reunite the two koreas by seeing the north not as an enemy but as 
a partner that also seeks to solve this problem roh told a news 
conference 
besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between south 
and north korea i will realize interkorean summit talks in the 
near future and achieve epochmaking progress in resolving the 
korean question he said 
leaders of the two koreas have never met on monday north korea 
agreed to south koreas proposal that planned political and military 
talks be headed by the prime ministers of the two countries the 
highest level contact between the two sides since the korean war 
outlining his administrations plans for the coming year roh 
said the government would continue its efforts to build a strong 
democratic system and ensure economic growth to raise living 
standards 
but he also said violent antigovernment radicals posed a threat 
to political stability and said the government would enforce tough 
controls to end violent protests and strikes 
stern action will be taken to check violent activities intended 
to topple our democratic society he said 
the unusually tough warning was aimed at dissidents and radical 
students that have mounted violent antigovernment protests 
demanding the overthrow of rohs government the radicals who claim 
roh is a front for military rule have little public support and 
their protests while violent often are on a small scale 
roh appealed to south koreans to work to create democratic 
government and political stability he said the change to democracy 
since the end of former president chun doohwans authoritarian 
government had exposed and aggravated many problems that had to be 
solved 
desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at 
once discord and discontent among different social strata have 
been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society 
he said 
the roh government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms 
since antigovernment protests in june 1987 forced the authoritarian 
chun government to agree to elections and an end to widespread 
repression 
roh touched several times on hopes for an end to the tense 
confrontation with north korea the two koreas have been bitter 
rivals since their creation in 1948 after us and soviet troops 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii 
the north invaded the south to start the 195053 korean war and 
the two sides have clashed repeatedly over the years

secretary of state george p shultz today 
insisted that east bloc nations implement human rights accords and 
cease repression 
in a speech to a 35nation human rights conference he said that 
while we are entering a period in which respect for human rights 
is gaining ground there were remaining dark areas in eastern 
europe 
he condemned czechoslovakia for forcibly suppressing 
demonstrators in prague on sunday and detaining scores of them 
shultz departed from his text and added criticism of east germany 
where he noted scores of human rights demonstrators were arrested 
in leipzig on sunday 
as in prague shultz said most of the east germans have not yet 
been freed he said the arrests stood in glaring contradiction to 
the solemn international commitment given by the communist 
governments 
later at a news conference shultz criticized romania for 
declaring it would not be obliged to comply with all provisions of 
the new human rights declaration adopted here sunday 
you have to keep calling these things as you see them shultz 
said he underscored us demands that all of eastern europe follow 
the pace set by moscow 
shultz in his speech to the human rights conference said riot 
police using rubber truncheons tear gas and water cannon on 
peaceful participants directly violated the czech governments 
commitment to the 1975 helsinki accords 
and he deplored what he called the timidity of the 
governments of east germany romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia in 
not granting greater freedom of expression and assembly to their 
people 
he said their reluctance contrasted with welcome progress in 
the soviet union and two of its eastern allies hungary and poland 
but even in the soviet union shultz said the release of more 
than 600 political prisoners left others unjustly imprisoned he 
pledged we cannot forget them 
shultz who leaves office with the reagan administration on 
friday spoke at ceremonies near the end of a 27month review of 
compliance with the 1975 helsinki final act which sought to ease 
eastwest tensions while promoting a freer exchange of people and 
ideas between east and west 
he said the helsinki promise has served as a positive force for 
change but that europe still lives with a legacy of the cold 
war 
in romania he said the political and civil rights of all 
citizens are being eroded at a discouraging rate adding that in 
both romania and bulgaria minorities have been particularly hard 
hit by recent government policies 
on the other hand shultz said more than 7 million east germans 
visited the west last year and about 77000 people emigrated from 
the soviet union 
we still look for full recognition of the right to freedom of 
movement throughout the eastern signatory states he said 
the helksinki accord was signed by the united states the soviet 
union canada and 32 european countries it tacitly accepted the 
postworld war ii boundaries in europe which the soviet union had 
long sought while providing the western democracies with a lever to 
promote more openness in the east 
before flying home shultz met briefly with hansdietrich 
genscher the west german foreign minister 
the united states has been working to dissuade western firms from 
providing technology to help libya develop chemical weapons on 
monday a west german official said a west german company may have 
unknowingly aided in the construction of a suspected chemical 
weapons plant in libya 
shultz said he talked about other things with genscher but 
in response to questions from reporters shultz said 
i believe having reviewed the evidence there is no question 
whatever that moammar gadhafi is trying to equip himself with a 
major chemical weapons production facility 
he hasnt quite got there yet they need aid from the outside 
in order to get there he said 
we are trying to do everything we can to throw every 
conceivable monkey wrench that we can find into his machinery and 
in doing so we are active in your behalf in my behalf i dont 
want poison gas dumped on me do you and i dont want gadhafi to 
have it or have an ability to give it to some terrorists

libyan leader col moammar gadhafi says that all 
state institutions including the security apparatus and the 
nations news agency will be abolished this year 
in a speech monday night that was broadcast by libyan television 
and monitored in london gadhafi said it was the people who should 
rule 
all the institutions which are traditionally considered as 
state institutions are to be abolished he said in a speech to a 
basic peoples congress or grassroots political committee in the 
community of aljabal alakhdar 
these companies these institutions and all these bodies seem 
to be literally imposed on you they are going to be abolished 
from this year gadhafi said 
he said that although peoples congresses created the 
institutions people still considered them as outside their power 
and belonging to a government 
the struggle for power must end he said in a rare 
acknowledgement of internal dissent the demonstrations the 
sitins and the protests are all protests against authority a 
struggle for power 
gadhafi said the action would be the cornerstone for a new time 
known as the era of the masses 
the libyan leader said that he also will abolish organized 
sports car importing companies and agricultural produce marketing 
companies so farmers would be free to market their own produce 
the government will help find work for those left jobless by the 
moves gadhafi said 
he said the nations security apparatus must be eliminated 
because complaints are mounting against it and its violations are 
on the increase gadhafi also said the agency duplicates 
operations of the nations bureau of investigation 
he described the news agency jana as a huge octopus with 
hundreds of officials that is useless 
the jamahiriyah news agency is one of those establishments 
which is tiring me the news item broadcast by the world today 
our agency reports it to us the day after tomorrow gadhafi said 
gadhafi who took power in a 1969 coup has always described his 
goal as the creation of a political system in which people run the 
country without parties or government bodies 
in recent months he has made moderating moves in internal 
politics 
in august gadhafi announced the abolition of the classical 
army and the traditional police saying the country would rely 
instead on armed civilians for security 
last march riding a bulldozer he knocked down the wall of 
tripolis prison and freed some political prisoners he also said 
libyans were free to travel abroad and gave his blessing to the 
flourishing black market

immediately established there was no claim of responsibility 
but commission officials said the attack was staged by 
organized enemies of the commission they did not identify the 
enemies 
commissioner david castro said ronan was killed because he 
enforced orders to sequester companies that marcos or his front 
men are believed to have acquired illegally during marcos 20year

some power groups may be trying to send us a message said 
robert federis the commissions investigations director 
federis said about four hours after ronan was killed a man

a california redistricting plan that placed 
democrats in control of the states congressional delegation does 
not unlawfully discriminate against republicans the supreme court 
ruled today 
by a 63 vote the justices upheld the redistricting plan 
republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of 
gerrymandering 
the court dismissed the gop appeal last oct 3 but then on nov 
14 the justices announced that they might consider the case after 
all 
the reasons for the courts second thoughts in november were not 
explained 
today chief justice william h rehnquist and justices john paul 
stevens and anthony m kennedy voted to grant full review to the 
california dispute four votes are needed to grant such review 
six justices joined in upholding the redistricting plan in a 
onesentence decision the judgment is affirmed they said 
the court said in 1986 in an indiana legislative reapportionment 
case that gerrymandering the manipulation of voting district 
boundaries for partisan gain may be unlawful even when it results 
in districts meeting the oneperson onevote requirement 
but in splintered voting the justices upheld the indiana plan 
that was attacked as a violation of democrats rights 
the 1986 decision left key questions unanswered and only four 
justices joined in the courts main opinion authored by justice 
byron r white 
white said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it will 
consistently degrade a voters or a group of voters influence on 
the political processes as a whole 
california republicans said that is exactly what has happened to 
them 
the essence of representative democracy is undermined when 
a computergenerated gerrymander can preordain what the 
congressional results will be throughout the decade they said in 
seeking supreme court reconsideration 
a threejudge federal court by a 21 vote last april upheld 
californias plan 
the federal court said republicans failed to show that the plan 
deprived them of political power and fair representation 
there are no allegations that california republicans have been 
shut out of the political process nor are there allegations that 
anyone has ever interfered with republican registration organizing 
voting fundraising or campaigning said judge cecil f poole for 
the federal court 
poole noting that california has a republican governor a 
republican us senator and 18 gop house members said there is no 
evidence the party is bereft of the ability to exercise potent 
power in the political process as a whole 
republicans said the democraticcontrolled state legislature 
rigged district lines to allow democrats to win 27 of the 45 house 
seats from california even though republican candidates overall 
received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections 
they said the democrats manipulated the outcome of elections by 
ignoring county and municipal boundaries and bunching republican 
voters in some districts to produce lopsided gop victories 
democratic voters were divided strategically to help the party 
win close races the republicans contend 
gop leaders also have appealed to the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals based in san francisco 
the supreme court has ruled in the past that election districts 
must be equally populated in accord with the oneperson 
onevote principle the justices have held that only if there is 
evidence of racial bias may a district plan be overturned even when 
the balanced population test is met 
the case acted on today is badham vs eu 871818

a previously unknown terrorist group 
today demanded a 790000 ransom for the release of paul vanden 
boeynants the former belgian prime minister it claims to have 
kidnapped 
in a onepage typewritten letter the revolutionary socialist 
brigade demanded that twothirds of the ransom come from vanden 
boeynants political and business partners and be given to the poor 
according to deputy brussels prosecutor andre vandoren 
the rest of the ransom would be for the groups participation 
in the effort to mobilize the people 
initially it was incorrectly reported that the kidnappers were 
demanding a ransom of between 525000 twothirds of the total sum 
and 790000 
the letter delivered to brussels dailies le soir and het laatste 
nieuws called vanden boeynants a corrupt person who has 
stolen large public funds for his own profit and called for a 
peoples tribunal to try him 
vanden boeynants 69 a businessman and christian democrat 
politician who disappeared saturday is under investigation for 
taking bribes when he was defense minister for seven years in the 
1970s 
a special legislative commission was to open a hearing today to 
consider initiating legal action against him 
the letter reinforced the belief the kidnapping is politically 
motivated it did not threaten the life of the politician unlike 
two anonymous phone calls earlier today to police in belgium and to 
le soir 
we have vdb said the caller using the politicians 
nickname who we are you will never know you will never see him 
again we will return him in small pieces vandoren related the 
threat to reporters 
a third call received by a radio station in hilversum the 
netherlands came from an anonymous caller purporting to represent 
the french terrorist group direct action he said the group is 
holding vanden boeynants 
prime minister wilfried martens has said vanden boeynants had 
received threats lately and asked to meet the interior minister 
monday presumably to discuss his personal safety 
officials have expressed concern about the health of the 
politician who needs daily medication for a heart condition 
vanden boeynants was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and 
again from late 1978 until early 1979 
he received a threeyear suspended sentence for tax fraud as head 
of his meat packaging business in 1986 that conviction forced him 
to drop a bid to become mayor of brussels in october

the supreme court today allowed antismoking 
groups to see and publicize a cigarette companys research that the 
groups say may link smoking to health hazards 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in a case from 
boston that allows public access to material compiled for liggett 
group inc 
the case stems from a lawsuit by the widow and daughter of joseph 
c palmer the suit alleged that palmers death from lung cancer in 
1980 was caused by cigarette smoking and accused liggett of failing 
to warn adequately of the consequences of smoking 
a federal judge in boston ruled against the palmer family 
but in 1987 antismoking groups asked the judge to release 
research conducted for liggett that the groups said may show 
cigarette smoking causes disease 
the groups are public citizen the american cancer society the 
american heart association the american lung association and the 
american public health association 
the judge who kept the material secret while the suit was 
pending permitted the groups access to the documents after he 
dismissed the case his ruling on disclosure of the documents was 
upheld last september by the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said that under federal court rules the 
public has a presumptive right of access to such materials unless 
good cause for confidentiality is shown and no good cause 
exists here for secrecy 
cigarette manufacturers have been successful generally in winning 
lawsuits accusing them of contributing to lung cancer and other 
diseases 
but in june 1988 a federal jury in new jersey ruled against 
liggett and awarded a smokers widower 400000 the first time 
damages were ordered for a disease said to be caused by smoking 
that suit was brought by antonio cipollone whose wife rose 
died of lung cancer in 1984

the supreme court today rejected a challenge to 
a state law exempting religiously affiliated childcare centers from 
some health and safety standards all other childcare centers must 
meet 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that the virginia law does not violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion 
the disputed 1979 state licensing law allows childcare centers 
run by churches or other religious organizations to seek an exempt 
status avoiding many of the health and safety standards applied to 
such facilities 
exempt centers still must meet basic health and safety standards 
however 
childcare centers with no religious affiliation must obtain a 
state license and are not entitled to seek the exemption 
among the 215 centers that could obtain exempt status under the 
virginia law 106 have opted instead to operate with state licenses 
the law was challenged in 1980 by three licensed childcare 
centers that have no religious ties forest hills early learning 
center in lynchburg academy day care in woodbridge and holloman 
child care centers in hampton and grafton 
a federal judge struck down the exemption as unconstitutional but 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling last may 
6 
absent the exemption some church leaders would immediately be 
forced to violate their convictions against submitting aspects of 
their ministries to state licensing or face legal action the 
appeals court said 
its ruling relied heavily on a 1987 supreme court decision in 
which the justices said religious organizations may practice 
employment discrimination by favoring members of their faith even 
for nonreligious jobs 
in that case the court unanimously upheld the firing in utah of 
a gymnasium custodian who failed to qualify for membership in the 
mormon church which owned and ran the gym 
the court in that 1987 ruling said a 1972 federal law exempting 
religious groups from a federal antibias law does not violate 
separation of church and state 
after the nonreligious centers in virginia appealed the 4th 
circuit courts decision state officials filed a counterappeal 
contending that the appeals court was wrong in ruling that the 
centers had the proper standing to challenge the 1979 law 
today the supreme court denied review to both appeals 
the cases are forest hills early learning center vs jackson 
88730 and jackson vs forest hills early learning center 88932

the supreme court today set aside a ruling that 
limited the access enjoyed by labor unions that represent federal 
government employees to the home addresses of all their members 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling 
that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to 
have their addresses withheld from their union 
the federal labor relations authority decided in two cases that 
denying the unions access to the information is an unfair labor 
practice but the 8th us circuit court of appeals limited the 
authoritys decision in a ruling last january 
the appeals court said that although unions generally are 
entitled to the addresses the information may not be disclosed 
without the employees consent 
in a brief order today the justices set aside the 8th circuit 
courts ruling and ordered the appeals court to restudy the two 
cases in light of regulations published by the two federal agencies 
involved 
in one case the american federation of government employees 
sought the names and home addresses of some 900 union members who 
work for the farmers home administration finance office in st 
louis in the second case the national federation of federal 
employees asked for names and addresses of members who work for the 
defense departments mapping agency aerospace center in st louis 
the unions said they needed the home addresses to communicate 
with members in the privacy of their homes about pending collective 
bargaining negotiations the unions also said the information could 
help them in recruiting new members 
the federal labor relations authority said disclosing the 
information does not violate workers privacy rights 
but the 8th circuit court said we doubt that the public 
interest would be served in any way by imposing disclosure of the 
names and addresses on employees who regard that information as 
private and who do not choose to receive union communications at 
home 
the fela asked the justices to overturn the appeals courts 
ruling 
in another development justice department lawyers told the high 
court that the reagan administration is seeking to resolve the 
problem by taking steps to provide the unions in both cases with the 
information they seek 
the justice department lawyers said they believe government 
agencies should be allowed to withhold the names and addresses but 
that providing the information is a better solution in these cases 
they said requiring agencies to get the consent of employees 
before giving such information to the unions violates federal law 
the consent requirment could mean that the government will be 
threatened with lawsuits anytime it gives out even innocuous 
information about federal employees the justice department lawyers 
said 
they said the justices should order the 8th circuit court to 
reconsider its decision in light of the steps being taken to provide 
the unions with the names and addresses they seek 
the case is federal labor relations authority vs us department 
of agriculture 88349

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
200 million lawsuit that accused a federal environmental official 
of failing to take swift action against industrial lead pollution in 
dallas 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out the 
suit against the government 
the suit was filed by 189 families in dallas who live near three 
lead smelters operated by rsr corp dixie metals corp and nl 
industries 
they sought damages under the federal tort claims act which 
allows citizens to sue the government in some circumstances 
the dallas families said members have suffered brain damage 
developmental defects and lifelong debilitating effects from 
lead pollution 
their suit said john hernandez deputy administrator of the 
environmental protection agency was negligent because he ordered 
further study of the problem rather than an immediate cleanup after 
a congressional hearing in 1983 found high levels of lead in soil 
and in schoolchildrens blood samples 
the us circuit court of appeals here last july upheld a federal 
judges ruling that dismissed the case 
the appeals court said hernandezs decision to order further 
study was a discretionary policymaking action immune from suit 
under the tort claims act 
the plaintiffs said hernandezs decision was based only upon 
scientific considerations that did not involve the exercise of such 
discretion 
but the appeals court said hernandez based his decision on 
economic social and political policy considerations making his 
choice immune from suit 
for example hernandez said he was concerned that a cleanup 
would set a precedent for other areas of the nation he also said 
that failure to order further study would expose him to criticism he 
acted too hastily 
one of the smelters made a pollution cleanup offer but 
hernandez said he was reluctant to accept the offer without 
additional study because the cleanup might be inadequate 
the case is wells vs us 88653

former pennsylvania republican chairman robert 
b asher failed today in a supreme court attempt to overturn his 
conviction for mail fraud and other briberyrelated charges 
the court without comment let stand ashers conviction prison 
sentence of a year and a day and 205000 fine 
the case received national attention when ashers codefendant 
former pennsylvania treasurer r budd dwyer 47 fatally shot 
himself at a news conference jan 22 1987 the day before he was to 
be sentenced 
dwyer said he was innocent accused the federal prosecutor of 
framing him and then stuck the barrel of a handgun in his mouth and 
pulled the trigger 
asher a montgomery county candymaker and dwyer were convicted 
in federal court in december 1986 of mail fraud perjury conspiracy 
to commit bribery and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering 
they were charged with arranging the award of a state contract to 
computer technology associates cta a california company that 
helps employers recover excess social security taxes paid to the 
federal government 
prosecutors said asher dwyer and two company officials william 
t smith jr and john r torquato jr took part in the bribery 
scheme 
torquato who cooperated with the prosecution testified that he 
agreed to pay 300000 to be divided equally between dwyer dwyers 
reelection campaign and the republican state committee in return 
for a 5 million state contract for his company 
cta was awarded the contract in 1984 with the state rejecting a 
lower bid from arthur young inc a nationally known accounting firm 
smith who pleaded guilty was sentenced to 12 years in prison 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld ashers conviction 
last july rejecting his claim that he was tried improperly under a 
federal mail fraud law 
the supreme court in 1987 ruled that the antifraud law could not 
be used to charge officials with depriving the public of its 
intangible right to honest government the court said there must be 
a charge that the state lost something of material value 
the 3rd circuit court said the indictment against asher and the 
others did allege a material loss since the state could have saved 
the taxpayers money by awarding the contract to arthur young inc 
the appeals court said even though the indictment against asher 
spoke of intangible rights the conviction must stand because there 
also was a material loss 
justice department lawyers urging the supreme court to reject 
ashers appeal noted that congress in 1988 amended federal 
antifraud law to permit indictments based solely on a deprivation 
of intangible rights the amendments in effect reversed the 1987 
high court ruling for future government corruption cases 
the 3rd circuit court also rejected ashers argument that he was 
charged mistakenly as a public official rather than as a 
republican party official 
the case is asher vs us 88532

the child was placed with a couple in hicksville ms dunn said she 
was reassured by sister gilson that she could regain custody of the 
child within 30 days if she changed her mind about giving her up for 
adoption 
but ms dunn did not regain custody of the child until march 
1987 after a bitter court fight 
a manhattan appeals court ordered the baby kara returned to ms 
dunn after finding that the woman had signed surrender papers 
under duress and perhaps even fraud in a busy diner on may 1 
1986 
the court said that agency officials did nothing when the couple 
refused to return the child after ms dunn said on may 20 that she 
wanted her baby back

prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski today 
urged the communist party to legalize the solidarity trade 
federation for a twoyear trial period 
he said the government ban on solidarity should be lifted only on 
condition that it be a partner not an opponent that would 
pull the country into anarchy 
rakowski also suggested solidarity which was outlawed in 1982 
should give up the financial assistance it receives from the west 
the prime minister said that during the trial period both the 
government and solidarity would gather positive and negative 
experiences according to a tv account of his speech to the 
central committee meeting 
the trial period would last until may 3 1991 he said that date 
is the 200th anniversary of the adoption of a shortlived but still 
admired progressive constitution in poland that was overthrown by 
imperial russia 
earlier today zygmunt czarzasty newly appointed party 
secretary told the 230member central committee he endorsed the 
stand of the ruling politburo on union pluralism his comments 
suggested the politburo already has sanctioned allowing more than 
one legal trade union 
permitting more than one union is a social necessity and not a 
gesture of the government or the party in the interests of social 
peace social agreement has to be reached czarzasty said 
he stressed those which receive permission to function should 
show responsibility and above all endorse the principles of the 
law 
the discussion is crucial as communist leaders struggle to 
decide whether to risk repeating the experiment of 1980 that allowed 
creation of solidarity as the east blocs first independent union 
after 16 months of exhilarating freedom solidarity was 
suppressed in a 1981 military crackdown since then the polish 
economy has stagnated and reforms have been hamstrung by many 
workers and independent groups refusal to participate as long as 
solidarity is illegal 
at the second session of the twoday central committee meeting 
the manager of southern polands katowice steel mill warned that 
competing trade unions might bring anarchy and divided work 
crews bogdan kolomyjski urged talks with the opposition to make 
clear proper conditions for gradually introducing pluralism 
a government source had told the associated press last week that 
the meeting will end with a decision to offer solidarity 
legalization under certain conditions thus paving the way for talks 
with its chairman lech walesa 
marian orzechowski the partys chief ideologist told the 
meeting monday that the question of allowing union pluralism was 
ripe to be solved and said a draft statement on the topic had 
been prepared for a decision by the central committee 
it seems they will register solidarity said zbigniew bujak 
a solidarity activist if so he said formal talks between the 
authorities and the opposition could begin soon 
but jan turzynski a party leader from southwest poland said 
groups which receive western aid a definition that would include 
solidarity should be barred from public dialogue 
alfred miodowicz chief of polands official union federation 
opzz told the meeting monday that no decision on trade unions 
should be taken before a party conference on ideology next month 
the state news service pap reported 
miodowicz official alliance factorybased party organizations 
and elements of the army and police remain among solidaritys 
strongest opponents according to party sources 
polish leader wojciech jaruzelski said in an opening speech 
monday today we will draw directions of democracy which will 
include some pluralistic solutions 
rakowski asked the central committee when it met last month to 
evaluate the opinions of local party members toward solidarity and 
return with their assessment in midjanuary 
walesa has warned the publics patience is wearing thin after 
years of rising prices and consumer shortages threatening a social 
explosion even he might be unable to control the countrys foreign 
debt stands at 39 billion and many of its major industrial plants 
are outmoded 
unrest over communist authorities handling of the economy has 
toppled governments three times in postwar poland in 1956 1970 and 
1980

here are excerpts from the report on former 
attorney general edwin meese iii by the justice departments office 
of professional responsibility 
 
conclusion 
we trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by mr 
meese that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether 
an independent counsel seeks an officials indictment we found that 
the independent counsels report far from vindicates mr meese 
rather it details conduct which should not be tolerated of any 
government employee especially not the attorney general of the 
united states were he still serving as attorney general we would 
recommend to the acting attorney general that the president take 
disciplinary action 
 
on his relationship with longtime friend e robert wallach 
we must conclude that mr meese in certain instances involving 
mr wallach either did not understand or did not appreciate or 
simply did not care what impression could be left with the public 
about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he 
oversaw 
 
on dealing with wallach on subjects as varied as wedtech corp 
and the iraqi oil pipeline 
the subjects varied but a strong undercurent flows through a 
not insubstantial number of those communications and that 
undercurrent was mr wallachs seeking action in matters in which he 
had a financial interest from mr meese or his staff mr meese 
continued to accept these communications gave no indication 
whatsoever that he was not receptive to them and took them into 
account in various official actions 
we have discovered no evidence that any other friend of mr 
meese had a relationship remotely similar to that enjoyed by mr 
wallach 
 
regarding the 1 billion proposed iraqi oil pipeline in which 
wallach was representing swiss oilman bruce rappaport and dealings 
with thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane 
in the pipeline matter mr meese knew that his close friend 
had a financial interest in the project nevertheless he called mr 
mcfarlane which resulted in a meeting between mcfarlane wallach 
and rappaport 
in addition that call intentionally circumvented the 
department of state and thereby initiated a sequence of events 
involving important foreign policy considerations without the 
participation of the principal foreign policy arm of the government 
his call facilitated a private venture with enormous profit 
potential to private individuals including mr meeses friend and 
creditor mr wallach

soldiers today dynamited the homes of three 
palestinians suspected of injuring three israelis with stones 
marking a new gettough policy against rock throwers in the occupied 
territories 
in the occupied west bank a 17yearold palestinian was fatally 
shot in the stomach during a clash with troops and a second 
teenager died of a gunshot wound to the heart suffered in a clash 
jan 7 hospital officials and arab reports said 
the army confirmed one death and said it was checking the second 
report 
sixteen palestinians were shot and wounded today in 
confrontations in the west bank occupied gaza strip and arab east 
jerusalem the reports said 
also today some reserve soldiers complained to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir of their role in the violence saying they were 
forced to beat innocent people and betray israeli values in trying 
to put down the 13month palestinian uprising 
the criticism came as shamir visited an army tent camp outside 
nablus the west banks largest city 
the soldiers said they routinely beat innocent people to instill 
fear in them and enforce order many said they were ashamed 
when i get up in the morning i say to myself now i have to 
go out and catch a man and i look at his hands and see he is a 
working man like myself and i have to slap him or beat him 
murderous blows to get him to fear me said a soldier who 
identified himself as yotam from tiberias 
todays housing demolitions drew immediate protests from 
leftwing israeli groups five opposition parties filed a motion of 
noconfidence in the government to be debated by parliament on 
wednesday israel radio reported 
gen amram mitzna head of the central command said the 
demolitions in the west bank town of kalkilya were intended to stem 
an upsurge in violence the army said two other houses in the town 
were sealed up 
after the demolitions soldiers dropped leaflets on the town from 
a helicopter the leaflets said troops would destroy the homes of 
anyone caught stoning israeli targets arab news reports said 
the army said more palestinians were wounded in the past month 
than in any other during the uprising as soldiers responded to 
increased attacks and rioting it said 26 palestinians were killed 
and 492 wounded in the month ending jan 9 
at least 361 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the revolt 
against israels 21year rule of the west bank and gaza 
the latest victim was ibrahim abu syam of faraa refugee camp near 
nablus he was shot during a confrontation with troops arab reports 
said 
an army spokesman confirmed there was a clash in faraa but said 
he had no reports of casualties 
todays other victim was issa taka manasra 19 of bani naim near 
the west bank city of hebron who died at a hospital in jerusalem a 
hospital official said the army confirmed the death 
mitzna said troops will be allowed to fire rubber and plastic 
bullets more liberally to quell riots despite controversy over the 
ammunition following the recent deaths of four arab youths hit by 
rubber bullets 
since stonethrowings have become a major nuisance we will use 
all the means at our disposal and everywhere strict punishments 
and deterrents so that the rebels who consider these attacks to 
be legitimate will understand that we will not tolerate them 
mitzna said on army radio 
lately we have widened our measures including among other 
things the use of plastic and rubber bullets said mitzna adding 
that they have been effective in confronting violence 
col renaan gissin deputy army spokesman said house demolitions 
would apply only to severe cases of rockthrowing that cause serious 
injury or damage 
we are trying to signal that those throwing rocks and causing 
harm will pay a higher price he said 
the new crackdown will also involve heavier fines more than 
1000 on the parents of stonethrowers under age 14 gissin said 
an army spokesman said the homes destroyed today belonged to a 
group of palestinians suspected in several recent stoning attacks 
including an assault on a vehicle dec 17 that injured three people 
army radio said 15 people in the group were arrested and the 
army said the suspects belonged to yasser arafats fatah movement 
the assaults were the first the army has blamed on palestinians 
linked to arafat since the plo chief renounced terrorism last month 
a move that led washington to break its ban on official contacts 
with the palestine liberation organization 
since the palestinian uprising began israel has routinely 
destroyed the homes of suspects in serious assaults todays 
demolitions raised to 152 the number of homes wrecked during the 
uprising according to army figures

the supreme court in a case of particular 
interest to lawyers and civil rights activists today agreed to 
review a 181000 attorneys fee award stemming from a 1970 airline 
sex bias lawsuit 
the justices said they will decide whether people who intervene 
in civil rights cases and are not the principal defendants may 
be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who 
successfully sue 
the case stems from a 1970 suit that challenged the policy of 
trans world airlines to fire female flight attendants when they 
became mothers 
the policy was attacked as illegal sex discrimination barred by 
title vii of the federal civil rights act of 1964 
a nineyear legal battle was resolved in 1979 when twa agreed to 
reinstate fired women with seniority from the date of their 
dismissal the airline which had abandoned its nomotherhood 
policy soon after the suit was filed also created a 3 million fund 
for the fired attendants 
the settlement was challenged by the independent federation of 
flight attendants on behalf of twa flight attendants who could 
suffer from the lawsuits settlement by being laid off in favor of 
those with the newly won seniority 
the union acted as an intervenor in the suit interjecting itself 
as a concerned third party rather than as either defendant or 
plaintiff 
the unions challenge to the settlement proved unsuccessful and 
last may the 7th us circuit court of appeals ordered the union to 
reimburse the women who won the suit 180915 in legal fees 
the appeals court noted that the union argued that because it 
intervened solely to assert the rights of its nondiscriminating 
incumbent members it should be viewed in practical terms as a 
plaintiff and hence assessed attorneys fees only if it its 
opposition to the settlement was found to have been groundless 
but the appeals court said the unions reasoning could 
substantially undermine a federal law aimed at giving citizens an 
incentive to challenge unlawful discrimination by assuring their 
legal costs will be reimbursed if they win 
we are not inclined to look favorably upon such a potentially 
injurious exception to this longstanding legislative scheme the 
appeals court said 
the fact that the women who sued were awarded more than 125 
million in legal fees from twa does not let the union off the hook 
the appeals court added 
in appealing to the supreme court the union said the 7th circuit 
court ruling conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals 
courts 
the union also said that it only was fulfilling its 
responsibility to its members when it challenged the settlement to 
the suit 
hundreds of twa flight attendants were laid off beginning in 
october 1979 when a recession hit the airline industry the union 
said it said some would have been able to keep their jobs were it 
not for the settlement that awarded seniority to the fired women who 
sued twa 
the high courts ruling in the case expected by july will 
affect numerous suits in which violations of civil and 
constitutional rights are alleged 
the case is independent federation of flight attendants vs 
zipes 88608

irans prime minister today said presidentelect 
george bush is working more to justify us policy in lebanon than 
to free american hostages there 
bush recently indicated iran could help free nine us hostages 
held by shiite moslems believed loyal to iran 
but prime minister hussein musavi of iran gave little 
encouragement 
he said the hostage issue was an internal question of 
lebanon and his country is limited because it is a question of 
territory 
musavi was asked at a news conference what tehran can do to help 
the hostages in view of the impending change of us administration 
as for bush musavi said he believed he is more than trying to 
work for the release trying to justify his policy in lebanon 
the iranian hinted the united states should rethink its policy 
toward lebanon but did not say what changes should be made 
musavi also maintained its not clear who these groups are who 
take hostages in lebanon 
he arrived in italy on monday for talks to improve economic 
relations the twoday visit was his first to a western country 
since iran and iraq agreed aug 20 to a ceasefire in their 8year 
war 
in a recent interview bush said the ceasefire has potential 
for amelioration of that hostage situation but i think it would be 
improper to assume that iran controls a key to all these hostages 
still bush said its in our interests to have better relations 
with iran 
in rome musavi also criticized an international declaration 
issued in paris last week on chemical weapons saying people can 
still easily construct chemical arms the declaration is not 
binding on the 149 nations that said they are against the use and 
spread of chemical arms 
musavi reiterated irans charges that iraq used chemical weapons 
during their war an allegation iraq denies 
musavi left for an audience with pope john paul ii that was the 
roman catholic church leaders first with an official of the islamic 
republic 
the pope urged that iran and iraq exchange their 100000 
prisoners of war as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of 
these men and to give back to so many families the joy of being 
together again according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
as the private audience went on in the popes library police 
dispersed about 30 supporters and opponents of the iranian 
government who shoved each other and yelled insults in st peters 
square 
after 20 minutes of private talks the pope publicly met musavis 
entourage and spoke briefly to hojatoleslam sadeq khalkhali 
chairman of the iranian parliaments foreign affairs committee 
our revolution is a religious revolution and we ask you to pray 
for peace in the world khalkhali said 
thats what were doing the pope responded 
the iranian continued we know the world needs religious spirit 
and until there is religious spirit there will not be morality 
the pope then offered his blessing to all iranians including 
those fallen in war

the supreme court today refused to set aside 
serial killer theodore bundys conviction and death sentence for 
murdering a 12yearold girl in florida 11 years ago 
the justices by a 72 vote let stand rulings that bundy was 
mentally competent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying in 
lake city fla of kimberly leach 
reacting swiftly state officials said florida gov bob martinez 
would sign a death warrant for bundy today scheduling his execution 
for 7 am on jan 24 
bundy 42 also received death sentences for the 1978 killings of 
two florida state university sorority sisters who were beaten and 
strangled just hree weeks before the leach murder 
he has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearances 
of young women most of them in utah colorado and washington state 
a federal court hearing in fort lauderdale is scheduled for next 
monday to determine whether bundy was mentally competent when he 
stood trial for the sorority house killings 
but florida officials are under no legal obligation to postpone 
executing bundy pending any conclusion to that proceeding 
bundy whose case won national attention even before it was 
depicted in a television miniseries the deliberate stranger 
previously has come within hours of being executed only to win 
postponement 
todays action marks the fourth time the supreme court has 
considered a formal appeal filed in bundys behalf one rejected by 
the justices in 1986 was a 34page document filed by bundy a utah 
law school dropout in his own handwritting 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for bundy argued that lower 
courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had been 
competent to stand trial in 1980 
referring to numerous incidents in which bundy exhibited bizarre 
behavior during his trial for the leach murder the appeal said 
bundy was mentally incompetent at the time 
this court has never addressed the issue of when if ever a 
posttrial hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a 
defendants right to a contemporary determination of his 
competency when sufficient indicia arise at trial the appeal said 
the supreme court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a 
contemporary competency hearing 
after the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1987 that 
bundy was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he had been 
mentally competent in 1980 a federal judge ruled that bundy had 
been 
the judge called bundy the most competent serial killer in the 
country at this time a diabolical genius 
the 11th circuit court then upheld the competency ruling 
sparking the appeal acted on today 
in other action today the supreme court 
allowed antismoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette 
companys research that the groups say could link smoking to health 
hazards 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in a case from 
boston that allows public access to material compiled for liggett 
group inc 
agreed to review a 181000 attorneys fee award stemming from 
a 1970 airline sex bias lawsuit 
the justices said they will decide whether people who intervene 
in civil rights cases and are not the principal defendants may 
be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who 
successfully sue 
ruled that a california redistricting plan that placed 
democratsin control of the states congressional delegation does not 
unlawfully discriminate against republicans 
by a 63 vote the justices upheld the redistricting plan 
republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of 
gerrymandering 
rejected a challenge to a state law exampting religiously 
affiliated childcare centers from some health and safety standards 
all other childcare centers must meet 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that the virginia law does not violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion 
set aside a ruling that limited the access enjoyed by labor 
unions that represent federal government employees to the home 
addresses of all their members 
the justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling 
that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to 
have their addresses withheld from their unions 
the appeal in the bundy case also argued that his conviction for 
the lake city murder was tainted by the uncorroborated 
hypnotically developed testimony of an alleged eyewitness to the 
young girls abduction and by ineffective legal help at trial 
it is left to this court the appeal said to apply the 
constitution to protect this unpopular petitioner to the same degree 
it protects all other criminal defendants

an early morning mudslide that looked

forced authorities to evacuate 10 other homes officials said 
ive got chesthigh mud in what used to be my back yard said 
robey kaufman whose 100000 home was destroyed 
the hill into which the house was built began shifting late 
monday night for reasons still unclear tuesday but water from a 
broken main behind the house might have loosened the mud said 
kanawha county public safety director mark wolford 
it was like a wall of mud wolford said the fire chief out 
there said it looked like lava 
mud from the hill piled up against the back of the house and the 
pressure collapsed the basement slowly pushing the house off its 
foundation and into the front yard wolford said 
the kaufmans apparently heard the house making some unusual 
popping and cracking noises they finally decided they should get 
out of there he said 
by the time authorities were called 1230 am the house was 
off its foundation gas water and electical lines had been severed 
wolford said

secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii 
called today for a renewal of bipartisanship in foreign policy and a 
joint effort with congress to ensure that a more responsible 
constructive policy emerges from the changes reshaping the soviet 
system 
yes this is an appeal for a kinder gentler congress baker 
said at a hearing by the senate foreign relations committee on his 
nomination to take over the state department after presidentelect 
bush takes office baker was the first of bushs cabinet choices to 
start then confirmation process 
baker also said the united states cannot abandon the contra 
rebels opposing nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
we must stand by them until our mutual goals are achieved 
baker said adding that the united states must insist on protection 
for human rights not only in nicaragua but in el salvador and other 
central american nations as well 
he said the premier task of us policy must be make certain that 
the soviets move toward positive changes 
our task is to arrange affairs so that whatever the outcome of 
perestroika a more responsible constructive soviet policy will 
remain in moscows interest baker said 
sketching a broad outline of the foreign policy goals of the 
incoming administration baker said experience has shown that a 
bipartisan foreign policy is an indispensable ingredient of success 
as the nation faces the problems and turmoil of an increasingly 
complex world 
bipartisanship does not mean that we must always agree baker 
said there are and always will be differences in approach and 
substance 
but eventually we must proceed he said and when we do it 
is best that we do so together if we are to achieve the national 
interest 
yes this is an appeal for a kinder gentler congress baker 
said bipartisanship is the lubricant that enables the 
branches of government to overcome their natural constitutionally 
designed friction a friction that arises from our differences of 
perspectives and our different responsibilities 
as a realist i know we need bipartisanship to succeed baker 
said in order to succeed we must work together 
the first order of business between the republican administration 
and the democraticrun congress he suggested is a meeting of our 
minds on how to proceed with a changing soviet union 
baker suggested that if that happens conclusions will include 
the need to modernize us conventional and nuclear weapons to set 
realistic and prudent standards for conventional arms control 
and to reach a common approach on the issue of loans and credits to 
the soviet union 
realism forces us to be prudent baker said however 
fascinating the twists and turns of perestroika economic 
restructuring may be and however riveting the details of decline as 
reported in soviet newspapers the soviet union remains a heavily 
armed superpower 
the talk is different but the force structure and policies that 
support farreaching interests and clients have not changed 
commensurately the nominee said many of those policies and 
those clients are hostile to american values and threaten our 
interests thats a reality 
baker proposed a multistep approach to soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs new policies among them 
continue to welcome reform and changes 
recognize that us policies and strength have contributed to 
moscows new sense of realism 
continue to probe the soviets on arms control human rights 
regional conflicts and overall relations 
place additional emphasis on ending regional conflicts in asia 
africa and central america and not allow the rhetoric of restraint 
to become a substituter for restraint itself 
seek help from the soviets in dealing with such global problems 
as drugs terrorism and the environment and if it is not 
forthcoming find out why 
as the hearings opened many senators were hoping to learn in 
what areas of foreign policy the bush administration will differ 
from the often ideologically rigid positions pursued by the reagan 
administration in the last eight years 
but baker a friend of the presidentelect and pragmatic 
political ally of longstanding may be hindered in his responses by 
his lack of direct foreign policy experience baker reagans former 
chief of staff and secretary of the treasury did obtain experience 
dealing with the worlds financial leaders during his years at the 
treasury in reagans first term 
he drew up the baker plan to deal with latin american debt the 
plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to latin 
america in return for economic restructuring 
some expect bush who served as us liaison officer to china and 
director of the central intelligence agency will seek to set his 
administrations foreign policy direction himself leaving baker to 
manage it 
baker does in fact possess skill as a tactical policy manager 
and a clear ability to deal easily with congress 
while senators will seek to learn exactly what baker will be 
asked to manage some are dubious about obtaining concrete results 
at least this early in the game 
baker will duck every substantive question was the flat 
prediction of one democrtic staff member who helped plan the two 
days of confirmation hearings and who asked not to be identified by 
name 
still the senate is almost certain to confirm baker possibly 
before the end of the month but before it does lawmakers will seek 
bakers public agreement to consult widely with congress as events 
and policies unfold and to link hands in a search for a bipartisan 
foreign policy

latin american nations must negotiate debt 
reduction agreements with commercial bank creditors or face a 
worsening economic situation that could lead to the return of 
military dictatorships in the region a panel of experts said 
tuesday 
the negotiation recommendation was made in a report by the 
interamerican dialogue a grouping of 66 prominent citizens from 
the united states canada latin america and the caribbean 
another key recommendation was for the incoming bush 
administration in washington and leaders of other industrialized 
countries to actively encourage debt reduction agreements and to 
provide appropriate financial guarantees to support such 
initiatives 
six years after the debt crisis began latin america remains 
mired in depression the group said in its 59page report 
unemployment and underemployment are at record levels it 
said wages have declined sharply by as much as 50 percent in 
some places average income per capita has fallen back to the level 
of 1978 and is not recovering 
the report the americas in 1989 consensus for action said 
the alternative for latin america to decisive action is a 
treadmill of austerity stagnation and rising debt 
it said the crisis could condemn latin america to a long period 
of economic hardship and political turbulence 
in some countries civilian authorities may be forced to yield 
to military rule thus reversing a strong trend over the past 
decade toward elected government it said 
the report also recommended that 
the nations of latin america revamp development strategies 
restructure their economies and effectively integrate them in the 
world economy 
the united states address its own economic problems and join 
other industrial countries to reduce international financial 
imbalances open world markets and sustain world growth 
the international financial institutions including the world 
bank sharply step up lending to latin america provided the debtor 
governments adhere to economic reform programs 
the cochairmen of the report panel were sol linowitz a former 
ambassador to the organization of american states and a negotiator 
of the panama canal treaties and former costa rican president 
daniel oduber 
also on the ideologically diverse panel were former presidents 
nicolas ardito barletta of panama and osvaldo hurtado of ecuador and 
numerous former cabinet ministers from the united states and latin 
america 
the report listed the hemispheres major debtors as brazil 
argentina mexico chile venezuela and colombia they account for 
85 percent of the regions debt 
since 1985 us policy on latin americas foreign debt has been 
guided by the socalled baker plan named for former treasury 
secretary and now secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii 
the plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to latin 
america in return for economic restructuring but lending levels 
since 1985 have been far below expectations 
a month ago presidentelect bush indicated he will undertake a 
major review of us policy toward third world debt because of the 
enormous problems facing latin america 
on central america the report called on the united states to end 
its diplomatic boycott of the sandinista government and bilaterally 
negotiate mutual security arrangements saying there can be no 
double standard the report also argued that managua must desist 
from assisting insurgencies in el salvador and elsewhere 
on drug trafficking the report said that action to reduce demand 
for narcotics must be given overriding emphasis in the struggle 
against drugs 
as long as there is a demand for illicit drugs supplies will 
find their way to it the report said

business inventories rose 04 percent in 
november and sales rose at the same pace the government said 
tuesday in a report that analysts said bodes well for the nations 
economy in the new year 
the commerce department said inventories held on shelves and 
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted 7536 billion in november 
while sales reached 5038 billion 
the matching 04 percent gains kept the ratio of inventories to 
sales at 150 meaning it would take 15 months to exhaust 
inventories at the november sales pace 
when not accompanied by increasing sales rising inventories can 
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to 
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods 
but john hagens of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said the 
new report indicates that at least from the inventories point of 
view we think the economy is in pretty good shape for continued 
growth in 1989 
oftentimes before a recession inventories tend to build up 
he said theres no evidence of any kind of excesses in 
inventories in the economy 
the november increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise 
during october and a 09 percent jump in september it was the 23rd 
straight month in which inventories had risen but sales generally 
have kept pace 
it looks like inventories closed out the year on a very lean 
note which should be a positive sign in terms of growth in the 
first half of this year said michael evans a forecaster in 
washington people remained somewhat skeptical about the 
durability of the recovery they kept their inventories rather 
lean 
the monthly increase in sales was down from a 13 percent 
increase in october and virtually unchanged sales activity in 
september 
the november sales gain was led by a 09 percent rise at the 
retail level followed by a 05 percent increase at the 
manufacturing level these two gains offset a 04 percent decline in 
sales at the wholesale level 
the government last week reported that retail sales in december 
rose a lackluster 02 percent 
the increase in inventories was led by a 07 percent rise in 
retailers inventories followed by a 04 percent increase for 
manufacturers and virtually no change in wholesale stockpiles

former ptl leader jim bakker pleaded 
innocent today to federal charges of diverting millions of dollars 
in donations from his followers and using the money to support his 
lavish lifestyle 
i pleaded not guilty to all charges bakker said after the 
arraignment i am definitely not guilty of any charges in this 
indictment 
bakker made no comment during the hearing but defense attorney 
george t davis asked us magistrate paul taylor to impose a gag 
order in the case 
davis read parts of an interview published jan 2 in which 
retired us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds who presided over the 
ptl bankruptcy case called the founder of the religious 
broadcasting empire a sawedoff little runt 
davis also said reynolds described bakker as a thief 
we cant see how we can have a fair trial if were innundated 
with pretrial negative publicity especially from a federal judge 
davis said how can we prevent this this guy is a loose cannon 
hes already gone overboard 
deborah smith a us justice department prosecutor handling the 
case said the government was willing to agree to a gag order 
however she questioned davis motives saying prosecutors were 
concerned that his statements were part of a strategy to get a 
change of venue in the case 
taylor asked the attorneys to consult with each other over the 
next two days and present a draft of a gag order to him by thursday 
taylor scheduled bakkers trial for the february term of court 
but set no specific date 
bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby ptl 
ministry in fort mill sc were indicted dec 5 after a 16month 
federal grand jury investigation into ptls operation under bakkers 
leadership 
bakker 48 and richard dortch 57 his former top deputy each 
were charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud and with 
conspiracy they were accused of conspiring to defraud ptl 
contributors to support their lavish lifestyles and of diverting 
more than 4 million in ptl money for their personal use 
last week dortch waived his right to appear at todays 
arraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts 
harold bender another bakker attorney said he has heard 
speculation that dortch may seek a separate trial 
also indicted last month were brothers david and james taggart 
they entered innocent pleas dec 15 to charges of tax evasion and 
conspiring to impede the irs in tax collection taylor tentatively 
scheduled their trial for the february term 
david taggart bakkers former personal aide and james taggart 
ptls former interior decorator were accused in a separate 
indictment dec 5 of using more than 11 million of ptl funds for 
personal expenditures 
bakker and the three other defendants were released on 50000 
unsecured bond on dec 15 by taylor who also imposed travel 
restrictions 
bakker resigned from the ptl in 1987 after he admitted he had an 
affair with church secretary jessica hahn and paid her money to keep 
quiet three months later ptl filed for protection from its 
creditors under federal bankruptcy law 
last month a canadian businessman bought ptls assets including 
its christian theme park at a bankruptcy auction the fate of ptls 
religious operations which were spun off by the bankruptcy court 
into the nonprofit heritage ministries is unclear 
bakker and his wife tammy began broadcasting the jim and 
tammy show from their leased home near charlotte earlier this 
month

former attorney general edwin meese iii 
violated federal ethics standards by acting at the request of a 
close friend to assist scandalplagued wedtech corp and a proposed 
1 billion middle east oil pipeline a justice department report 
concluded today 
there are three instances in which friendship between meese 
and longtime friend e robert wallach dictated government 
action it said 
if meese were still attorney general we would recommend to 
the next ranking department official that the president take 
disciplinary action the report said 
a department statement said no further action against meese is 
warranted because he is no longer a government employee 
the report by the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility also found that meese violated the executive order on 
ethics and the justice departments own standards of conduct by 
failing to disclose the sale of stocks in his 1985 federal income 
tax return on a timely basis 
the report also said meese violated ethics standards by 
participating in official matters involving the regional bell 
telephone companies while he held some 14000 in telecommunications 
stock 
the reports findings on ethics questions are based in large 
measure on evidence gathered in a 14month criminal investigation of 
meese by an independent counsel that probe did not address ethical 
questions and ended with a decision not to prosecute 
in response meeses lawyers called the findings a travesty of 
justice 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
president reagan believes this report was unnecessary partly 
because mr meese has not been in the office for some time and 
partly because it was unwarranted 
fitzwater said that reagan still believes his longtime friend did 
nothing wrong thats the way he feels i talked to him and i know 
whereof i speak the spokesman said of the president 
the report concluded that meese engaged in conduct which should 
not be tolerated of any government employee especially not the 
attorney general 
as a direct result of the preferential improper efforts of 
meese and his staff the army awarded a 32 million 
enginebuilding contract to wedtech in 1982 while meese was 
counselor to president reagan said the report 
the next year it said meese and his staff injected themselves 
as a direct result of the friendship between wallach and meese 
into a financial problem wedtech was having with the commerce 
departments economic development administration 
at the urging of wallach meese tried to help clear up the 
problem wedtech was having by making a phone call to thencommerce 
secretary malcolm baldrige the report said meeses intervention is 
precisely the type of activity that is prohibited by a federal 
executive order spelling out ethical standards for federal 
employees it said 
on the pipeline meese again at wallachs urging arranged a 
meeting in 1985 for wallach and his client swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport with thenwhite house national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that 
would support the project the report said 
we must conclude that mr meese in certain instances involving 
mr wallach either did not understand or did not appreciate or 
simply did not care what impression could be left with the public 
about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he 
oversaw the report said 
meese said last july he had been completely vindicated by the 
decision of independent counsel james c mckay not to seek an 
indictment against him mckay found meese had probably violated 
federal conflictofinterest and tax laws but he said prosecution 
was not appropriate 
we trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by mr 
meese that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether 
an independent counsel seeks an officials indictment the justice 
department report said 
we found that the independent counsels report far from 
vindicates mr meese rather it details conduct which should not be 
tolerated of any government employee especially not the attorney 
general of the united states 
the investigators said that if meese were still attorney general 
we would recommend to the next ranking department official that 
the president take disciplinary action it did not specify what 
action would be appropriate 
the justice department said in a statement that because meese is 
no longer associated with the department no further disciplinary 
action is warranted in connection with matters raised in the report 
in a statement the department said attorney general dick 
thornburgh has reviewed and accepted the report and considers the 
matter closed 
thornburgh addressed the portion of the report that found that 
meese had violated the executive order and the departments 
standards of conduct by participating in matters involving the bell 
companies while holding stock in them 
it appears to me that mr meeses failure to fully dispose of

afghan soldiers used clubs and tree 
branches to flail cold hungry people who nearly engulfed soviet 
troopers distributing emergency rations in this blockaded city 
tuesday 
the blockade by moslem insurgents who have fought the communist 
regime for a decade has created acute shortages as the remaining 
50000 red army troops withdraw from afghanistan before the feb 15 
deadline set in a unmediated agreement 
a woman was pushed to the icy ground an afghan trooper with a 
rifle under his arm punched and kicked a group of teenagers when 
the crowd of about 1000 ignored repeated orders from the soviet 
soldiers shouting through megaphones to move back 
some afghan soldiers even swung blankets at men women and 
children who broke from waiting lines and pressed toward soviet 
armored personnel carriers that rolled into the rundown khairkhana 
district near the airport with emergency supplies of fuel 
five red army soldiers in fur hats were in each personnel 
carrier and they appeared ill at ease some sat staring at the 
crowd from their vehicles which were armed with 75mm cannons 
pointed skyward while others poured fuel into containers held up by 
people at the front of the line 
soviet soldiers made a similar distribution last week but the 
small amounts will be of little help 
i have nothing now my house is cold my children are hungry 
said a woman who identified herself as aziza a 35yearold mother 
of nine and never got to the head of the line 
a woman whose face was totally veiled according to strict moslem 
practice held out her hands to a western reporter and said my 
children are hungry i am hungry this is because the rebels are not 
letting supplies in 
children as young as 8 joined lines waiting for bread outside 
shacklike private bakeries in other parts of the capital shivering 
in predawn temperaturs far below freezing 
lines of buses and cars waiting for gasoline or diesel fuel 
stretched around entire blocks in downtown kabul 
western aid officials expressed alarm at the plight of 
malnourished children waiting for bread in frigid temperatures they 
said the government wheat silo for supplying private bakeries which 
holds 50000 tons and usually has a 40 percent reserve was 
virtually empty 
severe shortages began earlier this month when soviet forces 
started pulling out of the city and handing over convoy stations on 
the solang highway the vital route north to the governments 
unreliable conscript army a particuarly bitter winter exacerbates 
the lack of daily necessities 
as the crowd struggled toward the soviet supplies giant 
ilyushin76 transport planes took off reguarly from the airport a 
daily occurrence as the withdrawal deadline approaches 
afghans generally have been hostile to the soviet presence during 
the long civil war but some said tuesday they wanted the red army 
to stay if that meant getting some supplies 
soviet soldiers arrived in december 1979 and began leaving may 
15 1988 under the withdrawal accord they helped government forces 
combat the moslem guerrillas who began fighting after a communist 
coup in april 1978 and an estimated 115000 were in afghanistan 
when the agreement was signed 
no political settlement is in sight and the soviets have promised 
to continue arming afghan forces against the insurgents who were 
not a party to the withdrawal agreement and have continued fighting 
they are supported by the united states and pakistan afghanistans 
eastern neighbor 
unconfirmed reports circulated tuesday that the afghan army 
which usually gets its grain supplies from the soviets had been 
buying wheat on the private market 
food prices have more than doubled in four weeks flour has gone 
from 850 afghans the national currency for about 15 pounds to 
1700 afghans in a nation whose people earn an average of about 300 
afghans a month 
one us dollar buys 50 afghans at the official rate and 200 on 
the black market flourishing in kabuls bazaars 
an afghan doctor said there were no more of the special ration 
coupons that protected government employees against previous 
shortages 
unicef the un childrens fund reported attendance at its 
health clinics down by nearly half because mothers said they and 
their children could not leave the food and fuel lines 
this is not an african famine situations but it is a very bad 
situaton said vincent oreilly the irishman in charge of the 
small unicef mission

at a moment of standstill and silence in us 
contacts with iran presidentelect bush says he can visualize a day 
of better relations a comment he hopes may help unlock the 
locks that bind nine american hostages 
bush spoke in general terms saying that a time of change in 
administrations also can be a time of change in troubled 
relationships abroad 
i dont start off with the view that we always have to be at 
loggerheads with iran the presidentelect said in a recent 
interview with the associated press 
he said iran also could take steps beginning with the hostage 
impasse to demonstrate a desire for better ties with washington 
bush becomes president on friday eight years almost to the hour 
from the release of the 52 us embassy hostages who were held in 
tehran for 444 days and freed when president reagan took office 
jimmy carters final days as president were marked by intense 
indirect negotiations with iran for the release of those captives 
that history has given rise to speculation about the possible 
release of american hostages in lebanon as bush succeeds reagan the 
militant shiite moslem kidnappers are aligned with iran and a 
state department official said tehran can control their fate 
there was a lot of speculation back in october and november 
that the hostages might be freed because of the parallel at the end 
of the carter administration the official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity but he said there have been no openings and 
no negotiations like those eight years ago 
nor have there been talks on reagans offer to pay compensation 
to the families of 290 people killed on july 3 when a us warship 
shot down an iran air jetliner over the persian gulf 
vice president bush went to the united nations to present the 
us case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistaken 
for a warplane at the security council he called it a terrible 
human tragedy but said iran shares responsibility because the 
civilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat 
bush and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules 
out paying a price for release of american hostages on the ground 
that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture us citizens 
around the world will be put at risk 
that was reagan policy too but the administration shipped arms 
to iran to try to gain hostages release three americans were freed 
in lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986 
nine americans and seven citizens of other nations are held 
hostage in lebanon terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
of the associated press is the american held longest he was 
kidnapped by gunmen on march 15 1985 
while state department analysts believe iran controls the hostage 
situation bush said in the interview that while tehran clearly has 
influence he is not certain that that government has full control 
bush said that as president he will be alert to opportunity 
to gain freedom for hostages leaving no trail unexplored im one 
who thinks that some day we will have better relations with iran 
he said and im one who thinks its in our interest to have 
better relations with iran and im one who thinks that iran can 
take a handful of steps and demonstrate that they want better 
relations with the united states 
and so to the degree iran holds the key holds most of the keys 
to unlock the locks that could be helpful the presidentelect 
said 
but bush said he does not hold the naive view that if you have 
some dramatic meeting thats going to result in the instant release 
of hostages who are not held by iran and in some instances may be 
held by clients of iran 
bush said his interview comments visualizing better relations 
would send a message to iran theyll read this they know me 
they know our administration 
but iranian prime minister hussein musavi discounted the bush 
comments calling them an effort to justify us policy at a news 
conference in rome on tuesday musavi repeated tehrans insistance 
that the hostage issue is an internal question of lebanon not 
one for iran

on friday ronald reagan becomes the 32nd former 
president of the united states posing anew the question of how or 
whether the nation can use the experience of its former chief 
executives 
the country has no formal structure for doing so but former 
president harry f truman thought he had an idea 
in his memoirs mr citizen truman proposed that former 
presidents be made nonvoting free members of the congress 
the former president of course could not be expected to sit 
still just waiting to be called on for an expression of opinion 
truman said more often he would want to speak up on matters which 
he might deem necessary to bring to the attention of the congress 
arguments and debate are what make a free government and a 
former president could be counted on to stimulate and even provoke 
debate the former president said 
it would said truman stop the waste of a vast storehouse of 
experince and to some extent help bridge a certain gap in the 
continuity of our government 
although trumans suggestion was never adopted it was in marked 
contrast with the tongueincheek proposal offered by former 
president william howard taft 
expresidents said the expresident should be chloroformed and 
ceremonially cremated immediately after leaving office 
this said taft would fix his place in history and enable the 
public to pass on to new men and new measures 
taft ignored his own view and instead had one of historys most 
distinguished and satisfying postpresidential careers becoming 
chief justice 
there were times he remarked when he could hardly remember ever 
having been president at all 
of course the first president to attach former to his title 
was george washington 
perhaps the most important decision ever made concerning an 
expresident was washingtons decision to become one wrote john 
whiteclay chambers in american heritage magazine in 1979 
conceivably he might have stayed in office until he died 
establishing a far different tradition than the voluntary 
relinquishing of power 
ever since washington retired to the life of a gentleman farmer 
former presidents have sometimes been called on for their expertise 
and sometimes ignored altogether 
grover cleveland became a former president twice having won the 
office for a second nonconsecutive term after a fouryear time out 
eight presidents died in office never achieving the status of 
expresident 
the second president john adams became a virtual political 
exile but his son john qunicy adams won election to the house of 
representatives after his presidency and served 17 years 
three former presidents sought the presidency again and failed 
truman determined to end 20 years of neglect reached out to 
former republican president herbert hoover twice naming him first 
to get food to hungry people after world war ii then to head a 
commission that recommended ways to streamline the government 
the former presidents act of 1958 granted expresidents an annual 
income and authorized them to hire a staff and operate from a suite 
of offices furnished at government expense it granted expresidents 
free mailing privileges and it provided a pension for presidential 
widows 
in 1963 congress also granted former presidents transition funds 
to be used in the first six months after leaving office 
after president john f kennedy was assasinated in 1963 congress 
granted all former presidents secret service protection 
and in 1969 a townhouse on lafayette square near the white house 
was set aside for the use of former presidents visiting the capital 
nearly all recent former presidents have written books 
justifying their conduct in office or offering ideas and proposals 
hoover opened the first presidential library and all of his 
successors have followed his example 
all of this provides a base for sharing that wealth of experience 
of which truman spoke several recent presidents have 
richard nixon struggling to emerge from the watergate cloud that 
forced his resignation as president has written several books of 
foreign policy advice 
jimmy carter has engaged in campaigns to improve world health and 
human rights conditions through his handson carpenters work with 
habitat for humanity he has campaigned for decent housing for the 
poor he has also written several books including one on middle 
east policy 
and this year gerald r ford teaming with carter issued a 
detailed volume of advice to the next president including the 
warning that there may be no other way to eliminate the federal 
budget deficit but to raise taxes

yasser arafat has accepted an invitation to 
address arabamericans in washington says a detroit attorney who 
met with the plo leader in tunisia but such a visit could pose a 
dilemma for the bush administration 
attorney and americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
president abdeen jabara who met with arafat last weekend said the 
palestine liberation organization leader has agreed to address the 
group april 13 at its convention in washington 
however the state department on monday refused to say whether 
arafat would be allowed to enter the united states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that we 
havent received a visa request yet we will consider it very 
carefully we wont say in advance what well do 
denying arafat a visa could anger arab leaders who consider the 
plo a key part of the push for peace in the middle east issuing the 
visa could anger israel and its supporters 
there is a dilemma said sol lachman a former president of 
the detroit chapter of the american zionist federation even as a 
supporter of israel i can understand why the us would want to 
talk to the plo and why its completely appropriate to serve as an 
intermediary in the cause of peace 
but arafat in washington to deal with him on that basis is to 
legitimize him who was a terrorist up until last month 
last november secretary of state george shultz rejected arafats 
application for a visa to address the united nations citing the 
palestinian leaders support of terrorism 
but in december the united states agreed to renew talks with the 
plo after arafat renounced terrorism and endorsed un resolutions 
recognizing israels right to exist 
the april speech would be recorded as an historic event in the 
relations between americans of arab descent and the palestinian 
leadership jabara said in a statement from tunisia 
the granting of a visa to the plo chairman will not only be a 
gesture of good will toward the 2 million americans of arab descent 
but would also underline the new administrations commitment to 
resolving the palestinianisraeli conflict within the framework of 
free and open discussion of all parties 
terry ahwal chief of the groups detroit office said monday the 
issuance of a visa would demonstrate the commitment of 
arabamericans to peace in the wartorn west bank 
arafat is an important figure to palestinians obviously but 
to other arabamericans as well ahwal said 
the largest chapter of jabaras group is in detroit

the longdelayed launch debuts of two 
new military space rockets the delta 2 and titan 4 should occur 
within two months as the air force prepares for what could be the 
busiest launch year here since 1983 an official said tuesday 
the commander of the eastern space and missile center air force 
col lawrence l gooch said the delta 2 carrying a pair of 
military navigation satellites is set for liftoff feb 7 with the 
titan 4 which will be americas most powerful unmanned rocket to 
follow within a few weeks 
gooch told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls for 
seven delta 2s two commercial delta 2s and one delta 1 two titan 
4s two smaller titan 34ds and two commercial titan 3s two 
commercial atlascentaurs and one with a navy communications 
satellite and six to eight submarine test launches of the navys 
powerful new trident 2 nuclear missiles 
in addition the missile center will support seven nasa space 
shuttle launchings during 1989 starting with discovery on feb 23 
the schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since 
1983 when there were 60 there were 26 in 1987 
but launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold down 
the total gooch said with luck we could support that rate but 
if we can get 70 percent up we will have earned our pay 
the air force decided to build the delta 2 and to greatly 
increase its titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttle 
challenger in 1986 
both the pentagon and nasa had been phasing out unmanned rockets 
and putting all launch eggs into one basket the shuttle after 
challenger officials realized this was a mistake and they ordered 
expendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space 
gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up waiting 
for a rocket ride as a result of the 32month shuttle standdown 
after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the titan 
34d for several months after backtoback failures in 1885 and 1986 
about 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense he said 
gooch said the range may have problems supporting the schedule if 
there are delays in a lot of the missions 
citing the trident 2 submarine launches the first of which is 
scheduled in about two months he said if you have a trident sub 
at sea and it comes in here for demonstration firings thats a lot 
of resources and involves a national defense commitment 
in most cases the trident launch probably would have priority 
over all except the most critical defense satellite launches 
the maiden launch of the delta 2 already has been delayed six 
months and the debut of the titan 4 about five months by problems 
preparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads 
another problem gooch said could be a shortage of manpower to 
support launches he said he has asked the pentagon for about 100 
skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations 
group

president roh taewoo said tuesday he 
wants to meet soon with north korean leader kim il sung to end 40 
years of enmity between the nations 
south korea is preparing a realistic proposal to reunite the 
two koreas by seeing north korea as a partner that also seeks to 
solve this problem roh said at a wideranging news conference 
the leaders of the nations have never met and the two sides 
technically are still at war since a peace treaty was not signed at 
the end of the korean war in 1953 
north korea agreed monday to a south korean proposal that would 
allow their prime ministers to lead political and military talks on 
reducing tensions those talks would be the highest level of contact 
since the war 
besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between south 
and north korea i will realize interkorean summit talks in the 
near future and achieve epochmaking progress in resolving the 
korean question roh said 
the president said recent developments indicated north korea also 
wants reconciliation but he could not give details on efforts to 
arrange a summit 
roh outlining his administrations plans for 1989 said his 
government would continue trying to build democracy and ensure 
continued economic growth to raise living standards 
but he said violent antigovernment radicals threaten the 
nations political stability 
radical fringes are attempting to overthrow our free society 
and democratic order through violence roh said stern action 
will be taken to check violent activities intended to topple our 
democratic society 
his warning was directed at dissidents and radical students who 
have mounted violent antigovernment protests demanding the 
overthrow of rohs government the radicals who claim roh is a 
front for military rule have little public support and their 
protests often are small 
roh appealed to south koreans to foster political stability he 
said the transition to democracy since the end of former president 
chun doohwans authoritarian government had exposed and aggravated 
many problems 
desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at 
once discord and discontent among different social strata have 
been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society 
he said 
the roh government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms 
since major antigovernment protests in june 1987 forced the chun 
government to agree to elections and brought an end to repression 
roh also promised to continue south koreas efforts to establish 
ties with the soviet union china and other communist nations 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since their creation in 
1948 after us and soviet troops ended the japanese occupation at 
the end of world war ii the north invaded the south in 1950 
starting the korean war and the sides have clashed repeatedly over 
the years 
roh said the 42000 us troops based in south korea under a 
mutual defense treaty must remain until peace is achieved on the 
divided peninsula radicals demanded removal of us forces

theodore bundy the serial killer called a 
diabolical genius by one judge faces death in floridas electric 
chair next week after losing a supreme court appeal tuesday 
the justices by a 72 vote rejected arguments that bundy 42 
was mentally incompetent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying 
of a 12yearold girl in lake city fla 
within an hour of the high courts action florida officials said 
bundy would be executed tuesday at 7 am under a death warrant 
signed by gov bob martinez 
bundy has also received death sentences for the 1978 killings of 
two florida state university sorority sisters who were beaten and 
strangled just three weeks before the lake city murder 
he has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearances 
of young women most of them in utah colorado and washington state 
bundy whose case was depicted in a television miniseries named 
the deliberate stranger previously has come within hours of 
being executed only to win postponement 
tuesdays order marked the fourth time the supreme court has 
considered a formal appeal involving one of his convictions or death 
sentences 
we hope justice can now be served in this case florida 
attorney general robert butterworth said 
after signing the death warrant martinez called bundy one of 
the most notorious killers in our nations history who has used 
legal manueverings to dodge the electric chair for 10 years 
justice has been on hold for a decade martinez said and 
its about time ted bundy paid for his crimes 
but james coleman jr one of the washington lawyers representing 
bundy said we will seek to stay the execution perhaps as 
early as tomorrow 
coleman said he planned to file an emergency appeal in florida 
state court if we do not win a stay in the state courts i expect 
we will be back in federal court he said declining to disclose 
what legal theory would be advanced 
in the appeal acted on tuesday lawyers for bundy argued that 
lower courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had 
been competent to stand trial in 1980 for the 1978 killing of 
kimberly leach 
referring to numerous incidents in which bundy exhibited bizarre 
behavior during his trial the appeal maintained that bundy had been 
mentally incompetent at the time 
this court has never addressed the issue of when if ever a 
posttrialhearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a 
defendants right to a contemporary determination of his 
competency when sufficient indications arise at trial the 
appeal said 
the supreme court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a 
contemporary competency hearing 
a federal judge in 1986 ruled that bundy had been competent in 
1980 calling him the most competent serial killer in the country 
at this time a diabolical genius 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld the competency 
ruling 
the leach girl disappeared from a junior high school on feb 9 
1978 her body was found in an abandoned pig sty 
prosecutors said that on the night of jan 15 1978 bundy 
entered a chi omega sorority house on the florida state campus and 
attacked four coeds killing two and seriously injuring two 
margaret bowman and lisa levy attacked as they slept were 
killed 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose 
capital punishment under all circumstances voted to overturn 
bundys death sentence 
in other matters tuesday the court 
turned down the appeals of four california death row inmates 
including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys in 
california texas west virginia and new jersey 
ruled by a 63 vote that a california redistricting plan that 
placed democrats in firm control of the states congressional 
delegation is not an unlawful form of political gerrymandering 
let stand a ruling in a case from boston that allows 
antismoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette companys 
research that the groups say could link smoking to health hazards 
rejected a challenge to a virginia law exempting religiously 
affiliated childcare centers from some health and safety 
regulations all other childcare centers must meet

at least 49 communist party and government 
officials in the republic of armenia have been fired or expelled 
from the party some for fostering nationalism or blackmail the 
party newspaper pravda said tuesday 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who heads a commission of the 
ruling politburo charged with coordinating relief efforts from the 
dec 7 armenian earthquake was scheduled to attend a meeting of the 
armenian partys central committee on tuesday night the official 
tass news agency said 
that bodys politburo has been reviewing the activities of 
armenian communist party in line with a dec 15 decree from the 
partys moscowbased central committee 
ethnic tensions have been running high in armenia since february 
when activists launched their drive for the annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian region that has been part of the 
neighboring republic of azerbaijan since 1923 
more than 60 people have been killed in riots and violence 
between armenians who are mostly christians and the predominantly 
moslem azerbaijanis the kremlin leadership rejected the armenian 
demands instead putting nagornokarabakh under the direct control 
of moscow 
the central committees decree directs party leaders in armenia 
and azerbaijan to penalize officials who committed illegal acts in 
connection with the ethnic dispute 
pravda the communist party daily said many highranking 
armenian officials had fueled the strife by their indecisiveness 
and implied they might have been involved in the annexation movement 
itself 
in all 68 persons received rebukes from the armenian partys 
politburo pravda said in addition 13 executives were expelled 
from party ranks and 36 officials in the party government police 
and economic management were fired pravda said 
the armenian politburo charged the officials with destabilizing 
the situation in the southern soviet union and kindling nationalist 
dissension through indecisiveness passivity and negligence pravda 
said 
the paper also reported officials had violated citizens 
constitutional rights by resorting to threats and blackmail it did 
not specify what acts had occurred 
the armenian politburo singled out two local party bosses for 
negligence and the absence of political leadership that it said 
caused deaths and massive emigration of the azerbaijani population 
the bureau recommended official rebukes for y chshmarityan of the 
stepanavansk region and d ananyan of the idzhevansk region 
according to pravda the bureau also recommended armenian 
education minister s akhumyan be rebuked for not maintaining order 
in university classrooms 
the armenian politburo also charged party officials with the task 
of penalizing communists who indulge in the estrangement of people 
by nationality who allow extremist attacks or stir up nationalist 
hostilities

the agriculture department on tuesday proposed 
a change in federal meat inspection regulations to allow importation 
of slaughtered livestock carcasses with certain tissues removed 
current regulations require imported cascasses of cattle sheep 
swine and goats to include internal tissues such as the pleura 
peritoneum and body or portal lymph nodes to help inspectors spot 
disease or other abnormalities said lester m crawford 
administrator of the departments food safety and inspection service 
but these requirements began many years ago when foreign 
countries exporting practices were much different he said 
today all countries which are certified as eligible to export 
meat to the united states must have an inspection system that is 
equal to ours crawford said this means that the carcasses 
including these specific tissues have already been inspected in 
that country 
the proposal which is in response to a petition from cloverdale 
foods co minot nd will be open for public comment through feb 
16 comments can be sent to policy office attn linda carey fsis

the nations capital will be trying to cover a 
ragged image with its sunday best when the nation turns its eyes 
this way for the inauguration of george bush 
police spokesman lt reginald smith said officers would be 
working to keep the streets clear of crime and vice while washington 
is full of visitors celebrating the installation of a new president 
were going to intensify our efforts to abate many of the 
nuisances throughout the city said smith specifically mentioning 
increased efforts against prostitution and drug sales 
washingtons facade with its historic monuments and powerful 
residents has cracked lately 
the festivities come at a time when the city is dismayed by its 
murder rate 371 slayings last year mostly due to drug wars and 
embarrassed by its mayor marion barry the subject of two 
investigations recently into his social ties with people who were 
the subjects of drug probes 
much has been said about the mayor and the citys image 
william sinclair the new president of the greater washington board 
of trade said recently obviously in the short term this 
doesnt help business in the district 
the federal government has provided the dc inaugural committee 
with 23 million to pay for police and fire protection medical and 
ambulance service traffic control supervision of construction of 
stands along the parade route food inspection and issuance of 
official inaugural maps according to cecilia perry of the 
office of emergency preparedness 
ms perry said the city had made no plans to shove its homeless 
residents out of sight estimates of their numbers run from 7500 to 
twice that figure 
theres nothing that can be done she said it 
homelessness is a problem in the city they have a right to watch 
the parade just like everyone else 
but homelessrights activist mitch snyder whose community for 
creative nonviolence operates a shelter three blocks from the 
inaugural parade route said police usually force the homeless out 
of sight by threatening to drive them far from town and leave them 
there 
it happened to me in 1980 snyder said i was homeless 
police came by about 530 in the morning and said if youre not 
off this grate within half an hour well take you somewhere and 
drop you off most people realize what the police want they want 
you to drop from sight so you do 
its fairly common for homeless people to be hassled by police 
and by other officials on the street told to move on told that 
theyre loitering told that they are not to be there said maria 
foscarinis counsel for the national coalition for the homeless 
its not an unusual experience for homeless people and what 
happens around times like inauguration is that those kinds of 
methods are greatly stepped up 
at inauguration time in january 1985 image issues took a back 
seat to the homeless populations welfare because the district was 
locked in a dangerous cold wave 
city police denied any role in moving homeless people this year 
about a dozen people many of them homeless demonstrate daily in 
lafayette park across from the white house most of that park will 
be used for media coverage of the inaugural events according to 
national park service spokeswoman sandra alley but a section has 
been set aside for protesters 
us capitol police spokesman dan nichols said homelessness isnt 
a problem on the capitol grounds which encompass 180 acres of parks 
and congressional office buildings 
its against the law to sleep in the capitol grounds 
outdoors nichols said and homeless people are aware of that

the students said they recited kings works in the franklin 
regional high school lobby monday because administrators failed to 
observe the civil rights leaders birthday with a student assembly 
or a day off 
the five who are white also said the curriculum in the 
predominantly white school system in an affluent pittsburgh suburb 
does not include black history there are only 10 blacks among the 
840 high school students 
martin luther king did not work just to give blacks their 
rights he wanted freedom for all men said leona wahl 17 a 
senior and one of the demonstrators 
the high school observed martin luther king day with a moment of 
silence at the beginning of the day and administrators asked social 
studies teachers to mention king in each class school district 
spokeswoman judy johnson said tuesday 
an estimated 15 students skipped their secondperiod class to 
assemble in the lobby for the king tribute 
principal richard plutto took them into the auditorium and gave 
them a choice between returning to classes or accepting threeday 
inhouse suspensions mrs johnson said 
the five students who rejected the principals offer were 
suspended she said we were really trying to do our very best to 
kind of agree to disagree said mrs johnson 
miss wahl said she does not regret being suspended 
if they want to do that its fine she said so long as

morton thiokol inc has postponed its 
final fullscale test of the redesigned space shuttle booster a 
third time citing delays in the rockets preparation 
the test the sixth and last to formally qualify major design 
features of the 126footlong solidfuel rocket had been originally 
set for tuesday then moved back to wednesday and thursday 
the test is now set for friday theres no one main reason for 
that just an accumulation of minor delays that put us back a day 
said morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab 
on the two earlier postponements the company said engineers had 
requested more time to adequately chill the solidfuel motors 11 
million pounds of propellant 
while fridays test is the last of six formal qualifying firings 
the redesigned booster already has been successfully used on two 
shuttle launches sept 29 and dec 2 in both cases the boosters 
performed without a hitch 
raab said only five of the six scheduled testfirings the last 
of which was held aug 18 were required prior to launch 
the final test is to determine how the rocket performs with 
propellant cooled to 40 degrees fahrenheit established by 
engineers as the lowest operating temperature for the redesigned 
booster raab said 
nasa ordered the rocket redesigned after a presidential 
commission blamed a faulty seal on one of the challengers boosters 
for the spacecrafts jan 28 1986 explosion that killed the seven 
people aboard

the city council today asked county 
prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was 
secretly filmed while he pushed an offduty black policeman through 
a plateglass window 
were certainly not happy to have an incident like this 
occurring but we need all the information said councilman thomas 
j clark of the councils request for an investigation 
curt livesay an assisant los angeles county district attorney 
and head of the offices special investigations division will lead 
the probe said district attorney spokesman andy reynolds 
the black hawthorne policeman sgt don jackson said he set up 
the selfstyled sting in long beach to expose alleged police 
racism in the los angeles area 
an nbctv news camera crew arranged to follow jackson during the 
sting saturday night the incident was broadcast on nbcs national 
news monday night 
weve never been able to come forth before with enough evidence 
of alleged police racism now it is brought to your living room 
in living color said frank berry president of the long beach 
chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
the police chief in long beach declined to comment pending an 
investigation city officials promised a thorough inquiry 
we will pursue it aggressively said long beach city manager 
james hanklad if there is evidence of brutality we will act 
accordingly 
long beach mayor ernie kell said on nbcs today show this 
morning that he was disturbed by the videotape 
i do not support racism or police brutality nor do the 
vast majority of the citizens of long beach and were a caring 
thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape 
he said 
long beach about 20 miles south of downtown los angeles has 
about 450000 people including a sizeable black population 
jackson and a companion were driving through a highcrime area of 
the city when their car was pulled over and jackson got out 
the nbctv videotape shows a white officer attempting to search 
jackson the officer unleashed a stream of profanity and roughed up 
jackson after he demanded to know why he was being searched 
the incident renewed calls for a citizen board to review the 
police department the idea first was debated last year amid 
allegations of police brutality 
but jacksons boss said the black officer was looking for trouble 
i submit that if mr jackson had stayed in the vehicle as did 
the driver this incident would not have occurred hawthorne 
police chief kenneth r stonebraker said at a news conference monday 
since the incident apparently was timed by jackson to coincide 
with the birthday of dr martin luther king jr the confrontation 
should be considered nothing short of timed sensationalism at the 
risk of serious injury to all of the parties involved stonebraker 
said 
as a police chief he added i do not for one minute 
condone the unlawful use of force or police brutality 
the 30yearold jackson who has been on a stressrelated 
disability leave from his hawthorne job for 22 months contends the 
incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the 
los angeles area 
jackson alleges racist slurs and actions forced him from the 
hawthorne department he has a disability lawsuit pending has filed 
racism complaints against the department and conducted a similar 
personal sting operation against los angeles police 
jackson was riding as a passenger with jeffrey hill a 
30yearold offduty state corrections officer when they were 
pulled over allegedly for straddling lanes which they denied 
jackson got out after the car stopped and police approached 
during an argument long beach officer mark dickey ordered 
jackson to face a building and put his hands behind his head 
jackson complied and moments later was pushed through a 
plateglass store window im all right ok no problem said 
jackson on the videotape 
police booked jackson for investigation of interfering with 
police and challenging a police officer hill was issued a traffic 
citation 
the officer simply used violence jackson said monday 
i already cooperated and told him he could search me jackson 
said i had already had my hands up and was turned to the window 
and he slammed my face in it 
jackson received support at a monday night ceremony in los 
angeles commemorating kings birthday 
im deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when 
police violence and excessive force is rampant said mark 
ridleythomas executive director of the southern christian 
leadership conferences los angeles chapter 
im more so offended since the hawthorne police department 
which has no jurisdiction is making judgment 
jackson said he chose long beach police because of complaints to 
the police misconduct lawyers referral service of los angeles 
david lynn of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints 
were filed with his group against the long beach police of those 
27 were filed by minorities and 24 of those involved confrontations 
with white officers

the big winners in congress under its planned 
50 percent pay raise would be members who already refuse to accept 
outside money while the losers will be those who in the past earned 
the most in outside fees 
the reason is simple mathematics those who declined outside 
income would receive the proposed 45500 raise from 89500 to 
135000 without giving up anything in the tradeoff 
but those who have been collecting outside fees would lose that 
income offsetting a large chunk of the raise 
president reagan has proposed the 50 percent increase for 2498 
people members of congress top federal executives and cabinet 
members the proposal would become effective automatically unless 
both houses of congress vote it down by feb 8 something not 
likely to happen 
lawmakers favoring the increase however have said they would 
give up their outside fees if the raise goes through 
to illustrate the winners and losers consider the case of 
threeterm sen j bennett johnston dla the chairman of the 
senate energy committee received 47625 in outside fees in 1987 and 
kept 34940 near the maximum he could retain under senate rules 
johnston would receive a 45500 raise but after taking into 
account the loss of his outside fees he would be ahead by only 
10560 
on the other hand twoterm sen carl levin dmich who takes 
no outside fees would be 45500 richer before taxes if he accepted 
the raise however levin said he would not accept the salary hike 
senators are permitted to keep outside fees totaling up to 40 
percent of salary a current cap of 35800 any amount over that 
figure goes to charity 
house rules are different allowing members to keep 30 percent of 
salary or 26850 
the outside fees normally come from special interest groups 
seeking influence in congress 
levin said acceptance of honoraria leaves a terrible appearance 
that somehow or other were for sale its long overdue that we say 
no to special interest groups putting dollars in our pockets 
as for the pay bonanza he would receive levin said it isnt 
justified 
theres just no way to justify this pay hike at this time he 
said we have a huge deficit the congress will be asking the 
american people for some shared sacrifice you cant lead in that 
kind of an issue by taking a pay increase yourself 
an official of the selfstyled citizens lobby common cause 
said the important issue is eliminating outside fees not the size 
of the raise 
ann mcbride common cause senior vice president said the 
issue is weve got to get rid of this corrupt system special 
interest money should not be financing our public officials we need 
to pay our public officials at an appropriate level

a dip in the soviet grain harvest is a 
disappointment for president mikhail s gorbachev as he prepares for 
agricultural reforms and may affect food supplies and buying 
strategies western analysts said tuesday 
this really is a disappointment just for credibilitys sake 
they have to improve grain production its not happening said 
one western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
soviet officials on monday announced that the 1988 grain harvest 
was 195 million tons less than the 210 million tons in each of the 
previous two years 
gorbachev is trying to reform soviet farm policy by encouraging 
workers on the collective and state farms that were formed forcibly 
in the 1930s to work in smaller groups he wants to give them 
longterm leases that will allow them to consider themselves masters 
of the stateowned land and offer the opportunity to earn more money 
for harder work 
a meeting of the communist partys policymaking central 
committee is scheduled for march to consider reform in the farm 
sector which is characterized by indifference low productivity 
and large losses in transportation storage and processing the 
newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported last week that three out of 
four potatoes harvested in the soviet union go to waste 
a smaller grain harvest also will require the soviets to divert 
more of their hard currency earnings to buying food rather than new 
foreign technology to modernize industry 
the harvests of 210 million tons of grain in each of the last two 
years were short of the targets of about 230 million tons which 
western experts considered unrealistic but better than the average 
annual harvest of about 180 million tons in the first half of the 
decade 
even with a harvest the size of those in 1986 and 1987 the 
soviet union had to import millions of tons of grain to provide 
bread and pasta products for its population and feed for its cattle 
the official press warned consumers last fall that the harvest 
would be lower this year blaming drought that afflicted many of the 
graingrowing regions in 1988 the western analyst however said 
the cold and rainy 1987 growing season had been even worse for grain 
experts said the shortfall would not affect the amount of bread 
in soviet shops which is one of the few items that is always 
plentiful but it could affect meat and dairy products 
a second expert said an increase had been noticed in the amount 
of veal offered for sale at farmers markets indicating more calves 
were being slaughtered and that soviet statistics indicated a 
slight drop in milk production 
the experts agreed the appearance of more veal is a likely result 
of a shortage of cattle feed but differed on whether it was grain 
or other feed elements such as sileage and hay that were in short 
supply 
in any case they said the dry 1988 weather was likely to 
increase the protein quality of the grain harvested making it 
better for bread products that would send the soviets into the 
world market for more feedquality grain 
in a meeting at the partys central committee late last week in 
preparation for the march plenary session gorbachev told farm 
officials that bureaucrats and neighbors alike treat farmers who are 
trying to take advantage of his reforms like rockefellers and 
that laws were being written to protect them 
many people especially the lazy dont like the fact that 
leasing is destroying the ethics and habits of the years of 
stagnation when you could get a good salary no matter how you 
worked gorbachev said

james a baker iii presidentelect bushs 
choice to be secretary of state promised on tuesday to investigate 
a senators contention that soviet chemical weapons have been 
stockpiled by cuban troops in angola 
baker answering questions at his senate confirmation hearing 
responded to sen jesse helms rnc who expressed concern about 
the justsigned agreement mediated by the united states for the 
pullout of cuban troops from angola 
helms said he was worried that the agreement would abandon jonas 
savimbi leader of the usbacked union for the total independence 
of angola unita to the mercies of the cubans and marxist allies 
in the angolan government 
the senator said he had sent staff members to angola to discuss 
the pullout agreement with savimbi 
i have some concern that he wasnt consulted i dont 
understand that kind of mediation negotiation helms said 
helms said his staff members found that in three battles last 
year the cubans used poison gas against unita paralyzing 300 
soldiers and killing 120 
he said the staff members brought back reports that tons of 
poison gas have arrived in angola in soviet transports within the 
past few months and have been stored 
baker said he had not known about such a development adding 
all i can promise you to do is to look into it immediately 
in response to a question baker said the united states had not 
obtained any commitment that the cubans would abstain from attacking 
savimbis forces during their sevenmonth pullout 
baker reiterated the pledge made by bush of continuing us 
support for savimbi

drug companies are making record investments in 
research and development but the food and drug administration lacks 
the resources to handle the wave of applications for new drug 
approvals the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said tuesday 
the trade group said the pharmaceutical industry spent 65 
billion on research and development in 1988 about 18 percent more 
than the 55 billion industry spent in 1987 
the industry also had record sales in 1988 the group said a 
survey of its more than 100 members showed they had sales of 462 
billion last year about 11 percent higher than in 1987 
the increase in research and development spending reflects at 
least partly higher costs due to inflation as well as the 
industrys move into chronic diseases such as cancer and aids 
research for which is more complicated and more expensive said 
gerald j mossinghoff president of the association 
if research and development on chronic illnesses were easy it 
would have been done and solved some time ago he said were 
now taking on the diseases that havent been cured or not 
adequately treated 
the fda last year approved 20 new molecular entities drugs 
that are chemically different from anything previously approved 
each was reviewed for an average 31 months by the agency before it 
was approved and made available for physicians to prescribe to their 
patients the association said that period is in addition to an 
average four years spent developing each drug 
fda spokesman bill grigg noted that the 1988 average was down 
from 32 months in 1987 and 34 months in 1986 the agency approved a 
total of 792 drugs last year including new drugs generic drugs 
and drugs related to previously approved compounds he also noted 
that the agency has expedited procedures for drugs used to treat 
cancer and aids 
mossinghoff said that with more money and staff and better 
facilities the fda could cut the time needed to review new drug 
applications to six months 
the association supports fda commissioner frank e young and his 
efforts to streamline the approval process and make it more 
efficient mossinghoff said 
young also has sounded an alarm over the agencys finances he 
said earlier this month that the fda needs more resources to keep up 
with the number of applications for new drug approvals which he 
said is doubling every year 
president reagans proposed budget for fiscal 1990 would increase 
funds for drug reviews by imposing a user fee on pharmaceutical 
manufacturers in order to collect about 100 million next year 
mossinghoff called the fee a tax on innovation and urged 
congress to reject it

a third group claimed tuesday it had 
kidnapped former prime minister paul vanden boeynants and one of 
them demanded about 790000 for his return saying most of the 
ransom must go to the poor 
police had no clues tuesday about the conflicting claims from the 
three groups in the saturday abduction of the 69yearold 
conservative politician and businessman 
a parliamentary commission on tuesday was to have begun 
investigating allegations that vanden boeynants accepted bribes when 
he was a defense minister for seven years in the 1970s the 
proceedings were suspended because of his disappearance near his 
home in a posh brussels neighborhood 
one of the groups which called itself the revolutionary 
socialist brigade said vanden boeynants is a corrupt person 
who has stolen large public funds for his own profit the 
previously unknown group said in a letter it would put him before a 
peoples tribunal 
also on tuesday a man claiming to represent the leftwing 
terrorist fighting communist cells said in a taped telephone message 
to a news agency that vanden boeynants would be killed in three days 
if four of its militants were not released from prison 
the third claim of responsibility was made to a radio station in 
the netherlands the radio station said it received a call from a 
person purporting to represent the notorious leftist french 
terrorist group direct action 
none of the groups offered proof they held vanden boeynants 
justice minister melchior wathelet said investigators are sure of 
only three things vanden boeynants was the victim of a 
wellprepared but violent kidnapping he felt threatened before he 
was abducted and a ransom has been demanded 
there actually were two claims from the group identifying itself 
as the revolutionary socialist brigade one in telephone call and 
the other in letters sent to two newspapers demanding the 790000 
ransom 
the letters demanded that twothirds of the money come from 
vanden boeynants political and business allies and be distributed 
to the poor through five relief agencies 
the remaining third of the ransom would fund the brigades 
program to motivate the people the letters said 
the phone call also purportedly from the revolutionary socialist 
brigade and related by deputy prosecutor andre vandoren said 
you will never see him again we will return him in small pieces 
wathelet said on national television that many unanswered 
questions remain 
anything is still possible as regards the identity of the 
kidnappers he said 
officials have expressed concern about the health of vanden 
boeynants who needs daily medication for a heart ailment 
he was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late 
1978 until early 1979 
in 1986 he received a threeyear suspended sentence for tax 
fraud as head of his meat packaging business that conviction forced 
him to drop a bid to become mayor of brussels in october

drugs seem to have replaced nuclear war as the 
top concern of elementary school children 
please do something about the bad people who sell drugs to 
little children put them in jail pleaded a thirdgrader from 
rosedale ny in one of more than 60000 letters written to 
presidentelect george bush at the invitation of scholastic news a 
classroom newsweekly read by 5 million students 
threequarters of the letters written by the children in grades 
three through six mentioned drugs as one of the countrys biggest 
problems said jeanne krier public relations director for 
scholastic news 
four years ago the magazines young readers advised president 
reagan that nuclear war was their top worry 
our young readers today are more concerned about drugs 
poverty the homeless and pollution said john lent scholastic 
news publisher 
one fourthgrader from harrisburg pa wrote i think the most 
important issue in our country is drugs it is killing people and 
teenagers and it is also interfering with our health if you went 
to the schools and educated the kids about drugs it would help 
solve all the problems 
krier plans to send 25 letters to bush along with a threepage 
sampling of excerpts from others 
a fifthgrader from mclean va wrote i think you should see 
how much effect the war on drugs has on teenagers you should also 
try to get the kids who stopped using drugs to encourage other 
people to stop 
if anyone gets caught selling drugs they should be put in 
prison for five years child or adult said a fifthgrader from 
pontiac ill 
on poverty and the homeless a fifthgrader from atwater calif 
wrote there are a lot of people in this country without jobs and 
people that sleep on park benches america does not seem like a very 
free country if we have people using garbage cans and boxes as a 
home 
other forums giving youngsters a chance to advise the 
presidentelect also showed social issues are primary concerns 
tips about caring for the homeless helping vietnam veterans and 
feeding the worlds starving people were in 900 letters sent to bush 
from elementary and middle school pupils in columbus ohio 
products of the election day 1988 tips for the president 
essay contest were presented to us rep john kasich for delivery 
to the white house 
hattie white 13 an eighthgrader at hilltonia alternative 
middle school said she was glad the whales off of the alaska coast 
were freed but how many people will freeze to death without 
shelter will you work as hard for the people as you did for the 
whales 
some kindergarten students in chicago had more immediate concerns 
if bad kids beat up good kids the president should take them 
to their moms said sarah 
perhaps the most enigmatic advice to bush came from a boy named 
matt who said be a woman put sharks in cages and kill all bees 
in the world

charlitta paytons roots are in the catholic 
church and she is not going to let the archdiocese of detroit close 
the innercity church she attended as a girl without a fight 
she is returning to our lady of the rosary church for herself 
and for future generations of black catholics endangered by an 
archdiocesan plan to close as many as 55 city churches 
when they become adults all of their hope has been killed 
through things like this said payton who had attended another 
neighborhood church that is not scheduled for closing that is why 
i was concerned about coming back to my roots 
our lady of the rosary is on a critical list of 25 parishes whose 
viability is under question it has a year to meet criteria set by 
the archdiocese or it will meet the same fate as 30 churches already 
ordered closed by june 
at least 12 of the 30 have filed appeals with cardinal edmund 
szoka nine have decided to accept the ruling and others were 
undecided the detroit archdiocese said the churches have until 
friday to appeal to the archdiocese 
szoka defends the closings as necessary to maintain 82 viable 
churches and to help end a plantation mentality which he 
defined as white parish leaders running churches attended largely by 
blacks 
but for many black catholics who represent 4 percent of the 15 
million catholics in the archdiocese the church closing plan has 
showed them their place in the predominantly white church 
now that it has come down to economic strain with not a lot 
of employment money coming in we are the last to be thought of 
payton said monday 
black lay catholics with a vision a group formed to fight the 
closings said the diocese has angered blacks struggling to maintain 
the church in a city where 60 percent of the population is black 
this is a time when they should be trying to build more 
churches not close any down said marian gabriel cochairwoman 
of the group we are very angered by what supposedly has done us a 
favor 
at st philip neri church doris ann whigham worries about what 
will happen to the poor when her parish and the soup kitchen it 
operates closes in june 
a lot of people dont believe in god what is going to happen 
to them she asked 
they cant feel the love and warmth we give them at the 
church in affluent grosse point park that st philip neri is 
supposed to merge with 
but a black auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese supports szoka 
nobody is taking their lives away from them said bishop 
moses b anderson our religion is a religion of hope those who 
purvey it as something else are being unfaithful 
we have seen things terrible things weve seen profound 
changes he said and we can look at change in a positive way 
the black community has that faith and i think thats a gift 
the church in detroit is not alone 
msgr john tracy ellis a historian at the catholic university of 
america in washington said he thinks other cities that have seen 
large white catholic populations leave for the suburbs will have 
similar problems 
you could say the church has no control over it ellis said 
the archdiocese of new york tried to deal with too few catholics 
for too many parishes two decades ago when it established the 
interparish city finance corp spokesman joseph zwilling said 
the corporation lets wealthier churches help older poorer 
churches financially however ellis said cardinal john oconnor 
recently warned that several urban churches were suffering 
financially 
in chicago cardinal joseph bernardin issued a set of guidelines 
in 1987 to assist parishes in conducting a selfevaluation said the 
rev george sarauskas director of the office for research and 
planning for the archdiocese 
sarauskas said last year three black parishes working together 
consolidated and he said 10 other mostly black parishes are 
undergoing a planning process that likely will result in some 
closings and consolidations 
but some black catholics in detroit reject the official 
explanantions 
how can you say you are going to better something and then take 
away the facility the churches and the priests gabriel asked 
and when the church pulls out payton wonders what will be left 
behind 
you can very well accept other organizations and businesses 
pulling away if even the church is leaving

the supreme court was urged tuesday to give 
states sweeping power to control child pornography by upholding a 
ban on nude depictions of children even by a parent 
its clear that posing a child in a state of nudity can and 
does do harm said attorney general james shannon of 
massachusetts the child will experience shame a fear of 
blackmail 
shannon appealed to the justices to reverse a massachusetts 
supreme judicial court ruling that threw out a state 
antipornography law on grounds it could make it a crime for parents 
to photograph their naked toddlers on the beach 
justice thurgood marshall picking up on that theme asked 
shannon what is wrong with taking a picture of a naked infant on a 
bear rug a pose familiar to millions 
those pictures are lawful shannon replied he said no 
prosecutor in massachusetts ever envisioned invoking the invalidated 
law to prevent that sort of activity 
some justices suggested they could dispose of the case without 
issuing a broad ruling dealing with the constitutionality of the 
law because massachusetts has replaced the statute with a narrower 
law 
the former law enacted in 1982 made it a crime to encourage or 
permit a child under 18 to pose or be exhibited in a state of 
nudity for purposes of a photograph picture or other visual 
reproduction even for private noncommercial use 
the massachusetts legislature has since revised the law to make 
such activity illegal only if done with lascivious intent 
shannon said the new law might not be strong enough to protect 
children from sexual abuse i can think of no obligation of the 
state that is more important he said 
he also said that while many states have laws against child 
pornography he believed only kansas and ohio had passed statutes as 
tough as the one struck down in massachusetts 
the massachusetts court ruling overturned the conviction of 
douglas oakes 40 of holden for taking photographs in 1984 of his 
14yearold stepdaughter while she posed topless clad only in a red 
scarf and bikini underwear on a bar in their home 
prosecutors said the girl later threw the photos in the woods and 
oakes made her retrieve them oakes was arrested after the girls 
mother went to police with the photos 
he was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was paroled after two 
years 
the massachusetts high court by a 43 vote said the law was too 
broad in restraining freedom of expression because it could make it 
a crime for a parent to take a snapshot of a naked oneyearold 
running on a beach or romping in a wading pool 
richard j vita oakes lawyer said tuesday the state has not 
offered proof of serious harm to minors from posing in the nude 
he said that the photographs at issue in the case are not 
pornographic and that the state was trying to outlaw an area of 
expression that is much a part of our culture 
some justices said the state does not have to prove harm to 
minors to outlaw such depictions 
justice antonin scalia questioned whether freedom of expression 
was at stake at all when a state makes it a crime to photograph 
someone in the nude 
i dont think youre talking about the first amendment even 
when one says parents should be free to photograph their naked 
infants on a bear rug scalia said thats a question of whether 
the state can intrude on the parentchild relationship 
the case is massachusetts vs oakes 871651

czechoslovak police drove crowds from 
pragues main square with water cannons for a third day tuesday 
although no protest was being held and 14 activists may be 
prosecuted dissidents and witnesses said 
fourteen dissidents were detained monday including playwright 
vaclav havel whose works are banned 
they had tried to lay flowers in wenceslas square to honor jan 
palach a 20yearold student who burned himself alive 20 years ago 
to protest the sovietled invasion that ended the liberal prague 
spring in august 1968 
a prosecutor told relatives dana nemcova spokeswoman for the 
human rights group charter 77 and sasha vondra a charter 77 
spokesman would stay in custody for an unspecified period a 
dissident source said by telephone phone from prague 
ms nemcovas son david who was married saturday also was 
among the 14 arrested monday along with jana sternova a former 
charter 77 spokeswoman who met with president reagan last year in 
washington 
emigre sources said privately that david nemcovas wife michaela 
and vondras wife martina were told their relatives would be charged 
under article 156 section a of the criminal code on obstructing 
the duty of a public official the maximum jail sentence on 
conviction is six months 
whether charges would be pressed against any or all of the 14 was 
not clear the informants said 
witnesses said police had at least four water cannons tuesday and 
sprayed people in the square indiscriminately 
about two dozen vans of police rushed into the square in what 
appeared to be a preventive measure since no demonstration was 
being conducted except for several hundred young people most of 
those in the square appeared to be people passing through on normal 
daily business the witnesses said 
the witnesses speaking by telephone from prague said people ran 
from the square to keep from being drenched and it was quiet after 
about two hours with police patrolling constantly 
ctk the official czechoslovak news agency said 91 people were 
detained sunday at a rally of at least 5000 people in palachs 
honor 
an emigre source said 89 were released later sunday but a 
dissident source in prague quoted one of those freed as saying the 
number detained appeared to be much higher than reported by the 
agency 
no official comment was available on the numbers of people 
arrested or released the home telephone of government spokesman 
miroslav pavel was not answered tuesday 
an associated press reporter saw police beat several people at 
the sunday rally at least one man was so badly hurt that other 
demonstrators called for an ambulance 
several ambulances were seen rushing through the streets of 
prague on sunday 
palach press an emigre publishing house in london said a 
59yearold suffered a skull fracture 
jan kavan of palach press said it was not clear from his source 
whether the injury occurred sunday or monday or whether the man was 
a demonstrator or bystander 
also among the 14 is jana sternova a former charter 77 
spokeswoman who met with president reagan last year in washington 
after police cleared wenceslas square on monday with tear gas and 
water cannon ctk carried a dispatch referring to groups of 
antistate elements organized under the pretext of an anniversary 
of jan palachs suicide who had attempted to continue sundays 
provocation 
the provocateurs disrupted public order with their aggressive 
behavior even despite repeated appeals to disperse the agency

the soviet union announced agreements on 
tuesday with two us companies marriott corp and huntsman 
chemical corp to provide and package meals for passengers of the 
soviet airline aeroflot 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin held a joint news conference with 
the heads of the two companies j w marriott jr of washington 
dc and jon huntsman of salt lake city to give details of the 
joint ventures set up without public announcement in moscow last 
month 
marriott said his company would spend 5 million on the venture 
which would include modernizing a threestory flight kitchen 
operation at moscows sheremetjevo airport 
he said he expects to use traditional soviet food but will also 
introduce more european and american cuisine on soviet flights he 
said it was the first time the soviets have arranged with a western 
company for contracted food services in the soviet union 
aeroflot already has contracts with marriott to provide meals on 
its airplanes at several airports outside the soviet union 
vladimar a nacharov aeroflot director general said soviet 
officials hope the new businesses will operate both efficiently 
and profitably he said the soviets made the deal with marriott 
because it was the only company with the capacity to serve the 
worlds largest airline which has flights to 3600 soviet and 100 
foreign airports and more than 180 million passengers a year 
asked if the soviet airline was currently serving meals on its 
flights nacharov said sometimes 
huntsman said the venture would mark the return of his company to 
food packaging after it sold off a company that designed mcdonalds 
hamburger containers 
his company in a separate joint agreement is to make plastic 
food services products for aeroflot with a manufacturing and 
packaging operation at the moscow airport 
marriott corp which says it provides over 150 million meals a 
year to 150 airlines said its moscow operation will be one of its 
biggest 
the joint sovietmarriott company is called aeromar ltd and is 
51 percent owned by aeroflot and 49 percent by marriott 
the operations are expected to begin this summer 
both marriott and huntsman said they were looking into other 
business ventures in the soviet union marriott said a team from his 
company would evaluate the feasibility of a moscow hotel huntsman 
said his company was evaluating a major petrochemical project in 
western siberia 
huntsman interviewed after the news conference said some 
eyebrows might be raised in utah over the fact that it took the 
soviet union to bring two mormon boys together in business 
though he and marriott who also has family roots in utah are 
longtime friends they have not taken part in such a business deal 
before

there is general agreement in congress and 
among foreign policy experts that the bush administration should 
complete a ussoviet treaty on strategic arms negotiate 
reductions in conventional arms in europe and eliminate chemical 
weapons says a report released tuesday 
the report by the annapolis group a bipartisan think tank of 
politicians and policy experts said the incoming administrations 
top foreign policy priority should be the start treaty for reducing 
strategic arms 
the group also found overall support for retaining senior arms 
control negotiators paul nitze and max kampelman negotiating 
reductions in conventional arms in europe and elimination of 
chemical weapons and continuing star wars research at about current 
funding levels 
more than 125 members of congress current and former 
administration officials and foreign policy experts were interviewed 
for the project and the group said the report represented a 
consensus of views 
during a sixmonth period the group questioned among others 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee secretary of the navy will ball senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan and brent scowcroft bushs nominee for national 
security adviser 
the report said bush will likely want to avoid conveying any 
sense of haste or urgency about completion of the start 
negotiation 
a sense of haste would be clearly counterproductive not only 
in terms of getting the best possible deal from the soviet union 
but in terms of securing senate consent to ratification as well 
it said 
but the report stressed the importance of continuing start 
negotiations and talks on conventional forces and chemical weapons 
noting that these efforts will advance your other interests in 
modernizing our strategic forces and in developing a strategic 
defense 
the start talks have been recessed since november bush said last 
month it was unlikely his new administration would be ready with 
proposals for the feb 15 date set by the reagan administration for 
continuation of the talks in geneva 
on conventional forces the members of nato and the warsaw pact 
nations agreed this past week in vienna to begin new talks starting 
in march

allegations that west german companies helped libya build a chemical 
plant that can produce poison gas 
even members of kohls christian democratic union say privately 
he has bungled the issue and threatened the partys popularity by 
dodging the question of whether he or his cabinet members ignored 
early reports of a german hand in the libyan project 
kohls chief aide is to appear before parliament on wednesday to 
disclose new information about us accusations that west german 
firms took part in the libyan project by selling materials in 
violation of export controls 
west germanys opposition social democratic party demanding the 
whole truth be told accused kohl of inflicting lasting damage 
to the nations image and to relations with the united states the 
leftwing greens party called on the chancellor to resign 
were making complete fools of ourselves commented a 
government official from the christian democrats speaking on 
condition of anonymity the chancellor must extricate the 
government from this controversy before the damage becomes 
irreparable 
kohl has been silent on the subject since thursday when he 
acknowledged during a tv interview there were growing 
indications of west german involvement in the libyan affair 
after several denials of government involvement kohls 
spokesman friedhelm ost refused to say tuesday whether bonn now 
accepts us claims that the plant near tripoli is capable of 
producing chemical weapons 
we have no new information on this ost told reporters 
but on monday finance minister gerhard stoltenberg told 
reporters the government now has concrete indications and 
intelligence reports that make clear the plant in rabta southeast 
of the libyan capital can produce chemical weapons 
we must assume that the factory is a facility in which poison 
gas can be produced stoltenberg said at a news conference 
finance ministry spokesman karlheinz von den driesch sitting 
three seats away from ost at the conference said stoltenberg had 
information from a trip to the united states last week that had not 
been seen by officials in bonn 
ost said the governments position would be explained on 
wednesday when the chancellors chief of staff wolfgang schaeuble 
informs the bundestag about what it knows of west german involvement 
opposition parties have and pressed the chancellor to clarify to 
what degree west german firms have been involved including one 
company owned by the federal government 
national newspapers have been critical of kohls handling of the 
affair describing the government as defensive in its stubborn 
refrain that it has collected no evidence that would justify 
criminal charges against any german companies 
munichs sueddeutsche zeitung commented tuesday that kohl had 
lost political control of the affair by evading action and suggested 
the government at least ask federal prosecutors to decide if charges 
are in order 
social democratic party leader hansjochen vogel accused kohl of 
personal responsibility for a situation in which the german people 
and the world public have long been decieved that germanamerican 
relations have been seriously hampered and that west germany has 
been exposed to worldwide suspicion of calling publicly for a ban on 
chemical weapons while secretly fostering their production 
petra kelly leader of the greens partys parliamentary 
delegation demanded that kohl resign over the governments 
mishandling of the issue 
ost told reporters in early january that the government learned 
of us claims that west german firms helped build the libyan plant 
during kohls nov 15 visit to washington 
eight days later after west german media claimed intelligence 
sources had informed the chancellors office as long ago as 1986 of 
apparent complicity ost corrected himself to say the first word 
kohl got of the affair came in midoctober 
stoltenberg said monday that his office learned of vague 
indications in august and ost confirmed tuesday that an 
intelligence report had been made to the government on aug 2 
what is seen by americans as footdragging by bonn poses a 
potential threat to the strong position kohls party has in west 
german politics 
if west german firms are found to have broken the law kohls 
government could appear to have tried to cover up for the companies 
or been slow to follow up on the american intelligence reports

hundreds of peasants are running truckloads of 
grain across a provincial border in east china at breakneck speed in 
the dead of night to get top prices a state newspaper said tuesday 
the peasants daily said in a frontpage story that grainrunning 
across anhui provincial border into more prosperous neighboring 
provinces is dangerous but profitable because of low prices inside 
anhui 
officials in the border region have tried to prevent the grain 
outflow by setting up checkpoints to stop trucks but the paper said 
most trucks barrel past the checkpoints and elude pursuers in chases 
that have resulted in at least one death 
the paper criticized anhuis low grain prices and its checkpoints 
and warned such policies would only dampen peasants enthusiasm for 
planting grain at a time when grain harvests already are falling 
behind population growth 
in one accident along what it called the bloodstained grain 
road a 19yearold youth driving a grainladen truck lost control 
and crashed as he tried to speed past one checkpoint he was killed 
a few days earlier a checkpoint official who chased a speeding 
truck leaped onto its running board and punched his fist through the 
window to force the driver to stop the driver did not stop but the 
official suffered cuts and had to undergo surgery the paper said 
the grain truckers who make these deathdefying dashes are 
lured by the high prices outside anhui it wrote after a 
threemile dash they can earn more than 270 for their load but if 
they are stopped at the checkpoint they are fined 810 who wouldnt 
risk his life 
peasants must sell a fixed portion of their harvests directly to 
the state but supppsedly are allowed to sell the rest on the open 
market in any province 
officials in anhui however feared all the grain would flow to 
neighboring jiangsu fujian and guangdong where higher prices are 
offered the going price in jiangsu after the autumn harvest was 12 
cents a pound of unhusked rice compared with 96 cents a pound in 
anhui border area 
the relatively wealthy provinces of fujian and guangdong to the 
southeast offer even more the paper said both provinces have 
prosperous industrial and export sectors and generally attract much 
of the regions grain because of the high prices they can offer 
unhappy with anhuis low prices many peasants have withheld from 
sale an estimated 300000 tons of grain the paper noted this means 
they will have less ready cash for investing in next years crop 
it did not comment on the impact on grain supplies which are 
short in many parts of the country because of a poor harvest 
china harvested less than 393 million tons of rice wheat and 
other grains in 1988 down from nearly 403 million tons in 1987

latin aliens in an outofcontrol influx streaming 
into makeshift quarters the smoke of civil rage curling out of a 
predominantly black neighborhood miamis twin crises 
while the dozens of nicaraguan refugees arriving daily and racial 
disturbances in the citys overtown area had the super bowl host 
citys promoters fretting about miamis image community leaders 
were more concerned with the threat of ethnic divisions 
for some leaders particularly those in the black community 
there were disturbing similarities to 1980 when the mariel boatlift 
overwhelmed miami with 100000 cuban refugees and racial tensions 
twice flared into violence in black neighborhoods 
tensions were simmering among some blacks over perceived unjust 
treatment from police and feelings of frustration over perceived 
uneven treatment given the nicaraguans community leaders said 
the hoopla over super bowl with the city showing off its new 
skyline new bayside attractions and improved image may have added 
to disaffection and the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by 
police monday evening provided the spark they said 
there have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks 
they just needed a catalyst said state rep james burke these 
people involved could care less about the super bowl being here 
its not going to help their lives 
its really close to what happened before in 1980 said garth 
reeves longtime publisher of the blackoriented newspaper the 
miami times 
his newspaper in recent weeks reported complaints that police 
were being particularly violent with blacks while resentment was 
rising over the influx of nicaraguans coming here by bus at 200 a 
day 
this incident is unfortunate reeves said of the shooting 
adding theres reaction from the influx of nicaraguan refugees 
these people coming in and getting jobs that a lot of young blacks 
claim are not open to them 
in late april 1980 cuban president fidel castro opened the port 
of mariel to boats from florida and some 125000 cubans arrived in 
less than five months placed initially in tent cities most settled 
in the miami area on may 18 that year the acquittal of metrodade 
police officers charged with beating a black motorcyclist to death 
sparked three days of riots that claimed 18 lives and hundreds of 
millions of dollars in damage 
less than two months later more racial disturbances flared for 
three days after an incident between police and blacks 
three more days of violent disturbances erupted in december 1982 
after police fatally shot a black youth and street violence flared 
again when the cubanborn officer was acquitted of manslaughter in 
that case more than 200 arrests were made 
as in 1980 when some blacks felt the miami community whose 
largest ethnic group now is the cubans with onethird of dade 
countys population was making a special effort to welcome the 
mariel refugees some blacks are now resenting what they see as 
openarms treatment for nicaraguans refugees being housed at the 
miami baseball stadium and other community shelters 
the africanamericans have felt cheated said johnnie 
mcmillian president of the miami branch of the national association 
for advancement of colored people we felt we were losing our 
place in the city 
gerard jeanjuste a fiery leader in the haitian community that 
numbers some 100000 in south florida about the same as the 
nicaraguan exile community said the nicaraguan influx underlines 
what he calls racist us treatment of haitians since 1981 coast 
guard patrols have intercepted haitians immigration authorities say 
are coming here for economic not political reasons 
they interdict the haitians at sea and they meanwhile offer 
the redcarpet treatment to nicaraguans jeanjuste said 
xavier suarez miamis cubanborn mayor expressed disappointment 
over the violence while saying its super bowl week timing wasnt 
his biggest worry now 
obviously any incident of this sort affects miamis image 
suarez said the timing is always bad 
the secondterm mayor said he had been trying to ease overtowns 
problems 
thats also the area in which the city has been making its 
greatest effort with the largest urban renewal project affordable 
housing possibly in the entire nation suarez said 
others say the city could do more 
burke who was on a 1980 commission that studied the riot 
aftermath noted that county voters last year rejected a proposal 
for a juvenile welfare board aimed at helping black youths stay in 
school or get jobs 
the young black males are the ones you see involved in this 
those are the people you would have reached burke said the 
answers are there unfortunately 1980 has been too far away for 
some people to care about anymore

the agriculture department said tuesday that 
for the first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for 
students from 17 historically black universities 
deputy secretary peter c myers said 563 of the 1989 summer jobs 
will be held aside as part of the departments effort to increase 
the number of minorty students in agriculture forestry and home 
economics and to seek careers in those fields 
last year 17753 students nationwide worked during the summer 
months for various usda agencies and officials said they expect 
about that many this year the 563 jobs reserved for the black 
schools would represent about 3 percent of the total 
agriculture is more than crop and livestock production myers 
said animal and plant sciences economics forestry marketing 
and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in 
agriculture today 
myers said the jobs will be with 19 usda agencies and will be 
located nationwide he said interested students at 17 institutions 
should contact unversity placement offices before march 1 
the universities collectively known as 1890 institutions because 
of landgrant legislation that year are being targeted in other 
ways by usda myers said 
on dec 29 the department announced it was establishing offices 
at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in 
agriculture also on jan 9 the reagan administration proposed a 
usda budget for next year that included 802 million for new and 
expanded programs to increase the teaching recruitment and research 
capabilities at the 1890 schools a 20 percent increase from the 
current level

thieves cut a 700yearold fresco from the wall of 
one of northwestern chinas famous dunhuang caves onetime buddhist 
shrines filled with magnificent paintings and statues the peoples 
daily reported tuesday 
the theft from a cave that was not open to the public was 
discovered friday the paper said the thieves cut the 
10squarefoot fresco into five pieces for easy removal but one 
piece broke the report said 
the report did not describe the painting or comment on how the 
thieves got into the cave it said a fresco also was stolen from 
dunhuang in 1986 and the thieves have not been found 
in the fourth century monks who first introduced buddhism to 
china from india opened cave temples in dunhuang along ancient 
trading routes in what is now gansu province over the next few 
centuries hundreds of caves were dug out of the arid hillsides of 
dunhuang and their walls covered with religious murals 
when the trade routes fell into disuse the caves were abandoned 
and forgotten they were rediscovered in about 1900 and found to 
contain thousands of priceless manuscripts and terra cotta statues 
only a few dozen of the caves are open to the public now as a 
tourist attraction 
millions of dollars worth of ancient artifacts are smuggled out 
of china each year officials estimate most through hong kong

secretary of state george p shultz 
criticized four east european nations tuesday about human rights and 
said dark areas remain in the soviet union but an aide reported 
kremlin assurances of improvement 
a senior state department official said a ranking member of the 
soviet delegation to the 35nation helsinki review conference told 
him during shultzs last mission abroad the whole process will 
move ahead during the bush administration 
according to the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the soviet delegate said the cases of 20 more jews who want to 
emigrate have been resolved and relatives of citizens who apply for 
exit visas no longer will be urged to object 
family objections have been used by soviet authorities to reject 
applications 
i really believe them the us official said all these 
things are being volunteered 
shultz praised the soviets and two east european allies poland 
and hungary for taking steps to implement the 1975 helsinki 
agreements on european security and cooperation 
he called soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev strong and 
creative and credited him with improving human rights 
signed by the united states the soviet union canada and all 
european nations except albania the helsinki agreemenrference 
late last year 
at a news conference he called for the destruction of the berlin 
wall built in 1961 to keep east germans from fleeing to the west 
there has been tremendous progress but the berlin wall remains 
as a symbol of the division of europe an inhumane structure and 
something that functionally separates people he said so in 
the end that sort of thing has to come down 
shultz criticized romania for reserving the right to select which 
provisions of sundays declaration it would observe although he had 
not done so in his address 
romania told delegates sunday before adoption of the final 
document that it would not honor provisions on greater religious 
freedom and emigration 
one provision of the document is a mandate for new negotiations 
scheduled to begin march 9 on reducing conventional military forces 
in europe 
i have some genuine optimism about the prospects shultz said 
his last trip as secretary of state was one of the shortest he 
was in vienna for 32 hours then flew home to prepare to relinquish 
his office friday

a revised law will prevent the main 
government intelligence agency from engaging in political activity 
the agencys chief said tuesday 
park sehjik director of the agency for national security told 
a national assembly subcommittee the government would add a clause 
to the law governing the agency that would ban political activity 
but he rejected an opposition demand that the agencys activity be 
limited to gathering information on north korea and other foreign 
countries 
in our reality it is difficult to separate domestic 
intelligence from that on north korea he said 
the agency for national security formerly the korea central 
intelligence agency has been a target of public criticism for its 
active involvement in politics 
political neutrality for the agency was a campaign pledge of 
president roh taewoo in the december 1987 elections

police cordoned off a largely black neighborhood 
today after a sixhour melee of shooting burning and rockthrowing 
that was touched off by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist 
by a white policeman 
mayor xavier suarez declared the situation in the overtown 
neighborhood under control this morning and called for an 
investigation 
there was a tranquility in overtown this morning suarez said 
at a news conference the people know we are working toward 
finding out the truth 
suarez said he found nothing to substantiate claims by some 
members of the black community that the unrest was caused by 
resentment over the waves of nicaraguan immigrants coming to miami 
he said he planned no curfew 
were looking to normalize everything and keep police presence 
as unobtrusive as possible he said 
police surrounded the neighborhood today and allowed only those 
with legitimate business into the area said a police spokesman 
officer angelo bitsis schools in the neighborhood were closed 
in the only incident of violence reported by police tuesday 
afternoon a white man driving through the overtown area reportedly 
began shooting into a crowd of blacks injuring one person before 
driving away 
the riot erupted on the night of the federal holiday for slain 
civil rights leader martin luther king jr and as national attention 
was focused on the city as the host of sundays super bowl it also 
rekindled memories of miami riots in the early 1980s 
it just exploded said city commissioner rosario kennedy as 
she prepared to enter the 1squaremile area with a police escort 
people have been celebrating martin luther kings birthday all 
day maybe they were drunk we just dont know 
the riot began about 8 pm about two hours after the death of 
motorcyclist clement lloyd lloyd 21 was shot in the head as he 
was being chased for an alleged traffic violation said sgt michael 
mazur another police spokesman 
police sgt david rivero said the department was investigating 
unsubstantiated reports that the men may have been involved in a 
robbery 
at least two officers were pursuing the motorcyclist for alleged 
erratic driving when they passed a third officer william lozano 
who was stopped by the side of the road in an unrelated incident 
police said 
lozano who is white shot lloyd as the motorcycle came toward 
him said assistant police chief don march 
the motorcycle crashed into a moving car seriously injuring 
lloyds 24yearold brother who was a passenger the brother whose 
name was not immediately released was in critical condition today 
according to jackson memorial hospital officials 
police said lozano was temporarily taken off duty 
the dade county medical examiners office issued a statement 
today confirming that lloyd was killed by the gunshot not by the 
crash 
within minutes of the shooting at least 100 blacks began 
throwing rocks and bottles at police who called for reinforcements 
about 125 officers cordoned off the area authorities said 
four people including one police officer were treated for cuts 
and minor injuries said jackson hospital spokesman tony fallon 
at one point the miami herald reported suarez approached the 
crowd in an effort at concilation but was driven back by rocks and 
bottles 
an auto parts store was burned to the ground after firefighters 
were shot at and had to leave the area mazur said 
during the height of the violence tear gas was used to disperse 
some crowds who attacked and burned several clearly marked news 
media cars 
wcixtv reporter lourdes ruiztoledo said she feared for her life 
all of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of 
the driver i blocked it with my elbow they were yelling get that 
white woman out of the car the 27yearold reporter said 
miss ruiztoledo who had stayed in her car while two colleagues 
got out said she drove a block and was rescued by an officer who 
led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield the car was later 
burned 
a woman driving home from work said her windshield was shattered 
by a 5pound concrete block 
i had no idea it was going on said kay worthington of miami 
beach there were about 20 kids all throwing things i didnt see 
any cops around there 
some blacks say they have been frustrated since miami officials 
began providing free shelter for about 250 nicaraguans seeking 
political asylum 
they feel that other folks are being recognized and getting a 
piece of the pie but things are different for them they feel they 
dont have nothing and what do they have to lose said preston 
marshall who had organized a parade in kings honor that drew an 
estimated 100000 people of all races in nearby liberty city 
of all days i didnt want this to happen said marshall who 
was among black community leaders called in by city officials to 
help calm the crowd 
no damage estimates were available some looting and gunfire 
continued in overtown early today 
during three days of rioting in overtown in 1982 arsonists 
torched buildings and mobs broke into stores causing millions of 
dollars of damage the riot was sparked by the fatal shooting of a 
black man by a cubanborn police officer 
the officer was acquitted of manslaughter charges in march 1984 
sparking another disturbance that resulted in more than 200 arrests 
and several injuries a police internal affairs report in 1985 
concluded that the officer was justified in using deadly force 
in 1980 racial violence in liberty city left 18 people dead 400 
injured and 100 million in damage that rioting occurred after an 
allwhite jury acquitted several police officers of manslaughter in 
the beating death of a black businessman 
the scene of mondays disturbance was about 15 miles from joe 
robbie stadium in north dade county the site of the super bowl but 
the cincinnati bengals are staying less than a mile away at the omni 
hotel 
the miami arena where the miami heat of the national basketball 
association has a game scheduled for tonight is on the edge of

the soviet union has bought an additional 
530000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part of 2 million 
tons authorized dec 23 under the export enhancement program or eep 
the wheat was bought under a longterm supply agreement with the 
united states a pact now in its sixth year 
sims said the wheat is for shipment in january february and 
march counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements 
the soviets have 670200 tons still available under the program 
the soviet union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under 
eep arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement the 
pact expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 31 
1990 
with the latest sales the soviets have bought about 13 million 
tons of us wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact 
the eep arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled slightly 
less than 52 million tons wheat sales in 198788 all subsidized 
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 530000 tons of 
wheat would be about 195 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 78 million 
besides the wheat for 198889 delivery under the pact the 
soviets have ordered 102 million tons of corn 450000 tons of 
soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of 
grain sorghum only the wheat is subsizied 
sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of 
2335 per ton or about 64 cents per bushel he said the bonuses on 
the 530000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies cargill 
inc 80000 tons continental grain co 200000 garnac grain co 
50000 richco grain ltd 50000 tradigrain inc 50000

riots trial demanded tuesday that two belgian police officials be 
convicted for failing to maintain security at the 1985 european 
champions cup match 
prosecutor pierre erauw was more lenient with two city officials 
and two top european soccer officials who were sued by relatives of 
the 39 people who died and hundreds who were injured in europes 
worst soccer riot they should not be punished he said 
on wednesday erauw is expected to call for severe sentences for 
26 british suspects who face up to 10 years imprisonment on 
involuntary manslaughter charges of instigating the riot before the 
may 29 1985 final between fc liverpool and juventus turin 
twenty of the 26 britons returned to belgium this week for a 
mandatory appearance during erauws final arguments they probably 
will be allowed to return home to await the end of the trial 
expected in march 
on monday erauw said albert roosens secretarygeneral of the

evangelist jim bakker pleaded innocent 
tuesday to federal charges that he diverted millions of dollars from 
his ptl television audience for personal use 
bakkers lawyer george t davis asked us magistrate paul 
taylor during the hearing for a gag order for all parties involved 
based largely on comments by the retired federal bankruptcy judge 
who supervised the sale of ptl assets 
taylor said he would consider the request instructing attorneys 
from both sides to draft a consent order and present it to him by 
thursday for approval the magistrate told davis he was concerned 
bakker would go on television and talk about the case but he issued 
no formal request for bakker to keep quiet 
bakker was silent during the hearing but made a statement 
afterward 
i am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment 
bakker said the judge asked for no conversations about this case 
but id like to say that tammy and i are thrilled to be back on tv 
the bakkers began broadcasting the jim and tammy show from 
their leased home near charlotte earlier this month bakker didnt 
appear on the telecast tuesday and his wife tammy faye handled the 
program alone 
bakker quit the ptl ministry in march 1987 after admitting a 
sexual encounter with former secretary jessica hahn and paying her 
money to keep quiet the ministry he founded wound up seeking 
reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months later bakker tried 
to raise money to buy back the ministry but failed 
last month a canadian businessman bought the ministrys assets 
including a christian theme park at a bankruptcy auction the fate 
of ptls religious operation is unclear 
in seeking the gag order davis presented taylor with a copy of a 
recent newspaper article in which retired us bankruptcy judge 
rufus reynolds called bakker a sawedoff little runt 
taylor asked davis if any of the comments made by reynolds 
focused on whether he felt bakker was guilty or innocent of the 
charges contained in the indictment 
davis responded affirmatively saying reynolds described his 
client as a thief 
we cant see how we can have a fair trial if were innundated 
with pretrial negative publicity especially from a federal 
judge davis said how can we prevent this this guy is a loose 
cannon hes already gone overboard 
davis said reynolds statements could have affect potential 
jurors 
this judge needs to be restrained he said he simply 
cannot control himself just think of the dangers that this kind of 
pretrial publicity could cause 
deborah smith a us justice department prosecutor handling the 
case said the government was willing to agree to a consent order 
the government is very concerned about the pretrial 
publicity she said adding that prosecutors also were considering 
filing a motion for a gag order 
ms smith said prosecutors were concerned that davis request 
might be part of a strategy to get the case moved outside the 
courthouse davis declined to say whether he planned to ask that the 
jury trial be moved out of charlotte 
taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the courts february 
term but set no specific date he also gave the attorneys 15 days to 
file other motions such as a request for a continuance 
bakker and three of his former top aides at the nearby ptl 
television ministry in fort mill sc were indicted dec 5 after a 
16month federal grand jury investigation into ptls operation under 
bakkers leadership the three have pleaded innocent to charges

secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii 
deftly sidestepped most direct questions tuesday at his senate 
confirmation hearing including queries about when the united states 
would resume nuclear arms control talks with the soviet union 
but in his answers to questions from members of the senate 
foreign relations committee baker made it clear that the 
administration of presidentelect bush will largely adhere to paths 
laid down by president reagan and will move cautiously when it does 
depart from those policies 
in the middle east in central america in south africa all 
trouble spots the new administration will be forced to grapple with 
in its early months in office baker disclosed no specific plans 
for dramatic change saying only that policies are under review and 
that in some instances the bush team will be open to new approaches 
as the scheduled twoday hearing opened committee chairman sen 
claiborne pell dri urged baker to press for quick resumption of 
strategic arms control talks with the soviets 
there is no more urgent priority facing you than to continue 
the momentum in arms control with the soviet union most 
particularly in the area of strategic nuclear weapons sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the committee said as bakers 
confirmation hearing opened 
the start talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have 
been recessed since november and the incoming bush administration 
is reviewing ussoviet relations including armscontrol 
negotiating postures 
pell and other lawmakers urged that the start talks be resumed 
quickly and without linkage to other negotiations such as upcoming 
multilateral talks on reductions in conventional forces 
baker was noncommittal saying he could not specify a date by 
which the talks will resume we must take a hard look at our 
negotiating position baker said adding that bush also will want 
to review the nations needs for strategic modernization 
but he noted that bush has made it very clear he wants to build 
on the progress made to date and added it is my thought that 
we should move forward with start talks without necessarily linking 
them to anything else 
opening the hearing baker read a statement calling for a new 
relationship between congress and the administration on foreign 
policy and promised more extensive consultation with capitol hill 
than was evidenced during president reagans two terms he asked 
that congress reciprocate 
yes this is an appeal for a kinder gentler congress baker 
said borrowing from bushs campaigntrail promise of a kinder 
gentler nation 
he said if partisanship and division on some thorny issues 
continue stalemate will be inevitable when we held the line 
together on afghanistan or throughout the inf negotiations we 
succeeded when we did not in central america the outcome was 
unsatisfactory to everyone he said 
he also called for renewed efforts to reach peace in the middle 
east a strong international effort to rid the world of the threat 
of chemical weapons and new efforts to address global environmental 
problems such as the greenhouse effect 
baker who was white house chief of staff during reagans first 
term and treasury secretary in the second has little direct 
experience in foreign policy making but his skill in dealing with 
congress and in negotiations are widely respected and confirmation 
seemed virtually certain 
on ussoviet relations baker said he remains wary of apparent 
moves by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to restructure and open 
soviet society the soviet union remains a heavily armed 
superpower baker said the talk is different but the force 
structure and policies that support farreaching interests and 
clients have not changed commensurately 
questioned about continued us involvement in regional conflicts 
around the world baker reiterated the new administrations 
intention to continue us support for the unita rebels in angola 
until national reconciliation is achieved and said the new 
administration cannot and must not abandon the contra rebels in 
nicaragua 
but in nicaragua he added clearly we need a different 
approach perhaps including an economic development plan assisted 
by european and japanese allies 
the standard for whether the united states will militarily 
support rebel movements a policy that has come to be called the 
reagan doctrine will be whether the group is a broadbased 
liberation group national in scope that expresses the will of 
the people he said 
during questioning on a wide range of issues baker also said 
that the new administration will undertake a fullscale 
review of the issue of third world debt i believe there is room 
for more creative financing mechanisms that can result in a 
reduction in the stock of debt he said suggesting that 
fundamental changes in the economies of debtor nations may be needed 
as much as debt relief 
us attempts to pressure south africa to abandon its apartheid 
policy of official racism through economic sanctions have not had 
the desired results we need to review our policy in south 
africa and reach agreement with congress on a unified plan he 
said we ought to consider perhaps some creative ways to build 
black institutions in south africa 
a decision on a usapproved panamanian administrator for the 
panama canal due in 1990 will have to await developments there 
im not sure its in the best interests of the united states to 
see us move forward down there under the current situation in 
which strongman gen manuel antonio noriega continues to hold power 
in defiance of us efforts to oust him it is difficult to make 
progress on normalizing relations as long as gen noriega remains in 
charge 
the united states will recognize whatever government takes 
power in el salvador after the march elections provided the 
elections are free and fair and in the best democratic 
tradition he said the bush administration will stand strongly 
against any resumption of deathsquad activity and might issue a new 
warning to the salvadoran government that such a resurgence might 
lead to cutoff of us aid

soviet and us negotiators have begun trying 
to settle the 70yearold question of much moscow should pay for 
bonds issued by russias last czarist government 
until now the soviet governments of v i lenin and his 
successors have refused to pay anything for the bonds which had a 
value of 193 million when they were issued before 1919 
since then unpaid interest has increased the total value of the 
bonds to 862 million according to the treasury department 
the bonds were issued by the czarist government but the last 
czar nicholas ii was overthrown and shot in the 1917 revolution 
lenins government repudiated them two years later 
since then the bonds were considered to have little or no value 
and were often valued more for the beauty of their engraving than 
any hope they would be repaid 
carl marks and co inc of new york owns bonds with a face 
value of 20 million but mark claster its chief operating officer 
says there is no market for them 
you make a market he told an interviewer how much will 
you give me five cents on 100 
negotiations began in london between us and soviet diplomats in 
london nov 28 and the two sides agreed to hold another meeting the 
state department said but nyoka white public affairs office for 
the departments bureau of european and canadian affairs said she 
did not know when or where it will take place 
the soviets have already made deals with britain and switzerland 
on czarist bonds held by citizens of those nations making a deal 
with the united states might make it easier to float new soviet 
bonds here though ms white said there would be several legal 
obstacles 
one of those hurdles may be another 674 million the treasury 
still carries on its books from world war ii which is part of the 
9 billion cost of food and equipment sent to the soviet union under 
the lendlease plan of world war ii 
in addition the soviets also owe 109 million to the us 
exportimport bank although the soviets are keeping current on 
those payments 
many european banks have opened new lines of credit for moscow 
and some american banks including the first national bank of 
chicago are interested in doing more business 
these deals which according to some estimates now reach 7 
billion evoked criticism from former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger who called them a potential aid to the soviet military 
these may be all going into production of better fertilizer 
he said in a speech to business executives last month the same 
chemicals however are used for chemical warfare in many cases 
but tony zehnder press relations officer for the first national 
bank of chicago said a distinction should be made between 
shortterm loans for trade deals and longerterm lines of credit 
such as those being offered by banks in western europe he said his 
bank is interested only in shortterm deals 
these arent for missiles that are going to be used to bomb 
washington he said in a telephone interview from his chicago 
office 
first chicago has agreed with a soviet bank in london the moscow 
naordny bank to finance projects in the soviet union and other east 
european countries 
zehnder says it plans to introduce the soviet bank to its clients 
who want to do business in the east

medical research scientists are voicing 
growing concern that their work on behalf of humanity is being 
threatened by community activists unduly preoccupied with the effect 
on the people down the street 
the not in my backyard syndrome was debated tuesday during 
the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement 
of science 
in the cases i examined the community wants to have some 
accountability if there are any health and safety implications to 
the research said sheldon krimsky an associate professor of 
urban and environmental policy at tufts university in medford mass 
community opposition to research facilities has blossomed with 
increasing public concern over toxics land use and other issues 
and with passage of tougher environmental laws he said 
but syracuse university sociologist allan mazur disagreed at a 
news conference on the not in my backyard syndrome 
mazur said such controversies have become common largely 
because of the journalistic coverage of them it will get a lot of 
sympathy 
during a saturday night keynote address to the convention 
stanford university president donald kennedy said scientists 
ability to solve societys problems is suffering as some 
environmental and nogrowth groups become enemies of scientific 
progress 
we need a lot more stiffness in the face of special political 
interests that are hostile to american science kennedy said 
calling san francisco the nations capital of activist 
singleissue and notinmybackyard politics 
on tuesday stanford associate vice president larry horton 
denounced what he called cynical manipulation of environmental 
laws by animal rights activitists and others opposed to research for 
nonenvironmental reasons 
the extent of mutual hostility on the issue became apparent 
during the news conference tuesday 
hotel security police escorted community activist margaret verges 
from the session after she claimed to be a reporter and launched 
into a brief speech against the university of californias plans to 
establish labs in a building it owns in san franciscos laurel 
heights neighborhood 
she later accused scientists of being arrogant hostile 
meanspirited and unwilling to bargain 
george carr president of the laurel heights improvement 
association said homeowners oppose the university of california at 
san francisco research facility because its an industrial use in a 
residential neighborhood and because they fear it will harbor toxic 
radioactive infectious and cancercausing substances 
the university disputes the allegations 
the university has tried to push us in the press as local 
dissidents opposed to science thats a lot of bull carr said 
he called biomedical research necessary but added one cannot 
destroy the quality of life that the research is intended to 
preserve 
yet zoning laws often fail to address whether small research labs 
should be allowed in residential zones krimsky said 
he said cases of communities seeking to exert control over 
research included studies of germ warfare agents nuclear weapons 
research semiconductors and genetically engineered microbes that 
would be released to the environment 
but horton indicated environmental concerns sometimes are 
ridiculous 
there was a hysterical reaction against pollutants from the 
proposed building where stanford wanted to house research rodents 
even though the most serious substance to be used was a cleaner 
called zonk to clean the cages horton said 
krimsky said scientific chaos could result if national standards 
for experiments on animals and humans were superseded by local 
standards researchers would move to the community where they 
would have the easiest set of guidelines he said 
and the ultimate result mazur said might be to drive 
laboratories to poor areas without activist neighborhood groups

a deeply divided communist leadership 
is unable to control the countrys economic and political crisis 
and further social upheaval is imminent a staterun newspaper said 
tuesday 
the following is clear this country is not being run by 
anyone the leading official daily borba said in an editorial 
more precisely it is being run by divided dangerously 
antagonistic republican leaderships with different ideological 
concepts creating chaos in politics and economy borba said 
meanwhile the ruling 23member politburo announced that on jan 
25 the policysetting central committee will discuss the political 
situation in the country relations within the party and the 
functioning and responsibility of the central committee and its 
politburo 
the wording of the announcement carried by the state tanjug news 
agency indicated the session might result in leadership changes 
in an apparent attempt to bridge the growing rifts between 
yugoslavias republics the ninemember state presidency on tuesday 
appealed to opposing leaderships to settle their differences by 
dialogue 
public discontent after years of rising inflation and falling 
living standards borba said is turning into a fullscale 
revolt threatening the very foundations of the communist system 
the crisis is so deep that it can at any moment cause even 
greater social upheavals which would force the country into a 
completely unwanted direction the paper said 
the most liberal republics of slovenia and croatia favor 
political pluralism and more democracy as a solution to the 
countrys woes but southern regions led by the countrys largest 
republic of serbia advocate more central control and a greater role 
for the communist party 
the choice of a new premier later this week may cause yet another 
sharp clash between the countrys liberal and conservative regions 
tanjug said the worsening crisis calls for an emergency party 
congress meeting to resolve conflicts and elect a completly new 
leadership 
it is better to have an extraordinary congress than to be 
forced to introduce extraordinary measures tanjug said 
the countrys six republics and two provinces have wide autonomy 
in political and economic affairs creating eight virtually 
selfruling states that must reach consensus when passing important 
new laws that often leads to watereddown compromises 
yugoslavia is faced with confusion sometimes bordering on 
political chaos borba said 
unable to control the economic crisis the federal cabinet 
resigned last month leaving the country virtually ungoverned the 
vecernje novosti daily said 
in addition under pressure from hardline serbian communist 
party chief slobodan milosevic and other serbian leaders the party 
elites in the provinces of vojvodina and kosovo and in the republic 
of montenegro have been ousted and only interim leaderships have 
been left in charge of the regions 
the ouster of the entire montenegrin ruling elite came after more 
than 120000 people demonstrated last week in titograd the regions 
capital demanding the leadership step down because of the 
disastrous state of the republics economy 
the action was applauded by serbias statecontrolled media 
but the mass demonstrations in montenegro were denounced in the 
liberal northern republics of slovenia and croatia and described as 
being covertly orchestrated by followers of milosevic who is 
alleged to have federal leadership ambitions

urban homelessness and hunger increased 
significantly in 1988 particularly among families with children 
the us conference of mayors said tuesday in reporting results of a 
survey of 27 major cities 
one of every four homeless persons in the surveyed cities was a 
child 
families women and children they make up the most 
significant increase we have experienced boston mayor raymond l 
flynn said in releasing the findings 
the conference which conducts an annual survey of hunger and 
homelessness reported that both had risen in nearly all of the 
cities it surveyed 
the senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn 
speaking to the mayors later called the survey a devastating 
indictment of the neglect of the needs of our major urban centers 
he said the mayors had made a compelling case for increased spending 
on the problems 
flynn said the rate of increase seemed to have slowed a bit from 
the previous year in part because of increased emergency services 
provided by state and local governments 
officials in every city surveyed cited a lack of affordable 
housing as the main cause of homelessness and flynn blamed a sharp 
decline in federal spending on lowincome housing during the reagan 
admininistration 
shelters are not the answer flynn said permanent 
affordable housing that is the answer 
the survey was released at the opening of the annual winter 
meeting of the organization of bigcity mayors the survey was 
conducted among the 27 cities whose mayors sit on the conferences 
task force on hunger and homelessness headed by flynn 
among its findings were that in the past year in the surveyed 
cities 
requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent 
all but two of the cities registered an increase 
requests for emergency food were up an average 19 percent 
threefifths of those asking for emergency food were memebers of 
families 
an average of 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter 
went unmet and among homeless families the figure was 23 percent 
shelters in two out of three cities reported they turned away 
homeless families because of a lack of resources 
in 62 percent of the cities emergency food assistance 
facilities had to turn away people also for lack of resources 
on average the composition of the homeless population was 49 
percent single men 34 percent members of families 13 percent 
single women and the rest unaccompanied youth one in four was a 
child an average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and 
onefourth were severely mentally ill 23 percent had fulltime or 
parttime jobs 26 percent were veterans 
flynn called for more federal spending on urban problems and 
said he was encouraged by presidentelect bushs stated commitment 
to making homelessness a high priority 
the boston mayor said that by holding the increase in the defense 
budget to the inflation rate in the coming fiscal year an extra 4 
billion could be made avilable for lowincome housing and emergency 
shelter programs that would not solve the problem he said but 
could at least pay for emergency shelter programs and get started on 
increasing the availability of affordable housing 
bushs choice for secretary of housing and urban development 
jack kemp is to meet with the mayors wednesday

president reagan has approved 10 pardons in 
recent days but has not yet decided whether to grant such relief to 
newspaper heiress patty hearst shaw and industrialist armand hammer 
an administration source said tuesday 
the source discussing the subject on the grounds of anonymity 
said there are no big names among those for whom reagan had 
approved pardons but the source would not identify the recipients 
there may be as many as a couple of dozen that are before the 
president the official said adding that consideration of pardons 
for shaw and hammer is well along in the process 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater questioned earlier in the 
day about the status of the shaw case said only that reagan was 
considering several pardon requests 
its certainly possible that a decision could be made before he 
leaves he said when asked whether reagan would grant pardons 
before he leaves office friday 
although fitzwater would not identify who had applied for 
pardons reagan himself told reporters sunday that he had asked 
staff aides to look into the question of a possible pardon for 
newspaper heiress patty hearst 
ms hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for 
her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a san francisco bank 
she now is married and living in connecticut under the married 
name of patty hearst shaw 
theres also a longstanding pardon request by industrialist 
armand hammer the head of occidental petroleum corp who was fined 
3000 and placed on a years probation in connection with his 
guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in connection with the 
watergate scandal of the early 1970s 
fitzwater said that several pardon requests with recommendations 
for action had been sent to the white house by the justice 
department in recent months he wouldnt say how many are pending at 
the white house 
i wont comment on any individuals that are in this category 
the spokesman said some of them are recent some of them weve 
had for weeks or for months 
fitzwater said he had been told that reagan doesnt have any of 
these on his desk at this time 
the administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that the pardon approvals tend to trickle over 
we got 10 back from the white house approved last week 
under routine procedure the justice departments pardons office 
would contact the person getting a pardon or that persons attorney 
he said 
returning from the presidential retreat at camp david md 
sunday reagan was asked by reporters if he was going to grant a 
lastminute pardon to shaw 
all of this thing i have asked everybody to look into this for 
me he replied 
shaw granddaughter of newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst 
last august quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery 
she has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical symbionese 
liberation army a group of selfstyled revolutionaries who abducted 
her in berkeley calif in february 1974 and orchestrated the bank 
heist 
shaw was convicted of charges connected with the robbery and 
sentenced to seven years in prison her sentence was commuted by 
reagans predecessor president carter and she was released from 
prison on feb 1 1979 after serving 23 months 
in an interview monday with the advocate of stamford at her 
westport conn home shaw was asked whether she thought reagans 
expression of interest in her case might result in a pardon 
i dont know she replied its a little premature for 
anything like that if he reagan doesnt approve it it would go 
to the next administration 
shaw now 34 lives in westport with her husband and two 
daughters 
reagan has steadfastly insisted that he is not considering a 
pardon for former national security council aide oliver l north 
who is scheduled to go on trial late this month on a variety of 
charges related to the irancontra affair a federal judge late last 
week granted a motion by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
asking that two central charges against north be dropped

the united states has been buying older 
sovietdesigned jet fighters and other russian weapons on the open 
market for the past year to test their effectiveness and to train 
american servicemen a military spokeswoman said tuesday 
jan bodanyi the pentagon spokeswoman said the purchases began 
in early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international 
arms dealers or private citizens soviet mig15 17 and 21 jet 
fighters 
the defense department also has bought soviet airdefense 
equipment such as radar systems with a view toward better training 
american pilots she added 
the us military has long conducted tests and experiments with 
military equipment made in the soviet union warsaw pact and third 
world countries and later captured stolen or covertly purchased 
the pentagon had not acknowledged previously however that 
efforts are now made to buy soviet weaponry in an open manner in the 
worlds arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret 
last september the pentagon announced the creation of a new 
organization known as the mobile operational test force set up by 
the pentagons operational test and evaluation office that receives 
the soviet equipment being purchased reporters were later allowed 
to watch the new organization test some sovietbloc equipment at 
kirtland air force base nm 
reporters were not told then however that much of the equipment 
they were viewing including the mig jet fighters had been 
purchased through arms dealers and other noncovert sources 
that acknowledgement came tuesday only when the pentagon 
responded to a report by the trade publication inside the 
pentagon focusing on one aspect of the testing program 
the defense department is purchasing soviet and other threat 
aircraft from commercial sources said bodanyi it is a 
continuing effort 
the spokeswoman acknowledged the pentagon does not expect to find 
the newest and most modern soviet weapons for sale on the open 
market but she said that purchasing soviet aircraft from 
commercial sources is often three to four times cheaper than 
modifying us aircraft to soviet characteristics 
in addition openly acquired aircraft and equipment can be 
tested openly by average us servicemen which adds to operational 
testing realism she said

vice presidentelect dan quayle gave 
unqualified support tuesday to the controversial 50 percent pay 
raise for congress federal judges and the cabinet acknowledging 
however i know its a lot 
quayle made his comments in an interview with the associated 
press as a washington post poll showed that eight out of 10 
americans oppose raising the salaries of members of congress from 
89500 to 135000 
quayle who served four years in the house and eight years in the 
senate appeared to take a somewhat different stand than his new 
boss presidentelect bush on jan 6 bush said he supported 
president reagans endorsement of the 50 percent pay raise but added 
he may take another look at the issue after becoming president 
bush asked if the nation could afford such a big pay increase at 
a time of huge deficits said well i dont know whether we can 
afford anything than to get this deficit under control 
quayle did not qualify his endorsement i support president 
reagans decision to send that up to capitol hill i know its a lot 
but i think he thought long and hard i support his decision 
the pay raise plan will take effect next month unless congress 
vetoes or modifies it 
under the proposal that reagan endorsed the presidents salary 
would rise from 200000 to 350000 and the vice presidents would 
go up from 115000 to 175000 however the constitution prevents 
bush from getting an increase for the term to which he was elected 
and presumably quayle would be covered by the same prohibition 
quayle will be sworn in with bush in ceremonies friday quayle 
said he will model his job after the way bush performed it refusing 
to discuss publicly what they talk about in private he said he 
would not speak up in cabinet meetings or when other people are 
present giving his views to bush alone 
hes going to rely on me for advice on things that he thinks 
are important quayle said 
he said everyone hes talked to who has been vice president 
including bush said dont get bogged down with trivia dont 
get tied down with lineitem assignments early on theres always 
going to be someone who says well this issue has come up what 
shall we do with it someone will suggest well lets give it to 
the vice president 
quayle said the assignments he takes on will be of substance 
stature and of importance to the president and those assignments 
will be forthcoming 
he said one thing he wants to do is to try to change the 
stereotype image of the republican party as insensitive to the 
plight of the poor and minorities he said he would travel to inner 
city neighborhoods to hear them out to get a feel a 
sensitivity about their problems 
acknowleding that the budget deficit will prevent new spending 
programs quayle said moneys not everything he said he would 
use the tools of leadership and persuasion 
bush administration officials say the key foreign policy issue 
facing the new president will be devising a strategy for dealing 
with a soviet union that is rapidly changing under mikhail gorbachev 
my personal viewpoint is that gorbachev is in a much stronger 
position than seen by the conventional wisdom in this country 
quayle said i think there are a lot of skeptics in this country 
about him i think hes in a very strong position 
hes consolidated power much quicker than any other soviet 
general secretary hes way ahead of the late leonid brezhnev he 
gorbachev consolidated power in three years which took brezhnev 10 
years to do 
quayle said he had not met gorbachev but considers him a very 
effective capable leader who has an opportunity to do something 
talking about gorbachevs twin programs of glasnost or 
openness and perestroika or economic reform quayle said i 
think glasnost is for real i happen to think that the soviet 
society today is more open than it has been in the past that you 
read publications today that you would not have read five years ago 
three years ago 10 years ago 
perestroika on the other hand im personally a bit more 
skeptical of i think perestroika anytime someone tries to reform 
the system particularly that system is just a consolidation of 
power i think gorbachevs been very effective in the consolidation 
of power

plo leader yasser arafat on tuesday 
rejected an israeli suggestion for palestinian elections in the 
occupied territories and said a vote could be held only after the 
israelis leave 
arafat denied he threatened a palestinian mayor on the west bank 
who proposed a truce in the palestinian uprising he also said the 
palestine liberation organization is cooperating in a probe to track 
down the bomber of pan am flight 103 
speaking at a news conference at the end of a twoday visit to 
finland arafat rejected the notion of elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip because the palestinians had very very 
bad experiences of elections run by israel 
the only elections which are acceptable are under the auspices 
of the united nations after the withdrawal of israel arafat said 
the last voting in the territories was in municipal elections in 
1976 when candidates supporting the plo were swept into office 
many of the elected mayors later were deposed two were targets of a 
jewish underground and were maimed in bomb attacks 
one lesson is enough arafat said 
the israeli labor party proposed an election to chose an 
alternative leadership that could negotiate for the palestinians 
but the likud party under prime minister yitzhak shamir has been 
cool to the idea 
israel refuses to talk to the plo which it considers a terrorist 
organization and it has dismissed arafats declaration last month 
renouncing terrorism and accepting israels right to exist as a 
public relations ploy 
arafat denied he threatened elias freij mayor of bethlehem who 
suggested a truce in the 13month uprising on condition that israel 
release palestinian leaders 
freij one of the few elected in 1976 still in office withdrew 
the proposal after a broadcast on monte carlo radio quoted arafat as 
saying 
any palestinian leader who proposes an end to the intifadeh 
uprising exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and 
endangers his life the plo will know how to deal with him 
asked about the broadcast by a reporter at a reception after the 
news conference arafat said the radio misquoted me i said if i 
tried to stop the intifadeh the small boy who is standing beside me 
would shoot me 
the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip territories israel 
seized from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war has left 
at least 362 palestinians and 15 israelis dead 
arafat also said the plo is cooperating to find who sabotaged pan 
american flight 103 which blew up over scotland on dec 21 killing 
270 people 
we are doing our best because this is an awful crime he 
said declining to elaborate 
he said 94 countries have officially recognized the state of 
palestine which the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile declared nov 15 he said he expected that 
number to rise to 120 within a few weeks 
on his second day in finland arafat met members of parliament 
and leaders of the political parties he held talks monday with 
president mauno koivisto prime minister harri holkeri and foreign 
minister kalevi sorsa 
the plo leader left the finnish capital tuesday evening for an 
unknown destination aboard an iraqi airliner 
in tunis bassam abu sharif chief arafat spokesman met the us 
ambassador to tunisia briefly sunday at a dinner given by the 
british embassy for visiting foreign office minister william 
waldegrave the tunisian newspaper assabah reported 
abu sharif confirmed the meeting in the tunisian capital and said 
he discussed the situation in the israelioccupied territories with 
ambassador robert pelletreau 
pelletreau held his first official meeting dec 16 in tunis with 
a delegation of highranking of the plo which is based in tunis

incoming presidential chief of staff john 
sununu suggested tuesday that george bush favors an increase in 
military spending near the 2 percentplusinflation level proposed 
by president reagan 
the remarks made by sununu in a broadcast interview appeared to 
be at odds with earlier hints by bush advisers pointing towards cuts 
in reagans defense budget to make room for more spending for some 
social programs 
sununu in an interview on john mclaughlins one on one was 
asked if bush like reagan wants a defense spending increase of 2 
percent above inflation in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
i think somewhere around that range sununu responded 
the interview for the syndicated television program was taped on 
tuesday to be aired on sunday 
bush through his campaign and in statements after the election 
voiced a desire to expand spending for some social programs 
including education the head start program child care and 
environmental cleanup 
in the past neither bush nor any of his top aides have indicated 
where in relation to the final reagan budget submitted last week 
the bush administration would stand on defense spending 
bush has said he will propose his own overall budget 
modifications to congress several weeks after his inauguration 
friday morning 
i think the question before congress right now and the bush 
administration is looking at in the budget theyre going to present 
is what level of growth from the budget ought to be maintained for 
defense and how that growth is related to inflation sununu said 
reagan in his final budget proposed defense spending authority 
of 3152 billion for fiscal 1990 up from 2988 billion in the 
current fiscal year 
thats an overall increase of 55 percent and takes into account 
about a 35 percent increase in the inflation indicator used for 
defense calculations 
bush has proposed a flexible freeze in overall spending 
which would hold the total growth in spending to the rate of 
inflation with social security benefits being exempt 
thus every increase above inflation would have to be offset by 
corresponding cuts in other programs 
going along with the reagan proposal for an increase in spending 
of 2 percent over inflation would make it even harder for bush to 
carry out his proposal for a flexible freeze without new taxes 
while getting the federal deficit to below the 100 billion level 
required by the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
sununu said growth in revenues to the treasury in the coming year 
would help bush meet his goals 
still he conceded were going to have a very spirited and 
lively set of budget discussions with congress 
bush meanwhile spent the day in a series of staff meetings and 
news interviews and also spent some time working on his inaugural 
address according to spokeswoman sheila tate 
she said he is now working on a second draft of the speech 
shorter than the draft he had earlier in the week 
he said he wanted it under fifteen minutes ms tate said

angry israeli soldiers told 
prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday that they were being robbed 
of their civilized values because they were forced to mistreat 
palestinians 
their statements reflected growing concern in israel that the 
13month occupation of the west bank and gaza strip is having a 
brutalizing effect on the morals of israeli troops 
one after another eight reservists rose to confront shamir as he 
toured nablus and visited an army tent camp outside the west banks 
largest city which has 120000 arab residents 
the soldiers in their late 20s and early 30s said they had 
beaten innocent people to instill fear in them and enforce order 
several said they were ashamed of their actions and had difficulty 
facing friends and loved ones when they returned home 
the basic values we grew up on changed whether we like it or 
not during our service here every day children are being hurt 
said capt ronnie carmelli the chief of staff lt gen dan 
shomron said it would take time but the time is long and the price 
is high 
three palestinians died in the occupied lands tuesday raising to 
362 the number of arabs killed in the revolt 
shamir said he would take the soldiers comments into 
consideration but that protesters who threw rocks and bottles want 
to end israel military presence in nablus and israels existence as 
a state 
we hate those plo people because they make us kill arab 
children we dont want it he said 
they force us to bear arms but we must do that to survive 
sometimes you have to fight for your human valuesyou have to have 
faith you do any important job said shamir a hawk who has 
advocated tough measures for putting down the revolt 
shortly before he arrived at the encampment gunfire could be 
heard in the city which has become a major battlegroud for 
palestinian youths and israeli soldiers 
the soldiers patrol the narrow winding streets of the casbah 
nablus marketplace 
in order to enforce order in the marketplace we must be 
brutally violent to innocent people said a reservist who 
identified himself only as yotam a laborer from tiberius 
when i get up in the morning i say to myself now i have to 
go out and chase somebody and when i catch him i look at his 
hands and see he is a working man just like me 
i have to slap him or beat him with murderous blows to get 
him to fear me it wears me down as a person it breaks me these 
are not the values i grew up on 
after eight of 50 soldiers spoke shamir thanked them for being 
frank and called for patience 
the very fact that you carry out your mission and then can 
talk about your concerns shows that your values are not 
eroding he said 
when shamir told reporters he did not believe the comments 
reflected the opinions of all troops a reservist interrupted and 
shouted yes they do 
another soldier approached reporters later and said those who 
spoke out did not represent the entire unit 
shomron who escorted shamir to the tent camp appeared 
embarrassed by the attacks on shamir and excused himself in the 
middle of the meeting 
before leaving shomron told the soldiers the armys mission 
is to enable the politicians to solve the problem from a position 
of strength it is your job as military men to fulfil the 
mission regardless of your individual views and concepts

a reagan administration lawyer on tuesday 
defended the governments attempt to label some political 
documentary films propaganda when approving their taxfree 
export saying the label is informative not disparaging 
but a lawyer for independent filmmakers told a federal appeals 
court that the labeling was an informal system of censorship 
the argument before the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
involved the us information agencys latest attempt to review 
thousands of documentaries each year for their content before 
approving them as educational scientific or cultural which 
allows their taxfree export under a treaty signed by 72 nations 
the agencys first regulations which rejected films that 
advocated viewpoints or were deemed to misrepresent a governments 
policy were declared unconstitutional by the 9th circuit last year 
the current regulations would require a film to be primarily 
factual in its approach to be based on a reasonably current 
state of available information and to acknowledge the existence 
of opposing viewpoints 
they would also allow the usia to tell other countries that a 
film though approved as educational was propaganda in that it 
was designed to promote a political religious or economic 
viewpoint the foreign government could then decide whether to 
approve taxfree imports 
the regulations were challenged by the makers of six documentary 
films four on subjects that include the dangers of uranium mining 
disarmanent and agent orange were denied usia approval one on 
drug use among urban youth had been rejected under the earlier 
standards but was approved under the new standards the sixth a 
sympathetic portrayal of the 1979 nicaraguan revolution was 
approved but given a propaganda label 
us district judge wallace tashima of los angeles rejected the 
new standards last may and ordered the usia to draft a third 
contentneutral set of standards while giving provisional approval 
to the films justice department lawyer wendy keats asked a 
threejudge panel tuesday to reverse tashimas ruling 
the 1954 treaty known as the beirut agreement requires 
governments to evaluate films based on their contents ms keats 
said she said the constitution does not prohibit a 
viewpointneutral assessment of whether a film is presented in a 
factual manner or a noncoercive statement that it is propaganda 
on its face the propaganda label does not either disparage a 
film or prevent it from being circulated ms keats said 
she said the label merely encourages foreign governments to take 
a second look at a film claims of censorship are unduly 
patronizing to foreign governments she said 
but the filmmakers lawyer david cole of the center for 
constitutional rights said the label was not simply neutral 
information but an attempt to get foreign governments to deny 
taxfree import of films that should qualify under the treaty he 
said canada has already declared that it would not accept us films 
with propaganda labels 
the usia has said they dont want these films to have 
benefits cole told the court he called the labeling an 
informal system of censorship 
us government propaganda labels on some imported films were 
allowed in 1986 by the supreme court which observed that the labels 
did not prevent anyone from seeing the films but cole said the 
current case is different because the labels are intended to stop 
foreign circulation of the films

two arab american officials have been invited 
to the state department to discuss the possibility of granting a 
visa for plo chief yasser arafat to visit the united states an 
arabamerican group said tuesday 
the president of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
abdeen jabara and the chairman of its board former senator james 
abourezk were asked to meet next monday with an aide to assistant

chief 
arafat last friday accepted an invitation from abourezk to 
address the adcs annual convention on april 13 in washington the 
adc said abourezk met in tunis the plo headquarters with arafat 
as well as with the plos executive committee 
he also met with us ambassador robert h pelletreau who has 
been conducting a newly launched dialogue with the plo 
the state department and the white house said tuesday they had 
not received any applicationfrom arafat for a visa if it comes 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater we will consider it 
very carefully we wont say in advance what well do 
secretary of state george shultz rejected a visa request from 
arafat last november citing concerns about the plos involvement in 
terrorism but subsequently president reagan authorized a dialogue 
with the plo when it recognized israels right to exist and 
renounced the use of terrorism 
arafat has visited the united states only once in 1974 to 
address the united nations his visa at the time was limited to new 
york 
washingtons prestigious national press club last year extended 
an invitation to arafat to address the forum but the plo said it 
could not obtain a visa for him to come to washington

george bush labored tuesday to trim his first 
speech as president into more sermonette than sermon as the capital 
and an estimated 300000 celebrants made ready for an inauguration 
extravaganza that wont leave much else to moderation 
congress meanwhile accorded a warm reception to bushs closest 
confidant and senior cabinet appointee james a baker iii who at 
confirmation hearings pleaded for a partnership between the 
executive and legislative branches in the conduct of americas 
foreign policy 
baker sure to win approval as secretary of state said the first 
order of business should be a meeting of our minds on how to 
proceed with the soviet union the task he said is to arrange 
affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika a more 
responsible constructive foreign policy will remain in moscows 
interest 
the new soviet leadership also was on the mind of vice 
presidentelect dan quayle who told the associated press in an 
interview tuesday that mikhail gorbachev is in a much stronger 
position than many american skeptics believe hes consolidated 
power much quicker than any other soviet general secretary said 
quayle 
quayle said also that one of the things he wants most to do in 
his new role is work to change the image of the republican party as 
insensitive to the plight of minorities and the poor he said he 
intends to travel to innercity neighborhoods and hear them out 
to get a feel a sensitivity about their problems 
elsewhere in the capital thousands of performers from hollywood 
heartthrobs to highschool majorettes rehearsed for scores of 
inaugural events the first will be a twilight pageant and fireworks

15 minutes or less said spokeswoman sheila tate 
the speech was drafted by peggy noonan the principal author of 
bushs republican convention acceptance speech last summer and a 
contributor to president reagans nationally broadcast farewell last 
week 
bush sent her back to the drawing boards on monday and was 
working with her again tuesday to tighten it ms tate said 
bush could do worse than aim for brevity when he mounts the 
capitols west portico friday to take his oath beneath the winter 
skies one president william henry harrison droned on in an icy 
downpour for nearly two hours caught pneumonia and died 
george washington delivered the briefest inaugural address after

federal investigators are exploring whether harvard 
and the university of california at los angeles use illegal quotas 
to restrict the number of asianamerican students they admit an 
official said tuesday 
the us department of education has been collecting and 
analyzing statistical information on admissions at the two schools 
since last fall said department spokesman mahlon g anderson 
he declined to say what sparked the probe no conclusions have 
been reached he said 
both harvard and ucla deny using quotas for any ethnic groups 
and both schools point to a significant rise in enrollment of 
asianamerican students 
at ucla asianamericans make up 229 percent of the freshman 
class up from 178 percent in 1980 at harvard the number of 
asianamerican freshmen roughly tripled over the past decade from 
48 percent in 1978 to 142 percent this year 
by comparison the us population is only about 2 percent asian 
however education department officials say asianamericans tend to 
be high academic achievers and have been applying to top colleges 
and universities in rising numbers 
the real issue is not whether the number of asian students is 
going up but what percentage of qualified applicants is being 
accepted said frederick h dow director of the asianamerican 
resource workshop a nonprofit educational group in boston 
harvard for example acknowledged last year that over the past 
decade it had admitted an average of 17 percent of all white 
applicants but 133 percent of asians applicants 
anderson said the education department will review the data and 
send investigators to question officials on both campuses probably 
before the end of the current school year 
statistics alone dont always tell the story he said 
when you talk to admissions officers you understand there may be 
nondiscriminatory policies that are driving the data and creating 
certain patterns 
william fitzsimmons harvards director of admissions said 
asians tend to be slightly stronger than whites on academic criteria 
and slightly weaker on extracurricular activities which can count 
against them because harvard seeks students with diverse talents 
such as music art and leadership 
in addition he said relatively few asians in the applicant pool 
are children of alumni or prospective varsity athletes when all 
those factors are taken into account the difference in admission 
rates for the two groups disappears he said 
eva lum a harvard senior and copresident of the asianamerican 
association on campus said harvard has had asian students working 
in the admissions office to recruit asianamericans especially from 
lowincome families for four years 
it would be counterproductive to do that and impose quotas at 
the same time she said 
ucla stopped qualifying asianamericans for affirmative action 
when it became clear that they were overrepresented not 
underrepresented in proportion to population said thomas lifka an 
assistant vice chancellor responsible for admissions 
lifka said 35 percent of asian applicants were admitted in 1988 
compared with 32 percent of whites 
we are convinced that if the department of education looks at 
the data carefully they will conclude that there is no 
discrimination 
if the department determines a college or university 
discriminates on the basis of race or ethnicity it can block 
federal grants and guaranteed student loans which amount to hundreds 
of millions of dollars for major schools 
but anderson said the schools are first given an opportunity to 
change their disputed practices and most do so

linda marchiano known as linda lovelace 
when she appeared in deep throat and other hardcore sex films 
is supporting a local antipornography law facing a federal 
challenge 
marchiano has claimed in her book ordeal that she suffered 2 
years of physical sexual and mental abuse while being coerced into 
performing sex acts and appearing in sex films 
the bellingham law that ms marchiano supports says pornography 
violates the civil rights of women when it portrays them as 
dehumanized sexual objects it differs from many antipornography 
statutes in that it sets up civil remedies instead of criminal 
penalties 
the law is being challenged by a local bookstore three 
bellingham residents and others who argue that it is vaguely written 
and would have an overly broad impact on work protected by the first 
amendment 
in a jan 6 affidavit ms marchiano said she wants to file a 
lawsuit in whatcom county seeking damages and an injunction against 
any showing of her films there 
every time someone watches those films they are watching me 
being raped ms marchianos affidavit said every time i am 
recognized from those films i am violated again 
in the hope of preserving her chance to file a lawsuit in 
bellingham ms marchiano a new york state resident is asking us 
district judge carolyn dimmick to let her join the defendants in the 
federal court lawsuit

the sale of a california hightechnology 
company to a west german chemical firm is being reviewed by a 
government task force in the first test of a new law that allows the 
president to block foreign purchases of american companies on 
national security grounds 
the case involves the proposed sale of monsanto electronic 
materials of palo alto calif to huels ag of west germany 
the american company an operating division of the giant monsanto 
chemical company headquartered in st louis produces silicon 
wafers the flat discs used to make computer chips 
silicon wafers are the building blocks for the semiconductor 
industry a sector of the us economy considered vital not only for 
national security reasons but also for trade reasons americas edge 
in the battle with foreign competitors has centered in such 
hightechnology fields as computer manufacturing 
the proposed sale to the west german company was reviewed in a 
closeddoor meeting on tuesday by the committee on foreign 
investment the committee is composed of officials from eight 
government agencies and is headed by david c mulford an assistant 
treasury secretary 
the panel has until next monday to forward a recommendation to 
the president it is expected the proposed sale will be one of the 
first trade issues that presidentelect bush will have to face 
originally the commerce department and the defense department 
raised questions about the proposed sale however an attorney 
representing monsanto said tuesday he believes the original 
objections had been dealt with 
we have met with government officials on numerous occasions 
we answered all of the questions and repeat questions said 
washington lawyer joseph f dennin 
earle h harbison jr the president of monsanto and carl 
krauch the chairman of huels a subsidiary of the giant west german 
conglomerate veba ag both met with officials from various agencies 
on tuesday 
there is no credible evidence that huels an exemplary company 
from a nato ally would so something that would injure the national 
security of the united states dennin said 
officials at the commerce department said no announcement of the 
panels recommendation would be released before it was reviewed by 
the president who has 15 days under the law to reach a decision on 
the panels findings 
the review of foreign takeovers of us companies on national 
security grounds was included in the giant omnibus trade act of 
1988 congress had become concerned that the wave of foreign 
purchases of us companies could be endangering national security 
three other us producers of silicon wafers have been sold to 
japanese firms in the past four years and the sale of another us 
silicon wafer supplier the wafer division of cincinnati milacron

in a small apartment about a mile from 
communist party headquarters in warsaw two excited solidarity 
activists tuned into the latest tv reports of a party meeting they 
believed would result in a decision to legalize the banned labor 
federation 
rarely have the long speeches at a central committee plenum 
commanded such close attention from solidarity which for seven 
years has tried the partys patience by refusing to abandon the 
fight for legal existence 
are they registering solidarity yet yelled jan litynski 
spokesman for the warsaw region of solidarity to former underground 
solidarity leader zbigniew bujak 
bujak had just flipped on the television switch in another room 
on the first day of the party debate on the future of solidarity he 
did not reply 
the answer was not immediately forthcoming as party members 
heatedly debated for hours on monday and tuesday over a move to 
legalize solidarity 
the party had reason to be nervous in 198081 during 
solidaritys legal existence an estimated 1 million party members 
joined the independent union movement thousands more turned in 
their party cards in disgust when polands leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski imposed martial law on dec 13 1981 
but on tuesday prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski urged the 
party to legalize the banned union on condition that it be a 
partner not an opponent that would pull the country into 
anarchy 
rakowski had vigorously defended the martial law decision in the 
early 1980s 
the reversal in policy arises from the partys failure to 
eradicate solidarity after the martial law crackdown and reflects 
the authorities need to gain support from society to push through a 
program of radical economic reform 
they party leaders are doing this because they realize they 
have to and it was obvious they had to said litynski a veteran 
opposition activist who advised striking miners during polands 
worst labor unrest in seven years last august 
although the shift in the partys attitude is welcome some 
solidarity activists believe the union must proceed with caution 
because the change results from necessity rather than good will 
the authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on 
top lets wait and see what they have to say and read the fine 
print carefully said maciej jankowski a solidarity leader at 
warsaw university 
solidarity activists do not foresee a return to the heady days of 
198081 when union work was a roundtheclock passion for many but 
they acknowledge that a return of legal existence would change their 
lives 
it would be a real tragedy for my family i dont have any 
children now and i wont have time for that with all my union 
activities said bujak who first drew national attention when he 
became leader of solidaritys warsaw region in 1980 at the age of 26 
litynski who has long dreamed of visiting the united states 
believes he may have to postpone any visit if solidarity is 
legalized 
for jankowski regulation of the labor federations status means 
he would be able to focus on solving other problems 
jankowski spent tuesday afternoon taking part in a rally at 
warsaw university in support of legalizing the independent students 
union and solidarity 
while solidarity is eager to resume its activities legally that 
status poses challenges to union leaders such as how to organize the 
labor federation and how to achieve economic reform 
but a return to legal existence would mean that many could 
finally emerge from the shadows of underground publishing and from 
church basement meetings into a more normal way of participating in 
public life

carolina resident who was on parole for two bank robbery convictions 
in that state in 1976 and had moved to hackensack in october

greensboro nc man he was taken into custody but no charges had 
been filed by late tuesday

identities gallagher said 
the trooper was not injured in the scuffle gallagher said

and promised massive retaliation if libya uses chemical weapons on 
israel

the united states has charged that west german companies helped 
libya build a chemical weapons factory south of tripoli libya 
maintains the plant will make pharmaceuticals 
foreign minister moshe arens also said he planned to confront the 
bonn government about the west german companies suspected 
connection to the libyan plant 
arens told israel radio the fact that germany has been 
involved on such a large scale in supplying equipment to be used 
to establish a chemical weapons capability in libya a country that 
insists it is at war with israel is an abhorrent thing to us 
we will do everything we can to put an end to it 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would use every means 
to defend itself against libya which he described as one of the 
jewish states most dangerous enemies 
whoever would dare to use this kind of weapon against israeli

cardinal john oconnor acting as a police 
intermediary appealed tuesday for the surrender of a rapist who has 
attacked seven women in the subway 
police commissioner benjamin ward said oconnor was asked to make 
the public appeal after police received two calls to the 911 
emergency line from a man who identified himself as the subway 
rapist the man said he would surrender if a personal appeal from 
oconnor was televised 
please please not only stop what you are doing but for your 
protection and for the protection of possible victims please turn 
yourself in to the police authorities oconnor said as reporters 
and television cameras recorded his words at a hastily called news 
conference 
oconnor promised the suspect would not be mistreated you have 
my word given me by them that you will be treated properly and 
given complete justice in every respect 
ward said the caller admitted he was a crack addict 
he is apparently a very troubled person he said he is sorry 
for what he did and he said he feels that he is getting a little bit 
out of control ward said 
ward said he was convinced the calls which came in monday at 
1245 pm and tuesday at 10 am were legitimate 
last february a man claiming to be the bomber of an abortion 
clinic made a request for a tv appeal from oconnor after 
oconnors appeal dennis malvasi surrendered and pleaded guilty to 
dynamiting a clinic and planting a bomb that was defused before it 
exploded at another he was sentenced to seven years in prison 
clearly there is hope that this may be a similar situation 
oconnor said 
the suspect now being sought by police is accused of raping or 
sodomizing four women and attempting to sexually assault three 
others over the past five months 
in each case the man forced a woman either off a train or a 
subway platform at gunpoint or knifepoint and into the subway 
tunnel where the attacks occurred

accords were signed by 35 countries the united states canada and

prague spring liberalization 
in leipzig on sunday east german police arrested scores of human 
rights demonstrators 
shultz departed from his prepared text tuesday to declare the 
police actions in glaring contradiction to the solemn 
international commitments just made in vienna by those governments 
romania told delegates to the review conference sunday before 
adoption of the final statement on human rights and security it 
would not honor provisions on greater religious freedom and 
emigration 
shultz did not raise that issue specifically but criticized 
romania for increasing repression and shortages of food heat and 
power endured by its 23 million citizens 
in romania the economic and social conditions as well as the 
political and civil rights of all citizens are being eroded at a 
discouraging rate he said and in both romania and bulgaria 
minorities have been particularly hard hit by government policies of 
recent years 
he praised the soviet union for a nineyear high in jewish 
emigration and release of more than 600 prisoners of conscience but 
noted that others continue to suffer repression or remain unjustly 
imprisoned for acting upon their human rights 
we cannot forget them he said 
both the kremlin and the west have praised the agreement which 
provides for new negotiations on reducing conventional military 
forces formation of groups to monitor compliance with human rights 
agreements and for greater freedom of travel emigration and 
information 
announcements that the soviets will begin a unilateral withdrawal 
of 50000 troops from eastern europe in april strengthened hopes 
that the talks set for march in vienna will lead to reducted 
conventional forces on the continent 
shultz said however we have a long way to go yet to achieve 
real peace in europe 
at a news conference the secretary called the berlin wall an 
inhumane structure symbolizing the repression of the soviet bloc 
and said it should be torn down 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe in another tough speech 
focused on human rights also called for destruction of the cold 
war anachronism built by the soviets and east germans in 1961 
it is the most public symbol of the divide between freedom on 
one side and its denial on the other howe said the berlin wall 
mocks all our work to remove barriers to contact and understanding 
howe also spoke of britains agreement in vienna to attend a 
human rights conference in moscow in 1991 which the soviets have 
sought for some time 
but in london prime minister margaret thatcher deplored the 
violent breakup of czech demonstrations and threatened to boycott 
the conference unless the soviets make sustained progress on human 
rights 
mrs thatcher told parliament many britons were somewhat 
dismayed by television scenes showing peaceful demonstrations 
being forcibly broken up 
i think it fully justifies the approach that we took on the 
human rights conference in moscow that we would not go unless 
certain strict criteria were met she said 
the womens campaign for soviet jewry a british group opposed to 
the moscow conference heckled ministers as they arrived for 
tuesdays meeting 
you sold out soviet jews too cheaply joyce simpson and 
elizabeth philips shouted as shultz arrived 
howe said britain would continue monitoring the soviet human 
rights record and would attend the conference only if reform was 
translated into soviet law and britain is convinced that soviet 
commitment to change is genuine and irreversible 
foreign minister alois mock of austria spoke out against 
repression in the east bloc as did thorvald stoltenberg of norway 
hans van den broek of the netherlands and others 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union was 
to arrive in vienna on wednesday and speak thursday

local fishermen 
threatened to confront a large french trawler on the high seas 
tuesday in a bitter dispute over fishing rights around this french 
territory off canadas atlantic coast 
yvon dodeman president of the fishermens union told reporters 
a trawler from st pierre and miquelon was called into port to 
prepare for action against the factory freezer trawler grand hermine 
the 6000 people living on this rocky archipelago 10 miles south 
of newfoundland rely almost entirely on fishing for their 
livelihood with cod the main catch a compromise last fall allowed 
one factory ship from france to fish in the zone but the arrival of 
two touched off tensions once again 
the fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish and 
dont provide any employment at the territorys fish processing 
plants 
michel auzou captain of the grand hermine said his ship as well 
as the other trawler the coma peche will not move out of the 
fishing zone around the islands known as 3ps unless they are forced 
to 
for a week now weve been insulted and attacked we never once 
answered back the captain said in an interview with french radio 
its over now weve been humble for too long he said 
were not leaving the zone now the decision has been taken on 
both trawlers 
he pointed out that french fishermen have been operating in the 
area for centuries 
earlier in the day st pierre mayor albert penn said paris 
officials agreed to move the grand hermine out of the zone so talks 
could begin between french premier michel rocard and a delegation 
from the islands 
there was no immediate comment from the paris government 
the union will take action if the trawler doesnt follow the 
governments instructions said dodeman they will prepare the 
boat to go against the grand hermine on the 3ps 
dodeman said it will take about six hours for the local trawler 
croix de lorraine to reach st pierres harbor 
he would not say what action the fishermen had in mind in recent 
weeks some fishermen have threatened to ram the large factory 
freezer trawler or shoot the radar equipment on its bridge 
on sunday fishermen blocked planes carrying 60 french police 
reinforcements from landing 
more than 1000 people turned out monday night for a public 
meeting and voted to accept the french governments offer for talks 
in paris about fishing rights in the region 
penn who is also the territorys senator to frances senate 
said a delegation would go to paris on condition the french 
government agrees to tie up one of the two trawlers at st pierre 
harbor 
penn said the paris government agreed tuesday that a french naval 
tug anchored off st pierre will carry a local observer and stay 
with the trawler grand hermine to monitor it 
in st johns newfoundland the two french military planes that 
had tried to bring in police reinforcements to st pierre and 
miquelon on sunday flew out tuesday morning their flight plans were 
filed to paris 
st pierre residents some armed with rifles surrounded one 
plane that landed sunday but allowed it to take off after four 
hours the second plane circled overhead before also flying to st 
johns 
canada and france have a longstanding dispute over fishing quotas 
and the islands international boundary canada long has complained 
of french overfishing 
canada and france disagree over the international boundary of the 
islands and quotas for fish in nearby waters france claims a 
200mile economic zone but canada recognizes only a 12mile limit 
around the islands

the soviet union has agreed to foreign 
currency exchange with some east bloc allies and may lower its 
domestic exchange rates as a prelude to full convertibility in world 
markets an official said tuesday 
the deputy chairman of state bank of the ussr va pekshev 
told a unsponsored conference on ussoviet trade that soviet 
officials acknowledge the need for full convertibility of the ruble 
but must proceed slowly 
by jan 1 1990 we would make a 100 percent increase in the 
ratio of the official domestic exchange rate pekshev said in 
effect doubling the amount of rubles exchanged for other currencies 
is this a currency devaluation he said we wont get into 
theoretical arguments on this question 
the soviet union has several sets of exchange rates for domestic 
and foreign products and it was not known how the proposed increase 
would affect the rates black market exchange rates are often six to 
seven times higher than the official rates 
more than 100 americans and soviets including us and soviet 
envoys to the world body began the twoday meeting tuesday the 
first such conference held under un auspices 
us and soviet speakers focused mainly on soviet economic 
reforms and repeatedly expressed optimism about improving relations 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
perestroika or restructuring has led to an explosion of 
cooperative business ventures and the relaxation of some 
restrictions on foreign trade 
but ventures have been stifled by the inconvertibility of the 
ruble in foreign exchange markets and by the need to operate through 
the soviet state bank which takes as much as 60 percent of hard 
currency earnings from each transaction 
western media have reported the possibility of changes in the 
official rate which currently brings about 160 per ruble one 
soviet official has said convertibility could result in a 10fold 
devaluation in the ruble 
pekshev dismissed the 10fold figure as speculative and said 
officials were considering ways to move to full convertibility 
stage by stage 
were not in a position today to assert a new value of the 
ruble to the dollar he said 
he said soviets have agreed to partial convertibility with 
several east european countries and were planning hard currency 
auctions for soviet and east bloc enterprises to buy the foreign 
currency needed for trade with the west foreign businesses 
initially will not be allowed to participate he said 
the conference is scheduled to end wednesday afternoon two days 
before presidentelect george bushs inauguration bush aides have 
said they are planning a wideranging review of us policy toward 
the soviet union before deciding on a new agenda for relations under 
bush 
exports to the united states jumped from 214 million in 1982 to 
446 million the next year and were projected to dip slightly to 
445 million in 1987 according to us figures us exports to the 
soviet union decreased from 34 billion in 1984 to a projected 13 
billion in 1987 
another statement said the us state department had agreed to 
extend visas for soviets wishing to continue meeting with american 
corporations after the conference ends 
among the usbased participants in the meeting were duco 
akkerman vice president of dow chemical europe sa wilhelm 
braxmaier vice president of eastern european motorola inc fe 
cassidy director of international development for the u s oil 
company tenneco inc and harvard university economist john kenneth 
galbraith 
soviet officials also included the deputy minister of external 
economic relations and head of the soviet delegation yn chumakov 
deputy oil minister li filimonov viktor ponomarev the soviet 
trade representative and soviet un ambassador alexander belonogov

an attorney for john hull an 
american charged with drug and weapons trafficking said she will 
ask the judge in the case to move proceedings to hulls hometown in 
northern costa rica 
hull who has been linked to an illegal armssupply network 
aiding the nicaraguan rebels was arrested at his ranch last 
thursday officials said he also was being investigated on charges 
of spying for the usbacked rebels known as contras 
attorney elda zuniga said hull who suffers from diabetes became 
ill on monday and was sent to the infirmary at the san sebastian 
jail where he is being held the jail is in san jose the capital 
hulls condition improved and he was back in his cell tuesday 
ms zuniga said she did not say why hull became ill 
ms zuniga said she will ask judge leovigildo rodriguez of the 
4th federal district court to order the proceedings moved to san 
carlos about 105 miles north of san jose hulls ranch is in nearby 
los chiles 
the judge will decide on the request during an open hearing 
scheduled for friday ms zuniga said 
the office of judicial investigations acted after residents near 
hulls ranch denounced activities by hull that they believed could 
endanger relations with costa rica and nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government an official with the office said 
the attorney generals office formally charged hull on friday

rica for 20 years ms zuniga said he became a naturalized costa 
rican citizen eight years ago when he moved to los chiles

the contras have said hulls ranch was a way station for gun

the justice department concluded tuesday that 
former attorney general edwin meese iii violated federal ethics 
standards five times in six years and that his relationship with e 
robert wallach dictated government action in major cases 
meeses assistance to scandalplagued wedtech corp and his 
efforts on behalf of a proposed mideast oil pipeline involved 
three instances in which friendship between him and wallach 
caused federal actions said the report by the departments office 
of professional responsibility 
wallach who collected 13 million from wedtech from 1982 to 
1986 is awaiting trial in new york on racketeering and other 
charges he is accused of peddling his meese connection 
as a direct result of the preferential improper efforts of 
meese and his staff the army awarded a 32 million 
enginebuilding contract to wedtech in 1982 while meese was 
counselor to president reagan said the ethics report on meese 
meese also violated ethics requirements the report said by 
failing to report a stock sale on his 1985 federal tax return and by 
participating in a justice department decision favoring the regional 
bell telephone companies in which he held 14000 in stock at the 
time 
if meese were still attorney general we would recommend to 
the next ranking department official that the president take 
disciplinary action the report concluded 
a department statement said no further action against meese is 
warranted because he is no longer a government employee 
independent counsel james mckay decided last summer not to 
prosecute meese although mckay concluded meese had probably twice 
violated conflictofinterest laws in connection with his bell 
holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to 
report the stock sales 
mckays report far from vindicates mr meese said the new 
justice department report it details conduct which should not be 
tolerated of any government employee especially not the attorney 
general of the united states 
attorney general dick thornburgh disagreed with one aspect of the 
report saying that meeses failure to dispose of his financial 
interest in the regional bell companies resulted from a failure to 
get adequate legal advice rather than from intent to violate ethics 
standards 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
reagan believes this report was unnecessary partly because mr 
meese has not been in the office for some time and partly because it 
was unwarranted 
fitzwater said reagan believes his longtime friend did nothing 
wrong 
the former attorney general who resigned last year immediately 
attacked the report through his attorneys who called it a 
travesty of justice meese spokesman patrick korten said there is 
an emotional undertone to the report that seems designed to 
slam him personally 
at a news conference thornburgh declined to defend his 
departments office of professional responsibility from criticism by 
meeses supporters that the report was a personal attack on meese 
i think mr meese is entitled to some peace said thornburgh 
thornburgh tried to avoid characterizing the opr report in any 
way but ultimately called one of its conclusions clearly wrong 
and said there is an adequate factual basis for the others 
thornburgh disagreed with the conclusion meese violated ethical 
standards when he failed to sell 14000 in stock of regional bell 
companies while participating in department decisions affecting them 
he said there is an adequate factual basis for finding in 
four instances that meese violated ethics standards 
but thornburgh said that in regard to the bell stock meese 
either didnt get adequate legal advice or didnt follow it 
thornburgh characterized that as a mistake saying ive done that 
myself sometimes people make mistakes were all human 
thornburgh emphasized that the findings in the report were those 
of opr not of the attorney general 
meese according to the report violated ethical standards which 
require government employees to avoid the appearance of impropriety 
when carrying out official duties 
but korten said such a requirement is a lousy standard he 
said appearance is a subjective matter it is not an objective 
measure what appears improper to one person may look ok to 
another 
he had a close personal relationship with mr wallach said 
korten i dont see why you can begrudge somebody of those 
friendships 
the report notes at least 600 contacts between meese and wallach 
beginning in 1981 it says that wallach a san francisco personal 
injury lawyer showered meese with letters and memos on topics 
ranging from a diet program for the stocky presidential 
counselor to business arrangements while meeting with meese in some 
cases twice a day 
many of the memos coming in a virtual torrent while meese 
was counselor to the president contain a strong undercurrent in 
which wallach was seeking action from meese and his staff in 
matters in which he had a financial interest said the report 
it said the letters and memos from wallach either confirm a close 
personal relationship or reveal a level of presumptuousness on the 
part of mr wallach which exceeded that which one would think 
humanly possible 
wallach suggested in one letter moving united nations ambassador 
jeane kirkpatrick to a new job with wallach becoming her 
replacement he also sent meese a proprosed draft for reagans 1983 
state of the union address and suggested in another memo a way to 
increase meeses power he recommended moving thenwhite house chief 
of staff james a baker iii to the cia and assigning thencia 
director william casey to the national security council 
in addition to the case in which the army awarded a huge contract 
to wedtech the report said meese and his staff injected 
themselves as a direct result of the friendship between wallach 
and meese into a financial problem wedtech was having with the 
commerce departments economic development administration 
meeses intervention including a phone call to thencommerce 
secretary malcolm baldridge was precisely the type of activity 
prohibited by a federal executive order spelling out ethical 
standards for federal employees the report said 
on the oil pipeline meese again at wallachs urging arranged a 
meeting in 1985 for wallach and his client swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport with thenwhite house national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that 
would support the project the report said 
george walker a lawyer for wallach said wallach simply asked 
meese to ensure that wedtech was being treated fairly on the wedtech 
engine contract and that meese didnt participate in resolving 
the problem surrounding wedtech and the commerce department walker 
said meese had little involvement in the pipeline project 
walker said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between 
wallach and meese that wallach put all this in writing we know 
theres nothing wrong emphasizing the report is old news

about 150 poor people their problems 
multiplied by the national economic crisis tuesday looted a red 
cross warehouse of food and clothing intended for victims of 
hurricane joan red cross officials said 
managua red cross director omar cruz said the group broke into 
the warehouse through the roof he said he did not have an estimate 
on the value of items taken 
a police official said on condition of anonymity there were no 
arrests because we had limited forces there and it was impossible 
for more people to climb up on the warehouse 
an ap photogapher who happened to pass the warehouse during the 
looting reported seeing people carrying away armfuls of canned food 
and clothing 
hurricane joan slammed into the atlantic coast on oct 21 
killing about 100 people and leaving an estimated 200000 homeless 
property damage was estimated at more than 700 million 
few in the capital were affected but many of the thousands who 
suffered property damages in nicaraguas rural areas since have 
moved to managua 
the sandinista government says the hurricane worsened the 
countrys economic crisis it also has blamed the crisis on eight 
years of civil war with the ussupported antisandinista rebels 
known as the contras 
at the mercado oriental in the citys east section it is common 
to see dozens of people rummaging through trash cans for food 
national inflation last year topped 20000 percent and the 
government announced numerous devaluations of the official currency 
the cordoba to keep the countrys economy afloat 
on jan 3 the government devalued the cordoba again this time 
by 120 percent it raised gasoline prices by 125 percent and bus 
fares 50fold 
the government also announced a spending reduction program that 
would lay off thousands of public workers cut defense spending by 
27 percent and slash police services 40 percent 
the government has not authorized salary increases although 
prices on many basic goods have risen as much as 50 percent since

a civilian court has charged two national 
police officers with murdering three family members in a 1986 raid 
on the suburban home of a popular leftist folk singer 
the appeals court of southern santiago indicted lt sergio 
gajardo and sgt jose luna on homicide charges monday in connection 
with the midnight raid on june 30 1986 santiago newspapers 
reported tuesday police lt col augusto sobarzo was charged with 
covering up the crime 
shot dead were the wife sisterinlaw and 16yearold son of 
benedicto salinas whose songs attack the rightwing military 
government of president augusto pinochet 
police first said the three committed suicide to avoid arrest 
they said they raided the house after being tipped off that it was a 
clandestine medical clinic for a leftist urban guerrilla group the 
manuel rodriguez patriotic front 
human rights and dissident groups maintained the three were 
gunned down 
the appeals court ruling said information gathered by 
investigators indicates the deaths of the three victims were 
caused by third parties the newspapers reported and that gajardo 
and luna appear to be the authors of the crime 
the ruling reversed a judges decision not to pursue charges in 
the case the officers were expected to appeal 
human rights groups say killings in political raids by police 
have occurred repeatedly during pinochets 15year rule officers 
have been indicted or tried in only a handful of cases and

genesis music and miracles a retelling of 
five medieval mystery plays is not very musical and more mundane 
than miraculous 
this old testament song and dance which opened tuesday 
offbroadway at the new york shakespeare festival public theater 
sounds like it was spawned in the late 1960s the production has the 
earnestness but not the conviction of street theater the relentless 
beat but not the soaring melodies of such pop musicals as 
godspell and jesus christ superstar and the simplicity but 
not the charm of story theater 
five episodes are told in a quick 95 minutes the creation and 
the fall of lucifer the creation and fall of adam and eve the 
murder of abel noah and the flood and the story of abraham and 
isaac 
the results are painless and occasionally pleasant but nothing 
more the stories adapted by aj antoon and robert montgomery 
unfold in rhymes many of them awkward and forced the tales are so 
well known that they need a little passion humor and inventiveness 
to make them fly they dont get that here 
the best moments come in the story of noah and these are 
supplied by set designer john conklin who has given the actors 
boards and planks with which to construct a pretty spiffy ark the 
designer also supplies some toy animals wooden figures that are 
carried onto the boat by the actors 
for a musical the sparse score which has music by michael ward 
and lyrics by antoon and montgomery is surprisingly wispy sort of 
like the lesser love themes from the biblical movies of cecil b de 
mille 
still the large cast remains undefeated by the material 
particularly fine is stephen bogardus who plays the pivotal roles of 
adam noah and abraham bogardus has a booming musical comedy voice 
and is a fine actor if broadway had more than two or three musicals 
a year he always would find work mary mungers eve is sympathetic 
and forthright but shes also saddled with some of the worst lines 
as noahs shrewish wife 
in one novel bit of interpretation david patrick kelly plays 
cain almost like a psychotic street tough his murder of the 
passive almost nondescript abel is brutal unnerving and hard to 
watch 
the redhaired russ thacker makes a persuasive lucifer a 
grinning boyish sprite with a ghoulish smile special mention also 
should be made of young braden danner who sings in a clear crisp 
style and turns abrahams son isaac into a credible character and 
not just the plot device he usually is 
the choreography by lynne taylorcorbett doesnt get past minimal 
and is given mostly to two dancing doubles for adam and eve 
conklin also designed the costumes and they include what may be 
a first for the supposedly naked first couple anatomically 
correct fleshcolored body stockings a very strange coverup 
except for those inventive glad rags genesis music and 
miracles offers very little that is surprising or memorable once 
the house lights have gone back up

communist party leaders adopted a 
resolution on trade union pluralism early wednesday after a 17hour 
debate state radio reported in a move that could open the way for 
legalizing solidarity 
earlier the central committee was urged to offer legalization to 
the banned independent union movement if it declares itself part of 
socialism and refrains from opposing the government 
but the proposal presented to the committee by prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski had so many conditions it appeared unlikely 
the union federation banned since 1982 would accept it 
rakowski said solidarity also would have to observe a twoyear 
strike moratorium and give up financial aid from the west amounting 
to millions of dollars 
the meeting of the 230member committee began at 10 am tuesday 
a commentator on state television said the debate proved long 
sharp and very hot 
state radio reported at 3 am wednesday 9 pm est tuesday 
that the session just ended and the committee adopted stances 
concerning political and trade union pluralism no immediate details 
of the resolutions passed were available 
the official pap news agency said a package of proposals on 
reforming the party passed unanimously and the leaderships stand 
on trade union and political pluralism was approved by a majority 
it did not elaborate 
solidarity leader lech walesa and other spokesmen for the union 
movement declined official comment on rakowskis proposal and were 
not immediately available for their reaction on the committees 
decision 
but a solidarity source in warsaw said on condition of anonymity 
that rakowskis offer at first glance appeared unclear and the 
conditions he set unacceptable or even laughable 
he cited specifically the requirement that solidarity declare 
itself to be socialist and that it refrain from all strikes he said 
solidarity must be able to function as a free trade union movement 
walesa had demanded the authorities agree to recognize the labor 
movement before he talks with them on polands future he warned 
that social moods were becoming explosive because of rising prices 
and shortages in stores 
a strike demanding higher pay and legalization of solidarity 
meanwhile closed the 1100worker pabianice fabric works in the 
central city of lodz the strike was confirmed by the solidarity 
information service in warsaw and by pap 
state news media noted that the deliberations were strained 
party secretary leszek miller was quoted as saying a 
fullblooded verbal duel was going on between rakowski and 
official unions chief alfred miodowicz both men are on the ruling 
politburo 
it was very hot miller told a tv interviewer 
the discussion marked a key moment for the party and solidarity 
as communist leaders struggled to decide whether to risk repeating 
the experiment of 1980 that permitted the east blocs first legal 
independent union movement 
rakowski addressed specific questions to solidarity he said the 
answers would determine if the union could be seen as a partner 
thereby opening the process of legalization or as a political 
opponent with whom one has to carry constant political struggle 
the questions included whether the union would see itself as an 
integral part of socialism and whether it intends to act as a 
trade union or as a political movement or party 
he also asked what position solidarity would have toward 
anticommunist polish groups and whether it would be a foreign 
agent by continuing to accept money from the us congress and 
other foreign organizations 
i am putting all these problems in an unambiguous way because i 
aim at avoiding any kind of ambiguity the problems are too serious 
to allow ambiguities rakowski said 
he said the legalization process should be preceded by signing of 
a detailed social accord among trade unions political parties 
and various clubs and associations 
the agreement could include provisions detailing planned social 
and economic reforms and establishing a civic body to settle 
disputes among the signatories he said 
rakowski said the economy would be the most important factor for 
poland in the coming years 
it above all needs order and peace he said even the best 
administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the 
economy becomes a field of political struggles 
after a 16month period of freedom for millions of solidarity 
supporters the union was suspended in a 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
and later banned 
but the results have proved disappointing for polands leaders 
the economy has stagnated foreign creditors have been 
unsympathetic and reforms have been hamstrung by the refusal of 
many workers to participate as long as solidarity is illegal 
zygmunt czarzasty a new party secretary took the floor to begin 
the second day of the debate and said he endorsed the politburo 
stand on union pluralism backing allowing more than one legal union 
such pluralism is a social necessity czarzasty said 
bogdan kolomyjski the manager of the huge katowice steel mill 
warned that competing unions threaten anarchy and divided work 
crews 
other speakers opposed allowing unions other than the 
governmentsponsored opzz alliance 
the us government has granted solidarity 1 million a year for 
the last two years but polish authorities have held up spending of 
half of this 
total us aid to solidarity was estimated last year at 5 
million by the new york times 
solidarity does not deny getting foreign help walesa said he 
would take money from the kremlin if he could use it to defend trade 
union freedoms

police said tuesday they have 
identified the baggage container in which a bomb was planted aboard 
pan am flight 103 and the times of london said authorities believe 
it was first loaded in frankfurt 
the jetliner blew up over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing 
all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground 
we have now identified the baggage container within the 
aircraft in which the explosive device was placed and substantial 
forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this 
regard detective chief superintendent john orr the scottish 
detective heading the investigation told a news conference 
orr refused to comment on whether the bomb was put on the plane 
in frankfurt or london or on who police suspect planted it 
but early copies of wednesdays edition of the times available 
tuesday night reported no details of the container what else it 
held where it was discovered or where it originated were given 
officially but police and accident investigators are now convinced 
that it was in luggage first loaded at frankfurt 
new yorkbound flight 103 originated in that west german city 
transferring passengers and baggage to another plane on arrival at 
londons heathrow airport 
the times said police think the bomb was no more than a few 
pounds of czechoslovakmade semtex explosive 
it said they think once a hole was blown in the side of the 
boeing 747 and the electronics bay the planes nerve center was 
destroyed the air pressure at 31000 feet ripped the aircraft apart 
investigators say the explosion occurred in the cargo area just 
in front of the lefthand wing 
orr said about 10000 items from the plane were recovered in 
searches across scotland 
the transport department said on dec 28 that investigators found 
evidence of a bomb in the framework of a metal luggage pallet the 
rack on which baggage is secured 
orr said scottish police are working with police in the united 
states and west germany he mentioned investigations in scandinavia 
but would not elaborate 
this investigation is widening on an international scale and 
over 3000 witness statements have been collated he said 
he was asked about a report in glasgows sunday post newspaper 
quoting former israeli intelligence official raphael eitan as saying 
he was sure the may 15 palestinian group was responsible 
there has been a lot of comment some illinformed and i do 
not think it would be helpful to identify any group orr said 
transport minister paul channon has said the bomb probably 
contained semtex a powerful and hardtodetect plastic explosive 
made in czechoslovakia 
orr agreed the explosive was a plastic of a hightechnology 
type but would not confirm it was semtex 
special agent harold hendershot of the federal bureau of 
investigation and helge tepp of west german police also attended the 
news conference 
hendershot said he was happy with the investigations progress 
tepp noted that only the prosecutor heading the inquiry in 
frankfurt was authorized to give information on the progress of 
inquiries there 
in helsinki finland yasser arafat said tuesday his palestine 
liberation organization is aiding the investigation he did not 
elaborate 
malcolm rifkind secretary for scotland said tuesday the 
government will meet all costs in lockerbie where 10 homes were 
destroyed and 30 badly damaged in the crash 
he said in a letter to local legislator sir hector monro that the 
cost of policing emergency services and social work will be 12 
million besides 177 million already pledged for new homes and a 
fund for those who lost relatives

a high school cannot allow students to hold 
regular religious meetings in a classroom shortly before the school 
day starts a federal appeals court ruled tuesday 
the ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals in a case 
from renton wash has implications for the equal access act a 
1984 federal law that requires public secondary schools to allow 
religious clubs to meet at school on the same basis as other 
extracurricular clubs 
the court stopped short of declaring the law unconstitutional 
saying instead that the renton school system wasnt affected by the 
law because it barred all noncurricular clubs from meeting on 
campus but the court also indicated that any oncampus religious 
meetings would probably violate the constitutional requirement of 
separation of church and state 
the district must exclude organized religious speech because 
use of public school facilities for religious purposes violates the 
establishment clause of the constitution which forbids a state 
establishment of religion said judge jerome farris in the 30 
decision 
if the ruling stands the equal access act has been 
functionally rendered impotent and wouldnt apply in virtually any 
public high school setting said steven mcfarland lawyer for a 
group of high school students in the seattle suburb he said he 
would appeal to the supreme court 
marc slonim a lawyer for the american civil liberties union of 
washington said the ruling may be the first by any federal appeals 
court on the issue but is consistent with a number of lowercourt 
decisions around the nation 
since early in the 19th century weve had a tradition of trying 
to separate religion from public schools so public schools can serve 
people of a wide variety of religious beliefs slonim said 
he described the equal access approach as an attempt to avoid 
the constitutional ban on preferential treatment of religion but 
said it inevitably sends a message of religious partisanship in 
the schools 
mcfarland said about 25 students applied in the fall of 1984 to 
use a classroom at lindbergh high school for beforeschool meetings 
of a nondenominational christian student group for religious and 
moral discussions bible readings and prayer 
the principal and school district denied the request citing 
constitutional standards as well as a district policy that allowed 
classroom meetings only if the purposes were an extension of a 
specific program or course offering the students also were 
rejected by us district judge walter mcgovern whose ruling was 
upheld tuesday 
permitting this student religious group to meet in a public 
high school just before the start of classes would impermissibly 
advance rather than neutrally accommodate religion farris said in 
the appeals court decision 
he said the meetings would take place at a time closely 
associated with a highly structured school day creating an 
appearance of school sponsorship 
although the supreme court in 1981 allowed a student religious 
group equal access to a universitys facilities the same standards 
do not apply to public high schools farris said 
high school students are required to attend school and are less 
mature and more impressionable than university students farris 
said teachers at high schools unlike college professors are 
both educators and authority figures 
he also said the meetings would improperly entangle the 
government with religion because teachers required by district 
policy to supervise all student activities on campus might either 
interfere with or advocate religious activities as the clubs 
supervisor

the families of three morton thiokol 
workers killed in an explosive fire at an mx missile motor assembly 
building filed a 9 million negligence suit tuesday against the 
federal government 
the lawsuit in us district court seeks 3 million each in 
general and specific damages for the wives and children of jeffrey 
ellis 29 richard goodsell 36 and michael smith 24 
the lawsuit filed jointly by lorene ellis helen goodsell and 
dianna smith contends their husbands deaths resulted from 
government negligence in implementing and monitoring safety 
standards at the mx facility 
specifically cited in the suit were the establishment and 
maintenance of mandatory criteria standards and methods for 
procedures involving the manufacturing of the mx motors 
the plaintiffs also claimed government negligence in holding 
regular inspections of the premises to ensure that procedures were 
being followed by morton thiokol and that the government neglected 
to warn employees or stop work in the event noncompliance was 
discovered 
the victims and two other thiokol employees had been manually 
removing the steel core from a casting of a firststage missile 
motor when 100000 pounds of solid rocket propellent ignited in a 
fireball dec 29 1987 at the companys wasatch operations plant 25 
miles west of brigham city 
four of the men were killed instantly and ellis died 11 hours 
later the air force said in a report three months after the 
accident that the fire was caused either by friction or static 
electricity 
the air force report concluded that morton thiokol had failed to 
provide an adequate remotecontrol system or fully implement other 
safety measures recommended after a near miss six months earlier 
that consisted of a flash and release of fumes during the same 
procedure 
a telephone call to the us attorneys office in salt lake city 
after business hours tuesday for comment on the suit was not 
answered 
morton thiokol was cited for six safety violations and fined 
31700 by the utah division of occupational safety and health the 
company vowed to appeal violations alleging serious and willful 
deviations from division rules but company spokesman rocky raab 
said tuesday he was not sure if the appeal was filed and the fine 
reduced

stuttering once thought to be 
psychological has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists 
who hope to understand many disorders by making 3d videotapes of 
the brain in action 
subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow were 
found in brains of 60 percent of stutterers whose speech is broken 
by abnormal pauses repetitions stststuttering or prolongations 
ssssstuttering of sounds said audiologist terese finitzo who 
directed the university of texas studies 
she said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percent 
of people with spasmodic dysphonia in which malfunctioning vocal 
cords produce a hoarse strained strangledsounding voice 
the dallas scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people with 
spasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging pictures 
of brain anatomy unlike cat scans which use xrays the technique 
uses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs

doctors have long recognized the power of 
female sex hormones to keep womens hearts healthy now theres 
evidence that abundant levels of testosterone may be good for mens 
hearts 
its attractive to think that being male is good for men and 
being female is good for women said dr elizabeth barrettconnor 
a physician at the university of california san diego 
estrogen the female hormone is believed to one of the key 
differences between the sexes that explains why women typically live 
seven to eight years longer than men 
barrettconnor presented evidence monday that men with high 
levels of testosterone the male hormone are in better shape than 
those with relatively low levels whether this means they are more 
likely to escape heart attacks is still unclear

mercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country 
temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s 
the relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists joggers

a sudden soviet willingness to consider making 
good on bonds issued by russias czarist government is spurring 
interest in the obscure securities which long ranked as the 
financial worlds equivalent of a deed to the brooklyn bridge 
like the worthless deeds offered by hucksters to unwary 
immigrants the russian bonds were considered for years to be worth 
little more than the paper they were printed on of interest only to 
collectors 
but on monday the state department said us and soviet 
officials have started talks on repayment of the russian debt which 
was owed by the czarist government but repudiated after the soviet 
revolution of 1917 
similar talks with britain produced an agreement two years ago 
that brought a nearly 68 million windfall to investors there who 
had hung onto or acquired russian bonds often for mere pennies 
apiece 
in 1919 the new soviet regime defaulted on 193 million worth of

doctors believe they can predict in 
babies 6 months of age which ones are likely to grow up to have high 
cholesterol showing that heart disease and its prevention begin 
early in life according to a report tuesday 
the findings which emerge from a longrunning study in 
louisiana suggest that high cholesterol levels and high blood 
pressure have begun to do damage by the time children are in their 
teens 
adult heart disease very clearly begins in childhood said 
dr gerald s berenson of louisiana state university medical center 
in new orleans 
cholesterol causes fatty buildups in the hearts arteries this 
congestion can culminate in heart attacks usually in middle age or 
later unless it is treated by changes in diet or taking 
cholesterollowering drugs

in this corner usa today the television 
show fast on its feet but dragging the baggage from its 
inauspicious debut in september 
in the other corner is the plodding inside edition a 
knockoff of foxs a current affair that king world hopes will 
knock usa today out of the ring 
the decisive round between the two syndicated shows is expected 
during the february sweeps when local ratings are measured 
usa today the television show barely survived the november 
sweeps and has suffered station defections and time changes 
sometimes in favor of the new inside edition and the old a 
current affair 
usa today the television show premiered last fall after 
months of hype and a 40 million investment by the gannett co in 
partnership with grant tinker the producers promised 
stateoftheart graphics and a format that would change the face of 
television news in retrospect there was no way the show could live 
up to expectations but it wasnt expected to be so bad either 
overproduced and whizzing by at a frantic pace its anchormen and 
women were stranded on an unpopulated spaceage set talking to 
disembodied images on bigscreen television monitors 
the new version is much better brief updates on stories of the 
day are delivered by grounded anchors who have been allowed to sit 
down phew behind a desk that does not spin gyrate or sprout 
statistics 
its lighthearted features benefit from the impressive graphics 
the flash and the likable telegenic hosts remain if this were the 
show that had premiered in september it still wouldnt have lived 
up to the buildup but reviews would not have been nearly so 
negative 
but those negative reviews did hit newsstands and king world 
the successful syndicator of wheel of fortune the oprah 
winfrey show and jeopardy soon thereafter announced it was 
gunning for usa today the television show with inside 
edition to premiere in january 
usa today the television show had proven there was a market 
for a syndicated newsmagazine it had sold in 95 percent of the 
country weeks before a single show was produced thanks to the cast 
behind the scenes former nbc chairman tinker gannett and former 
nbc today show executive producer steve friedman 
when the show fell flat king world figured to step in and pick 
up the market 
but gtg stuck by the show hired jim bellows as new executive 
producer and announced a massive repromotion at a cost of 4 
million to herald the recreated program 
usa today the television show is far from the the sure thing 
it once seemed inside edition has been picked up as a midseason 
replacement in markets covering 71 percent of the country 
the kings enlisted the producers of a current affair and 
hired wellknown tv personality david frost as host 
but inside edition wasnt exactly impressive in its premiere 
either in comparison to usa today the television show the set 
looked like communityaccess cable the content was a mishmash of 
previously covered sob stories frost concluded the show with an 
embarrassing promise of no threeheaded babies no programs 
devoted to issues like should onelegged lesbians be allowed to 
adopt ferrets no sex surveys and hopefully no broken noses for 
the host 
if inside edition is wavering the new usa today the 
television show has settled down 
welcome to the new look of usa today on tv said cohost 
bill macatee as the show repremiered on jan 9 a new look for a 
new year 
several of the pieces were an amazing several minutes long 
documentarylength by the standards of the original version they 
were pleasant to look at if they were largely mindless a 
gardenvariety feature on preparations for the inauguration included 
a pointless film clip from the movie no way out another feature 
delivered the news flash that car stereos louder than a speeding 
locomotive are bad for drivers and other living things 
but the show is at least watchable now what remains to be seen 
is whether the improvements are too late many stations moved usa 
today the television show into lowrated latenight and gave 
inside edition the coveted time period just before prime time 
in the new york television market inside edition premiered on 
the nbcowned station at 730 pm usa today the television 
show has languished since september at 2 am on the cbs station 
neither inside edition nor usa today the television show 
can claim to be great journalism usa today the television show 
has at least tried to do something new

since economic thinking periodically succumbs to 
conventions and fads it is sometimes revealing and often wise to 
take an oblique perspective to look from the side rather than dead 
on 
if you do you may see some pet notions assume a different 
appearance just as people in profile sometimes appear differently 
than they do face to face 
consider the notion sometimes expressed by the impatient that 
the trade deficit be cleaned up once and for all during the next 
administration why piddle around lets get it over with 
but to do so would mean putting people out of work lowering real 
incomes and retarding economic growth this would severely diminish 
imports in theory it could be done but not without domestic and 
probably worldwide recession 
forced recessions used to be part of economic policy whether 
stated or denied and there are pure economists around who still 
maintain that a good recession is a wholesome thing for the trade 
defict sort of like a purgative 
today however economics is more heavily dosed with politics 
than it was in the immediate postworld war ii years recessions 
though they will happen are less likely to be a consequence of 
abrupt economic policy changes 
another issue deserving of a different perspective is that of 
exporting jobs it is a contentious one often used by labor in 
criticizing washingtons economic policy by importing it is said 
were shipping jobs abroad 
to which one economist professor william dunkelberg responds 
currently we employ 625 percent of our over16 population the 
highest proportion in history if were losing jobs to foreigners 
its hard to figure where 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys business school suggests 
that if the thesis had validity the evidence would show up as a 
decline of manufacturing jobs but it hasnt manufacturing 
employment is strong again 
true he says theres been a job loss in unionized protected 
automotive and steel industries where he claims wages were kept 
artificially high but jobs in some other manufacturing areas have 
grown along with productivity 
how about foreign investment in the united states an issue that 
irritates and provokes millions of americans as they see it 
foreigners are buying up the united states its economic warfare 
they say and americans are losing 
this one demands perspective to wit 
one reason net foreign investment has grown is that americans 
themselves are investing more in the united states and less abroad 
again dunkelberg explains 
the reason we are doing this is the same reason there is more 
foreign investment here the united states is a very good place to 
invest 
from a historical perspective he adds growth has been the 
strongest in the united states during periods of strong foreign 
investment when foreigners seek a good thing they sometimes do a 
good thing they make the country grow 
moreover foreign investment leaves hostages plants and 
buildings they erect in the united states cannot be taken home 
when things sour a bit says the professor we can buy them 
back at a lower price 
in the meantime shouldnt some thought be given to foreign 
investment in terms of jobs provided wages earned taxes paid and 
products put on the competitively priced marketplace 
its only a slightly different perspective from the conventional 
one but it suggests the possibilities in taking a second look at 
what might at first seem to be onefaceted situations

prayer for presidential integrity and courage by evangelist billy 
graham this friday brackets george bushs inauguration the ceremony 
starts with an invocation of divine assistance and ends with a 
benediction 
im going to ask god to give the new president strength 
courage and wisdom graham says im going to pray that he be 
given the wisdom to know whats right and the courage to do it 
although inaugural ceremonies ordinarily include prayers by a 
denominational crosssection of clergy bush this time chose for it 
only the durable evangelist a longtime friend and vacation 
companion 
i dont know why im the only one graham said when asked 
about it i guess he and barbara must have felt i could represent 
the others im honored to have been selected 
graham who has been a confidant of presidents ever since dwight 
eisenhower in the 1950s is particularly close to bush and his 
family and has been for about a quarter century 
they regularly spend some time together each year at bushs 
vacation home in kennebunkport maine and graham and his wife 
ruth also spent a holiday with the bushes in mexico before bush 
became vice president 
i knew his father and used to play golf with him graham 
related of the late sen prescott bush of connecticut whose 
hospitality drew the grahams into the bush orbit in the early 1960s 
weve been close friends of the bushes for many years 
related graham now 70 who in his halfcentury globegirdling 
career has preached directly to more than 100 million people in more 
than 65 countries 
the new president graham said has a huge family there are a 
lot of bushes and walkers bushs mothers maiden name theyre all 
very religious people i know all the children very well theyre 
all religious 
after dinner at the kennebunkport weekends he related we all 
gather in the living room and sit around on the floor i read some 
scipture and the children ask questions about the bible 
asked why bush isnt as openly expressive of his faith as 
outgoing president reagan graham said chuckling well you see 
hes an episcopalian graham himself is a baptist 
of the long line of presidents which graham has been associated 
he said i think lyndon johnson went to church more than any of 
them although jimmy carter also was a regular churchgoer and 
taught an adult class 
ronald reagan has talked a lot about god graham observed 
graham has scrupulously avoided taking sides in presidential 
campaigns whatever his personal associations particularly after a 
noncommittal ceremonial appearance with richard nixon caused 
accusation of partisanship 
at last summers national political conventions graham led 
prayers both at the democratic and republican affairs 
however while he has been a frequent white house guest and 
counselor through a string of eight presidents he has a special 
niche in the bush retinue because of their background 
i think hell make a far greater president than some people 
give him credit for graham said bush probably has more 
knowledge of what is going on in the world and more government 
experience than any man that has ever occupied the white house 
graham who in recent years has condemned the nuclear arms 
buildup said the developing friendlier relations between the united 
states and the soviet union is one of the great legacies being 
passed on by reagan 
graham added i definitely think bush will advance this new 
warmth between our two countries 
in the inaugural prayer graham said he would quote george 
washington as saying that america stands on two great pillars 
faith and morality without these our foundation crumbles 
sometimes this seems to be happening but there also are signs 
that a new spiritual tide is running in this nation im going to 
thank god for america and all it stands for 
im also going to say that humantitys promotion comes neither 
from the east or the west but from god 
graham said his inaugural prayer also would ask blessings on dan 
quayle as vice president on his wife marilyn and for the coninued 
health and service of reagan and his wife nancy

when south africas black townships 
erupt in violence black policemen are in the front lines 
when stateofemergency regulations are enforced black police 
are among those imposing the will of white authorities 
when antiapartheid activists target government collaborators 
for attacks black police often are singled out 
more than half of south africas 70000 policemen are black 
working for a government that upholds white privilege and living in 
segregated ccommunities restless for change 
blacks are very important to the overall success of the south 
african police said dirk kotze a white police captain who trains 
recruits at the black police college in hammanskraal outside 
pretoria 
black policemen are seen as part of the apartheid system 
enforcing discriminatory laws for their white masters said dr 
nthato motlana a prominent physician and antiapartheid activist in 
soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
black policemen generally view themselves as an apolitical group 
providing an essential service in a country where crime is high in 
the black township of soweto home to 25 million people more than 
10 murders and 25 rapes are reported on an average weekend 
im a professional policeman and my job is to uphold the law 
said lt col fanyana zwane a black who has worked in soweto since 
1969 we support the government of the day and dont get involved 
in politics 
yet black police are a vital link in the governments 
intelligence network helping to collect information on political 
activists who may be detained without trial 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained for varying periods 
during the 31month emergency and there have been repeated charges 
of police torture of detainees 
black policemen also are a buffer to reduce the number of 
confrontations between black citizens and white policemen 
i dont think the government trusts black policemen but it 
finds them useful in diverting black anger away from white 
authorities said motlana the activist 
during widespread unrest since 1984 militant activists attacked 
black police more than any other group associated with the 
government 
the homes of more than 1000 black policemen were damaged or 
destroyed and dozens of black police were killed in 198687 
according to research organizations 
one group of militants not only burned an officers home but 
so great is the hatred that they came back the next day with 
sledgehammers and broke down the building to its foundations 
louis le grange the former law and order minister said in 1986 
black officers are accessible targets because they live in the 
townships were most of the unrest occurs and are the most visible 
government representatives 
sgt john shiburi who lives and works in soweto said more than 
200 youths surrounded and stoned his house in 1985 shiburi held the 
mob at bay by firing shots for 20 minutes until police arrived to 
rescue him 
shiburi said he knew many of the youths and has spoken to them 
subsequently 
they said they wanted to kill me just because i was a 
policeman even though i hadnt done anything to them personally 
shiburi said 
several months later black students threatened to kill shiburis 
wife a high school teacher the couple moved to a different 
neighborhood but continued with their jobs 
most policemen receive no special protection but in some 
townships they live in barracks surrounded by barbed wire 
despite the occupational hazards there is no shortage of black 
volunteers for the police force 
blacks and people of mixedrace make up more than 25000 of the 
60000member south african police the national force and 
virtually all the 10000 policemen employed by township councils are 
black these figures do not include the police in black homelands 
where the only white officers are a few top commanders 
most black policemen are from impoverished rural areas attracted 
by the prospect of stable employment at a salary far greater than 
anything available in their hometowns 
all policemen regardless of race earn a starting monthly salary 
of about 800 rand 340 by comparison beginning mineworkers earn 
less than 500 rand 220 a month and are among the betterpaid 
black workers 
pay parity for policemen of all races was instituted five years 
ago and other discriminatory measures also have been eliminated 
until 10 years ago a white policeman was always in charge when 
working with a black colleague even if the black held a higher 
rank now rank alone determines command 
as recently as three years ago black traffic policemen in one 
province could not issue tickets to white motorists this also has 
changed 
several blacks have risen to the rank of colonel but whites 
still dominate the officer corps and blacks are likely to be 
stationed in black areas 
i know the people in the township wont like me said charles 
maluleke 22 a trainee at the black police college but he added 
this is the bestpaying job i could find and i have a chance to 
advance 
fourteen hundred black recruits are trained every six months at 
the college while hundreds of applicants are turned away 
of five students interviewed all said they would have preferred 
other careers but opted for the police because of the pay 
my parents and my four sisters are all depending on my wages 
said maluleke explaining that he lacked the money to study to be a 
teacher 
police recruits are required to have a high school education but 
kotze says many trainees are unsophisticated and have to be trained 
in some social amenities 
many new policemen including those raised in tiny villages are 
sent directly to urban centers critics question whether they are 
adequately prepared for the turbulence that awaits them 
during the recent unrest police also have hired thousands of 
instant police who received only six weeks training 
law and order minister adriaan vlok has conceded that these 
recruits need better training but motlana said that for many blacks 
the image of the entire police force is beyond repair 
it is impossible for blacks to trust any policemen under the 
apartheid system said motlana blacks are not part of the 
decisionmaking process and they will never have faith in anyone who 
enforces these unjust laws

mean moving in with his family 
her predicament is just one symptom of this countrys severe 
housing shortage there simply is not enough space to permit young 
married couples to have their own apartments 
as a result teresa must decide whether she wants to continue 
living with her own family or get married and move in with that of 
her prospective husband complicating the decision is the fact that 
she doesnt get along with some members of his family 
many residences here have 10 occupants in a space more suitable 
for three or four 
in the nuevo vedado section three families all related shared 
the same twostory home once the residence of a prerevolutionary 
oligarch since none of the families got along they had their 
respective dinners in shifts at 6 8 and 10 pm eventually each 
family found alternate housing easing what had been a wrenching 
experience for all concerned 
the government claims that every cuban has a place to live and 
indeed the housing shortage is probably less acute here than in the 
overwhelming majority of other latin american countries where 
homelessness and substandard housing are often rampant 
but because cuba has a different social system the housing 
problems and the ways they are dealt with are not the same as they 
are elsewhere in latin america 
because young couples often have no privacy due to overcrowded 
conditions at home the government runs a string of posadas or 
inns where they can spend a few hours alone in a modest room for a 
nominal fee 
occasionally signs saying 2 for 1 can be seen hanging from 
apartment building balconies that can mean that the couple there 
wants a divorce and is willing to trade their apartment for two 
smaller ones one for each partner 
in the meantime until alternate arrangements can be found such 
couples often must live under the same roof 
rodolfo davalos legal director of the national institute of 
housing admits that this unhappy situation is a common 
occurrence in cuba but he says usually in cases of marital 
difficulties the husband packs up and leaves an alternate solution 
is to construct a partition in the house in effect converting it 
into a twofamily dwelling 
in 1986 president fidel castro said he was appalled at the 
evidence of corruption and profiteering in housing 
he discovered that state construction equipment material and 
manpower were being used illegally to renovate existing housing 
enabling the owners to sell it at big profits the government struck 
back by forbidding the sale of housing altogether 
thus a cuban family that wanted to move had no choice but to 
trade houses with another family last month new regulations were 
instituted which permit the sale of housing once again but only if 
state inspectors give their approval their main interest is to 
guard against profitmaking by home sellers 
there are ways for young cubans to escape from an untenable 
housing situation one is to volunteer for a microbrigade 
groups of mostly young cubans who take leave of their regular job to 
work at a housing construction site 
the workers continue to receive the salary from their normal job 
and the state provides the equipment and the building materials the 
normal workday is 10 hours but it is not unusual as part of the 
spirit of selfsacrifice castro tries to instill in his people to 
find these workers on the job 12 to 14 hours a day 
for the typical 200 peso a month worker about 160 at the 
official rate the long hours mean an income of less than a peso an 
hour but the payoff comes when after two or more years the 
microbrigadista is entitled to move into one of the apartments 
at mininal monthly payments which he or she has helped construct 
rafael a taxi driver worked on a microbrigade at the alamar 
apartment complex 12 years ago after two years he was allowed to 
move into one of the apartments paying just 21 pesos a month the 
apartment will be all his in four years 
the alamar complex has grown to about 30000 units dania one of 
18 women on a 90person brigade has spent two years as a 
construction worker there and the long hours obviously had taken 
their toll she looked drawn and tired and said she looked forward 
to going back soon to her normal eighthour a day job as a garment 
worker 
but she is luckier than her peers in some other communist 
countries such as poland and the soviet union where the wait for 
an apartment sometimes exceeds 20 years 
the cuban government abolished the microbrigade system for a 
time then resurrected it two years ago in an effort to meet the 
increasing demand not only for housing but for day care centers and 
health clinics as well 
in previous years housing was allocated largely on the basis of 
need but lately the government has been shifting its philosopy 
somewhat showing a preference for workers who demonstrate diligence 
thus in the competition for new housing a father of five who is 
indolent may lose out to an exemplary worker with only two children 
a form of material reward in a country which usually relies on 
moral incentives to get people to work hard 
the microbrigades distribute among themselves half of the 
apartments they construct the other half goes to the elderly or to 
others who are unable to volunteer for such work 
during a recent speech castro said the portion of houses 
allocated to the microbrigades may be raised from 50 percent to 60 
percent since most of his audience was made up of 
microbrigadistas it was the biggest applause line of his 
twohour and 45minute speech

oil has spurted to a 14month high in the futures 
market in a gusher of speculation by traders that oilproducing 
nations will succeed in controlling their perennial overproduction 
the price jump will not spill over onto prices of consumer 
products such as home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasts for a 
considerable period of time analysts say 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil jumped 40 cents on monday to settle at 
1888 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
the last time the nearmonth contract settled higher was nov 20 
1987 amid hostilities in the persian gulf in the iraniraq war it 
settled that day at 1893 
although persian gulf troubles no longer are an issue the price 
of the nearmonth contract for west texas intermediate has soared 50 
percent since an intraday low of 1228 a barrel on oct 5 
one reason for the increase is speculation that some kind of 
production agreement may be reached at a meeting beginning jan 26 
in london between members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries and nonopec countries according to gene nowak an 
analyst at dean witter reynolds inc 
nevertheless analysts said the latest surge seemed more the 
result of emotion than news 
the main thing weve got getting this market up is momentum 
id have to list that as the first cause said peter beutel 
assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
theres no underlying structural reason theres no shortage 
said john lichtblau president of the petroleum industry research 
foundation 
prices began rising in october on expectations that opec members 
would agree to cut production as a way of propping up prices an 
agreement was reached in late november and took effect jan 1 
analysts said opecs production has been 19 million barrels a day 
or slightly more above its selfimposed quota of 185 million 
barrels but well below decembers production 
in a sign that many traders expect the surge in oil prices to be 
shortlived prices for delivery in later months were significantly 
lower 
the march contract for west texas intermediate rose 27 cents to 
1795 a barrel the april contract rose 21 cents to 1737 a 
barrel and the may contract rose 14 cents to 1698 a barrel 
among refined products traded on the new york mercantile 
exchange the february contract for unleaded gasoline rose 094 cent 
to 5091 cents a gallon and the february contract for no 2 heating 
oil rose 021 cent to 5316 cents a gallon 
the intraday trading high the highest point reached during the 
trading session was 1893 for the february contract for wti that 
topped the 1988 intraday high of 1892 on april 18 which also 
preceded a meeting between opec and nonopec nations beutel said

five major food companies have joined four others 
in working toward eliminating highly saturated palm and coconut oils 
from their products prompting a multimillionare health crusader to 
declare victory 
how much i have had to do with this is for the public to 
decide said phil sokolof who spent 2 million on nationwide 
newspaper ads to promote his cause i know we speeded it up 
the omaha businessman announced monday that general mills inc 
ralston purina co borden inc pillsbury co and quaker oats co 
had agreed to switch to vegetable oils with less saturated fat 
earlier kellogg co sunshine biscuits pepperidge farm and 
keebler said they would stop using the socalled tropical oils in 
their food products 
saturated fats increase blood cholesterol levels which are a 
risk factor for heart attacks sokolof 66 blames high cholesterol 
for the nearfatal heart attack he suffered 22 years ago 
none of the companies gave timetables for the reformulation of 
their products but many said removal of tropical oils was under way 
before sokolof launched his campaign 
in the earlier announcements some of the companies denied that 
sokolof had any influence on their decision kellogg even denounced 
sokolof as irresponsible for placing the fullpage ads which warned 
of the poisoning of america through tropical oils 
but the latest announcements in the form of letters to sokolof 
over the past week were cordial 
the elimination of tropical fats from pillsbury products is a 
major priority said a letter from that company released by 
sokolof thank you for your efforts on behalf of the american 
consumer 
sokolof said two major food processors general foods and nabisco 
brands have not supported his cause completely 
but he added with nine of the top 11 players in the field i 
guess the battle has been won millions of ounces of saturated fat 
wont be clogging the arteries of the american public 
nabisco brands spokeswoman caroline fee said her company a 
division of rjr nabsico inc is testing its existing products to 
see whether tropical oils can be eliminated and that 32 out of 35 
products it has introduced in the past few years have been free of 
these oils 
we are not a holdout she said but it is not something you 
can do that quickly without making sure the taste and quality is not 
jeopardized 
sokolof said some nabisco products also contain lard which also 
contains saturated fat ms fee said the review of the companys 
product formulations also was looking at whether lard could be 
removed 
general foods a division of philip morris cos inc told 
sokolof in a letter that it was eliminating tropical oils in all its 
products except cool whip the company said it believes it may not 
be possible to reformulate the dessert topping to eliminate tropical 
oils 
sokolofs initial advertising blitz singled out kelloggs 
cracklin oat bran sunshines hydrox cookies pepperidge farms 
goldfish crackers keeblers club crackers nabiscos triscuit 
crackers procter amp gambles crisco shortening carnations 
coffeemate and bordens cremora for their tropical oil content 
while most people think they are contributing to their better 
health by avoiding foods that contain animal fats many do not know 
that the tropical oils are as bad or worse he said palm oil 
has 25 percent more saturated fat than lard coconut oil has 100 
percent more 
some of the food processors have argued that the tropical oils 
impart a distinctive flavor and increase their products shelf life

business founded the national heart savers association in 1985

retailers from across the country gathered for 
their annual convention have heard an unsurprising forecast from 
industry watchers sales will remain sluggish in 1989 
rosalind wells chief economist of the national retail merchants 
association told storeowners monday that consumers are optimistic 
and confident about the economy but retail sales will increase only 
6 percent 275 percent after inflation 
americans have already put a lot of big purchases behind them 
and theres much less pentup demand she said 
ms wells and lyle gramley chief economist with the mortgage 
bankers association of america were upbeat about the economy 
although they did not expect consumer spending to surge gramley 
said he saw no signs of a recession this year 
he did see some negatives ahead including a slight worsening of 
inflation that would help to nudge interest rates higher but he 
said he expected interest rates to peak by midyear if significant 
steps are taken to cut the federal budget rates could decline 
before years end he said 
the forecasters spoke at the nrmas fourday convention here the 
delegates included retailers ranging from owners of small shops to 
executives of the nations largest storeowner sears roebuck and co 
the economic forecasting session traditionally is one of the 
biggest of the meeting drawing thousands of retailers away from the 
aisles of exhibits set up by cash register manufacturers and credit 
card companies 
another industry watcher stuart robbins an analyst with the 
investment firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said 
he expected more of the same kind of muddling along in the 
economy this year resulting in a mediocre retail environment 
robbins said i dont feel good about 5 and 6 percent sales 
increases recalling that in past years retailers enjoyed 9 percent 
or 10 percent gains 
forecasts of consumer spending are critical for retailers 
because they must adjust their inventories and expenses in line with 
how much americans spend economists also watch consumer spending 
because it accounts for twothirds of the gross national product 
the broadest measure of economic health 
in recent years consumer spending has increased although retail 
sales have risen only slightly americans have been channeling more 
dollars into buying homes and cars and into necessities such as food 
and medical care leaving less money for discretionary items which 
include clothing and furniture 
high installment debt has been blamed for some of the retail 
sales slump which is nearly 2 years old 
but despite the forecasts of higher interest rates ms wells was 
unconcerned about consumer debt although they may owe more money 
buying on credit is such a way of life that people are more 
comfortable with debt she said 
gramley and ms wells both expected job growth to slow that 
would affect retailers because new workers have been a primary 
source of sales increases in recent years 
durable goods such as cars furniture and large appliances 
would bear the brunt of consumer hesitance while nondurables such 
as food clothing and gasoline should see pickups ms wells said 
robbins had a warning for the retailers no matter what sales do 
operating expenses will climb 
storeowners have been paring costs in the past few years to 
preserve their profits as sales declined but robbins said expenses 
would spurt higher because as costs of labor goods and real estate 
accelerate 
the forecasters also said there were many other variables that 
may affect business during the year such as the volatile price of 
oil

sport magazines latest issue may have come as a 
surprise to some faithful readers who were offered a pinup sports 
calendar rather than luscious photos of beautiful women in 
swimsuits a year ago 
in a testament to the selling power of midwinter swimsuit 
issues the february sport has a darkhaired model appropriately 
dressed for what the headline over the magazine title called its 
hot swimsuit issue 
the magazines executives note that new owners and a new editor 
have taken over since the last policy pronouncement on swimsuits 
petersen publishing co based in los angeles bought the magazine 
last summer 
and the new owners say they are giving the predominantlymale 
sports magazine audience what it wants as demonstrated by the huge 
popularity of the swimsuit issues from its rivals sports 
illustrated and inside sports 
sport is reviving its swimsuit issue just weeks before sports 
illustrated celebrates the 25th anniversary of its first swimsuit 
edition with a blitz that will include a paycable program a home 
video and a desk calendar 
sports illustrated designed its initial swimsuit issue as a 
travel feature to brighten up the dark days between the football and 
baseball seasons when many northern cities are snowbound and sports 
fans are blue 
the swimsuit issues periodically have sparked protests that the 
sections are sexist exploit women and are unsuited to a sports 
magazine some readers threaten subscription cancellations although 
publisher donald barr said he had fewer than 50 cancellations due to 
last years swimsuit issue 
sports illustrated charges about 28 percent more for ad space and 
75 percent more for a single copy of its swimsuit issue it expects 
to sell nearly 55 million copies of this years special issue 
which hits the newstands feb 6 compared with the usual 3 million 
for regular issues 
home box office inc plans to air a 47minute video about 
shooting the swimsuit issue feb 9 a slightly longer home video 
will made available a few days later in video retail and magazine 
stores and retailers have reportedly ordered about 350000 copies 
which will be priced at 1999 
next fall a special 25th anniversary desk calendar will be 
published for 1990 using photos taken for the 1989 swimsuit issue 
tom ettinger of sports illustrated enterprises said he expects to 
sell about 250000 desk calendars at 1295 each in addition to 
500000 of the usual wall calendars at 1095 each 
inside sports owned by century publishing co in evanston ill 
has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands and hopes to sell 
850000 copies compared with a normal rate base of 500000 
the magazines first swimsuit issue was a parody of sports 
illustrateds version showing pretty women in swimwear carrying 
rolledup copies of the competitions swimsuit issue 
it was so wellreceived that we decided we would keep doing our 
own every year said marketer jerry croft 
sport magazine tried its first swimsuit issue in march 1986 
featuring swimsuitclad women athletes from all fields but sales 
failed to improve 
in his message to readers last year theneditor neil cohen 
wrote we didnt feel comfortable with the pages they didnt fit 
our magazine 
so this month cohen wrote a year ago instead of devoting 
16 pages to luscious photos of beautiful women in swimsuits we give 
you a 16page pinup sports calendar there are no sexy pictures 
there just some remarkable sports photos but you dont have to 
hide it from your kid either 
sport publisher lew green is looking for a sales boost but 
wont say how much in sports rate base of 850000 copies 
he makes no apology for the change in philosophy on swimsuit 
issues 
what we are showing here is appropriate for a young male 
audience he said its part of what sports are all about

if you kept your books the way uncle sam keeps 
his you too might have a big budget deficit be accused of 
irresponsibility and urged by your friends to take immediate 
corrective action 
but you and uncle sam differ in your approach to accounting it 
might surprise many people but the old sprendthrift uses 
bookkeeping that is more severely restrictive and harder to live by 
than yours 
this is but one of the ways in which some critics claim the big 
federal budget deficits may be overstated at least with respect to 
their immediate impact on the strength or weakness of the economy 
it isnt at all an apology for the rich uncles big debts or a 
reason to continue them in fact an unusual spectrum of economists 
from conservative to liberal agree that regular annual budget 
deficits must be checked 
but says james griffin chief economist of the aetna investment 
management group unless we understand how the numbers are 
derived it is impossible to draw any reliable meaning from them 
the big difference between you and your uncle is that you keep a 
capital budget spreding payments for durable bigticket items such 
as your home and automobile over many years its the cash flowdebt 
service concept 
sam has no capital budget 
it means that whatever the government buys however long or short 
its useful life might be it becomes an immediate expense its 
called cashbased accounting and it flies in the face of standard 
accounting practices 
griffin comments that while a cashbased system may have merit 
it is simple to the point of being silly when applied to the 
federal governments operations 
he estimates for example that if capital items were considered 
in the federal budget we would get better than halfway to a zero 
balance 
for an entity that makes significant capitaltype expenditures 
he explains the important point to recognize is that a zero balance 
on a cash system is a stringent budget indeed cash on the 
barrelhead for everything 
business doesnt operate that way homeowners dont attempt to do 
so if they did they might be confronted with numbers so horrifying 
they would sell the house and car and rent the least expensive 
apartment they could find 
sensibly they reason that the house and car are good for a few 
years at a minimum and that they can space out their payments in 
affordable units over that time 
and that brings up another matter that conceivably lessens the 
impact of uncle sams deficits it is inflation and the declining 
value of the dollars used to pay off debt 
just as inflation allows you to repay your mortgage in cheaper 
dollars offset to some degree these days by variable interest 
rates it also allows uncle sam to repay his debts with money that 
isnt worth as much as it seems 
says griffin 
with 183 trillion of privately held outstanding federal debt 
securities and a 42 percent inflation rate in fiscal 1988 the 
decline in the real value of outstanding debt offset roughly half 
the officially reported deficit 
there may be a danger most economists today might say a very 
real one in playing down budgetdeficit dangers especially in 
view of the tendency of uncle sam to seek excuses for spending 
beyond his means 
but at the other extreme there may be pitfalls too in failing to 
understand where those big numbers come from especially by those 
folks who tend to look at government budgets as similar to their own

national semiconductor corps 
decision to lay off about 2000 workers worldwide was based on slow 
demand and dipping prices but will allow the company to recover its 
financial health by summer company officials and analysts said 
the layoffs are part of a company reorganization announced monday 
in a move allowing national semiconductor to focus on its primary 
business advanced semiconductors 
the company which designs manufactures and markets advanced 
semiconductor products currently employs about 39000 people 
worldwide 
while we expect slow growth this calendar year in line with 
industry levels our management remains optimistic about the 
longterm outlook for our company said charles f sporck 
president and chief executive officer of national semiconductor 
we believe this action will allow us to focus on our core 
business and to maintain the companys growth and longterm 
health said sporck 
national semiconductors action follows the layoff of nearly 
2500 employees by advanced micro devices 1000 of them in the 
united states amd blamed a soft market while analysts said poor 
management also contributed significantly to the companys financial 
problems 
a weakening demand for semiconductors and by extension personal 
computers in the second half of 1988 affected most major silicon 
valley manufacturers but shrewd management practices helped most 
companies from hewlettpackard co to apple computer avoid 
layoffs 
the us semiconductor industrys monthly ratio of orders to 
shipments slipped to its lowest point of the year in december 
according to figures released last wednesday by the semiconductor 
industry association the figure meant that for every 100 in 
products shipped there were 93 in new orders the figure for new 
orders reached a high of 118 in april and has fallen every month 
except one since then 
dataquest a hightechnology consulting firm has predicted the 
semiconductor industry will experience modest growth of about 10 
percent for the rest of this year down from 36 percent last year 
national semiconductors layoffs will occur at all levels in 
asia europe and the united states with about 50 percent of the 
cuts being made domestically said company spokeswoman mary coady 
the company also will take a onetime restructuring charge in the 
third quarter of its current fiscal year 
company officials couldnt immediately say what that charge will 
be although the information should be available within a few days 
coady said 
for the first half of fiscal 1989 national semiconductor 
reported a net loss of 557 million in the latest quarter the 
company posted a net loss of 25 million on revenue of 705 million 
company officials said the layoffs will allow national 
semiconductor to achieve two goals a corporate reorganization and 
bringing costs and staffing into line with declining revenues in the 
semiconductor industry 
companies arent buying as many personal computers said 
coady luckily we are a broadbased supplier 
the drop in revenues also was caused by an inventory adjustment 
by distributors who bought very heavily in the summer and had built 
up huge supplies analysts said 
mel phelps an analyst with hambrecht amp quist in san francisco 
predicted the company is getting healthy again and will break 
even this quarter and begin to turn a profit by the end of fiscal

the nations ability to produce steel will 
increase this year after declining for seven consecutive years 
according to the american iron and steel institute 
the industrys raw steel production capability is expected to 
reach 1159 million tons this year up from 112 million tons in 
1988 the low point of the decade 
the figure was projected from a december survey of all mills with 
furnaces for melting the institute said monday 
us steelmakers had facilities capable of producing 160 million 
tons of steel per year in 1977 the highest on record 
the projected increase from 1988 to 1989 is mostly a result of 
newer and more efficient equipment those capital investments have 
paid off with increased yield of finished products per ton of raw 
steel the institute said 
the average yield is now close to 85 percent compared with 715 
percent 10 years ago

the dollar gained sharply against the japanese yen 
today reflecting its sharp rise on overseas markets overnight and 
stock prices fell in tokyo 
the dollar opened at 12793 yen and went as high as 12815 yen in 
early trading before easing back to 12770 yen at the finish up 
105 yen from the close of 12665 yen last friday when the dollar 
gained 053 yen the market was closed monday for a national holiday 
finance minister tatsuo murayama attributed the dollars strength 
to the difference in key interest rates between japan and the united 
states and to reported statements by west german finance authorities 
that the dollars current level is acceptable 
he ruled out the possibility of the bank of japan intervening to 
stem the dollars rise saying the situation does not require 
immediate countermeasures 
traders noted that on monday the dollar closed in london at 
12805 yen and in new york at 12810 one reason for the gains they 
said was reduced chances of central bank intervention as japan 
observed a holiday and many us traders were absent from the market 
in observance of the rev martin luther kings birthday 
there had been strong demand for buying the dollar but 
traders fears over intervention prevented such a move said a 
dealer at a major commercial bank speaking on condition of 
anonymity then when they were freed from such fears they all 
went out to buy the dollar 
but the traders added that the dollar was unlikely to continue 
gaining while the market awaited us trade reports due wednesday in 
washington 
meanwhile on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average 
of 225 selected issues dipped 7086 points or 023 percent closing 
at 3122752 
dealers said the dollars steep gain and anxiety over the 
upcoming us trade reports contributed to the decline as many 
investors pulled back to the sidelines prices of exportoriented 
issues fell as did those of steel railway and petroleum shares 
it appeared the market was taking a break today as the market 
anxiously awaits the us trade reports said a dealer at a major 
japanese brokerage but the yens sharp downslide against the 
dollar gave a downward direction and most shares ended up lower 
but most dealers appeared to take todays decline as temporary 
the market is still bullish despite todays slip said 
ichitaro watanabe of nikko securities co i think it still has 
potential for further growth

winstonsalem nc ap rj reynolds tobacco co claims that 
an article in the journal of the american medical association is an 
attempt by ama officials to further their political goal of banning 
the companys new smokeless cigarette 
we are appalled that such a widely respected publication as 
jama would jeopardize its reputation by promoting distortions to 
further the political goals of its parent organization g robert 
di marco reynolds tobaccos senior vice president of research and 
development said in a registered letter monday to jama 
rjr charged that a political faction of the ama has printed 
information in the jan 6 issue about premier which heats rather 
than burns tobacco the company said the information is 
scientifically incorrect 
no scientific journal no matter how widely read or well 
regarded can afford to dilute or distort scientific facts much 
less publish information that they ought to know is scientifically 
incorrect di marco said 
a spokesman for ama in chicago could not be reached at home late 
monday night 
a letter to the editor of jama reported preliminary results from 
two government scientists at the national institute of drug abuse in 
baltimore which claims that premier could be altered to smoke crack 
cocaine 
di marco said rjr scientists met with top ama officials in june 
and presented an overview of the scientific testing conducted on 
premier 
despite our initial invitations to visit our laboratories and 
talk to our scientists to date the ama has not accepted our offer 
to learn detailed facts about the science surrounding premier nor 
did they contact us in regard to their most recent statements di 
marco said 
this leads me to believe that the real issue here is 
prohibition he added

dinner for two costs at least 250 at le gavroche 
so what is the master chef doing in court being bugged about flies 
messing up the food in londons most famous restaurant 
the prosecution trotted out a 10inch model of a fly to display 
in magistrates court on monday where chef albert roux was 
contesting 15 charges of violating food and hygiene regulations and 
five under health and safety legislation 
the charges for which the eatery could face fines refer to food 
contamination by flies and the premises being at risk of infestation 
by rats and mice 
today prosecutors dropped one charge filed under the food and 
hygiene regulations saying it had been determined there was no 
problem with the location of the restaurant staffs bathroom 
le gavroche in londons chichi mayfair area is one of just two 
restaurants in britain to hold the coveted michelin threestar 
rating the other at brayonthames west of london is run by 
rouxs brother michel 
a health officer for westminster city council has testified that 
he saw flies in the restaurant kitchen attracted by dirty open 
garbage bins outside flying in through open windows and doors and 
holes in the pantrys mesh screen 
dr nicholas burgess an entomologist and witness for the 
prosecution brought in the model of the fly 
he testified that the insect has revolting eating habits and 
can cause a list of diseases running to 45 pages burgess said these 
include salmonella dysentery and conjunctivitis and said flies 
contaminate food while they eat mate and lay eggs on it 
there was laughter in court when burgess added that in the jewish 
religion one can kill flies on the sabbath and a fly in ones 
food is grounds for divorce 
but burgess said in answering rouxs lawyer timothy cassel i 
dont think any entomologist could find direct evidence of any 
particular disease caused by a fly 
cassel said council health officer alexander parkerbrown was 
obviously biased and eager to prosecute one cannot rely 
too heavily on the objectivity fairness and judgement of a man who 
described a chipped electric plug as serious 
cassel said parkerbrowns predecessor had praised the le 
gavroche kitchen and put it in the top category the kitchens 
alleged deterioration coincided with the arrival of parkerbrown he 
said 
le gavroche said the attorney is a restaurant of which this 
country can feel proud 
cassel said it was inconceivable that in 18 months it could have 
gone from being a shining example to squalor and a possible 
candidate for closure and then back to best again all under the 
same management 
health officers have said they did not find le gavroche filthy 
enough to close but the bad publicity over the case has been a 
major punishment in itself

engineers found errors in emergency system 
wiring of two delta air lines boeing 757s an airline spokesman said 
today similar problems have been reported in five other planes 
belonging to four carriers 
jim lundy a delta spokesman in atlanta said the airline 
immediately notified the federal aviation administration and 
corrected the problems which would have prevented sprinklers from 
working properly in the event of a baggage hold fire 
similar problems were earlier reported in another deltaoperated 
757 one belonging to royal brunei airlines two owned by air 
holland and one operated by the british airline air 2000 one of the 
air holland planes was being used by a charter company in canada 
discovery of the crossedwiring by delta engineers in one of its 
41 new 757s led to an faa airworthiness directive last friday 
airlines using the planes had until this morning to complete the 
inspections 
officials of eastern which operates 25 of the 757s and 
northwest which has 33 said today they found no problems with any 
of their planes 
lundy said all other delta planes also passed the inspection 
he said one plane had crosswiring into the cargo area which 
would have resulted in the wrong sprinkler system going off the 
other had a wiring error that would have flashed a warning light in 
the cockpit but the fire extinguisher would not have worked he 
said 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the agency had not yet received 
complete results of the testing of either the 757s or of testing 
under an earlier order involving engine fire warnings systems of 
boeing 737s in checks with several of the 10 airlines involved with 
the 737 inspections during the weekend none reported a problem 
regular airline service was not affected by any of the 
inspections officials said 
the directive for 737s came as the result of speculation that 
crosswiring might have misled the pilot of a british midland 737 to 
shut down his good right engine after the left one caught fire 
officials have yet to determine cause of the crash that killed 44 
people jan 8 
the two faa directives were not related except that both 
involved possible crosswiring 
the 757 inspection was for crosswiring of warning systems from 
the cargo holds done either on the boeing assembly line in seattle 
where the planes were built less than a year ago or during 
maintenance 
we are looking into the technical aspects of it to see what the 
miswiring was or is how they relate to each other and what might 
have happened so we can correct it boeing spokesman tom cole said 
monday after problems with five aircraft had been reported 
cole said three of the first five planes affected were 
manufactured at the same time but the one owned royal brunei and 
the first one from delta were not 
the boeing co will examine what happened and study the way the 
fire extinguisher bottles are put in there well see if something 
can be done to make them less fallible he said

a kentucky man who lost a leg in a farm 
accident lost a supreme court bid today to revive his lawsuit 
against a farm equipment manufacturer 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that the 
lawsuit was dismissed improperly because a stenographer was tardy in 
transcribing pretrial statements 
the accident occurred oct 22 1983 when eugene mcdowell was 
unloading corn from a wagon into an old house used for grain 
storage his clothing was caught in the portable conveyor connecting 
a tractor to the corn elevator and his left leg had to be severed 
us district judge scott reed in lexington ky threw out the 
suit against dynamics corporation of america of bloomington ill 
the conveyor manufacturer 
mcdowell said the conveyors design was defective and was 
inherently dangerous 
dynamics corporation said mcdowells own negligence his failure 
to stand far enough away from the machine caused the accident the 
company also said the machine had been modified since its 
manufacture and that dynamics corporation ws not responsible for the 
changes 
reed threw out the suit on june 30 1987 without reviewing 
depositions or pretrial statements from witnesses for mcdowell 
an engineer said in the deposition that the conveyor was defective 
because it lacked a guard to prevent such accidents the engineer 
also said any changes in the machinery were minor and had little 
bearing on the accident 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled last june that it was 
mcdowells responsibility to make sure that a transcript of the 
statement was provided to the judge 
without the deposition testimony mcdowell has presented no 
evidence of design defect the appeals court said 
mcdowells lawyers said the stenographer called a court 
reporter violated federal court rules by failing to supply the 
judge with the statement 
the lawyers said unbeknownst to them the stenographer sent a 
transcript of the deposition to attorneys for dynamics corporation 
but not to reed 
mcdowell was denied his day in court beacuse of the failure of 
a court reporter to follow the federal rules attorneys said 
they also said that federal appeals courts elsewhere in the 
nation have reinstated suits in such cases 
the case is mcdowell vs dynamics corporation 88758

kn energy inc plans take a writedown of 
401 million in the fourth quarter but expects its 1988 earnings 
to exceed its 1987 net income of 133 million 
the company is marking down the value of its coal oil and 
natural gas resources to reflect current market prices charles w 
battey kn energys chairman and chief executive officer said 
monday 
despite the 401 million writedown in the fourth quarter in 
1988 gains from a lawsuit settlement and an asset sale should 
enable kns earnings for the year to surpass those of 1987 battey 
said 
financial results for 1988 will be announced next month 
the bulk of the pretax writedown 33 million reflects a lower 
valuation for kns coal properties according to battey the 
valuation of oil and gas assets was reduced by 71 million 
in early january kn announced a 361 million gain from the 
settlement of a lawsuit involving the etsi coal slurry pipeline 
venture kn was a partner in the 1000mile proposed pipeline 
project which never got off the ground mainly because of railroads 
opposition settlements of lawsuits against those railroads have 
brought millions of dollars to etsi partners 
and last june kn sold its east texas pipeline subsidiaries for a 
pretax gain of 157 million 
battey said the company plans to increase production later this 
year at its golden eagle underground coal mine west of trinidad in 
southern colorado the mine is operated by wyoming fuel co a kn 
subsidiary 
our wyoming fuel co coal subsidiary has a good operating base 
in its contract for coal sales to the arizona electric power 
cooperative battey said after the addition of efficient 
longwall mining equipment which wyoming fuel will lease and have 
in operation later this year we expect to have positive cash flow 
and operating income 
meanwhile standard amp poors raised kns senior debt and 
preferred stock rating by one level to aminus from bbb the new 
yorkbased creditrating agency said the improved rating was due to 
the improved coal outlook the use of pipeline litigation income to 
reduce debt and to new markets

the reagan administrations 
rambostyle diplomacy led to frequent trade clashes with 
european countries but transatlantic relations remain good 
according to europes former top trade official 
willy de clercq who recently finished four years as a key 
official of the european economic community also raised the 
possibility that the latest trade dispute sparked by a european 
ban on hormonetreated us meat might be resolved shortly through 
negotiations 
i think there is a way to get out of it he said in a recent 
interview 
de clercq said he considered conflicts and divergent interests to 
be normal between the united states and the 12nation common market 
trading bloc 
what i have always deplored is the frequency whichincreased 
so visibly and intensively during the 1985 to 1989 period and the 
way the american administration was behaving he said 
de clercq complained that us officials reacted to conflicts 
with the common market by putting deadlines and threatening with 
measures the famous rambostyle diplomacy which we do not like 
very much here in brussels 
even so he said the atmosphere has always been good between 
the giant trading partners 
although there have been many many problems we have had 
almost no real shooting war de clercq said 
de clercq for four years was the top trade and foreign affairs 
official of the european commission the common markets executive 
body he now is a candidate of a conservative belgian political 
party for the european parliament the trading groups legislative 
body 
the latest transatlantic trade spat was touched off by the eecs 
jan 1 prohibition on imports of american meat from cattle treated 
with growth hormones the united states retaliated by imposing also 
on jan 1 higher tariffs on a variety of european products 
common market officials tentatively have agreed on 
countermeasures that would slap stiff duties on american imports of 
dried fruit and walnuts foreign ministers of the member nations are 
to meet next monday to consider formally backing those measures 
de clercq said the community and the united states agreed to 
allow sanctioned products to enter their borders through the end of 
january this would apply to goods in transit before jan 1 
he noted the delay probably will allow the eec to start a new 
dialogue on the issue with the incoming bush administration 
there has to be another round of negotiations he said 
but de clercq said it was impossible for the common market to 
lift the ban on hormonetreated meat as demanded by us officials 
european officials cited health concerns in imposing the meat 
ban which originally was to have taken effect jan 1 1988 the 
trading bloc agreed to a oneyear delay but refused further us 
appeals for a postponement 
if you say it is to protect our population then you have to 
maintain it if it is so he said expecting the community to 
say now that it is going to allow the production or entry of meat 
with hormonesis an illusion 
the prohibition is expected to halt the importation of about 100 
million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the united states 
some of which are used in pates and sausages meat used to make pet 
food is exempted 
american officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten 
cattle a common practice among us farmers does not pose a health 
risk 
the meat imports represent a tiny fraction of the estimated 166 
billion in trade last year between the united states and the common 
market 
de clercq also said relations between the common market and japan 
had grown in recent years he said european exports to japan likely 
soared by 20 percent to 25 percent last year from 154 billion in 
1987 
we have pushed the japanese governmentinto opening the 
markets more and integrating japan more into the international and 
economic circuit behaving in other words like a great economic and 
trading power should he said 
common market members are france west germany italy 
luxembourg belgium the netherlands denmark greece ireland 
portugal spain and the united kingdom

pushing the dollar lower against the japanese yen to 
help shrink the us trade deficit could have the opposite effect in 
the long term as japanese businesses become more competitive a 
senior finance ministry official said tuesday 
makoto utsumi director general of the finance ministrys 
international finance bureau also said us businesses were fully 
competitive at current exchange rates even though they had problems 
competing in foreign arenas 
a further decline in the dollar would not reduce the japanese 
trade surplus utsumi told reporters at the foreign correspondents 
club of japan 
if the dollar weakens further japanese businesses would take 
steps to survive by further rationalization of business and 
manufacturing keeping wage increases low cutting labor further 
economy in every aspect utsumi said 
after this process of rationalization japanese manufacturers 
might be still more competitive and paying lower prices in dollar 
terms for imported raw materials would give them a further 
advantage he said 
japanese manufacturers responded to the first major appreciation 
of the yen against the dollar in 19851986 by improving efficiency 
after the major industrialized nations including the united states 
britain west germany france and japan agreed to slash the 
dollars value to help shrink the us trade deficit 
in february 1987 those nations agreed on approximate exchange 
rate ranges for the us dollar and other major currencies seeking 
to restore stability to exchange markets but the dollar continued 
to slide from its september 1985 level of 240 yen 
the dollar closed at 12770 yen tuesday in tokyo it has ranged 
between 120 yen and 135 yen since november 1987 
economists remain divided over the actual impact of a cheaper 
dollar on trade flows 
some say the cheaper dollar has helped narrow the trade gap by 
dampening demand for more expensive foreign goods in the united 
states and stimulating sales of cheaper american goods overseas 
they also say the dollar would have to drop to 80 yen or lower to 
achieve desired reductions in the us trade deficit 
but utsumi said further declines in the dollars value would not 
improve american export competitiveness 
the problem is not price competitiveness of us industries 
but the willingness and capacity to export utsumi said 
using exchange rates to boost exports has the disadvantage of 
encouraging manufacturers to concentrate on fattening their profit 
margins rather than improving productivity utsumi stated 
the senior ministry official urged the incoming administration of 
presidentelect george bush to cut the us federal budget deficit 
and curb consumer demand 
then us manufacturers would become more eager to seek out 
overseas markets to sell their products he said 
utsumi said little remains to be done by japans government to 
open its markets to foreign exporters instead the question is 
how to crack the ice of the private sector he said 
he predicted japans current account surplus would decline by 
several billion dollars in fiscal 1988 which ends march 31 and by 
another several billion dollars in fiscal 1989 
in 1987 japans surplus in the current account which measures 
trade in goods and services flows of shortterm interest and 
dividends repatriation of profits and other financial transfers 
was 867 billion up from 858 billion in 1986 
its surplus with the united states hit a record 598 billion in 
1987 up from 586 billion in 1986 
in 1986 japans current account surplus amounted to 36 percent 
of its gross national product and was expected to amount to a 
little over 2 percent this year utsumi said

the midflight disintegration of part of a 
boeing 737 over hawaii is likely to lead to as many as 50 orders to 
strengthen older passenger jets in the next year a boeing co 
executive says 
in the meantime ben cosgrove vice president for engineering at 
boeing commercial airplanes said the worlds largest commercial jet 
manufacturer is making sure the federal aviation administration is 
told of problems in older planes 
at a news briefing on aging aircraft cosgrove said that when 
boeing officials hear about an aircraft problem from an airline 
they tell the carrier to notify the faa within 24 hours and we 
make sure that it does 
the hawaii accident last april stunned the commercial aircraft 
industry and raised questions about older aircraft and how long they 
can safely fly the aloha airlines boeing 737 was flying over hawaii 
when an 18foot section ripped from the top of the jetliner 
a flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 of the 93 other 
people aboard were hurt before the crew managed to land the plane on 
maui the 19yearold plane with nearly 90000 flights was the 
second mostheavily used plane in the worldwide 737 fleet 
last june the faa sponsored a threeday conference in 
washington dc on older planes one result was the creation of 
task forces of faa manufacturer and airline representatives to 
examine ways to ensure older planes safety 
since the aloha accident the faa has changed some of its 
thinking about older aircraft sometimes requiring operators to make 
specific modifications rather than just checking for a given problem 
and correcting it if trouble is found 
last fall the faa required operators of many older 737s to 
replace thousands of rivets in some places where a 737s skin is 
joined after the adhesive used on those lap joints was found prone 
to delamination in december a similar order was issued for older 
boeing 727 trijets 
cosgrove who serves on a working group that oversees task forces 
dealing with boeing planes said it has reviewed service bulletins 
boeing has issued over the years as advisories for 727 737 and 747 
jumbo jets operators and has nearly completed recomending which ones 
airlines now should be required to perform 
the faa will then determine which modifications should be made 
mandatory through airworthiness directives or orders to air 
carriers he said 
youre going to see ads coming out pretty quick on some 
recommendations he said adding later that as many as 50 51 
directives could be issued in the next 12 months 
in addition to the boeing planes other work groups are examining 
aircraft made by mcdonnelldouglas lockheed airbus industrie 
convair fokker and british aircraft 
boeing spokesman jack gamble said the number of directives 
involving older boeing airframes could be as few as 10 or 12 and 
that the faa may group some smaller modifications into single 
directives to make the process simpler 
boeing officials and many others in the industry say commercial 
planes can be flown indefinitely as long as they are properly 
maintained what determines an airplanes life they say is the 
increasing cost of maintenance the aircrafts efficiency and 
technological changes 
the national transporation safety board report on causes of the 
aloha accident is expected out shortly and cosgrove said he would 
wait until it is released before commenting on why that massive 
structural failure occurred

lf rothschild amp co tuesday said it voluntarily 
decided to quit as a primary dealer in us government securities 
and to discontinue most trading of the securities because the 
activities have not been profitable enough 
the company said in a statement the return on capital devoted 
to its government securities operations was insufficient to warrant 
continuation of the business 
rothschild said it had ample capital to satisfy new guidelines 
announced by the federal reserve bank of new york last november and 
the decision was made purely on profitability grounds 
the guidelines announced by the new york fed nov 17 doubled the 
minimum capital required for securities companies who have the 
coveted title of primary dealer the minimum was raised to more than 
50 million 
primary dealers can buy and sell us government securities 
directly from the new york fed through the buying and selling of 
the securities the federal reserve system seeks to influence 
interest rates 
therefore financial firms with primary dealer status have an 
insight into government interest rate policy also primary 
dealership is soughtafter because some big institutional investors 
prefer to conduct their business exclusively through primary dealers 
the lf rothschild move which will result in the loss of about 
50 employees jobs curtails all of the companys sales and trading 
activities of us government securities except for proprietary 
trading meaning for its own account the company had been acting as 
a primary dealer for about two years 
from now on rothschilds operations will consist of fixedincome 
securities sales and trading as a dealer in mortgagebacked 
securites as well as corporate and highyield securities it will 
also continue to operate in the investment banking field 
the withdrawal of lf rothschild a unit of franklin savings 
association based in ottawa kansas reduces the number of primary 
dealers to 44 
on friday county natwest government securities inc announced 
its departure from the exclusive group county natwest a subsidiary 
of britains largest bank national westminster bank plc had been 
under pressure from the new york fed to boost its capital

continuing reaction to the governments report of 
largerthanexpected corn supplies analysts said 
wheat and oat futures closed mostly higher 
rumors that the soviet union may cancel some soybean or 
soybeanmeal purchases because of port congestion also contributed

rockwell international corps said 
tuesday its firstquarter profit fell 17 percent from the same 
period last year when profits were boosted by a tax adjustment 
related to production of the b1b bomber 
the aerospace electronics and industrial company said it earned 
160 million or 62 cents a share in its first quarter of fiscal 
1989 down from 1929 million or 71 cents a share in the same 
period a year earlier 
sales for the quarter ended december 31 were 287 billion up 
from 268 billion a year earlier 
the firstquarter profit fell in comparison with the 1988 quarter 
because the company recorded a onetime gain of 502 million from 
tax benefits related to the b1b programin the earlier period the 
benefit came from deferring taxes on some income in previous years 
of the b1b program until last year when the tax rate was lower 
rockwell delivered the last b1b to the air force in april and 
the end of that program meant decreased sales in the aerospace 
division which also works on the space shuttle 
sales rose in the electronics automotive and graphics divisions

lawyers for shareholders and creditors of 
public service co of new hampshire on tuesday dismissed a 2 
billion offer for the company by northeast utilities as too low 
howard berman a lawyer representing psnhs 100000 shareholders 
said they would urge the companys board to reject northeast 
utilities plan as totally unsatisfactory 
the offer doesnt contain anything for shareholders and we 
believe its inadequate he said 
northeast utilities offered last week to buy psnhs assets aside 
from its share of the seabrook nuclear power plant for 12 billion 
psnhs 36 percent stake in seabrook would be spun off to the 
companys unsecured creditors while a northeast utilities 
subsidiary would buy seabrook power for 750 million 
northeast utilities new englands largest power company also 
would pay public services unsecured creditors 300 million in cash 
stock and financial backing bringing the total cost of the 
transaction to 2 billion 
psnh was forced into reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws 
last year because of rising debts from the 58 billion seabrook 
plant which remains idle in the absence of a federal operating 
permit 
berman said bidding for psnh should begin at 28 billion and any 
buyout plan must include public services share of seabrook 
joel zweibel who represents thousands of psnh junk bond holders 
and creditors with claims of about 1 billion said the northeast 
utilities offer casts too much of the contingent risk as to 
whether seabrook will operate on creditors 
the state which has been negotiating with psnh on a 
reorganization plan for the utility said tuesday it was too early 
to take a position on the offer from connecticutbased northeast 
utilities 
senior assistant attorney general larry smukler said however 
the offer represents a reasonable basis for further discussion

the dollar slipped tuesday in quiet trading 
reflecting moneydealer reluctance to take risky positions in the 
currency prior to the release of the potentially marketmoving 
monthly trade deficit report 
gold prices rose slightly after declining in the previous trading 
session in new york republic national bank quoted bullion at 
40250 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est up from 40180 at the same 
time monday 
currency strategists said the dollars decline signaled a 
cautious approach by dollar holders toward the commerce departments 
wednesday release of the november us merchandise trade deficit 
statistics 
the consensus is for a shortfall of about 11 billion compared 
with 1035 billion the month before but the numbers are renowned 
for defying predictions 
a number sharply higher than 11 billion could possibly incite a 
big selloff in dollars while a much smaller number could encourage 
a surge in demand for the currency 
in either case the uncertainty of whether central banks would 
intervene to stabilize the dollars value with massive purchases or 
sales of their own also encouraged caution in the market currency 
traders said 
it was a very quiet day with people squaring their positions 
ahead of the release of the number said fred scala senior 
foreign exchange dealer at manufacturers hanover trust co in new 
york 
over the past few years the trade deficit numbers have become a 
powerful influence over the foreignexchange market because of 
their role in us economic policy as well as their unpredictability 
from month to month

citicorp the nations largest bank holding company and three 
other big banking concerns reported sharply higher earnings tuesday 
for both the fourthquarter of 1988 and the whole year 
most of the banks which included jp morgan amp co security 
pacific corp and wells fargo amp co said they were helped partly by 
tighter cost controls and brazils resumption of interest payments 
on foreign loans 
the earnings of all four banks were severely hurt in 1987 the 
peak of the third world debt crisis when brazil halted interest 
payments on bank loans and other economically troubled countries 
negotiated to restructure their debt citicorp said earnings for the 
three months ended dec 31 totaled 747 million or 219 a share 
compared with 621 million or 182 a share in the comparable 1987 
quarter 
for the year citicorps earnings totaled 185 billion or 536 
a share that compared with a loss of 118 billion in 1987 when 
the company decided to increase its provision to cover possible 
losses from shaky third world debt 
jp morgan the nations fourth largest banking company earned 
2581 million in the fourth quarter or 138 a share compared 
with the 2241 million or 121 a share earned in 1987 fourth 
quarter 
the companys 1988 earnings totaled 100 billion or 538 a 
share compared with 833 million or 39 cents a share in the 
previous year 
security pacific ranked sixth said quarterly earnings totaled 
1695 million or 146 a share vs a loss of 394 million the 
previous year 
its annual earnings reached 6389 million or 559 a share vs 
157 million or a penny a share in 1987 
wells fargo ranked 10th said fourth quarter earnings were 136 
million or 245 a share up 22 percent from 1112 million or 
196 a share in 1987 
for the year wells fargos earnings totaled 5125 million or 
920 vs 508 million or 52 cents in 1987 
citicorp said all sectors of the company did well partly due to 
tighter expense controls 
the company said quarterly and annual earnings included among 
other things 436 million from nearly two years of accumulated 
brazilian interest payments and 160 million from tax benefits 
stemming from its 3 billion addition in loanloss reserves in may 
1987 
jp morgan said it received 240 million of pastdue interest 
from brazil during the final quarter of 1988 on top of that its 
loanloss provision shrank to 200 million for all of 1988 from 
960 million in 1987 
security pacific said the recognition of brazilian interest 
payments accounted for 58 million of the increase in net interest 
income it said results also reflected slow growth in noninterest 
expenses 
security pacific said losses on loans to developing companies 
totaled 6636 million in 1988 as a result of loan sales and other 
measures that reduced its debt exposure 
at years end the company had reduced nontrade related 
developing country debt to 520 million down from 950 million as 
of sept 30 1988 and 18 billion at the end of 1987 
wells fargo said the provision for its loan losses in the fourth 
quarter was 75 million down from 114 million a year ago the 
fullyear provision was 300 million compared with 892 million in 
1987

corn futures prices plunged tuesday for the second straight day 
on the chicago board of trade amid rumors of export cancellations in 
a market already weakened by the governments report of 
largerthanexpected supplies 
soybean futures also fell sharply while wheat and oat futures 
finished mostly higher 
on other other markets gasoline futures led energy futures 
higher precious metals advanced livestock and meat futures were 
mostly higher and stockindex futures retreated 
wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 10 cents 
lower with march at 267 a bushel oats were unchanged to 2 cents 
higher with march at 233 a bushel and soybeans were 14 cents 
lower to 1 cent higher with march at 770 a bushel 
rumors that port congestion may force the soviet union to cancel 
some of its purchases of us corn soybeans or soybean meal weighed 
on the futures markets for those commodities analysts said 
under a longterm grain agreement with the united states the 
soviet union has so far agreed to purchase more than 10 million tons 
of us corn 11 million tons of soybean meal 450000 tons of us 
soybeans and 370000 tons of us wheat for 198889 delivery 
the cancellation rumors had the greatest impact in the corn pit 
where intraday losses approached the 15centsabushel limit the 
board of trade expanded the daily trading limit for corn from 10 
cents a bushel following limit declines on monday 
analysts said the rumors surfaced just as the corn and soybean 
markets appeared to be recovering from mondays collapse which was 
linked to an agriculture department crop report released friday that 
indicated that supplies of us corn and soybeans were larger than 
most market experts had expected 
when people started talking about net cancellations of us 
sales by the russians that brought in a pretty bearish attitude 
right up until the close said steven freed a grain market 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
additional selling of soybean futures was prompted by reports of 
improved growing conditions in brazil and argentina where a spate 
of hot dry weather got the south american soybean crop off to a bad 
start analysts said 
a late rally brought corn and soybean futures off their lows of 
the day but corn for nearmonth delivery still closed at its lowest 
point since dec 20 and january soybeans finished at 761 the 
lowest soybean futures price since dec 5 
the market is searching for support now following the 
liquidation as a result of the crop report said ted mao a 
grainmarket analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
freed predicted corn prices would stabilize after tuesdays 
selloff 
the market will go to wherever the demand price is he said 
my feeling is that dont have to go down too much farther in 
corn to attract buyers 
contracts for deferred deliveries of unleaded gasoline soared the 
2centsagallon daily limit on the new york mercantile exchange on 
speculation that new pollutioncontrol standards taking effect this 
year in several northeastern states will raise the price of gasoline 
production analysts said 
the new regulations in states including massachusetts and new 
york create a more stringent standard for a characteristic of 
gasoline that is related to automobile exhaust emissions said 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures inc 
in new york 
crude oil for nearmonth delivery finished the day at a new 
14month high of 1895 a barrel after trading as high as 1921 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 30 cents 
higher with february at 1895 heating oil was 11 cent lower to 
13 cent higher with february at 5305 cents a gallon ands unleaded 
gasoline was 19 cent to 2 cents higher with february at 5110 cents 
a gallon 
gold and silver futures advanced on new yorks commodity 
exchange reflecting the us dollars weakness against major 
foreign currencies 
gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with february at 404 a 
troy ounce silver was 53 cents to 54 cents higher with march at 
601 a troy ounce

the dollar value of acquisitions in the computer 
software and services industry shot up 70 percent in 1988 according 
to a survey released tuesday 
among the 434 deals done last year were a record 14 valued at 
more than 100 million according to broadview associates an 
investment banker that does a quarterly survey for adapso the 
computer software and services industry association 
overall the transactions were valued at a record 84 billion 
up from 49 billion in 1987 broadview said the number of deals 
rose 21 percent from 358 in 1987 
the biggest deal was the 16 billion purchase of ims 
international inc by dun amp bradstreet corp broadview said 
many of the buyers were big companies that preferred to buy 
established companies rather than try to build software and services 
businesses from scratch 
for private companies being acquired can enrich the original 
owners while giving their company the resources to continue its 
growth the alternative of making a public stock offering is 
unattractive in the current market broadview said

federal charges were announced tuesday against 18 
former employees of first commodity corp of boston alleging they 
defrauded more than 2600 investors of some 40 million 
the charges stem from an ongoing investigation in chicago 
boston new york miami and san francisco the largest single 
investigation of its kind ever undertaken by federal officials us 
attorney anton valukas said at a news conference 
the former employees named in a federal grand jury indictment 
and criminal information are accused of using highpressure sales 
tactics to persuade customers from around the country to invest in 
highstakes commodity ventures misrepresented as being lowrisk 
more than 22 million of the investments was lost valukas said 
those named tuesday include the failed companys former national 
vice president for sales two branch managers and 15 former 
salesmen and managers from its former offices in chicago and 
suburban oak brook ill valukas said the criminal information 
includes charges by his office while the indictment includes charges 
by the grand jury 
the defendants are charged with a total of 187 counts of wire 
fraud and mail fraud racketeering and racketeering conspiracy 
they include david c connolly 48 of teaneck nj the former 
national sales vice president for the company ross a barnard 37 
of suburban hinsdale ill former branch manager of the oak brook 
office and stephen l barnard 38 of suburban flossmoor ill 
former house broker of the chicago office 
neither connolly nor the barnards could be reached for comment 
the barnards have unpublished telephone numbers and connolly was not 
listed in the teaneck telephone listings 
if convicted those charged could face lengthy prison terms and 
thousands of dollars in fines 
in the alleged scheme customers were solicited by telephone by 
first commodity sales representatives posing as phony commodities 
experts those representatives often made repeated phone calls using 
scripts handed out by managers valukas said 
investors were falsely told that commodity trading was not 
risky and would lead to high profits he said 
in fact the defendants knew almost all of first 
commoditys customers lost money valukas said 
during the alleged scheme from 1980 to february 1987 100 
million in sales was brought in to the companys chicago and oak 
brook offices and 63 million of that was lost valukas said 
more than 406 million of those sales and more than 227 
million of the losses were attributable to the former employees 
named in the complaints valukas said he declined to say whether 
more charges were forthcoming but noted that the investigation is 
continuing nationwide 
three other former first commodity employees pleaded guilty to 
similar charges in december and have been cooperating in the probe 
valukas said 
it is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales 
techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them 
he said these cases should serve as a clear warning that fraud 
and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts in 
whatever form it takes will be thoroughly investigated and 
vigorously prosecuted 
founded in the late 1970s first commodity rapidly grew into one 
of the nations leading futures trading companies but it collapsed 
in 1987 beneath a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal 
investigations

the federal national mortgage association tuesday 
reported a 22 percent drop in fourthquarter income from the year 
before but for all of 1988 profit rose to a record level 
fannie mae as the federallychartered private corporation is 
commonly known said aftertax income totaled 1527 million or 
191 a share in the final three months of 1988 down from 195 
million or 242 a share in the corresponding 1987 quarter 
results for the entire year were better in 1988 fannie mae had 
aftertax income of 5067 million up 348 percent from 376 
million the prior year and a record annual amount that translated 
to pershare earnings of 643 and 466 in the two respective 
periods 
fannie maes record 1988 income successfully caps a year in 
which the company celebrated the 50th anniversary of its creation 
and its 20th year as a private company said david o maxwell 
chairman and chief executive officer 
fannie mae is the nations largest investor in home mortgages 
maxwell attributed last years earnings growth to an increase in 
the spread between the yield on the corporations investment 
portfolio and the cost of its debt outstanding an increase in the 
companys average investment portfolio continued expansion in fee 
income from mortgagebacked securities and a decline in the tax rate 
also beneficial was a decline in properties having to be taken 
over due to foreclosures such acquisitions have fallen in each of 
the past five quarters 
the provision for losses on mortgage loans was reduced in the 
fourth quarter to 85 million from 120 million in 1987s final 
quarter 
part of the reason for the drop in the latest quarterly earnings 
was that the 1987 results included adjustments associated with 
changes undertaken following implementation of a new accounting 
standard 
without the changes earnings in the fourth 1987 quarter would 
have been 60 million or 75 cents a share and earnings for all of 
that year would have been 242 million or 298 a share 
as of dec 31 fannie maes assets totaled 1121 billion up 85 
percent from 1035 billion at the end of 1987

american mutual liability insurance co and 
american mutual insurance co were ordered by the state supreme 
court into receivership tuesday at the request of state insurance 
commissioner roger singer 
the action was prompted by concerns over the wakefield companies 
reserve capacity to cover primarily highrisk policies written in 
the 1960s and 1970s involving asbestos medical malpractice and 
toxic waste claims singer said 
under the order which was supported by the companies singer was 
named receiver and the companies were enjoined from issuing new 
policies or proceeding with their business except as permitted by 
singer 
the companies were authorized to continue paying automobile 
workers compensation and certain disability and accident and health 
claims but will not renew or write new policies 
the companies formed 101 years ago are licensed in all 50 
states but primarily operate in the northeast they have 20000 
commercial policies nationwide and nearly 75000 personal policies 
singer said the order was intended to protect policyholders while 
the insurance division works with management in an effort to 
improve the companies financial condition 
the insurance division will report back to the high court within 
30 days on whether to rehabilitate them in some ways or declare 
them insolvent singer said we will either have a plan to 
somehow get them back on their feet or well have the court declare 
them insolvent 
singer and company spokesman tom synder said there is a 
possibility that a portion of the companies may be sold 
national grange mutual insurance co of new hampshire has signed 
a letter of intent to buy a small stockcontrolled subsidiary of 
the companies american policyholders insurance co which is 
unaffected by the order although it too will stop writing new 
policies 
singer said national grange has expressed interest in buying 
american policyholders bringing 500 to 600 of american mutuals 
nearly 800 wakefield headquarters employees on board and paying off 
american mutuals longterm claims 
one of the big assets of this company american mutual is a 
welltrained experienced work force singer said 
synder said national grange will be reviewing the potential 
acquisition over the next 30 days 
in the meantime american mutual will be looking at cutting its 
total 1400employee work force to handle only claims synder said 
no decision on layoffs has been made yet 
singer said the companies reserve capacity has been under review 
by the insurance division since 1985 since then american mutual 
has brought in new management sold off assets and upgraded its 
business 
during the past several years the company has made great 
strides in strengthening its reserves to pay losses american 
mutual president j john wortman said the reserve accounts have 
been strengthened by over 250 million since 1986 
however some very recent changes in payment patterns on old 
losses indicate that even more reserves may be necessary he said 
singer said the discovery a few weeks ago of 500 million to 700 
million in potential longterm claim exposure prompted one investor 
interested in buying all three companies to back out and the 
insurance divisions decision to seek the receivership order 
synder said it was unclear what direction american mutual will 
take in 30 days but he said we obviously are not going to be 
the size or shape of company that we were in the past it all 
depends on what we can bring out of this

that are in litigation 
according to khabos lawsuit he was hired by ibm in june 1984
