about 700 inmates rioted at a crowded 
19th century prison sunday occupying rooftops smashing windows 
and setting fires at least 50 guards and inmates were injured 
police said 
television newscasts carried unconfirmed reports that witnesses 
had seen up to 12 bodies a police spokesman said inmates brought 
out of strangeways prison also reported deaths but that police 
would not be able to confirm this until they reached the center of 
the complex 
the home office said no hostages were being held and police 
said talks with prisoners were under way there was no clear 
indication of the cause of the rioting at the mediumsecurity 
prison built in the victorian era and now one of the most crowded 
in europe 
home office spokesman charles keseru said prison officers 
regained control of one wing of the jail sunday evening and found 
no seriously injured inmates the office said 12 injured staff 
members and 25 inmates were taken to area hospitals 
the rioters appeared to have the rest of the complex under 
control however prisoners were surrendering to authorities and 
about 400 had given up late sunday night keseru said 
it was not clear how many still were participating in the riot 
or the circumstances of the prisoners who were not involved the 
prison was built for 970 inmates but houses about 1600 
hundreds of riot police surrounded the prison and a police 
helicopter hovered overhead as flames leaped 20 feet into the air 
from the prison gymnasium where a fire burned out of control 
twentyfive firefighters under police protection battled the 
blaze as dense black smoke billowed above the building 
fires also were reported to have been set in three cells and a 
classroom as large groups of inmates rampaged inside those fires 
later were reported under control 
scores of police vans lined side streets around the prison a 
mile from the manchester city center in central england the home 
office responsible for prisons and law enforcement said the 
perimeter of the prison was secure 
an office statement said the uprising began in the prison chapel 
at 11 am when 300 inmates attacked staff members 
those prisoners then gained access to the chapel roof and then 
broke into the living accommodation in the main prison other 
prisoners including those on remand joined in the disturbance and 
staff had to be withdrawn the statement said 
as many as 80 prisoners reportedly made their way on to the 
rooftops of the jails f wing the prison chapel and adjoining 
buildings the windows of a central turret linking several wings 
were smashed as prisoners made their way to the roof 
once there the prisoners tore roof tiles up and hurled them 
into the prison courtyard where there were believed to be groups of 
riot police and prison officers 
the prison built in 1868 has been criticized as cramped and 
inadequate because of the crowding in response home secretary 
david waddington has announced plans to expand strangeways 
judge stephen tumin chief inspector of prisons said in a 
report last week on strangeways that one shower a week was the norm 
for the inmates and up to 400 men had no work assignments he said 
the most dangerous men were locked up 22 hours a day 
last week two prisoners at strangeways climbed onto the roof in 
a protest but the reason was not made public 
the prison serves the local area onethird of its inmates are 
awaiting trial and twothirds have been sentenced the home office 
said 
many of britains prisons date from victorian times and 
crowding has become a serious problem one of the worst previous 
riots occurred in may 1989 at risley remand center near liverpool 
when 54 inmates staged a rooftop demonstration and held off police 
for four days 
the most famous riot in british penal history this century was 
at dartmoor the jail on the moors of devon where fighting over 
poor food and conditions in 1932 left 70 inmates and six guards 
injured

liberation front 
us embassy spokesman terrence kneebone said us government 
personnel in honduras had been on a precautionary alert ahead of 
the second anniversary this week of the burning of the us 
consulate in tegucigalpa to protest the extradition of an alleged 
drug kingpin 
three attackers fired on the bus six miles north of tegucigalpa

soldier shot in the head was in critical condition and another 
wounded in the stomach was in delicate condition

better treatment facilities at gorgas hospital than in soto cano 
all five are out of danger in fact they walked out of the 
hospital after receiving first aid treatment earlier in the day 
he said 
jessup said the servicemen are members of the us air force 
but he refused to identify them by unit or release the names of the 
injured

us soldiers had seen them as they fled 
a white house spokesman sean walsh said in washington we 
deplore any action against us citizens well be working closely 
with the honduran government on the investigation 
the morazano front founded in 1979 is thought to be an arm of 
the communist party the group takes its name from gen francisco

are frequently based jessup said the uninjured soldiers also were 
flown to the base and all leaves there were canceled jessup said 
the us soldiers have been building roads and airstrips in

the united states keeps several thousand personnel stationed in 
honduras

mata ballesteros 
kneebone would not say specifically why us government 
personnel had been put on alert we are always monitoring the 
security and political environment and so on and we decided to take 
these precautions he said

former gov toney anaya said saturday 
that his calling thenpresident reagan antihispanic during the 
early 1980s probably triggered a series of federal investigations 
into anayas administration 
the prominent hispanic democrat addressing a workshop at the 
national association for chicano studies annual conference said he 
made the comment on an economic trip to mexico in 1983 or 1984 
anaya new mexicos governor from 1983 to 1986 was investigated 
by the fbi the us attorneys office in albuquerque and the 
internal revenue service no charges were ever filed against him 
he said saturday that he was asked to comment on reagan and his 
policies toward mexico during a news conference that followed his 
meeting with mexicos president during the trip 
i made the unfortunate statement suggesting that ronald reagan 
was probably the most antihispanic and they translated that to 
mean the most antimexican president wed ever had he recalled 
john ehrlichman who was an aide to president nixon and who 
lives in santa fe read of anayas comment while having breakfast 
with former gov jerry apodaca anaya said 
he told jerry apodaca theyre going to get him the feds are 
going to get your friend anaya theyre not going to tolerate 
that anaya said it wasnt days after that the first of many 
federal investigations were kicked off 
there were 13 fbi investigations altogether there were three 
federal grand jury investigations there was one criminal irs 
investigation and two or three instances where we could trace that 
the cia had been used in these investigations anaya said 
anaya said he didnt learn of ehrlichmans comments until 
recently when apodaca also a democrat related them to him 
apodaca said saturday night anaya took ehrlichmans remarks out 
of context 
apodaca said ehrlichman indicated during their conversation that 
he thought anaya made a major mistake in criticizing reagan 
while outside the united states ehrlichman also said the reagan 
administration would never let him anaya rest apodaca said 
we were simply talking about prevailing attitudes in the 
administration apodaca said 
repeated telephone calls to ehrlichmans santa fe home saturday 
reached an answering machine albuquerque fbi spokesman doug belden 
referred questions on the issue to us attorney william lutz who 
denied that anayas remark prompted the federal investigations 
its untrue lutz said late saturday its unfortunate 
that he anaya would attack president reagan in that manner 
reagan spokesman mark weinberg in los angeles said there would 
be no comment from the former president and suggested talking to 
the fbi 
during anayas term lutz conducted an extensive investigation 
into the governors finances anaya at the time accused the 
prosecutor of using a federal grand jury to investigate the 
governors involvement in land transactions in new mexico and 
pennsylvania 
the irs investigated anayas tax liabilities in 1983 and 1984 
according to court documents the fbi investigated the awarding of 
a state fair concession contract after an unsuccessful bidder told 
agents hed heard a payoff had been made to anaya 
anaya said saturday that the various federal agencies that 
launched investigations repeatedly leaked information to the news 
media in their campaign against him and accused news organizations 
of fanning the flames 
anaya acknowledging his administration made many mistakes said 
he believes he was singled out by federal agencies because of 
differences with the rightwing reagan administration over his 
liberal leftwing philosophy 
we had a progressive agenda and that was not going to set very 
well with them he said we had taken on ronald reagan 
personally 
anaya became the states 21st governor behind a wave of 
bipartisan support but his four years in office were plagued by 
controversy and criticism often from the media by the end of his 
administration anayas approval rating in public opinion polls had 
dipped to about 12 percent 
he suffered critical reviews for his good friday 1986 
proclamation that new mexico was a state of sanctuary for central 
american refugees and his thanksgiving eve decision that year to 
commute the death sentences of the states five death row inmates 
anaya who was ineligible for a second consecutive term was 
succeeded by gov garrey carruthers a republican 
anaya has remained active in the democratic party he is 
chairman of the hispanic caucus for the democratic national 
committee and a member of the partys national executive committee 
he indicated when he left office that he would never again be a 
political candidate but said saturday that that could change

buffalos cashpoor bus and subway system 
shut down early sunday after the city transit authority refused to 
consider a county offer to take over the system 
the last bus finished its run at 301 am leaving new york 
states secondlargest city the largest us metropolitan area 
without any public transit system more than 120000 people use 
buffalos system daily 
a city labor leader labeled the conflict a class struggle 
against selfish suburbanites who didnt want to pay for a system 
they dont use 
erie county executive dennis gorski said saturday afternoon hed 
asked a cincinnati management firm to administer the transit system 
for the county if the niagara frontier transportation authority was 
willing to yield control 
but the authority meeting with gorski and city officials 
saturday night refused to take up the offer and voted 72 to shut 
down the system repeating a similar vote take wednesday 
gorski had said a countyrun system would eliminate all but a 
small core of bus and subway routes but would be better than no 
system at all the alternatives are disastrous he told a news 
conference 
you think i want a bus system gorski asked i dont want 
it but ive got to keep it going 
about 80 percent of the transit systems 1043 workers had 
already been laid off by saturday afternoon authority spokesman 
daryl rasuli said 
on wednesday the county legislature rejected a proposed tax on 
public utilities to fund transit after vigorous opposition from 
business leaders the next day the transit agencys board approved 
the shutdown 81 
attempts thursday and friday to put together a bailout plan 
collapsed gorski rejected mayor james griffins proposal to use 
county sales taxes for transit the board turned down gorskis call 
for sweeping service cuts and reorganizing the transit agency 
the utility tax would have raised 9 million for the transit 
system which costs about 55 million a year to run it has been 
squeezed by declining federal subsidies and had only 89000 in the 
bank as of saturday night 
among the first to be affected by a shutdown would be buffalo 
sabres hockey fans about 3000 of the 16000 fans expected to 
attend sunday nights season finale against the quebec nordiques 
would normally have taken the subway to memorial auditorium 
taxi companies said they would be overworked because only 375 
cabs are licensed to pick up people within city limits 
without a transit system more than 12000 public and private 
schoolchildren who normally ride the bus or subway to school would 
be stranded said william goldbach assistant city school 
superintendent for transportation goldbach said it would take 240 
school buses to carry those children but said there simply 
arent enough bus drivers and vehicles available in the area 
some downtown merchants planned to arrange car pools or taxis 
for their employees but others said they were waiting to see what 
happened 
about 110 people attended a noontime rally saturday sponsored by 
the buffalo teachers federation 
union president phil rumore said the shutdown was a class 
struggle against wealthy suburbanites and business interests 
whose lobbying campaign sank the utility proposal 
were talking about people that have saying the havenots 
dont need a public transportation system rumore said 
leonard braun new york area manager for the federal urban mass 
transit administration said he knew of no other transit system 
that had ever been shut down by its own board for lack of funds 
but braun said there was no chance the federal government would 
come to the rescue calling the 1974 decision to provide operating 
subsidies for mass transit a mistake

thousands of yellowcapped schoolchildren marched 
on tiananmen square sunday but police barred the general public 
from entering on a day when dissidents had urged a silent protest 
in the plaza 
the children were bused in to attend ceremonies marking civic 
efforts to plant trees and flowers for the asian games to be held 
in beijing in september many waved the red flags of the young 
pioneers a group for teaching social and ideological values 
the usual crowd of sunday visitors to the square mainly chinese 
tourists from outside beijing was kept behind police lines on the 
outskirts of the 100acre plaza 
there were no signs of any attempts to mark the military assault 
on the studentheld square june 4 that left hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of people dead on the streets of beijing and ended the 
sevenweek prodemocracy movement campuses in the northwest 
corner of the city were reportedly quiet 
overseas dissident groups have urged students and other 
activists to take a protest stroll on the square on april 1 and 
april 5 to mourn those killed last year april 5 is the qingming 
festival the annual day when chinese honor their dead on qingming 
in 1976 thousands of chinese carried wreathes and flowers to 
tiananmen to honor chou enlai the beloved premier who died that 
january and indirectly protest the ultraleftist policies of the 
government 
the brutal suppression of that spontaneous show of defiance in 
what is now called the first tiananmen incident led to the 
eventual overthrow of the leftist gang of four 
organized demonstrations are banned and the stroll was 
proposed to avoid the certain arrests of those participating in any 
public protests against the repressive policies of the current 
hardline government of premier li peng 
chinese sources say communist party officials in their work 
units are telling them to stay away from tiananmen square the 
symbolic political center of china 
there were steppedup police patrols around the square saturday 
night and police or soldiers on sunday manned rooftop lookouts 
around the square peering down on the crowds with binoculars 
shortly before noon thousands of peoples liberation army

the army is speeding up development of a 
weapon to shoot down enemy satellites but has quietly dropped its 
goal of building enough of the hittokill rockets by the 
mid1990s to knock out all soviet military satellites 
the defense department asked congress to nearly triple the 
projects budget for the fiscal year starting oct 1 to 208 
million that would make it one of the fastest growing us weapons 
programs at a time when congress is hailing the end of the cold war 
as reason to scale back defense spending 
the army estimates the total cost of an antisatellite system at 
between 2 billion and 25 billion most of that to be spent over 
the next five years 
the army plans to develop two means of attacking satellites 
with kinetic or nonexplosive warheads fired from 30foot 
missiles based on us territory and with groundbased lasers 
the army has put the kinetic warhead system on a fast 
development track in february it began soliciting bids from 
industry to build between 60 and 75 of the weapons a contractor is 
scheduled to be selected in july and full scale development would 
start in 1992 
the laser program is much further behind 
while the pace of work on kinetic antisatellite or asat 
weaponry is picking up the size of the eventual system has been 
scaled back according to army officials 
brig gen morgan jellett who is in charge of the asat program 
said that until last december the army had planned to buy 300 of 
the weapons or double the number of soviet satellites now 
deployed in december it was decided that 60 to 75 weapons would be 
enough to attack the most crucial soviet space targets he said 
congressional debate on the defense budget so far this year has 
focused mainly on biggercost projects such as the b2 bomber the 
mx intercontinental ballistic missile and other strategic systems 
and on savings from demobilizing troops the antisatellite 
program however is beginning to draw more attention 
im going to do everything i can to scrub it sen dale 
bumpers dark a member of the senate appropriations committee 
said in an interview it just doesnt make any sense 
bumpers said the soviets limited antisatellite capability is 
no threat to us space interests and that the bush administration 
should take up the soviets offer to negotiate a ban on the systems 
before both sides shell out billions to build them 
the groundbased antisatellite program as described by its 
managers in recent interviews at the armys strategic defense 
command in huntsville ala would not violate us arms treaty 
obligations yet critics say it could reignite the superpower arms 
race 
sen john glenn dohio said in a march 7 floor speech that he 
feared the united states could be sparking a superpower asat 
race especially damaging to us space interests particularly 
since the air force this year retired its fleet of sr71 blackbird 
spy planes which are less vulnerable to attack than lowearth 
orbit satellites 
even the army acknowledges that the soviets probably would 
respond to deployment of us antisatellite or asat weapons by 
fielding their own version to knock out us satellites improving 
defenses for their own satellites and by developing a weapon to 
attack the us antisatellite systems 
jellett sought to play down the countermeasures issue 
saying we dont see those being developed anytime soon 
yet an october 1989 strategic defense command document outlining 
a management plan for asat work said that as early as 1996 the 
projected start of deploying a us antisatellite system moscow 
would have the technical and economic means to respond by 
enhancing the effectiveness of their force and degrading the 
effectiveness of the american system were it to be operated 
the 150pound kinetic warheads often called hittokill 
projectiles because they would literally destroy a target by 
ramming it enjoys the advantage over lasers of being effective in 
any weather conditions and of making an easily verified kill 
the advantage of the laser is that it would produce less debris 
in space and could make a covert strike disabling a satellite by 
blinding its electronics system but not causing it to explode 
jellett said a laser asat weapon could be used for example to 
covertly disable the soviet mir space station which us officials 
claim could be used for surveillance and military targeting 
jellett said the mir would be one of the main targets of an asat 
system but for the purpose of disabling it not destroying it 
the army work is not part of the strategic defense initiative 
known as star wars which would put weapons in space to shoot down 
ballistic missiles

the new owners of colt firearms are weighing 
whether to resume production of the colt ar15 the popular 
usmade assaultstyle rifle the former owners stopped sales to 
civilians last year when the government banned imports of similar 
weapons 
ron stilwell executive vice president and chief operating 
officer of what is now called colts manufacturing co said the 
hartford connbased company is considering whether to start 
producing ar15s for civilians again 
we are evaluating that stilwell said in an interview we 
will have some formal statements on it in the future 
we firmly believe it is a legitimate sporting system and in 
fact the only system that can be used for certain national target 
matches he said 
the firearms division of colt industries was sold march 22 to a 
group of investors cf holding 
the colt ar15 was the most popular usmade semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifle when the former owners shut down production for 
the civilian market in march 1989 
the action occurred the day after the federal government imposed 
a temporary import ban on dozens of foreignmade weapons with 
similar characteristics the import ban became permanent last july 
on 43 styles of rifles 
at the time colt industries spokesman mike dunn said we want 
to conform to the spirit of the law although we werent 
specifically mentioned in the letter of the law 
dunn said late friday that colt never resumed production of the 
ar15 for civilian use 
susan whitmore of handgun control inc said she was disappointed 
that colts new management may reverse that decision 
theyre putting profits over public safety whitmore said 
we dont want to see one more assault weapon on the streets and 
this is just going to add to it

in 1988 colt produced 17368 of the ar15s according to a list 
provided by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to rep 
pete stark dcalif a gun control advocate stark released the 
list of usmade semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles and pistols on 
sunday 
the ar15 represented the largest domestic production of any 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifle or pistol and copies of it made 
by other manufacturers totaled 9411 
the atf list of 78201 rifles and pistols produced in 1988 
included 38108 rifles and an unknown number of quality parts 
bushmaster rifles and ruger mini 14s as well as 40093 pistols 
the ban on imports did not include pistols 
the second and third largest number of us assaultstyle 
weapons produced in 1988 were the intratec tec 9 pistols at 
13770 and the mac11 pistols at 12273 according to the atf 
list 
the 26 types of weapons on the list had at least one of the 
following assaulttype characteristics threaded barrels to 
accommodate a silencer flash suppressors that could hide the 
shooters position at night and prevent a loss of night vision 
provisions for mounting a bayonet and folding or collapsible 
stocks 
the atf listed such characteristics when it defined 43 types of 
foreignmade guns as semiautomatic assault rifles that it 
banned from import last july 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
when atf director stephen e higgins announced the ban on 
imports he said a study had found that the models were not being 
used for sporting uses a requirement for imports 
atf does not control domestically produced weapons congress 
does 
the house judiciary subcommittee on crime approved a bill two 
weeks ago that would outlaw domestic assaultstyle weapons the 
bill introduced by rep william hughes dnj outlaws domestic 
and foreignmade assaultstyle rifles it also would outlaw 
domestic and imported assaultstyle pistols which can accept a 
silencer or a bayonet the measure approved 53 now awaits action 
in the house judiciary committee 
foreign imports of semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles were far 
outnumbering domestic production even before the import ban was 
imposed according to atf 
atf spokesman jack killorin said imports of the 43 styles of 
rifles later banned totaled 84154 in 1986 and 83695 in 1987 
although the atf did not total such imports in 1988 the approved 
permits and pending requests skyrocketed in 1989 when the weapons 
were banned 
on april 7 1989 a month after the temporary ban was imposed 
there were permits approved or requested to import a total of 
926510 semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons he said

legislation that would allow employers for the 
first time to provide union workers with housing assistance is on 
the fast track toward final passage in congress this week 
the bill sponsored by a boston hotel workers union local calls 
for a rare amendment to the tafthartley labor law that would allow 
employers to set aside money to help workers buy or rent housing 
its a privatesector initiative it doesnt cost the 
government a penny said bruce marks housing director for the 
5000member boston hotel workers local 26 its a pure 
partnership to deal with a major social issue the lack of 
affordable housing 
the bill is more than a boon to unions marks said large 
employers around the country have been contacting local 26 asking 
for details about the plan many companies expressing an interest 
are in areas where living costs are high making it difficult to 
recruit and keep employees 
the legislation carrying the unanimous recommendation of the 
house education and labor committee is on the suspension 
calendar for house floor debate this week meaning that it has 
been deemed noncontroversial 
in a clear sign of the legislations ideological breadth sens 
edward kennedy dmass and orrin hatch rutah cosponsored the 
bill in the senate where it already has received final approval 
its very important that we join with the senate in passing 
this legislation out of congress and i think the full house will 
support it unanimously said rep william clay dmo chairman 
of the labormanagement relations subcommittee and the house 
sponsor of the bill 
housing secretary jack kemp and labor secretary elizabeth dole 
are strongly behind the bill according to clay and union officials 
tafthartley the nations overriding labor relations law for 43 
years includes anticorruption provisions that prohibit management 
from making direct payments to unions except for certain purposes 
including employee education health and retirement the amendment 
up for a vote tuesday would add housing to that list 
in december 1988 the hotel workers negotiated an agreement with 
nine boston hotels calling for wage and work improvements and an 
unprecedented housing trust fund the agreement required the hotels 
to contribute 5 cents per hour for every employee into the trust 
workers would not have to contribute 
if congress approves the fund now estimated at about 1 
million will be available to pay loan collaterals help with down 
payments reduce mortgage interest rates or pay apartment fees or 
security deposits 
workers will apply to a joint unionmanagement board for 
assistance a formula based on the employees financial need will 
be used to determine whether or how much money the worker receives 
the contract stipulates that if the tafthartley amendment is 
not made by may 31 the trust fund money will revert to a fund used 
for conventional union benefits 
a particular challenge the union faced was a general handsoff 
policy in congress toward the tafthartley act 
weve always had a fear of opening up the law clay said

the mood in the lithuanian capital was 
grim sunday as the soviet army moved in dozens of additional 
armored personnel carriers just hours after a threatening statement 
from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the combination of the warning the reinforcements fridays 
seizure of a lithuanian government building by soviet troops and 
the soviet unions drive to remove foreign correspondents from the 
republic by sunday night had many people worried that martial law 
would be imposed within days 
i fear they are going to start shooting said one 
middleaged lithuanian woman 
last week gorbachev said he would use force only if there was a 
threat to life since then soviet authorities have complained of 
several sniper attacks on soldiers 
lithuanian officials said they can find no evidence to support 
the allegations and many fear that the reports are being created to 
serve as a pretext for a military crackdown 
the silence from western nations in the face of these moves left 
little hope of aid from abroad 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said last tuesday the 
us government did not want to inflame the situation by 
issuing comments on the soviet armys actions in lithuania the 
army rounded up at least 23 lithuanian deserters last week and has 
occupied several buildings 
in london an assistant to lithuanias prime minister laima 
andrikiene was kept waiting while prime minister margaret thatcher 
spoke with gorbachev on the telephone 
when thatchers conversation with the soviet president ended 
ms andrikienes appointment was canceled another member of the 
delegation parliamentarian emanuelis zingeris said 
gorbachev has said he fears a breakup of the soviet union could 
result in chaos and violent conflict he has said it would uproot 
many of the 60 million people who do not live in their ancestral 
lands 
saturday night gorbachev urged lithuanian leaders to reverse 
their republics declaration of independence saying they must 
recognize their responsibilty for the lithuanian peoples 
security and wellbeing for the state of democracy in the whole 
country and stability in the world 
he warned that if they refuse the developments may have grave 
consequences for all of us 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis said saturday night 
gorbachev was demanding impossible things but said he would 
send a delegation to moscow on monday to try to begin negotiations 
on sunday the last foreign correspondents were being rousted 
out of the republic hundreds of journalists from across the world 
obeyed the soviet governments order to depart fearing the loss of 
their moscow bureaus if they refused 
many said they were depressed at being forced to leave lithuania 
after gorbachevs warning 
you do get this very sick feeling in your stomach that as soon 
as we leave its not going to be pretty said jonathan 
sanders of cbs 
people in the lithuanian tv station are very nervous he 
said sanders said the lithuanian journalists expect their 
reporting of the moscowvilnius war of nerves to be halted as soon 
as foreign networks are no longer on hand to record a soviet 
takeover of their stations 
the soviet army reinforced its garrison in central vilnius 
sunday with at least 45 armored personnel carriers 
its the same brezhnev doctrine at work as in 
czechoslovakia only this time gorbachev is moving with a 
smile slowly and easily said algimantas cekuolis editor of 
ther lithuanian newspaper gintasis krastas who has become a de 
facto spokesman for the independent government 
he was referring to the doctrine under which late soviet leader 
leonid i brezhnev justified the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia 
despite the pressure lithuanian officials say they are 
convinced they will last longer than gorbachevs authority over a 
splintering empire 
our tactics are to hold on a couple of months cekuolis 
said he said he hopes for support from other soviet republics 
moving toward independence and from other democratically minded 
legislators just elected to the russian parliament 
lithuanians also said gorbachev risks the loss of respect in the 
soviet union and in the world if he is unable to assert his 
authority without resorting to force 
they are compromising the leadership of the soviet union 
landsbergis said

support said one prosecutor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
we are just working on what we have the tip of the iceberg 
despite the gravity of the offenses the atmosphere at camp 
crame was more of a family reunion than a maximumsecurity 
stockade guards addressed senior detainees with a respectful 
sir and played with children of the inmates 
four months after the coup attempt only 81 officers have been 
charged the rest are still undergoing investigation while in 
custody under conditions ranging from confinement in a stockade to 
being restricted to military camps 
those at large include gregorio gringo honasan the 
charismatic former lieutenant colonel whose likeness was 
emblazoned on the guards shirt 
other fugitives include former brig gen jose zumel once 
superintendent of the philippine military academy and navy 
commodore domingo calajate valedictorian of his academy class 
no date has been set for trials and sessions involving 
defendants in previous coup attempts dragged on for months before 
verdicts were returned 
in the meantime soldiers who had been among the cream of the 
officer corps wile away their time at stockades discussing the 
countrys future and drafting position papers on alternative 
government 
they break the monotony with an occasional bottle of smuggled 
liquor we like it here joked one senior officer who spoke on

mike levine is angry 
the longtime drug enforcement administration undercover agent 
contends the war on drugs is a sham run by suits in washington 
who care more about their jobs than about winning the war or 
preserving the lives of agents on the street 
levine says they killed the better part of his last major case 
while needlessly putting his life and the lives of other agents in 
jeopardy 
if the plan had been carried out he says agents could have 
arrested leaders of the corporation which runs bolivias cocaine 
operations and a major bolivian money launderer in panama while 
seizing at least 38 tons of cocaine at secret air strips in bolivia 
but it was not to be 
so a frustrated levine who retired from the dea last year 
wrote a book about his experiences called deep cover 
the whole drug war has now become a political grab bag 
levine said in a recent interview all of these people leading 
the war on drugs have their arms in this grab bag for every reason 
you can imagine 
the book focuses on a case operation trifecta that ended in 
early 1988 it resulted in convictions and long sentences for 
several mexican and bolivian drug traffickers 
but levine says it could have done much more if bureaucrats had 
not stood in the way of his plan to buy 15000 kilos more than 
30000 pounds of cocaine with 5 million allowing him to 
penetrate the upper reaches of the bolivian cocaine trade 
among the books contentions 
the agent in charge of deas panama office alfredo fred 
duncan suggested that the undercover agents stay at a marriott 
hotel even though the drug traffickers called it the dea hotel 
and refused to do business there on a later trip dea headquarters 
insisted that the agents again conduct business at the marriott 
duncan was asked several times to keep the corporations 
alleged money launderer in panama remberto rodriguez under 
surveillance but when levine and another agent flew to panama in 
early 1988 to arrest rodriguez duncan professed ignorance about 
who he was where he could be found and even that hed been asked 
to keep track of him 
two months before final meetings between the agents and the 
drug traffickers occurred at an undercover house in la jolla 
calif near san diego us customs officials had escorted tv news 
crews through the home the crews filmed the attic where video 
monitors and other eavesdropping equipment was set up and even 
took photos of lamps with hidden cameras 
reporters also were on hand for the arrests of the mexican and 
bolivian drug traffickers near the la jolla home and the news was 
out all over latin america long before the agents could arrest 
rodriguez or raid the bolivian air strips by the time levine 
arrived in panama rodriguez had disappeared and the air strips had 
been abandoned 
the dea balked at levines plan because its top officials had 
sold congress on the value of operation snowcap in which dea 
agents are sent to south america to help local officials eradicate 
coca crops and cocaine processing laboratories if his operation 
had been successful levine says it would have revealed that 
operation snowcap was a waste of money and unnecessarily put agents 
in harms way 
the only reason any of the plan went forward was because customs 
embarrassed dea into it offering to put up the money levine says 
the dea has been tightlipped about the book even though the 
book criticizes such highranking officials as acting administrator 
terry burke chief of operations david westrate and duncan 
we feel its inappropriate to debate the merits of the 
specifics of his book with anyone and we are not going to have 
anything such as this distract us from our mission dea spokesman 
frank shults said 
its unfortunate that a former narcotics agent has taken on 
all of his former colleagues shults added as an individual 
his view is limited to that of an individual and he was never in a 
position to know the best direction that the agency should take 
at customs spokesman david hoover said we dont have an 
official reaction to his book its not a cause celebre around 
here 
to jim dozier the book was real now the county attorney in 
montgomery county texas dozier spent eight years in the dea after 
two years with customs all of it in drug enforcement 
many things rang true in the case that made me grin with 
frustrations i had in the past with certain cases dozier said in 
an interview 
dozier said he could recall many times when you have something 
good in hand that had to go through 15 lines of bureaucrats who 
hadnt been on the line in years 
their notion of fiscal restraint once put his life in danger he 
said 
when he traveled overseas to work on a possible drug connection 
at a gambling casino the government gave him only about 100 to 
gamble with the drug traffickers meanwhile were putting 50000 
in chips on the table dozier said he allayed their suspicions 
somewhat by claiming he didnt gamble but adds there arent too 
many people like that who dont gamble 
the moral if you want to swim around with a bunch of ducks 
youve got to look like a duck

the head of the environmental protection 
agency predicted sunday the senate will respond to a threatened 
veto by president bush and reject a housepassed effort to 
establish a politically independent bureau for collecting and 
analyzing environmental data 
we do not want an independent agency that we have no control 
over as part of a proposed cabinetlevel department of the 
environment replacing the epa administrator william k reilly said 
we are confident the senate will not have a provision of that 
sort the epa chief said 
president bush in january endorsed a congressional effort 
already afoot to elevate epa to cabinet status however the house 
in approving the bill last week said it wanted an independent 
bureau of environmental statistics in the new department headed by 
a civil servant who could be dismissed only for malfeasance 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater immediately raised the 
threat of a veto saying the house bill gives a degree of 
independence to this unit of the agency which we feel is 
unconstitutional fitzwater expressed confidence the 
administration could sustain a veto in congress 
reilly appearing on nbctvs meet the press program called 
the proposal for an independent data agency a slight to the epa 
and said it suggests that were not capable of developing quality 
information and doing environmental statistical collection 
one inference i draw from the efforts by some democrats in the 
house to create such an entity is that they dont expect to be in 
power very soon he said 
rep john conyers dmich who as chairman of the house 
committee on government operations is the chief sponsor of the 
independent data agency provision said it would put a halt to 
conflicts of interest that had raised questions in the past 
about epa analyses 
conyers cited a case last year in which epa scientists were 
directed by the white house office of management and budget to 
change their testimony to congress about global warming because it 
did not fit with the administrations view 
under the housepassed bill the bureau of environmental 
statistics would function much like the bureau of labor statistics 
does under the umbrella of the labor department 
its head would be named to a fouryear term and would not be 
subject to dismissal except for malfeasance just as with bureau of 
labor statistics administration officials including the secretary 
of the department would not have authority to review or alter 
reports by the new environmental data bureau before they are 
released 
a similar bill elevating epa to cabinet status has been approved 
by the senate governmental affairs committee but has not yet been 
taken up by the full senate both bush and sponsors of the measure 
had hoped to have it ready for his signature by april 22 the 20th 
anniversary of the first earth day celebration 
neither version of the bill envisions a significant expansion of 
epa as a department rather than a regulatory agency epa now has a 
staff of about 16000 employees and budget of 55 billion

thousands of civilians fled lebanons 
christian enclave sunday as a ceasefire ended two days of fierce 
fighting between rival christian forces that left 63 dead and 133 
wounded 
police said an uneasy calm reigned over the major warfronts in 
raindrenched east beirut and the fogshrouded highlands of 
kesrouan province in the christian hinterland northeast of the 
capital 
the truce was negotiated by a threeman christian mediation 
committee backed by the vatican it is the 15th ceasefire in two 
months 
a police spokesman said many villages have been nearly wiped out 
by shellfire and large sections of several posh mountain resort 
towns were gutted yet neither side has gained a single inch of 
territory 
the spokesman who could not be named under standing 
regulations said the truce was allowing rescue workers to remove 
bodies and civilians to flee the truce seems to be holding at 
least momentarily 
the latest round of fighting broke out at dawn friday pitting 
gen michel aouns 19000 army troops against christian warlord 
samir geageas 6000strong lebanese forces militia 
the two days of fighting raised the number of casualties to 839 
dead and 2289 wounded since jan 30 when aoun moved against 
geagea to stamp out the main challenge to his authority in the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
the two sides battled with artillery tanks and multibarreled 
rocket launchers 
despite pitched battles and housetohouse fighting aouns army 
failed to break through lebanese forces defenses in kesrouan or 
east beiruts ashrafiyeh and karantina districts leaving geagea in 
full control of twothirds of the christian enclave 
aoun and his troops remain in metn province with no airport or 
harbor to resupply hostile syrian troops ring all overland inlets 
to his territory 
the showdown remains inconclusive on the battleground but 
geagea is rapidly emerging as the political victor said a 
longtime lebanon analyst who requested anonymity 
tens of thousands of residents emerged from basements and bomb 
shelters at first light in east beirut to examine the destruction 
wreaked on their homes and businesses by the two days of fighting 
thousands hurriedly packed beds mattresses and blankets into 
taxis and fled to the syriancontrolled western sector of the 
divided capital others stockpiled food water and powder milk 
fearing the ceasefire would not last 
police estimate that up to onethird of the enclaves 1 million 
inhabitants have fled since feb 1 
i couldnt risk staying theyre definitely reloading to start 
all over again said maroun bustani a christian pharmacist 
after he fled with his wife and two children into west beirut 
in a sunday sermon maronite patriarch nasrallah sfeir asked 
have we all been hit by triple blindness the blindness of the 
eye the blindness of the heart and the blindness of the 
conscience 
how can we be blind to the sight of homeless families taking 
shelter in forests he said at the chapel in bkirki where 
hundreds of families had taken refuge in the pine forest 
aoun and geagea are both maronites a catholic sect that has 
dominated lebaonons political life since independence from france 
in 1943 
geagea has backed the presidency of elias hrawi a maronite who 
was elected by parliament nov 24 with a mandate to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to resolve lebanons 15yearold civil 
war the accord gives moslems an equal share of power with 
christians 
hrawi fired aoun as army commander and interim prime minister 
but the general has held out in the presidential palace in a 
christian enclave east of beirut claiming hrawis election is 
unconstitutional 
aoun also rejected the arab league peace plan saying it did not 
guarantee the total withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from lebanon

the alleged ringleader of a white mob charged in 
the killing of a black teenager goes on trial monday along with 
the accused triggerman as prosecutors try to recover from a series 
of setbacks in their case 
assistant brooklyn district attorney bruce mcintyre who had 
been tipped to present opening arguments abruptly quit as trial 
strategies were being finalized last week saying he resented being 
a token black at the prosecution table 
prosecutors endured another blow three weeks ago when john 
vento 21 an important witness in the slaying backed out of a 
deal and decided to face seconddegree murder charges rather than 
testify against his friends 
seven other young white men from bensonhurst have been charged 
in the aug 23 slaying of yusuf hawkins a black 16yearold who 
was shot after he went with three friends into the largely italian 
neighborhood in south brooklyn to look at a used car 
 
judge thaddeus owens ruled last week that alleged triggerman 
joseph fama 19 and alleged ringleader keith mondello 20 would 
be the first to stand trial prosecutors said jury selection 
begins monday 
both men are charged with two counts of murder and face 25 years 
to life in prison if convicted five of the others have been 
charged with murder and other crimes and the sixth with assault 
brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes says he is baffled 
by mcintyres resignation and regrets ventos change of heart but 
insists hes confident he has a case he can win 
ventos unexpected defection led prosecutors to seek and get a 
onemonth delay in the start of the trials 
on monday the judge plans to speed the proceedings by 
impaneling two juries the panels will sit side by side in the 
courtroom with one deciding the fate of fama and the other 
considering the case of mondello 
there may be as many as six trials defense lawyers and 
prosecutors say 
the murder labeled racial from the outset by police and 
prosecutors sparked a furor across the city it is widely viewed 
as the most serious racial incident in the city since a december 
1986 attack in new yorks howard beach neighborhood in which a 
black man chased by a gang of whites ran onto a highway and was 
struck and killed by car 
the bensonhurst killing apparently was ignited by a dispute 
between mondello and a former girlfriend gina feliciano as word 
raced through the neighborhood that miss feliciano had invited a 
group of black and hispanic friends to her 18th birthday party 
mondello allegedly recruited some of his friends to take on what 
they saw as intruders on their turf 
the gang of some 30 whites many armed with baseball bats 
mistook hawkins and his three teenage friends all of them black 
as the expected outsiders and set upon them 
as the gang surrounded the four youths fama allegedly stepped 
in with his gun and fired four shots three of which struck hawkins 
and killed him 
the mob scattered when the shots were fired and hawkins 
companions who are expected to testify at the trials were not 
hurt

donald trump opens the worlds 
largest gambling hall monday and his heavily leveraged 
billiondollar taj mahal casino resort needs to rake 1 million a 
day off the boardwalk just to pay its debt 
its 11 competitors meanwhile worry and wonder whether the 
42story taj mahals 3000 slot machines 12 restaurants and 
10000anight suites will bring new customers to the boardwalk or 
steal away old business 
analysts estimate the taj mahal must bring in at least 1 
million a day to pay expenses plus interest on 675 million in 
bonds trump took out to finish the casino he took over from resorts 
international in november 1988 after five years of sporadic 
construction 
the casino is opening at a time when atlantic citys gaming 
market has flattened and new competition for the betting dollar is 
coming from theme casinos in nevada and from new state 
lotteries elsewhere 
trump who owns trump plaza and trump castle casinohotels said 
the taj mahals 120000squarefoot floor and the novelty of a 
gambling hall named for the 16th century indian mausoleum will let 
him exceed the 1 million figure 
the taj mahal will be beyond everything else he said the 
three casinos occupy a similar niche theyre luxury properties 
that cater to high rollers and everybody interested in a good 
time 
not everybody sees the taj mahal as a magnificent success beyond 
its first months when interest is high and the weather is warm 
when the property first opens my guess is it will do no 
wrong said marvin b roffman a former gaming analyst for janney 
montgomery scott whose published remarks about the taj mahal led to 
his firing when trump complained to the brokerage company 
the big question mark is is it sustainable in the winter 
months roffman said 
roffman said he expects a taj mahal win or gross revenues 
of 35 million to 40 million in its first month the win does not 
take expenses into account and thus is not profit 
the mirage hotel helped by the sugar ray leonardroberto duran 
fight took in more than 40 million in its first month of 
operation in las vegas caesars hotel casino set atlantic citys 
record with a win of 328 million last july 
last years win leader for the year trump plaza took in 
3057 million 
daniel lee a gaming analyst with first boston also predicted a 
35 million to 40 million win for the first month and expects that 
pace to continue he said he expects a 375 million win for the 
year exceeding 1 million a day for the taj majal 
is it too leveraged probably not lee said do i think 
hell default certainly not 
state division of gaming enforcement director anthony parrillo 
said the taj mahal has proven it will be financially sound for the 
oneyear licensing period 
atlantic city had been loaded with debt on these properties 
parrillo said the same can be said for the taj thats not to 
say it cant be profitable 
casino president walter j haybert said the 5200seat mark 
etess arena named after one of two top taj mahal executives who 
died in a october helicopter crash will draw convention and event 
business in lean months 
beyond the gold green and blue minarets that festoon the casino 
and give it that certain taj mahal flavor are the citys 11 other 
casinos worried about losing business after a year of only 26 
percent growth 
the showboat hotel casino and merv griffins resorts casino 
hotel which are bookends to the taj mahal are banking on their 
new neighbor to bring customers to what has been the relatively 
barren north end of the boardwalk 
trump said the taj mahal might take away rivals business in the 
short run but would lead to longterm growth in a market that had 
its first decline in tourist visits since the first casino opened 
in 1978 
casino association president thomas carver said the other 
casinos feel the taj mahal could cause a tremendous spurt in the 
market but also approach the opening with a lot of 
trepidation 
everybody knows that the concentration of interest will be in 
that general area carver said referring to the northern end of 
the boardwalk the specific gravity of the town may change 
the wild card in the game is trump himself and his 
nameinthenews quality that accelerated with his recent marital 
breakup 
trump admits the gossip accounts for many of the 1500 media 
credentials issued for the opening its a strange phenomena but 
someday well figure it all out he said

americans desire for lowfat food is posing a 
new threat in congress to dairy farmers whose surplus butter ends 
up in government warehouses because consumers dont want it on 
their table 
under consideration as part of the 1990 farm bill is a change in 
the price support structure that would cut into the subsidies 
received by farmers who produce more milkfat than the market will 
bear 
introduced by reps charles stenholm dtexas and steve 
gunderson rwis the plan would penalize farmers who produce more 
than their limit as part of a nationwide ceiling on milkfat 
production 
however the bill also would raise the support price what the 
government pays for 100 pounds of milk if the market price falls 
below that amount from the current 1010 per 100 pounds of milk 
to 1060 
while we do that we also get at the milkfat problem currently 
plaguing the dairy industry said gunderson 
currently price supports drop by 50 cents per 100 pounds when 
government purchases for the year are estimated to exceed 5 billion 
pounds the bush administration wants to continue that system 
which according its estimates could lead to price supports 
dropping to 860 by 1993 
gundersons and stenholms bill would prevent the administration 
from reducing the price support any lower than 1010 
the national milk producers federation which represents dairy 
cooperatives wants a support of 1060 with no lower price 
available rep harold volkmer dmo is leading the support for 
that position 
the house agriculture dairy subcommittee on dairy which 
stenholm chairs and gunderson vice chairs has set aside tuesday 
for approving the language that would be the dairy title of the 
1990 farm bill 
the solution to the milkfat problem is contentious some 
subcommittee members and the bush administration both contend the 
stenholmgunderson plan is unworkable 
basically the plan calls for a twotiered price support system 
if the government buys more than 7 billion pounds of milk 
products that include 260 million pounds of milkfat and 600 million 
pounds of powered milk and cheese the system begins to operate 
farmers would get the higher support price for a certain 
percentage of their milk and a sharply lower price for the 
overproduced portion 
tom theiding an aide to gunderson said farmers could reduce 
the amount of milkfat they produce by about onetenth of 1 percent 
simply by changing the feed cows eat but he acknowledged that cows 
have been bred to produce more fat and changing that to higher 
protein production will take time 
under the stenholmgunderson bill farmers would be told to 
annually reduce their milkfat production from the previous year 
theilding said 
were trying to get an incentive out to the farmer that 
saysdont give us butter he said

the firing squad that executed romanian 
dictator nicolae ceausescu last december killed official 
antisemitism in that nation only to allow a more dangerous form 
to surface the countrys chief rabbi says 
before the antisemitism was from above now its from 
below rabbi moses rosen said rosen was in washington to ask for 
help in combating the antisemitism finding new expression among 
romanians since the revolution that overthrew ceausescu 
rosen the leader of romanias jewish community for the last 42 
years met with an old friend deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger eagleburger in 1984 interceded on the elderly clerics 
behalf when ceausescu was about to arrest him 
rosen said he described to eagleburger the resurgence of the 
fascist iron guard organization which conducted pogroms against 
romanias jews in 1941 
speaking in an interview rosen said young disciples of the 
organization have been coming back to romania from exile in the 
united states canada and other countries in canada he said some 
of the group members received paramilitary training 
there were 400000 jews left in romania after world war ii 
about half the prewar population now only 20000 remain most of 
them over 60 
rosen said he had received threats on his life in letters mailed 
to his home in bucharest as have other romanian jews a synagogue 
was destroyed recently in a town near the border with hungary he 
said 
rosen said that while he had been reassured by the government 
that it would punish those responsible for antisemitic acts he 
was not sure how effective the authorities could be 
there is a power vacuum a breakdown of law and order he 
said this was evident in an outbreak of vicious street violence 
earlier this month between ethnic hungarians and romanians in the 
province of transylvania 
echoing a scathing editorial rosen wrote recently in one of his 
countrys major newspapers the rabbi said of the jews enemies 
what do they want from us what harm does it cause if we wait 
for our graves to be here next to those of our parents and 
forefathers

the curse that hangs over wagners magic golden 
ring and brings misfortune to his characters seemed to extend to 
the production as well at the metropolitan operas first 
performance of das rheingold this season 
at a crucial moment in the final scene on saturday night the 
greedy giant fafner reaches to snatch the ring from a pile of 
treasure instead it fell to the stage and rolled away from him 
coming to rest perilously close to the orchestra pit 
there it remained for the rest of the opera symbolic of how 
this production for all its musical splendor remains hampered by 
stage effects that sometimes seem amateurish or misguided 
the met wanted a traditional literalminded ring cycle free 
from the psychological and political interpretations fashionable in 
europe in recent years thats ok but it puts a tremendous burden 
on the sets and projections by guenther schneidersiemssen and the 
lighting by gil wechsler to seem truly magical where wagner called 
for magic 
in scene three of rheingold for example the vicious dwarf 
alberich is supposed to change into a serpent then a toad by 
means of a helmet fashioned out of the gold he has stolen from the 
rhinemaidens surely in an age of stage wizardry that has brought 
us phantom of the opera his transformation could be managed 
more convincingly than to have him visibly sneak off stage behind a 
cloud of smoke each time 
the serpent by the way has a new wrinkle this season he 
emits showers of sparks that make him livelier if not particularly 
scary well see if there has been any similar tinkering with the 
dragon that figures in the third opera of the cycle siegfried 
up to now he has looked rather disgusting but not realistic enough 
to be frightening 
musically the performance with a mostly familiar cast was 
just about all one could hope for 
james morris wotan remains a pillar of vocal strength and 
ekkehard wlaschihas alberich was a good match for him siegfried 
jerusalem repeated his wonderfully slimy interpretation of loge 
the god of fire but he sounded more raspy than mellifluous in his 
upper register that doesnt matter much for loge but it makes one 
wonder how hell cope with the heroic demands of the young 
siegfried a part hell sing for the first time at the met in a 
couple of weeks 
helga dernesch found fricka wotans nagging wife a congenial 
role for her waning vocal resources since it requires no high 
notes marianne haggaender was lovely as her sister freia and 
alan held made a good impression as the god froh kaaren erickson 
diane kesling and meredith parsons were an unusually vivid trio of 
rhinemaidens and matti salminen and janhendrik rootering made a 
formidable pair of giants 
the met orchestra conducted by james levine has polished its 
playing of this work brilliantly over the last three seasons 
the performance was recorded by television cameras for broadcast 
as part of the complete ring cycle on four consecutive nights 
beginning june 18 over the public broadcasting service 
the next installment die walkuere will be broadcast over 
the texaco radio network on saturday afternoon april 7

decades before mcdonalds flaunted its 
golden arches a roadside diner that looked like a beached tugboat 
lured customers with oldfashioned root beer and a newfangled 
idea a driveup window 
clarence donley boasts his maidrite sandwich shop has the 
worlds first and oldest driveup window although experts on 
commercial architecture say that claim would be hard to prove 
still the 66yearold building is listed on the national 
register of historic places with such prestigious springfield 
monuments as lincolns tomb the statehouse and the executive 
mansion 
in terms of fastfood chains it is one of the oldest existing 
restaurants in the country said michael b jackson an architect 
with the illinois historic preservation agency 
driveup restaurants like maidrite antecedents of todays 
major fastfood chains began popping up across the country in the 
early 1920s 
the springfield building opened in 1924 donley said the shop 
became part of the maidrite chain whose claim to fame is a 
sandwich of crumbled steamed ground beef and onions when the 
chain was founded a couple of years later 
today about 100 maidrites are scattered across the midwest 
but the springfield one is the only one still operating out of its 
original building 
the original red and white woodframed structure was narrow and 
shaped like a tugboat it had three stools at its counter and room 
for at most 13 skinny customers in woodbenched booths 
donley bought the shop 19 years ago and in 1985 expanded the 
store to almost three times its original size 
it hasnt lost its historical significance because of the 
addition jackson said i think they did a good job of 
preserving the original form of the building 
jackson who is also a spokesman for the washington dcbased 
society for commercial archeology said the claim that the 
maidrite driveup window is the oldest is not unreasonable 
but would be difficult to substantiate 
he said the organizations newsletter may carry a notice asking 
if anyone knows of an older driveup window 
donley prides himself on not giving in to the whims of the 
fastfood culture he still serves the same basic menu of maidrite 
loosemeat hamburgers french fries and root beer in a frosty mug 
that menu has brought maidrite and donley an almost cultlike 
following 
they come from all over california florida he said 
theyll come back and ask me to make up a quart of the maidrite 
meat so they can freeze it and take it home with them 
melvin boyd 68 and his wife bonita 63 said they had been 
coming to maidrite for almost 40 years their 35yearold son 
les said he eats there at least once a week 
mrs boyd said the shops faithful crowd of lunchtime regulars 
has nothing to do with its historic architecture if this place 
is a landmark its because it makes such great hamburgers she 
said

nelson mandela on sunday offered 
to meet with president fw de klerk to discuss how to end 
violence but said police conduct will determine when the african 
national congress decides to talk with the government 
mandela indicated to reporters that he is having differences 
with fellow leaders within his antiapartheid organization though 
he refused to discuss it publicly 
authorities said eight more people died in the past 24 hours 
during black factional fighting and clashes between protesters and 
police in natal province 
addressing an estimated 300000 people in this southern black 
township outside port elizabeth the acting leader of the anc 
appealed to whites to condemn police shootings of black 
demonstrators 
whites here have become used to police shootings of black 
demonstrators mandela said 
he defended the anc decision to cancel april 11 talks with the 
government in protest of a clash last monday between police and 
protesters that killed more than 10 blacks and injured 400 in 
sebokeng south of johannesburg 
depending on the response of police the anc and the 
government could work out a new date for formal talks he said 
the actions of the police against peaceful protest in various 
parts of the country are in direct conflict with the public 
positions being taken by the government 
mandela was nearly crushed by black people surging forward to 
touch him as marshals fought to push him to the speakers platform 
on an open field in the township 
de klerk has said he is studying a report on the shootings in 
sebokeng but that in the meantime talks should be held on avoiding 
further violence he said he had told mandela my door remained 
open and he was welcome to meet with me 
at a news conference after the rally mandela said he is willing 
to meet with de klerk to discuss the violence but gave no specific 
time he indicated it would follow his visit monday and tuesday to 
southeastern natal province where five years of black factional 
fighting has intensified in the past week causing scores of deaths 
and hundreds of injuries 
mandela also said he hoped during his twoday trip to meet 
with mangosuthu buthelezi although he was persuaded by natal anc 
officials to cancel a monday a joint peace rally he had suggested 
holding with the zulu homeland leader 
the anc executive in lusaka zambia announced saturday it 
canceled the meeting mandela and an anc delegation were to have 
held with the president on april 11 the discussion was to have 
focused on obstacles to negotiations about an end to white minority 
rule 
during sundays news conference mandela was questioned 
repeatedly about two cancellations in two days of his initiatives 
he would not talk about specifics or explain what the 
cancellations meant to his position as deputy president of the anc 
but he acknowledged that he had differences of opinions with other 
anc leaders 
i do not intend discussing any differences among black 
leaders he said but i prefer addressing the question to the 
particular person involved and not through making use of the public 
media for settling disputes 
mandela released from 27 years imprisonment on feb 11 is the 
effective head of the anc while president oliver tambo recovers in 
sweden from a stroke but events of the past two days suggest he 
may not have the freedom to pursue initiatives without approval of 
younger more militant anc leaders 
differences of opinion and lack of coordination among the 
internal and exile leaders have also increased since the 
organization was legalized feb 2 
sometimes leaders deny events have occurred or insist that 
statements havent been made after journalists have witnessed and 
reported them some officials issue statements on behalf of the 
anc but refuse to identify themselves or say who has authorized 
the statement

the united states is considering bold 
imaginative proposals to deal with controversial nato plans for a 
new shortrange nuclear missile in europe a senior administration 
official said 
the idea of updating the lance missile which would be based on 
west german soil and used to halt a soviet thrust through central 
europe has run into trouble in congress 
it also has encountered fierce public opposition in west germany 
in light of moves toward democracy in poland and hungary and by 
the prospects for german reunification 
a nato meeting last spring in brussels nearly collapsed over the 
issue when us and british officials pressed for the 
modernization of the lance but ran into stiff opposition from west 
german and other alliance members 
in the end the alliance smoothed over the matter by agreeing to 
postpone a decision on deploying the missile until 1992 
but the surge of change in europe and pressure in congress for 
slashing the us military budget is forcing open the debate once 
again 
in his 1991 pentagon budget defense secretary dick cheney has 
asked congress for 1122 million to develop a new shortrange 
missile as a replacement for the aging groundbased lance 
currently deployed throughout europe 
faced with the prospect of a balky congress and another 
intraalliance showdown over the issue at the annual spring session 
of natos nuclear planning group officials on both sides of the 
atlantic are working on alternative ideas said the us official 
who spoke friday on condition of anonymity 
the official declined to elaborate nor would he answer directly 
when asked whether us officials were contemplating dropping the 
idea of moving ahead with the lance modernization 
but he said a host of informal ideas are being studied he 
emphasized that no formal administration decisions have been made 
on the missile issue 
cables are flying all around the official said were 
looking for bold imaginative proposals to present at the npg 
nuclear planning group 
the session is informally scheduled for next month 
the official pointed out that it is an alliance matter that must 
be dealt with within the framework of negotiations inside the nato 
partnership 
we dont have anything hard and fast yet the official said 
but its clear that the alliance isnt sitting on its hands 
he added we know that the world has changed 
in an interview earlier this month with the publication defense 
news gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said he had not discussed alternative lance deployments such as 
basing unassembled missiles in britain 
the lance issue opens a pandoras box of questions since it is 
not the alliances only shortrange nuclear missile 
such missiles have not been included in any superpower arms 
control negotiations but the west germans would like to see them 
introduced into the process 
formally the alliance has said it will not enter into such 
talks until after the eastwest conventional force reduction talks 
are implemented 
the alliances military strategy is based on the concept of 
flexible response the idea that it must have a landbased 
nuclear capability to respond to a soviet assault 
the removal of the intermediaterange nuclear missiles under the 
inf ussoviet missile accord left the shortrange nuclear weapons 
as the major landbased system 
there are 88 lance missile launchers in europe each with a 
range of less than 100 miles the updated version of the weapon 
would be able to reach targets up to 280 miles away 
most of the 88 launchers and their 700 warheads are based on 
west german soil 
but us military officials have warned recently that despite 
the changes that have swept the warsaw pact theyve seen little 
reduction in its stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons

a panel of congressional leaders scholars former government 
officials and retired military officers has suggested the 
administrations 1122 million request for the lance program 
would be better spent elsewhere 
in a report sponsored by the johns hopkins foreign policy 
institute the group said the us nuclear guarantee and the 
presence of a substantial number of us troops in europe will 
continue to serve us interests for years to come 
the study put forward to a group of defense writers by sen 
william cohen rmaine and former defense secretary harold brown 
said however that the mission number and structure of 
shortrange nuclear forces should be reviewed prior to the opening 
of talks on these weapons 
in view of us budgetary constraints and west germanys firm 
opposition to deploying new shortrange nucleararmed missiles 
the group concludes that funds requested in the fiscal 1991 budget 
for the lance modernization program would be better spent 
elsewhere a statement by the group said

east germans are becoming restless with worry 
that they will be plunged into poverty when their nation is unified 
with west germany the countrys outgoing communist premier said in 
an interview published sunday 
hans modrow who stands to lose his job in the coming weeks when 
a new government takes office said west german chancellor helmut 
kohl is backing away from promises to east german voters that their 
money would be worth the same as west german marks 
modrow said kohl was able to influence the outcome of the east 
german elections by promising prosperity to east german voters if 
they elected candidates who favor the chancellors plan for quick 
unification 
inevitably a situation has therefore developed which 
contradicts all that chancellor kohl repeatedly said during the 
election campaign modrow was quoted as saying by the west german 
bild newspaper 
modrow told the paper that east germans are becoming 
increasingly upset that they will be shortchanged by the 
monetary merger he said kohl should bear responisibility for any 
strikes or demonstrations 
some believe the debate over the conversion rate could affect 
the outcome of west germanys general election later this year and 
determine how many more east germans flee their country for the 
west 
east germans reacted with alarm this weekend after the west 
german central bank announced it was proposing an exchange rate of 
two east german marks for one west german mark as part of a plan to 
merge the nations currencies 
following a meeting between the east german christian democrat 
chairman lothar de maiziere and social democrat deputy chief 
markus merkel both men said they rejected the proposed 21 
monetary union rate 
our goal is a money exchange of 11 de maiziere told 
reporters i see no clear or understandable reason to change that 
position 
merkel said the social democrats reject the 21 proposed rate as 
totally unacceptable 
meanwhile the head of east germanys labor union federation 
helga mausch told the official news agency adn that the 
organization was urging its 86 million members to fight for 
their rights and demonstrate next week against the proposed 
exchange rate 
east germans who have amassed large savings because of a 
shortage of consumer goods under the communists were hoping for a 
11 conversion based on election campaign speeches made by kohl 
and other conservatives 
kohl said saturday he never promised an equal exchange of east 
german marks for west german marks but modrow said kohl did 
he promised it again and again bild quoted modrow as 
saying the voters clearly saw it that way the outcome of the 
election was as a result of those promises 
east germans voting in their first free elections on march 18 
overwhelmingly chose a christian democratled conservative 
alliance that kohl helped organized 
kohl made regular trips to the east to campaign for the 
coalition 
the christian democrats continued to negotiate sunday with the 
secondplace finisher in the election the leftleaning social 
democrats on forming a coalition that would dominate east 
germanys new 400member parliament 
modrow leads the overhauled communist party that embraced a form 
of democratic socialism after the old stalinist regime was 
overthrown during last years mass demonstrations 
the communists finished a distant third in the elections the 
new parliament is expected to convene for the first time this week 
under the exchange rate established by the former communist 
regime three east german marks bought one west german mark the 
east german mark is nonconvertible however and has virtually no 
value in western markets 
karl otto poehl the chairman of west germanys bundesbank said 
saturday the state banks plan for a 21 conversion actually raises 
the value of the east german mark small savings accounts of up to 
2000 marks 1175 still would be exchanged at a 11 rate poehl 
said 
kohls government facing elections in december is trying to 
walk a fine line between living up to election promises to east 
german voters without placing too great an economic burden on west 
german voters 
east germanys collapsing economy and the nearly 500000 east 
germans who fled to the west since january 1989 were main factors 
in the revolt that ousted the old communist regime 
some officials including ulf fink of kohls christian 
democratic union have predicted that anything less than a 11 
conversion could cause a new exodus of east germans to the west 
another exodus would be more costly than a general 11 rate 
for all savings fink was quoted by the neue osnabreucker zeitung 
as saying 
west german financial experts say it will cost hundreds of 
billions of marks to improve obsolete industries and repair roads 
and communications in east germany 
much of that burden is expected to affect the wealthy west 
german economy possibly resulting in rising inflation a decline 
in the value of the powerful west mark and perhaps new taxes 
proponents of a 11 conversion say it is necessary to allow east 
german workers and elderly people living off savings accounts to 
maintain adequate living standards in a unified germany 
east germans currently depend on heavy government subsidies for 
housing food and employment the subsidies will be quickly phased 
out in the new freemarket economy when unification comes

prime minister margaret thatcher and opposition 
politicians on sunday blamed extremist groups for turning a 
carnivallike antitax protest in trafalgar square into one of 
londons worst riots this century 
on sunday about 100 protesters chanting no poll tax and 
cant pay wont pay clashed with police for a second day when 
home secretary david waddington toured the scene of saturdays 
riot four people were arrested 
a protest by 40000 people against a new local tax turned 
violent saturday when thousands of militants smashed windows set 
cars ablaze and battled police for several hours hundreds of 
people were injured and hundreds were arrested 
the socalled community charge which took effect sunday in 
england and wales replaces a property tax with a levy on each 
adult and increases the amount many pay by up to a third critics 
say its unfair because britains richest man the duke of 
westminster pays the same rate as his gardener 
ms thatcher told reporters of her absolute horror at 
saturdays violence 
people have a right to demonstrate peacefully this was taken 
over by some extreme groups who used violence with no consideration 
for others or their property she said near her country residence 
in chequers 
labor party chief neil kinnock whose party is 28 points ahead 
of mrs thatchers conservatives said those who caused the 
violence must be treated as criminals and punished 
scotland yard launched a toplevel investigation into the 
sixhour street battle which sent 58 police and 86 civilians to the 
hospital injured 22 police horses and caused hundreds of thousands 
of dollars of damage 
detective chief supt roy ramm leading the investigation said 
341 people had been arrested for offenses including arson robbery 
serious assault criminal damage and looting 
the heart of london looked like a war zone after a battle on 
sunday 
cleanup crews cleared rubble and burnedout cars from the 
streets and strollers wandered past boardedup restaurants pubs 
and shops whose windows had been smashed many victims were among 
britains most exclusive names libertys burberrys mappin and 
webb dickens and jones 
in trafalgar square a pall of black smoke was still rising from 
construction cabins on the side of a sevenstory building 
undergoing renovation which had been set on fire by the protesters 
the south african embassy across the street had smashed windows and 
one window area blackened by a firebomb that missed setting the 
building ablaze 
we are supposed to be the violent ones in the usa said 
tourist harold eaton of st louis surveying the scene i am 
surprised that something like this could happen in what is such a 
civilized place 
the independent on sunday newspaper called it the worst riot in 
central london this century scotland yard said it was one of the 
worst but nobody had yet researched whether it was the worst 
chief inspector graham bartlett a 24year police veteran who 
was kicked in the eye and hit on the head when he went to rescue a 
man who had been knocked out said it was the most severe 
attack on police he had ever seen worse than the 1981 brixton riot 
in south london 
david meynell scotland yards deputy assistant commissioner 
blamed the sustained and savage violence on about 3500 people 
who were among a crowd of 40000 at a rally in trafalgar square 
organizers put the crowd at 200000 
i thought yesterday you saw a patch of anarchy coming to 
london meynell told a news conference certainly there were 
some anarchists there and other extreme elements 
meynell said the clashes began when some demonstrators heading 
up whitehall to trafalgar square stopped at the corner of downing 
street where mrs thatcher has her official residence and tried 
to storm the barricaded entrance to the street 
of those injured he said only two police officers and two 
civilians remained hospitalized sunday 
steve nally of the allbritain antipoll tax federation which 
organized the rally said on sky television news that police 
overreacted to provocation by a small number of demonstrators at 
downing street 
the new tax is part of mrs thatchers crusade to bury british 
socialism by hitting at its last bastion local government the 
levy which went into effect in scotland a year ago has been 
greeted with frequent demonstrations some violent 
the ugly scenes in london overshadowed a huge peaceful 
demonstration saturday in glasgow scotland where at least 20000 
people protested the tax 
critics have dubbed it the poll tax after a percapita tax that 
set off a peasants revolt in 1381 
many councils conservative as well as labor have set charges 
far higher than the governments estimate of 450 claiming the 
government failed to consider that inflation would rise above 8 
percent

brazilian political parties are 
joining forces to knock down key provisions of president fernando 
collor de mellos drastic economic austerity plan on which 
congress begins voting monday 
in the first serious hurdle to collors 2weekold 
administration congress will grapple with the 26 measures that 
have paralyzed brazils economy and raised fears of social 
instability lawmakers have two weeks to scrap or alter the plan 
collor brazils first popularly elected leader since 1960 
decreed the countrys fifth and most radical austerity package 
march 16 to curb 4853 percent annual inflation and jump start 
brazils stagnant economy 
but the plan which freezes savings accounts above 1200 for 
18 months severely tightens the money supply raises taxes and 
utility rates and slashes government spending has run into 
mounting opposition 
brazils communist party the leftist workers party and the 
centerleft democratic labor party have condemned the package in 
addition five centrist parties holding a solid majority of about 
400 votes in the 570member congress have demanded substantial 
changes 
voting is expected monday and tuesday on four of the less 
controversial measures 
voting on the heart of the plan is expected to be held later in 
the week or early next week 
under pressure from labor unions businessmen and voters party 
leaders have expressed support for increasing the limit of bank 
withdrawals the freeze has caused a brutal shortage of currency 
causing consumer demand to drop near zero and triggering massive 
layoffs 
unions estimate that more than 200000 brazilians have lost 
their jobs since the plan was implemented hardest hit were 
construction and auto industry workers including 19000 laid off 
in southern parana state and 11000 in rio de janeiro 
we wont disfigure this plan but there will be corrections 
said rep marco maciel of the rightofcenter liberal front party 
collor however has said the plan is nonnegotiable and 
warned he will veto any alterations by congress 
the president does not want a confrontation but he wont 
allow the plan to be watered down said rep renan calheiros 
leader of collors tiny national reconstruction party which holds 
just 24 congressional seats 
collor can veto any congressional amendments to his plan but 
congress can overide his veto with a simple majority 
collors aggressive posture had earned him public support and 
unofficial backing from congress but brazilians are grumbling 
increasingly about layoffs and a delay in receiving march wages 
now even collors allies in congress are pondering whether or 
not to hedge their bets and soften the package 
were receiving an average of 800 angry letters a day from 
people asking the government to let them take their money out of 
their savings acounts said rep ibsen pinheiro of the brazilian 
democratic movement party which holds a house majority it has 
an effect on your vote 
collors wage policy is also under attack this month workers 
received a 73percent pay raise to cover for marchs 84 percent 
inflation and they will not be reimbursed for costofliving 
increases in the first two weeks of april 
nothing is unnegotiable said sen fernando henrique 
cardoso of the leftofcenter brazilian social democracy party 
the untouchable nature of the plan has been revoked 
but analysts fear any tinkering with the economic measures might 
undermine collors credibility and hurl the economy into chaos 
collor has shot his bolts wrote a political commentator 
villas boas correa in the rio daily jornal do brasil the 
rejection of the package or major changes in it will be 
unacceptable to collor and lead to an institutional crisis of 
massive proportions

the united states should crack down on iraq 
for allegedly trying to circumvent american restrictions on nuclear 
technology shipments and for using chemical weapons three senators 
said sunday 
i think there should be sound and fury and all were 
hearing now is the sounds of silence from the bush 
administration said sen william cohen rmaine the ranking 
republican on the senate intelligence committee 
i think we ought to take action and not simply allow it to be 
a headline one day and then fade off into nothing the next 
cohen said on abctvs this week with david brinkley program 
i dont think weve done enough sen john mccain rariz 
said on cbstvs face the nation 
mccain said the iraqis must be forewarned that the united states 
will exercise all options including that of military if 
necessary to prevent this enormous threat from continuing if they 
acquire the nuclear weapons we think they are maybe three to four 
years away from 
iraqs president saddam hussein must be stopped on his 
messianic mission to become a dominant force in the middle 
east mccain said 
us and british intelligence forces broke up an alleged iraqi 
smuggling ring in london last week officials claimed the iraqis 
were trying to obtain usmade nuclear triggers for atomic 
weapons five people were charged in an indictment that claimed an 
iraqi government agency was involved in the scheme 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat said 
his country does not have nuclear capability and denied it was 
trying to build a nuclear bomb 
mccain challenged the iraqis denial 
the facts are the iraqis have for over a decade been 
attempting to acquire nuclear capability he said the israelis 
bombed a iraqi nuclear facility in 1981 
moreover mccain charged the iraqis have failed to abide by the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty to which they are signatories 
both mccain and cohen said the iraqis statements have to be 
taken with a grain of salt in light of their denials they used 
chemical weapons in the iraniraq war and in efforts to put down 
kurdish nationalists 
the iraqis gassed some 5000 kurds back in 1988 thousands 
more iranians cohen said 
congress could do something about the situation the senators 
said 
specifically cohen cited a proposed law that would penalize 
american companies doing business with middle eastern countries 
working to acquire chemical weapons and nuclear capabilities 
sen jeff bingaman dnm also appearing on the abc program 
said i think we need to get tough not just with those middle 
eastern countries but also with those that are supplying them 
mccain said congress might be more willing now than in the past 
to impose sanctions on such companies 
i think that finally were beginning to focus hopefully with 
the assistance of the soviet union on the enormity and the 
immensity of the challenges that this presents us with he 
said 
exposure of the smuggling ring prompted president bush to 
express his concern about the spread of nuclear weapons in the 
middle east and the state department registered its fears with the 
iraqi ambassador

caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir has set 
in motion plans to quickly start five more jewish settlements in 
the occupied territories an aide said sunday 
the action is bound to fuel tensions with the united states 
whose leaders have renewed warnings that the settlements in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip are an obstacle to peace 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc acted as his 
political rival labor party leader shimon peres sped up efforts 
to form a new governing coalition without likud 
president chaim herzog asked peres to put together a new 
coalition after the likudlabor cabinet led by shamir collapsed 
march 15 in a parliamentary vote of no confidence triggered by a 
dispute over middle east peacemaking 
yossi ahimeir a shamir aide said of the premiers plans for 
settlements we are talking about completing the picture of eight 
settlements decided by our government and theres no doubt that 
sooner or later they will be established 
israel radio said former defense minister yitzhak rabin of the 
leftofcenter labor party had postponed construction of five of 
the settlements in response to american protests the defense 
minister has final say on when settlements will be built 
ahimeir noted that shamir was now acting as defense minister a 
post he took over after rabins resignation from the cabinet on 
march 13 during the crisis that led to the government collapse 
if there were artificial delays until now they will be 
removed ahimeir said in a telephone interview ahimeir said the 
settlements were authorized by a cabinet decision more than a year 
ago 
labor legislator avraham burg said shamir also wanted to 
confiscate additional land for settlements and enlarge the present 
jewish enclaves around hebron where clashes have occurred between 
settlers and palestinians 
burg told the associated press that shamirs plans were in line 
with the likud philosphy of not giving up any land in the occupied 
territories even in exchange for peace 
part of the plan is to kill the peace process he said 
since capturing the west bank and gaza during the 1967 middle 
east war israel has built 143 settlements that are home to 75000 
jews about 17 million palestinians live in the occupied lands 
an additional 120000 israelis have been moved into 
neighborhoods built in the israeliannexed sector of jerusalem 
where 140000 palestinians live 
three settlements have been opened since shamir was reelected 
premier in november 1988 these are ofarim and tsoref started may 
10 in the west bank and kfar darom started about the same time in 
gaza 
five others agreed on as a compromise between shamir and peres 
when they formed their coalition government have not been built 
and their names and sites have not been disclosed 
ahimeir confirmed a radio report that shamir has named michael 
dekel a veteran likud activist and former deputy defense minister 
to be in charge of building the new settlements 
the radio said dekel still needs permits from the military 
government in the occupied teritories and the justice ministry 
which controls land purchases in the past some settlements have 
been started by putting up fences and moving in mobile homes 
peres meanwhile was seeking to break a 6060 deadlock with 
likud to win a majority coalition in the 120member parliament by 
trying to enlist defectors from likud israeli media reported 
by law peres has about 10 more days to form a government and 
then can ask herzog for an extension this could give herzog an 
opportunity to ask shamir to form a government 
israeli newspapers noted that rabin labors no 2 leader could 
also be assigned to form a government if peres fails 
rabin is more popular with religious swing parties largely 
because of his tough policies aimed at putting down the 
27monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories

dozens of newly arrived soviet military 
vehicles lumbered through lithuanias capital sunday but defiant 
republic leaders resisted the increased pressure to renounce their 
declaration of independence 
the lithuanian parliaments presidium met to consider its next 
moves and deputy prime minister kazimieras motieka told reporters 
the government remains ready to negotiate and discuss any 
questions with the soviet union except that of independence 
the last western correspondents were ousted from the baltic 
republic sunday night on orders of the soviet government leading 
some lithuanians to express fears of an impending crackdown by the 
soviet military 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev urged the rebellious 
republic in an appeal saturday night to renounce its march 11 
declaration of independence and enter into talks with the kremlin 
on the basis of the soviet constitution he warned that a refusal 
may result in grave consequences for all of us 
the lithuanian parliament was scheduled to meet monday morning 
to forge a response 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis rejected gorbachevs 
appeal saying the soviet leader was demanding impossible 
things 
it cannot be now demanded that we annul everything that we 
bore in our hearts he said in remarks carried sunday by the 
official soviet news agency tass 
but landsbergis said he would send negotiators to moscow on 
monday to try to set up a meeting with soviet officials 
western reporters counted almost 30 armored vehicles being 
unloaded from trains that arrived near the vilnius airport others 
drove through the city their treads slicing into the asphalt 
apparently on their way to a nearby base soldiers peered out of 
the lookouts 
the reinforcement of the vilnius garrison came in broad daylight 
when many residents were out for sunday strolls to savor the spring 
sunshine 
motieka complained that the soviet army had refused to inform 
the lithuanian government about its activities 
this situation must be changed he said according to 
william hough an american lawyer who attended the news conference 
an additional column of some 15 armored personnel carriers had 
moved through vilnius in the early morning hours lithuanian 
officials said a duty officer at the republics interior ministry 
said the vehicles rolled into a military base in central vilnius 
just three miles from the parliament building 
eduardas potashinkas an activist and lithuanian tv editor said 
many concerned residents had called the television station and 
lithuanian radio to report troop movements overnight 
western journalists saw 30 to 40 armored personnel carriers or 
apcs full support vehicles and soldiers being unloaded from a 
train near the airport north of vilnius at about noon sunday 
there was a big transport that came by train there were a lot 
of apcs over 20 of them at least and also trucks it looked like 
they were beginning to unload a local photographer said on 
condition of anonymity 
later sunday 28 apcs eight trucks two jeeps and a tanker 
could still be seen at the station while other vehicles were 
driving through the city reporters estimated that at least 45 
military vehicles had been brought to the city since midnight 
sunday 
gorbachev in his first formal appeal since the lithuanian 
crisis began said the republics chosen path towards independence 
was ruinous and will only lead to a dead end 
in an 18line statement addressed to the lithuanian supreme 
soviet gorbachev charged lithuanian leaders with taking steps that 
are openly challenging and insulting to the entire soviet 
union 
i propose that the lithuanian supreme soviet immediately annul 
the illegal acts it has adopted gorbachev wrote in his appeal 
which was prominently played sunday on the front pages of major 
soviet newspapers 
landsbergis in separate comments broadcast on lithuanian radio 
said gorbachevs strongly worded appeal to the lithuanian 
parliament is extremely surprising and contained open threats 
to the safety of the lithuanian nation 
the council of the federation a new group of leaders from the 
soviet republics formed to advise the president on nationalities 
issues directed gorbachev on friday to tell lithuania that it must 
rescind laws contradicting the soviet constitution before talks on 
secession could begin 
the constitution provides a republic with the right to secede 
from the soviet union but offers no mechanism for secession 
gorbachev has promised lithuania and other independenceminded 
soviet republics to establish such a mechanism but the measure 
presently before the soviet legislature gives the soviet government 
final authority in such issues 
on friday nearby estonia pledged to join lithuania in its drive 
to regain independence lost when the three baltic republics were 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 after moscow occupied them 
under terms of a secret hitlerstalin pact 
the third baltic republic latvia is expected to pursue 
independence next month

a police officer who was consumed with 
hatred every time he looked out his window and saw his nextdoor 
neighbor eventually shot him to death to settle a 13year grudge 
prosecutors say 
defense lawyers in the trial of robert mclaughlin contend that 
the 18year hampton police veteran was insane a zombie two 
years ago when he walked around to robert cushings house and 
opened up with two shotgun blasts when he answered the door 
but prosecutors in the 4weekold murder trial say mclaughlin 
49 is a coldblooded killer who was angry at cushing over an old 
policebrutality charge the case could go to the jury by the 
middle of the week 
cushing a 63yearold former schoolteacher and prominent real 
estate agent was killed by two shotgun blasts after opening his 
front door in hampton the night of june 1 1988 the slaying 
shocked residents and for nearly three months police had no solid 
leads 
then mclaughlin an 18year veteran hampton police veteran 
turned himself in saying he pulled the trigger the surrender 
stunned the community particularly cushings family 
when we were out in the back yard grieving mourning the loss 
of our father he could see us out his windows robert cushing 
jr said at the time its sick to think the murderer was 
watching us from his windows its like voyeurism on our grief 
but there was more stunning news to come 
a year ago mclaughlins former wife susan cook was convicted 
of being an accomplice to the murder and given a mandatory sentence 
of life in prison without parole she is appealing 
the next month during pretrial hearings mclaughlin startled 
onlookers by testifying that cook actually had killed cushing 
later shortly before his trial was to begin mclaughlins lawyers 
produced letters written by cook to mclaughlin from her jail cell 
in them she said she killed cushing 
babe i pray they find you innocent theyve got to said 
one letter you didnt kill mr cushing i did and i know you 
said youd never tell and youd protect me 
shortly after the letters were made public mclaughlins lawyers 
dropped out of the case without explanation and the trial was 
delayed until new lawyers could be found 
cook continued to write to him for a time signing her letters 
all my love then inexplicably she filed for divorce and 
obtained one earlier this year 
mclaughlins trial opened on march 5 in rockingham county 
superior court 
prosecutors claim that with cooks help the defendant planned 
and carried out the murder to settle a longsimmering grudge 
the initial resentment grew into an ugly hatred assistant 
attorney general michael ramsdell said in opening arguments 
robert mclaughlin hated cushing every time he looked out his 
window and saw him working in his garden or sitting on his back 
deck he released that hatred on june 1 1988 
the grudge prosecutors say began when mclaughlin and another 
officer investigated a traffic accident outside cushings home in 
which an elderly woman driver was cited for driving violations 
cushing who had been an onlooker was arrested on a disorderly 
conduct charge 
the driver who has since died claimed she was arrested because 
she had told cushing she would testify on his behalf at her trial 
she accused mclaughlin and another officer of brutality saying 
they ripped her raincoat while trying to pull her out of her car 
a group of residents led by cushings son pushed to have both 
officers fired on brutality charges but both were eventually 
cleared 
defense attorney steven shadallah told the jury that mclaughlin 
should not be held criminally responsible for what happened the 
killing was a product of delusional thinking in a man who was out 
of touch with reality 
shadallah argued that the night of the killing mclaughlin 
under severe stress from his job drank heavily took a heavy dose 
of tranquilizers and watched apocalypse now a violent vietnam 
war movie a combination that induced him to commit the murder 
he said cook helped mclaughlin plan the slaying after he stated 
his intention to kill his neighbor 
she is the one who suggested wearing disguises using a 
getaway car to serve as a lookout she directed him to the 
front door he said he didnt even know to run after the 
killing his wife had to tell him 
this man was a zombie on june 1 1988 
hampton police chief robert mark called as a defense witness 
last week remembered mclaughlin as a cops cop but mark and 
other witnesses said mclaughlin suffered from severe stress that 
caused him to attempt suicide on one occasion 
shadallah said several traumatic experiences contributed to the 
stress including mclaughlins accidental shooting of one of his 
best friends at age 15

in just a matter of seconds sunday the 
citys first skyscraper disintegrated in a flash of flame a loud 
rumble and a billowing tidal wave of smoke and dust 
the 11story hartfordaetna building its metal skeletal innards 
laced with explosive charges crashed into a heap of twisted steel 
girders and dusty concrete chunks at 7 am to the applause of 
hundreds of spectators 
despite the efforts of preservationists who fought to save the 
building the 78yearold building was knocked down to make way for 
a 45story office tower 
the demolition went off like clockwork a mans voice boomed 
five seconds over a loudspeaker and precisely five seconds 
later the blast with a resonating rumble that shook the ground 
brought the building down 
the building was brought down by implosion in which explosives 
are carefully spaced to pull a building in on itself to keep 
debris from flying off the demolition site 
spectators some crammed onto a pedestrian walkway others 
perched on cars or in side streets blocked off by police oohed 
ahhed and applauded as the building fell in spewed a cloud of dust 
that swept over the downtown area 
the demolition ended the debate between the society for savings 
which plans to erect the new office tower and preservationists who 
had argued that the citys first skyscraper should be saved 
the hartfordaetna on the corner of asylum and main streets 
was the sixth of 11 buildings razed to create the site for the 
proposed tower 
the tower was approved in august but the city council 
stipulated that architecturally significant materials from the 
bottom two floors would be incorporated into the lower floors of 
the new building 
as proposed the old materials would form the facade on the 
first two stories of the buildings fronts on main and asylum 
streets 
preservationists have ridiculed the project michael kerski 
executive director of the greater hartford architecture 
conservancy scoffed at the plan to preserve the old buildings 
first two floors 
how do you blow something up and then piece it back

the driver of a southeastern trailways 
bus taking a greyhound route was shot and critically wounded 
prompting strikeplagued greyhound on sunday to rule out contract 
talks until a week has passed without gunfire 
its an openandshut case of terrorism said fred g 
currey chairman and chief executive officer of strikeplagued 
greyhound lines inc we will not negotiate with people who are 
involved in terrorism 
representatives of striking greyhound drivers denied 
responsibility but currey said he would refuse to reopen talks 
until a week goes by without a shooting 
the bus belonged to southeastern trailways an independent 
company but operated on greyhound routes with greyhound passengers 
under a pooling arrangement that existed before the strike said 
greyhound spokesman george gravley 
southeastern trailways has been carrying more greyhound 
passengers than usual in recent weeks because of the strike said 
greyhounds nashville division general manager larry m glasscock 
jr 
about 6300 greyhound drivers nationwide went on strike march 2 
and the company has reported 29 shooting attacks on its buses 70 
bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents a picket was killed 
march 3 in redding calif when he was crushed as a bus driven by 
a replacement driver was backing up there were no charges filed in 
that incident 
a 100000 reward that greyhound offered last week for 
information on strikerelated violence will be offered in this 
case gravley said 
the driver david e bryant 58 of cincinnati underwent six 
hours of surgery sunday at vanderbilt university medical center 
none of the 46 passengers was injured in the attack late saturday 
on the bus heading from nashville to louisville ky 
one of two men in a pickup truck that pulled up alongside the 
bus opened fire with a 44caliber or 45caliber handgun on 
interstate 65 near white house tenn about 30 miles north of 
nashville authorities said 
the bullet entered the bus through a front window and struck the 
driver a member of the union on strike against greyhound state 
trooper randy pack said 
hospital spokesman wayne wood said the driver was in critical 
but stable condition 
its now a matter of just waiting and sort of seeing what 
happens wood said if everything goes perfectly his arm will 
not need to be amputated if theres a problem unfortunately that 
still could happen 
three of the passengers refused to board another bus for 
louisville and were returned to nashville on vans 
greyhound officials told leaders of the striking amalgamated 
transit union on thursday that greyhound would return to the 
bargaining table on monday 
but on friday the company announced that it was calling off the 
meeting citing continuing violence 
they say they dont condone it currey told a news 
conference but yet they dont do anything to stop it 
the chairman flew from dallas where greyhound is based to 
nashville early sunday but has unable to visit the driver 
joe semmes an executive board member for the unions local 1613 
in nashville said the shooting could not have been the work of 
union members because the driver is a union member 
this shooting last night leads me to believe it is outside 
work and not related to any of our unions whatsoever he said 
this southeastern trailways is a member of the same labor 
organization we are 
currey said striking drivers must have been involved in the 
latest shooting because until the strike began greyhound buses 
hadnt been fired on in the three years he has controlled the 
company 
semmes said southeastern trailways drivers were honoring picket 
lines by refusing to drive buses into terminals in nashville and 
knoxville instead supervisors must do that job he said 
semmes blamed the shootings on demented people 
they hear mr currey say he wont negotiate while this 
violence continues he said and they say heres a good chance 
i can stir up a lot of trouble 
currey said he wanted to meet with gov ned mcwherter to see 
what measures can be taken to increase safety aboard greyhound 
buses he said he had offered to place twoway radios in buses that 
could be monitored by state troopers after shootings in hamilton 
county but said the governor had shown no interest authorities in 
at least two states florida and ohio installed radios aboard 
buses after shootings there 
currey said that in the meantime offduty police will be 
riding greyhound buses across tennessee

three flights with soviet jews arrived from 
budapest on sunday after the hungarian state airline backed off its 
refusal to fly the immigrants to israel 
however gad ben ari the spokesman for the quasigovernmental 
jewish agency that is responsible for immigrants said the 
situation was still confused for jews wishing to come to israel via 
budapest 
malev airline cut off ticket sales and flights to soviet 
emigrants last month because of threats from a proiranian group 
called the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine the group 
threatened any airline that transported soviet jews to israel 
palestinians and arab governments have expressed fears that the 
large number of jewish newcomers would be settled in the 
israelioccupied territories 
ben ari said charter flights from the soviet union have not been 
resumed but he said immigrants with malev tickets bought in the 
soviet union for tel aviv can fly into budapest and then continue 
from there with the airline on regular flights 
no malev tickets are being sold to soviet immigrants in hungary 
however those who fly the soviet airline aeroflot to budapest must 
wait for room on one of the special daily flights to tel aviv on 
israels el al airline the spokesman said 
the flow of immigrants via budapest resumed friday when a few 
soviet jews arrived at bengurion airport near tel aviv after malev 
decided to honor their tickets bought in the soviet union ben ari 
said 
on sunday a large group of soviets arrived in tel aviv from 
budapest on two malev fights and one by el al israel airlines 
officials at the airport said 
malevs decision to cut off flights worried israeli officials 
since the hungarian capital has been the exit route for soviet jews 
coming to israel 
the number of soviet jewish immigrants has greatly increased 
because of eased exit policies and fears of growing antisemitism 
in the soviet union the united states also has tightened its 
immigration policies 
israeli officials have estimated that up to 750000 soviet jews 
may immigrate to israel in the next few years

at least 52 drinking and dancing clubs listed by 
the city as nuisances are on cityowned properties making 
government the biggest landlord of the illegal establishments 
according to published reports 
a crackdown began after 87 people died march 25 at the happy 
land social club an illegal social club in the bronx in an arson 
fire that was the deadliest blaze in the united states since 1977 
the bodies of 48 of the victims were flown sunday from kennedy 
international airport to honduras aboard a dc8 chartered by the 
american red cross in all 79 of the victims were believed to be 
hondurans 
most of them went to the united states with high hopes and 
they came back dead we are very sad said honduran president 
rafael leonardo callejas who went to san pedro sulla to be with 
dozens of grieving relatives 
a grand jury on friday indicted 36yearold cuban immigrant 
julio gonzalez on charges of murder arson attempted murder and 
assault he is accused of starting the fire with gasoline after 
being rejected by a former girlfriend who worked at the club 
in the latest citywide social club sweep from friday night to 
early sunday social club task force members visited 356 clubs and 
found 122 of them open said police sgt diane kubler they issued 
54 vacate orders 132 summonses and 193 notices of violation one 
person was arrested 
clubs such as the wanda social club which was slapped with a 
vacate order friday night are a particular embarassment to the 
city the city is the landlord 
the new york times citing police records reported sunday that 
52 of the 1255 clubs listed as nuisance establishments were in 
properties owned by the city including two in housing authority 
projects the records portray the city as the largest landlord of 
such clubs 
buildings finance and department of housing preservation and 
development records indicated there were 46 to 66 social clubs in 
cityowned buildings department commissioner felice michetti told 
the times 
department inspectors were surveying them she said 
cityowned residential buildings house as many as 46 illegal 
clubs the daily news said saturday basing its report on a review 
of buildings department and real estate records as well as reports 
from inspections by city agencies 
the news said the number could increase as city officials check 
contradictory listings of illegal clubs 
the city inherited the clubs along with vast numbers of tenants 
and abandoned buildings said lee jones a spokesman for mayor 
david n dinkins 
is it embarrassing jones said its something were going 
to have to deal with 
in the event of death or injury in a fire or other calamity the 
city might be liable in lawsuits involving such establishments the 
times said 
ms michetti said there were two grounds for city action if the 
tenant doesnt have a bona fide lease we can bring an eviction 
action she said otherwise the city can move for a vacate order 
and ultimately padlock the property for violating fire and building 
codes or selling alcohol without a state license 
the city has moved against two other cityowned social club 
tenants besides the wanda the times said authorities last week 
issued a vacate order for a club in manhattan and closed another in 
the bronx

cold fusions early promise of a clean 
inexpensive energy source has faded as scientists struggle to 
understand the complexities of a phenomenon that continues to elude 
definition researchers said 
at the conclusion saturday of the national cold fusion 
institutes first international conference about 200 researchers 
agreed only that a year of experimentation had produced some sort 
of nuclear process 
were not in a position now to say its practical said 
charles scott of tennessees oak ridge national laboratory it 
doesnt mean we wont be able to some day but we certainly cant 
do it today 
still many scientists left the threeday conference convinced 
the results of experiments substantiate claims made a year ago by 
chemists b stanley pons of the university of utah and martin 
fleischmann of englands university of southampton 
the two mens seeming breakthrough was questioned when 
researchers in other laboratories had trouble duplicating their 
results while many scientists say they doubt cold fusion exists 
experiments continue around the world 
i think we should have the courage to say if we feel so that 
it is cold fusion said physicist guiliano preparata of italys 
university of milan 
it has been proven to the extent that these phenomena are 
real although they are not controllable the world is 
welladvised to take it seriously preparata said 
pons said that while it was still too early to draw any 
conclusions about a practical application the work must go forward 
you cant deny theres something here he said it may be 
a huge thing it may not but you have to look at it 
pons and fleischmann announced in march 1989 that they had 
produced a nuclear fusion reaction by immersing a palladium and 
platinum electrode in deuterium oxide or heavy water then 
charging the device with electricity 
they said deuterium atoms fused giving off energy in the form 
of excess heat at the time it was suspected that sea water which 
contains deuterium might provide an inexhaustible source of fuel 
for the process 
nuclear fusion powers the stars traditionally scientists have 
believed that fusion could occur only at extremely high 
temperatures cool smallscale fusion would provide a convenient 
limitless source of power and be one of the greatest scientific 
discoveries of all time 
the utah legislature appropriated 5 million to establish the 
national cold fusion institute last august and to pursue patents to 
protect the states commercial interests 
however the federal government has declined to fund the center 
and only two private companies are known to have donated money 
institute director fritz g will said that while deuterium is a 
vital part of the phenomenon the possibility that the fusion 
reaction occurs inside the palladium electrode could leave 
prospects for a practical application dead in the water because 
of the rare metals cost 
even so many scientists said the results of experiments in the 
united states japan italy india and elsewhere pose intriguing 
questions about the nature of the nuclear processes that seem to be 
occurring 
many reported theyd observed excess heat while others said 
their experiments had produced nuclear signatures such as 
tritium neutrons and gamma rays 
the big question is what kind of fusion is going on said 
edmund storms of los alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
storms who has detected tritium in his experiments suggested 
that more than one nuclear process might be taking place in the 
electrodes 
the conference was not without skeptics but even richard 
petrasso of the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge 
whod dismissed cold fusion as highly improbable acknowledged that 
results so far warrant further research 
im still skeptical but i think there are some exciting 
things that need to be explained he said

more palestinians were killed by fellow arabs 
than by israeli soldiers during the first three months of 1990 and 
analysts said sunday the figures reflect a decline in clashes with 
the army 
according to a report issued by the israeli information center 
for human rights in the occupied territories 37 palestinians died 
in interarab violence it said 30 palestinians were shot to death 
by soldiers in confrontations in the 27monthold uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the report noted that both tallies were lower than for the final 
three months of last year during that period army gunfire killed 
64 palestinians and 43 were slain by fellow arabs said the 
center which used figures compiled by the associated press to 
prepare its report 
palestinians killed by other arabs were accused of dealing in 
drugs or prostitution or of being israeli informants which moslem 
fundamentalist groups consider crimes against the uprising 
arieh shalev a former commander of the israelioccupied west 
bank said the lower figures this year were a result of the decline 
in confrontations between soldiers and palestinians during the 
uprising known as the intefadeh 
the intefadeh is different he said there are no more 
mass violent protests most of it is stonethrowing 
an army spokesman who could not be identified under 
regulations said the reduction in the number of palestinians 
killed by army gunfire was due to stricter rules for opening fire 
on palestinian demonstrators 
things have changed from the beginning of the intefadeh when 
there was not much experience with this kind of unrest he added 
he said only officers or unit commanders are allowed to open fire 
and then only after firing warning shots 
sari nusseibah a leading palestinian activist in jerusalem 
said the army had learned killing palestinians hurt its image 
nusseibah said the underground leadership in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip had tried to curtail interarab killings and 
that the execution of suspected collaborators was something 
extraneous to the uprising 
shalev in his telephone interview said in some cases 
palestinians were using the uprising to settle unrelated disputes 
in the latest violence a 24yearold palestinian prisoner was 
strangled sunday in the ketziot prison in southern israel by a 
fellow inmate who accused him of collaborating with israeli 
authorities arab reporters said 
his death raised to 202 the number of palestinians slain by 
other arabs during the uprising at least 670 have been killed by 
israelis and 43 israelis have also died 
in the west bank arab reports said murshed fawzi abu hafiza 
27 the village leader in alar was found shot to death in his car 
he had been attacked several times as a suspected collaborator 
the reports said two friends who were with him told police he 
was killed when his gun accidentally discharged only palestinians 
who work with israel are allowed to have guns

despite consumer complaints about service and 
rates from some cable tv companies congress is unlikely to 
reregulate the industry lawmakers told the nations 
broadcasters sunday 
sen dennis deconcini dariz told the national association of 
broadcasters convention that said a new mustcarry rule 
forcing cable companies to carry local stations could pass the 
congress 
and rep cardiss collins dill predicted we are going to 
have a little small reregulation bill 
if youre looking for major reregulation of cable i dont 
see it and technology will make that decision obsolete said 
rep tom tauke riowa one of six congressmen at the national 
association of broadcasters convention 
tauke was referring to direct broadcasting satellite proposed 
highpower satellite services that can beam dozens of 
customerselected channels direct to home antennas no more than 18 
inches across 
highpower dbs is going to happen its inevitable said tom 
rogers president of nbc cable a partner in the recently announced 
sky cable venture 
sky cable hopes to launch its service with as many as 108 
channels of programming available to some 4 million homes in 1993 
rogers said that while his service is technologically capable 
of being competitive to cable the marketing scheme weve focused 
on is not intended to be directly competitive with cable 
the company is considering having at least some customers 
ordering sky cable through their local conventional cable operator 
and he said for the cable industry since dbs is inevitable 
its better to be a part of it

the countrys top tamil guerrilla 
leader emerged sunday from his jungle hideout where he had spent 
2 years commanding a guerrilla battle against indian soldiers 
we have successfully foiled the indian military 
intervention velupillai prabhakaran 35 said at a military camp 
run by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the group he heads 
i do not think there is any more need for me to live an 
underground life he said 
the last indian soldiers left sri lanka a week ago after 30 
months of a deadlocked jungle war against the liberation tigers 
the withdrawal marked a turning point in relations between 
ethnic tamil militants and the government which is dominated by 
the countrys sinhalese majority 
the sinhalese people should realize the blunders of the past 
and be prepared to resolve our problems on the basis of human 
justice and righteousness the burly guerrilla leader said in the 
tamil language 
if on the other hand justice is denied to our tamil people 
and if oppression is unleashed we will not hesitate to resume 
the armed struggle to uphold the freedom of our people 
prabhakaran wore a green camouflage uniform and carried a 
revolver in an open holster at least 50 guerrillas wearing 
bulletproof vests stood guard with automatic rifles snipers were 
posted on the roof of the building where the news conference was 
held 
the liberation tigers and the government which both wanted the 
indians out reached a peace accord last summer now the tigers 
have moved out of the jungles and swamps into areas vacated by the 
indians to share policing duties with the government forces they 
once fought 
but the tigers have not given up their demand for independence 
and the government has not announced what the political future of 
the tamildominated north and east will be 
there is peace and a cessation of hostilities between the sri 
lankan armed forces and the tamil tiger fighters prabhakaran 
said but the fundamental problems of our people have not been 
resolved once concrete actions are taken to remove the causes and 
conditions that led to tamil resistance then the question will 
be resolved forever 
the tamil war for an independent nation began in 1983 touched 
off by decadesold complaints of discrimination by the sinhalese in 
jobs education and use of the sinhalese language 
many militant groups including prabhakarans were based in the 
southern indian city of madras where they were bolstered by the 
sympathies of indias 60 million tamils 
in july 1987 india brokered a peace accord between the sri 
lankan government and the militants giving the tamils limited 
autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender 
india sent in peacekeeping soldiers to carry out the agreement 
but the liberation tigers renounced the accord and the indian 
forces were caught up in vicious battles 
at least 11000 people including 1150 indian soldiers have 
died in the tamil insurgency 
in addition the tamil autonomy drive has generated a 
nationalist sinhalese backlash and that antigovernment campaign 
has killed at least 7000 people 
prabhakarans last appearance in public was in august 1987 soon 
after he returned from new delhi after talks with indian government 
leaders 
an eighthgrade dropout prabhakaran learned guerrilla warfare 
at a training camp in lebanon run by the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine headed by george habash 
last summer reports of prabhakarans death in a gunbattle with 
his no 2 man ajith mahathiya surfaced in sri lanka and india 
asked sunday about those reports prabhakaran just laughed

dutch prison guards foiled an 
attempt by 12 americans including several servicemen to seize a 
us air force sergeant imprisoned on charges of killing his wife 
television reports said sunday 
a justice ministry spokesman reacted by warning of a serious 
diplomatic conflict according to dutch television 
television reports said the incident occurred friday after the 
dutch high court ruled that sgt charles donald short could not be 
extradited to the united states to stand trial on the murder 
charges 
the 12 us citizens including several members of the us air 
force were waiting in several cars with us license plates 
outside a jail in the central dutch city of utrecht the television 
said short was due to return there from the high court ruling in 
the hague 37 miles away according to the report 
prison guards who saw the americans asked them what they were 
doing and the guards were told the men were waiting for short to 
take him to the united states apparently for trial the report 
said 
there was no immediate word of how the guards thwarted them or 
whether the americans were armed 
the television report quoted a justice ministry spokesman as 
saying the 12 americans are way off the mark here they should 
keep their paws off short or else there will be a serious 
diplomatic incident 
the spokesman was not identified in the report a security guard 
at the ministry said no spokesman could be reached until monday 
the television report quoted shorts unidentified defense 
attorney as saying the americans were trying to mount a little 
panama it was a reference to the us invasion of that nation in 
december to topple dictator manuel antonio noriega 
short was arrested on april 1 1988 and accused of killing his 
turkishborn wife cutting her body into pieces and dumping the 
remains in plastic bags in monnikendam 56 miles from the us air 
force base at soesterberg he was serving there with the 32nd 
tactical fighter squadron 
he was transferred to us military police a few days later but 
he was eventually handed back to dutch authorities for trial 
the high court ruled shorts extradition would be illegal since 
he could be sentenced to death if convicted of murder by a us 
court 
however it is still unclear whether dutch courts will be 
legally competent to try him if not he could be released 
according to the television report 
the united states asked for shorts extradition soon after his 
arrest but dutch law which has no capital punishment routinely 
bans extradition in cases that could lead to the suspect being 
executed

the us government is requiring some french 
and italian vineyards to certify that their wines do not contain 
traces of a fungicide not approved in the united states before 
shipping the wines to this country a spokesman said sunday 
we have found a little bit of italian sparking wine and some 
french wine that contains traces of a fungicide not approved in the 
united states said food and drug administration spokesman bill 
grigg 
he said there is no ban on the wines but the vineyards involved 
must retain independent testing labs to certify that the wines are 
fungicidefree before shipping them to the united states 
the fda will conduct spot tests on the wines to reaffirm the 
certifications he said 
the fungicide procymidone is made in japan and is applied to 
grapes while they are growing rather than to the wines themselves 
said grigg 
grigg said he did not have figures on the amount of wine 
involved but that it was a tiny percentage of total exports from 
the two countries to the united states 
he also said there is no indication that the fungicide which 
is approved for use in europe constitutes a health risk but 
because it has not undergone us clearance procedures he said it 
cannot be allowed

jewish emigration and to express rage at reports of growing 
antisemitism in the soviet union 
the ralliers who packed dag hammersjold plaza also called for 
direct flights from moscow to tel aviv 
the rally came six days after malev the hungarian airline 
halted flights between budapest and tel aviv because of threats by 
the radical group islamic jihad to attack airliners carrying soviet 
emigres the airline resumed limited flights from budapest to tel 
aviv sunday but still wasnt running direct charter flights from 
moscow 
arab nations have asked the soviet union to slow the tide of 
emigrating soviet jews 
to stand resolute against these terrorist threats is to defeat 
their cowardly perpetrators said president george bush in a 
statement read at the rally soviet jews must be allowed free and 
unimpeded transit as well as direct flights to israel 
several other prominent politicians and dignitaries addressed 
the crowd which police estimated at 120000 they included new 
york city mayor david dinkins sen alfonse damato rny new

israels consul general uriel savir former mayor edward i koch 
and refusenik natan scharansky who emigrated from the soviet union 
in 1986 
messages of support were sent by vice president dan quayle new 
york gov mario cuomo sen daniel moynihan dny sen bill 
bradley dnj and cardinal john oconnor head of the new york 
archdiocese 
each of the speakers praised the soviet union for allowing 
greater emigration but also cautioned that the battle continues 
when you hear that there are wonderful leaders in the soviet 
union dont believe this scharansky told the ralliers it is 
you who made all these changes possible its your struggle to 
change our future 
under mikhail gorbachevs leadership soviet authorities have 
let thousands of jews leave the country in 1986 only 914 were 
allowed to emigrate 
thousands of jews are presently trying to leave the soviet union 
for israel but there are no direct flights between the soviet 
union and israel so emigres must travel via third countries such 
as hungary or czechoslovakia 
speakers expressed alarm over reports that antisemitism is 
growing in the soviet union 
jews are terrified over threats to their life and limb said 
rabbi haskel lookstein the chairman of the greater new york 
coalition for soviet jewry the rallys sponsor 
we say to mikhail gorbachev we have nothing against you or 
the soviet union but we demand that you crush the antisemitic 
savages in your country he said 
bigotry among some soviets is becoming their first exercise in 
free thought said mayor dinkins but soviet jews havent come 
so far to be disappointed so soon

state police with shotguns blockaded a 
mohawk indian community sunday for a third straight day since 
gunfire forced down a vermont national guard helicopter and wounded 
a doctor on a medical mission 
while the blockade of the ganienkeh mohawk territory continued 
negotiators were trying to work out an agreement to investigate the 
shooting which wounded a civilian doctor aboard the helicopter 
the indians insisting that a police investigation would be an 
invasion of the ganienkeh territory said they would die to protect 
the sovereignty of their community near the canadian border about 
150 miles north of albany 
hundreds of troopers were outside the community state police 
said several armed mohawks several with ak47 assault rifles were 
seen inside the isolated and secretive traditional indian community 
where an estimated 40 families live 
state police failed again sunday to persuade the indians to 
allow investigators into the area but said they would resume the 
negotiations monday 
an indian spokesman daryl martin said late sunday the indians 
would be willing to allow an independent investigation team onto 
their land as long as the results were reported simultaneously to 
both sides state troopers wouldnt be excluded from the team as 
long as the mohawks believed they could be impartial martin said 
a national guard crew flew the damaged helicopter off the 
ganienkeh land and back to vermont sunday afternoon said state 
police capt richard garrant the mohawks had allowed a crew on the 
territory to repair the craft 
two state police helicopter overflights of the ganienkeh land 
saturday determined that the shots were fired by a gunman standing 
near a building on the territory said state police maj robert leu 
daryl martin a spokesman for the indians insisted the shots 
did not come from the encampment 
mohawk roadblocks were set up beside police blockades after the 
shooting to keep authorities from coming onto the settlement 
martin said state police patrolled blockades on the four roads 
leading into the encampment 
the crew chief of the national guard helicopter sgt kris 
samples saw a man fire a rifle at the chopper leu said samples 
flew with state police investigators saturday and pointed out where 
he saw the gunman leu said 
another witness a man who had been driving a pickup truck on a 
nearby road and heard the shots corroborated samples account leu 
said investigators took aerial photographs of the area leu said 
tensions spiked saturday afternoon when talks broke off and the 
mohawks said they were preparing for violence by nightfall 
though tensions eased and negotiators were preparing to continue 
their discussions 
state police want permission to send three investigators onto 
the ganienkah land for one hour but the indians like other 
mohawks in northern new york claim federal or state authorities 
have no jurisdiction on their land 
sovereignty is the bottom line said dennis curtin a 
plattsburgh attorney representing the indians the position of 
the indians is that no outside investigation is going to be done on 
the territory 
trooper richard garcia said the helicopter was flying at about 
200 feet when it was fired on about 1130 am friday dr james 
van kirk 27 was recovering from a gunshot wound at vermont 
medical center in burlington where he works 
three military crew members van kirk and a civilian nurse were 
aboard the uh1 helicopter which was flying from burlington to 
massena ny to pick up a seriously ill patient snow forced the 
helicopter to abort its mission and it was returning to vermont 
when the shots were fired 
the ganienkeh encampment has its roots in a centuriesold land 
claim by the mohawks who say the land is among 9 million acres in 
new york and vermont wrongfully taken from them in the 18th century 
the state gave the mohawks the use of the ganienkeh land in 1977 
as part of a settlement that ended a threeyear mohawk occupation 
of land at moss lake about 100 miles southwest of altona 
in october 1974 a 22yearold man and a 9yearold girl were 
shot and wounded while riding in cars near moss lake and the 
indians also refused to cooperate no one was ever charged 
state attorney general robert abrams sued the ganienkeh indians 
to try to close a bingo hall that opened in 1988 busloads of 
people normally travel on weekends to the territory to play 
highstakes bingo but the buses were turned back at the roadblocks 
throughout the weekend

efforts to notify the sex partners of 
syphilis patients is unlikely to control the spread of the disease 
because many of those infected have multiple anonymous partners 
according to a study released sunday 
the results reported in mondays issue of the annals of 
internal medicine suggest that efforts to fight aids by notifying 
patients partners is likely to fail too said an accompanying 
editorial in the journal 
the 1988 study conducted by oregon health officials and the 
us centers for disease control focused on 146 syphilisinfected 
adults treated over four months overall the patients were able to 
identify an average of just one in five of their sexual partners 
according to the report 
twentyeight percent of the patients reported exchanging sex for 
drugs or money and that group accounted for 72 percent of the 
unlocatable sexual partners 
a strategy of controlling syphilis which relies solely or 
mostly on partner notification is doomed to failure because it is 
at most only 20 percent effective said one of the studys 
authors dr david fleming of the oregon health division 
oregon state law requires that syphilis cases be reported to 
county and state health officials 
each patient had an average of five sex partners during the 
study period whom they could not identify sufficiently for partner 
notification the study found 
in contrast a comparison group of 164 oregon adults with 
gonorrhea which is also sexually transmitted reported an average 
of less than one anonymous sex partner 
syphilis a chronic sexually transmitted disease is at its 
highest national rate in 40 years infecting about 16 people out of 
every 100000 in 1988 39000 cases were reported according to 
the cdc 
because of syphilis long infectious period and the likelihood 
that some patients engage in prostitution or drug use the 
researchers said partner notification wont control its spread 
because aids is prevalent among those with multiple sex partners 
and intravenous drug users partner notification for those patients 
will be fraught with the same problems fleming said 
instead contact tracing should be supplemented by vigorous and 
aggressive voluntary screening and educational programs the 
researchers said 
despite a medical treatment for syphilis the resurgence of 
this disease in the heterosexual population may be an alarming 
prelude to an epidemic of aids in the same population the 
researchers wrote 
the editorialist allan brandt of harvard medical school said 
that despite calls for mandatory contact tracing of aids patients 
the oregon study points out the great uncertainty that partner 
notification effectively serves the goals of public health and 
welfare

the son of a man extradited for nazi war 
crimes confronted the federal investigators who helped send his 
father to yugoslavia at an international conference sunday on the 
holocaust 
radoslav artukovic said the nazihunting office of special 
investigations built the case against his father andrija 
artukovic by relying on forged documents 
officials of the osi a us justice department agency whose 
role in the extradition is under federal investigated deny the 
allegation 
the fifth annual boston college law school conference on the 
holocaust and human rights law was attended by prosecutors 
academics and nazi hunters including beate klarsfeld of france in 
the holocaust during world war ii the nazis systematically killed 6 
million jews as well as homosexuals gypsies and others considered 
undesirable 
andrija artukovic was extradited in 1986 dubbed the butcher 
of the balkans he was convicted in yugoslavia of ordering the 
deaths of more than 1000 people and of complicity in hundreds of 
thousands of other concentration camp deaths he died of natural 
causes in a prison hospital in 1988 while awaiting execution 
artukovic claims his father was innocent and has repeatedly 
questioned the extradition 
on sunday the los alamitos calif stockbroker and former 
military police investigator accused the osi team of relying on 
falsified evidence from a communist country in order to extradite 
his father 
the elite unit was able to extradite the senior artukovic 
because extradition is performed at the request of a foreign 
country it doesnt require due process in a us court 
artukovic said he had state department cables suggesting the osi 
solicited the yugoslavian request for his fathers extradition 
osi deputy director bruce einhorn denied the accusations at the 
conference 
osi does not operate a service for begging and demanding 
extradition from other countries he said other countries are 
grown up they have to make the decision about whether they want 
someone extradited 
artukovic also accused the osi of holding back facts that would 
have discredited affidavits from several witnesses whose testimony 
was crucial to the extradition 
in addition artukovic said osi officials misled a los angeles 
court by deemphasizing the offices role in soliciting information 
from yugoslavia about artukovic 
the justice department has confirmed in written replies to 
members of congress that internal auditors in the office of 
professional responsibility have begun investigating the 
allegations 
einhorn declined to comment on the investigation 
as far as were concerned we think the case should be over 
he said we deny that anyone at osi committed any misconduct we 
believe our office acted properly and we believe the courts 
support that 
artukovic said he undertook his crusade because he wants his 
fathers body back from the yugoslavian government which has 
refused to return it

a 30milelong fuel slick left a town of about 
15000 people without normal water sunday and threatened water 
supplies in pittsburgh and dozens of other cities dependent on the 
allegheny and ohio rivers authorities said 
the slick moving sluggishly down the allegheny northwest of 
pittsburgh resulted from a landslide that cracked a pipeline 
friday the pipeline released a mixture of gasoline kerosene and 
lesser amounts of other fuels into a tributary creek at freeport 
about 35 miles northeast of pittsburgh 
buckeye pipeline co estimated it lost about 98000 gallons of 
fuel from the 10inchwide pipeline linking linden nj and the 
pittsburgh suburb of coraopolis 
the company said it recovered about 20 percent of the spilled 
fuel and the us environmental protection agency estimated that 
75600 gallons leaked into knapp run creek then into the 
allegheny the cleanup continued sunday 
pennsylvania gov robert p casey on sunday declared a state of 
emergency along the section of the allegheny affected by the spill 
suffice it to say there is still a high level of concern 
casey said but we believe the situation is being dealth with 
adequately 
the 30milelong slick was at least five miles northeast of 
pittsburgh city water department engineer alex sciulli told an 
evening news conference 
this spill has been very difficult to track sciulli said 
many water treatment plants cannot filter out the fuels in the 
spill said allegheny county health director albert brunwasser 
officials were trying to develop a treatment program he said 
in harrison township a city of about 15000 people nearly 35 
miles northeast of pittsburgh residents had to rely on water 
brought by truck and tanker to community fire stations said county 
deputy fire marshal nat mastro 
in a worstcase scenario about 50000 people in more than 30 
communities that get their water from the allegheny could be 
without it by monday mastro said 
in pittsburgh officials said they expected to shut down the 
citys water intakes leaving at least a threeday reserve 
mayor sophie masloff has asked all residents in the city of 
about 400000 people to reduce water use sciulli said if 
residents cooperate the reserve could last an additional two days 
we feel were in very good shape sciulli said 
officials in other communities were not as optimistic 
brackenridge emergency management director dennis vrotny said 
fire departments in his community and others were drawing as much 
water as possible from tributaries to the allegheny to add to their 
reservoirsvrotny said coperation from residents was essential 
i dont think its going to hold if people dont conserve 
now he said as it is were losing ground fast 
the water system in brackenridge a community of about 4000 
serves 30000 people vrotny said 
eight municipal water authorities that draw supplies from the 
ohio up to 12 miles northwest of pittsburgh were asked to begin 
saving water in case the slick reaches them said beaver county 
emergency services director russell chiodo the ohio flows out of 
the juncture of the allegheny and monongahela in pittsburgh 
the authorities serve about 40000 people chiodo said we 
want them to be conservative as all heck right now he said we 
dont know whats going to happen 
eightyfive cleanup workers from buckeye pipeline and 
contractors used absorbent pads attached to floating booms to 
remove oil from the allegheyny said charles kleeman the epas 
pittsburgh administrator 
the state department of environmental resources and county 
health laboratories tested river water samples to determine the 
extent of pollution and whether the fuellaced water was flammable 
kleeman said 
federal state and county emergency management officials said 
experience from a 4 milliongallon spill two years ago on the 
monongahela helped this weekends cleanup 
the spill has not affected the monongahela

when there were only four television channels in 
britain watching telly was the countrys favorite pasttime and 
viewers boasted british programs were the best in the world 
now that government deregulation is bringing a smorgasbord of 
conventional and satellite tv channels to british homes studies 
show audiences have dropped by 10 percent half of those still 
watching grumble about the programming 
its a paradox that is troubling an industry in upheaval as the 
latest target of prime minister margaret thatchers selloff of 
stateowned or regulated enterprises 
until last year when publisher rupert murdoch introduced 
satellite television to britain television was neatly carved among 
four networks two run by the statefunded british broadcasting 
corp and two by private companies 
now legislation before the house of commons calls for 
auctioning off all the commercial tv franchises and the creation of 
a fifth landbased tv channel 
it is the most radical overhaul since commercial networks were 
first allowed to compete with the venerable bbc in 1955 
a private consortium meanwhile is about to launch britains 
second satellite tv network british satellite broadcasting to 
compete with murdochs moneylosing sky television 
all thats missing are the viewers 
britons still watch an average of about 25 hours of television 
every week but thats a 10 percent drop from five years ago 
despite the arrival of overnight television in 1987 and then sky 
some of this drop is attributable to video but the same 
period saw a considerable increase in alternative leisure 
activities taking two or more holidays eating out said barry 
cox director of london weekend television 
bernard bennett lwts controller of research thinks the 
existing cake will have to be carved up in a larger number of 
portions to accommodate the new channels 
first on the air will be british satellite broadcasting the 
international consortium awarded the government franchise to use 
the five satellite channels allocated to britain under an 
international treaty 
the 2 billion consortium is the secondlargest private sector 
investment project in britain after eurotunnel the tunnel under 
the english channel between england and france 
the five bsb channels including a movie channel trumpeting 
deals with six of the top eight hollywood studios will go 
headtohead beginning april 29 with the four channels of sky 
television sky already is losing 32 million a week 
neither of us has any clue whether theres room for one or 
room for two admitted bsb spokesman edward bickham 
on a financial basis we have the ability to spread the risks 
of the project across a number of major companies no one has to 
bet their business on bsb 
referring to an industry study showing 44 percent of viewers 
saying they find nothing appealing when they want to watch 
television bickham said we believe theres a lot of room for 
extra choice 
were not trying to take over the market from the four 
existing generalist channels but offering a complimentary service 
alongside he said 
bsb expects to be in 1 million of britains 22 million homes by 
the end of the year and in 3 million its breakeven point by the 
end of 1991 
channel 5 the proposed new landbased commercial channel 
probably will not begin broadcasting until the mid1990s because of 
a wrangle over the type of transmission system even then it will 
reach only 70 percent of households and all their video recorders 
will have to be retuned to avoid interference 
at present the bbc carries no advertisements and the two 
commercial networks do there are 15 regional franchises awarding 
to companies that broadcast on the commercial networks they will 
all be put on the auction block in 1993 
theres no guarantee that any of the existing companies such as 
london weekend television makers of upstairs downstairs or 
granada television which brought out the jewel in the crown 
will retain their franchises 
in fact michael grade chief executive of the existing channel 
4 commercial network predicts few of the present companies will 
have the money to compete with the powerful consortia bidding 
against them 
they may make what they know to be a sensible bid and still 
lose to a group which is much more optimistic or has simply got its 
sums wrong grade told a recent american chamber of commerce 
luncheon 
is it really right i ask to hand out broadcasting licenses 
to people who for whatever reason may simply be offering too much 
money for them

southmark corp and its unsecured creditors have 
agreed on a new bankruptcy reorganization plan the real estate 
holding company said sunday 
the agreement to be filed with the us bankruptcy court in 
dallas calls for a quicker payout to creditors than the company 
offered in its original reorganization proposal 
the new plan also restructures some securities and proposes a 
reduction in payout to southmarks equity holders the company said 
since filing chapter 11 last july our objective has been to 
avoid lengthy and expensive litigation and to provide prompt 
distributions from the estate board chairman arthur g weiss 
said in a statement 
the unsecured creditors had presented the biggest obstacle to a 
reorganization plan put forward by southmark in january that plan 
called for the company to sell nearly all of its assets except for 
its houstonbased thrift san jacinto savings association 
southmark officials then projected total payments to creditors 
of 284 million 
unsecured creditors mainly holders of over 1 billion in 
southmarks junk bonds were unhappy with the size of the planned 
payout and the companys proposal to use securities instead of cash 
to satisfy claims they proposed the complete liquidation of 
southmark 
junior debtholders and equity holders also opposed the original 
plan arguing that they would not fare as well as senior 
debtholders 
the new reorganization plan retains a controversial deal 
southmark made with federal thrift regulators to retain control of 
san jacinto 
under the new plan the companys senior creditors will receive 
up to 75 million in cash as well as secured notes and stock in 
the reorganized southmark the company said 
the reorganization and future management of the company will be 
supervised by a new board of directors to be elected by the 
creditors 
holders of subordinated debt will receive stock in the 
reorganized company and other considerations senior and 
subordinated creditors will share in proceeds that may be received 
by southmark from litigation resulting from the companys failure 
southmarks current common and preferred shareholders will 
receive a portion of common stock of the reorganized company 
southmarks bankruptcy filing made in atlanta and moved to 
dallas listed total assets of 1046 billion secured debt of 
1524 million unsecured debt of 1051 billion and other 
liabilities of 1909 million 
the unsecured creditors committee said unsecured claims against 
southmark were closer to 15 billion the dallas morning news 
reported saturday 
nonthrift assets the company has proposed selling include 
insurance oil and nursing home companies interest in casinos in 
atlantic city and san juan puerto rico and numerous real estate 
partnerships they were acquired mainly through financing provided 
by highrisk highyield junk bonds sold by drexel burnham lambert

the new chairman of ford motor co says there is 
some truth to the perception that japanese automakers turn out a 
better quality product than their us counterparts 
if you look at the japanese i think were equal to some and 
not as good as the best harold red poling said in an 
interview published in sundays editions of the detroit news our 
objective is to get there that says you get the reality and youre 
going to get the perception 
poling who took over as chairman last month said he doesnt 
believe the japanese have a technological edge over americas big 
three automakers but he said there is a disparity in operational 
costs 
can we get plants in the united states to produce vehicles as 
inexpensively as the japanese do you bet but that requires 
shutting down your plants and starting from scratch we cant do 
that 
we have a workforce we have retirees were committed to 
pensions and were committed to health care and that gives us a 
serious noncompetitive disadvantage going in we have to deal with 
that somehow
