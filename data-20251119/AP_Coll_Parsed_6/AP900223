the opposition coalition will 
recognize an election victory by president daniel ortegas 
sandinista party if the vote is fair and the count is honest vice 
presidential candidate virgilio godoy said friday 
we will forget all the unfair campaign practices of the flsn 
sandinistas if the final voting process sunday is clean godoy 
told a news conference 
if there is fraud and we are not saying now that there will 
be we will issue a public protest and then consider other forms 
of passive resistance godoy said 
elliott richardson the head of the un observer mission told 
a news conference he expects a fair election 
ive given a lot of thought to how the system could be beat 
he said i havent yet been able to come up with a good scheme 
richardson is a former us attorney general 
the final un preelection report he released concludes that 
the election has done much to move nicaragua toward becoming a 
pluralistic society 
meanwhile former president jimmy carter perhaps the most 
important of the estimated 2000 observers of sundays vote 
arrived in managua he was meeting the main presidential candidates 
as well as other leading observers during the afternoon 
carter drove through streets filled with sandinista banners 
posters and placards past people wearing daniel presidente 
caps backpacks and tshirts eight feet in the air blackandred 
sandinista helium balloons decorated the fronts of many businesses 
in contrast a lone redandwhite uno united national 
opposition banner hung across one boulevard the minor social 
christian partys blue fish symbol was more evident drawn by hand 
on walls 
ortega his voice hoarse and gravelly after days of publicly 
speaking maintained his conciliatory attitude towards the 
opposition he expects to beat soundly on sunday 
the sandinista national liberation front is in agreement with 
violeta barrios de chamorros call to avoid violence said ortega 
after meeting with joao baena soares secretarygeneral of the 
organization of american states and another top observer 
ortega and mrs chamorro of the opposition coalition are the 
leading presidential candidates eight others are running but are 
given little chance 
also at stake are the vice presidency a 90member national 
assembly and 146 city town and regional councils about 175 
million people are registered to vote 
godoy dismissed a recent poll by the washington post that 
indicated a big sandinista lead as lacking credibility 
nicaraguans are afraid when the nicaraguan is polled he is 
always trying to figure who is conducting the poll and his 
motives he said 
ortega said he was certain of victory and trusted mrs 
chamorros desire to avoid violence but that he was still worried 
about more radical elements of the opposition 
military sources said friday that a large contingent of contra 
rebels perhaps as many as 300 has descended from mountain camps 
in the central province of chontales 
adolfo vargas a member of the villa sandino city council said 
groups of 20 rebel fighters had been spotted in the bush and fields 
near the main road to the atlantic coast 
he said the government fears they may try to provoke violence or 
intimidate voters on election day although the contra leadership 
has said the guerrillas have been told only to defend themselves 
and not to interfere in the election process 
on thursday ortega said the sandinistas have spent about 7 
million on their campaign 
he said any complaints about the illegal use of government 
property should be filed with the supreme electoral council or the 
international observers 
godoy said the opposition coalition spent less than 1 million 
because the money promised by the united states never arrived 
however other political sources said the coalition did receive 
money from the united states through private donations and other 
channels 
us officials have said that if ortega wins a free and fair 
election the bush administration would consider normalizing 
relations with managua as long as other conditions are fulfilled 
as well those include stopping the export of arms to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador and honoring human rights 
ortega in an interview published in saturday editions of the 
new york times was quoted as saying that if reelected he would 
not provide arms to the salvadoran guerrillas in the past ortega 
has said he would respect regional agreements prohibiting giving 
arms to the guerrillas

a pipeline break at a shell oil refinery 
near the mississippi river spilled an estimated 672000 gallons of 
crude oil 16 times more than the company originally said the 
state announced thursday 
mondays accident was the latest in a series of mishaps at the 
refinery in the last two years 
in pipeline leaks alone there has been more than a million 
gallons of product loss since middecember said will flower a 
spokesman for the illinois environmental protection agency there 
was a 300000gallon gasoline spill 
the new estimate of mondays spill was released by the state 
epa which is calling for a multimillion dollar study of a series 
of leaks spills and fires at the refinery near st louis mo 
shell called us this morning with the updated figure flower 
said 
he said no oil reached the river or a nearby marsh after the 
rupture in the pipeline which leads from a storage tank at the 
refinery 
the cleanup could take weeks if not months flower said 
calls to the shell refinery went unanswered late thursday 
afternoon 
cleanup crews on thursday used absorbent booms to soak up oil 
that washed into a retention pond built to catch spills flower 
said 
the pond discharges into a marshy area but there wasnt any 
noticeable oil in the marshy area he said 
on wednesday the illinois epa called for a study of the 
refinery to discover the cause of its recurring accidents 
at this time the entire shell facility is a prime candidate 
for a hazard and operability study flower said they do seem 
to be getting worse and we feel a real strong need to get a study 
under way 
illinois attorney general neil f hartigan filed a lawsuit in 
september against shell seeking 12 million in penalties for the 
various environmental mishaps last week hartigan amended the suit 
to include nine other accidents at the refinery since late november

contrary to previous findings women survive as 
well as men after heart attacks if their age and other illnesses 
are taken into account a new study says 
merely being a woman in and of itself does not appear to be a 
risk factor in connection with heart attacks said lead 
researcher dr nicholas h fiebach of yale university school of 
medicine 
fiebach and his colleagues explored the issue after two previous 
studies yielded conflicting results 
the new study involved 332 women and 790 men who had suffered 
heart attacks and found that 29 percent of the women and 23 
percent of the men died within the three years after the attack 
but when we did a statistical analysis that took into account 
differences in age diabetes and hypertension the differences in 
mortality werent there anymore fiebach said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
heart disease is the leading killer of men and women but women 
tend to be stricken when they are older and have more health 
problems said fiebach whose study appears in fridays journal of 
the american medical association 
women were more critically ill when they were admitted to the 
hospital and a greater proportion of them died there than did men 
the researchers found 
after being discharged from the hospital however the womens 
adjusted death rate appeared to be a little better than mens 
though the difference was not statistically significant fiebach 
said 
that finding is consistent with the fact that women in general 
tend to outlive men he said 
critics of governmentfunded research have said recently that it 
has focused too heavily on middleaged white men leaving a gap in 
knowledge about womens health risks 
it looks from all of the studies we have to date like the 
main risk factors for coronary heart disease in men are probably 
similar to the risk factors in women fiebach said 
he said researchers need to study whether risk factors traits 
that correspond with aboveaverage risk exist in women when they 
dont in men 
we know there is some relationship between female hormones and 
coronary heart disease and menopause he said

the trial judge in the drug trafficking case 
against ousted panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega upheld the 
release on bond of codefendant daniel miranda on thursday but 
changed his bail conditions 
miranda and defendant eduardo pardo who has pleaded guilty to a 
charge of illegal travel were accused of flying 800000 in drug 
money from fort lauderdale to panama in 1983 a week ago pardo 
became the first of noriegas codefendants to plead guilty 
us district judge william hoeveler upheld the pretrial release 
order of federal magistrate peter palermo but changed the amount 
of corporate surety bond from 100000 to 200000 while lowering 
the level of personal surety bond from 900000 to 800000 said 
mirandas attorney michael okane 
okane said the change in the corporate surety bond has doubled 
the 15 percent mirandas family will have to pay to get him out 
the personal surety bond will be backed by mortgages he said 
if the family can come up with 30000 then he can get out i 
thought that hoeveler would uphold palermos decision okane 
said but it increases the money he has to come up with and that 
will make it a little harder 
miranda who has been held at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center south of miami would be the second noriega 
codefendant released on bond brian alden davidow who surrendered 
in february 1988 was released on bond four days after the 
indictment was handed down 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from the 
cartel the panamanian leader who surrendered to us troops after 
the december invasion of his country has disputed the right of a 
us civilian court to judge him 
that question and other pending motions will be considered when 
noriega and four codefendants are to appear before hoeveler monday 
pardo faces up to five years in prison and a 10000 fine and 
will face sentencing april 25 on the single count of illegal travel 
prosecutors say pardo and miranda flew a lear jet fitted with 
secret compartments so that money could be hidden 
but okane said when pardo pleaded that miranda didnt know the 
money came from drugs 
i guess pardos guilty that doesnt mean that miranda is 
okane said at the time

a pickup truck loaded with drums of suspected 
explosive material erupted in flames near an internal revenue 
service office thursday snarling traffic and forcing the 
evacuation of thousands 
the abandoned truck burned itself out shortly after the fire was 
reported at 5 am but police closed off a 15block area for at 
least 13 hours as a police bomb squad worked to defuse what 
appeared to be a makeshift bomb 
the potential danger was very great assistant police chief 
robert vernon said thursday afternoon 
vernon said material in the five drums appeared to be extremely 
dangerous but it was not immediately identified as he spoke a 
fork lift operator was lifting the barrels out of the back of the 
truck 
we cant say at this moment that it would have flattened so 
many blocks but we have to assume the worst vernon said the 
assistant chief added he could not remember an explosive situation 
quite this large it looked to experts that it had the potential 
of being a large explosive device 
the truck was parked outside a city national bank building that 
also houses an irs annex and other offices 
several explosions accompanied the early morning fire said 
cmdr william booth 
it was shooting out flames said jim nord a 21yearold tow 
truck driver who said he saw the truck burning early thursday 
there were explosions that sounded like shotgun blasts 
officers allowed the fire to burn itself out called in bomb 
squad and hazardous materials experts and cordoned off the area 
agents from the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms also were 
called in 
booth said the substance in drums can be easily ignited and 
can explode he said the material is something our people know 
how to handle 
the street closure created nightmares for rush hour commuters in 
the heavily commercial district 
a fifthfloor window in the irs office was broken said officer 
sylvia palacio of the west los angeles station but it was unknown 
whether the broken window was related to the truck fire 
irs spokesman robert giannangeli said the agency had received no 
bomb threats he said up to 250 agency personnel including 
auditors return examiners and criminal investigators were based 
at the office 
while the investigation took place several thousand workers and 
residents were asked to evacuate the area the red cross set up a 
shelter for evacuees at the westwood park amp recreation center said 
red cross spokeswoman barbara wilks

from across a gurgling brook 
abrahim baht can see the house of his brother inside india but 
cannot go over to visit 
when someone marries baht can hear the celebration from the 
house which is about 10 yards away when theres a death the 
mournful wailing also reaches his ears 
baht 80 is banned from the house of his brother suleiman by 
a ceasefire line that separates india from pakistan 
indian troops man bunkers opposite bahts corn fields where the 
snowcapped mountains of the himalayas stretch into the heavens 
pakistani trenches line the hills behind him sometimes a rattle of 
automatic weapons fire cuts through the peace of bugina 
baht and his 70yearold brother are kashmiris the people who 
have inhabited this himalayan village for centuries 
their land was split between india and pakistan in 1947 
following the end of british colonial rule the two countries 
fought wars over the region in 1948 and 1965 now although few 
fear another conflict tensions are heating up again on the line 
on jan 20 indian troops launched a crackdown on moslem 
separatists in indias state of jammukashmir the only state in 
predominantly hindu india with a moslem majority the separatists 
want either an independent kashmir or union with pakistan a moslem 
nation 
tensions escalated when indian troops killed several pakistani 
students feb 11 on the border after the students tried to cross 
into india in solidarity with the separatists 
the recent troubles have made it even harder for baht and his 
brother 
when times were good the men would meet on a small rock in the 
middle of the stream and gossip about life on either side 
sometimes they would bring dishes for each other made by their 
wives there are no telephones 
now pakistan and indian troops have forbidden them from even 
talking 
dont let me catch you sneaking to the brook old man 
pakistan army lt raza aqeel shouted at baht one recent day near 
the ceasefire line youve lived a long time dont end it with 
an indian bullet 
they are my people how can i ignore them baht growled as 
his beard dyed red with henna bobbed up and down politics has 
divided my house in two my heart is weeping 
aqeel commands the posts above bahts house and is responsible 
for security in bugina a village of about 500 people 
we are ready for the enemy aqeel said full of a soldiers 
bravado we have all the newest weapons and we are sure to win 
the young lieutenants bluster is not shared by mohammed arfan 
a 45yearold farmer who lives in a big blue house just yards from 
the baht clan 
arfan fled to pakistan after the 1965 war which like the 1948 
conflict was lost by islamabad he joined the pakistan army 
traveled throughout the country but chose to settle in bugina 
because it was the nearest he could get to his native home 
this is my valley and fighting would only make us poorer 
said the 45yearold father of six i wish the politicians would 
forget us and then maybe we could live in peace 
arfan grew up on the indian side of the ceasefire line to this 
day his father and three brothers live in a small compound across 
the creek in india 
i came back in 1970 i was homesick for the kashmir but living 
here mixes happiness with pain he said i am so close to my 
people i can smell their cooking but i cant shake the hand of my 
father 
two weeks ago one of his nephews was married on the indian side 
listening to the noise was like a dagger splitting you in 
two said another relative mohammed dayub who operates the 
villages flour mill i wanted to make them cakes 
bugina is populated by devout moslems men often conduct their 
noon prayers on rocks amid the roaring blue waters of the neelum 
river which means turquoise in the urdu language women cover 
their heads in public and are generally banned from the bazaar in 
the nearest town about a mile away 
thus it is to their god allah that many in bugina look to 
solve the problems of kashmir 
india is not expected to give up its portion and pakistan would 
not tolerate an independence movement on its side of the ceasefire 
line 
says baht pointing to his brother who has come out of his house 
on the other side of the line all we can do is pray

the fbi has begun a preliminary inquiry into the 
way boston police investigated the circumstances surrounding the 
shooting of carol stuart who was apparently the victim of a fatal 
plot concocted by her husband 
initiated at the request of us attorney wayne budd the probe 
was undertaken concerning allegations that individuals were 
coerced or intimidated into making statements implicating willie 
bennett according to a statement issued thursday by fbi special 
agent thomas hughes 
bennett was named as a suspect after the pregnant attorney was 
shot oct 23 and her husband charles stuart was seriously 
wounded his name was cleared after stuart apparently committed 
suicide jan 4 upon learning that his brother had implicated him in 
the crime 
stuart originally told police a black gunman had murdered his 
wife in the citys mission hill neighborhood touching off a 
massive search in which black residents allege their civil rights 
were violated and witnesses were coerced 
police commissioner francis m roache was advised of the inquiry 
and has promised the departments cooperation the statement said 
roache and suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan did 
not immediately return messages late thursday night

the drive to unify germany which has the 
enthusiastic support of the bush administration may have to slow 
down to deal with some painful questions about borders and with 
echoes of a horrible past 
the pace has picked up to the point secretary of state james a 
baker iii would not be surprised if there is union of west germany 
with east germany by the end of the year many west germans say 
they are sure of it 
as baker and his key advisers see it free elections in east 
germany in midmarch will legitimize the government that emerges 
the elected leaders then could begin unification talks quickly with 
west germany 
the catchy twoplusfour formula that baker persuaded the 
soviet union britain and france to approve at an open skies 
conference last week in ottawa gives the germans a lot of room to 
decide their countrys future 
the big four allies of world war ii then would meet to discuss 
security issues but the formula is vague on how much influence the 
four the united states the soviet union britain and france 
would have over sovereign german policy 
so far the main us goal is that germany remain in the north 
atlantic treaty organization however there is a lot more on the 
minds of the soviet union and poland bloodied victims of german 
invasion a halfcentury ago 
they are seeking reassurance the mighty country about to emerge 
is not looking eastward to recover territory lost at the end of 
world war ii 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev acknowledged again on 
tuesday that the two germanys had a right to unify but he stressed 
the soviet unions own inalienable right to make sure 
unification does not lead to moral political or economic 
damage 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze meanwhile suggested 
unification would not happen as quickly as they imagine in 
bonn adding that it requires several years 
the german lebensraum that drove the world into its costliest 
war in 1939 is on the minds of lots of europeans 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has said 
repeatedly the new germany would encompass west germany east 
germany and the nowdivided city of berlin but it would seek no 
other territory 
the two germanys have signed agreements recognizing polands 
western border but west german chancellor helmut kohl who will 
visit president bush this weekend at camp david has said he cannot 
make promises about the border on behalf of a united germany 
other victims of nazi aggression also are anxious 
moshe arad the israeli ambassador to washington told the 
american jewish congress in west palm beach fla monday that 
israel recognizes the right of the german people to determine their 
own destiny 
at the same time arad said we are totally justified in 
observing with trepidation the movement toward german unification 
the nazis and their accomplices tried to extinguish european 
jewry in world war ii they nearly reached their goal killing 6 
million 
poland which was crushed by the german war machine is seeking 
a peace treaty to secure its western border 
we are demanding that before the reunification prime 
minister tadeausz mazowiecki said wednesday the total removal of 
those ambiguities must take place 
so far the bush administration will not expand the group of 
four to include poland or other european countries the us 
position rests on the agreement at the end of world war ii that 
gave the big four allies special rights over vanquished germany 
but mazowiecki said it is unthinkable in todays democratic 
world to have this form of yalta where one group of countries 
could decide about another 
west germany has rejected a role for poland but approval of the 
twoplusfour plan in ottawa does not deter the soviet union 
from supporting warsaws claim 
the uncertain situation has had an ironic twist the 
solidaritydominated warsaw government wants to keep soviet troops 
in poland as insurance against the new germany even as it breaks 
away from leninism 
genscher with us support has offered to keep nato forces 
from moving into what is now east german territory after 
unification but evidently the offer is not enough to quiet 
everyones nerves 
kohls talks with bush and baker will have to take these 
concerns into account

stop dumping your trash on our national 
seashore the federal government is telling the cape cod mass 
community of provincetown 
stop playing big brother with our land is the towns response 
what began as a squabble over the future of the provincetown 
landfill has escalated to a cabinet and congressionallevel fight 
on the surface is a dispute over the future of a town dump 
located on federal property underneath according to some 
participants is the latest skirmish in a dispute between a small 
community and the federal government over one of the nations most 
popular seacoast attractions the cape cod national seashore 
the seashore has an i dont care attitude sandra turner 
provincetowns public works director said thursday this is big 
brother the federal government and its picking on this tiny 
community 
the federal government no longer wants provincetown to use 
national seashore land for its town landfill seashore officials 
have given the community of 3200 yearround residents on the tip 
of cape cod until october to find another place to dump their trash 
seashore officials say the landfill threatens the pristine sand 
dunes and scrub pine forests that form the spectacular landscape on 
the tip of cape cod 
the dump has adverse impacts on groundwater wetlands and 
ponds said andrew ringgold superintendent of the cape cod 
national seashore theres windblown litter all through adjacent 
areas its just totally incompatible with the mission of the 
national park service 
the town argues it may use the landfill under an agreement 
reached in 1961 when the national park service established the 
national seashore a move that swallowed up 80 percent of 
provincetowns land area 
the rancor over the landfill dispute has much deeper roots 
according to local and regional officials the town has feuded with 
the seashore over beach access for local fishermen driving offroad 
vehicles over the extension of a commission designed to hear local 
concerns about the seashore management and over a federal plan to 
demolish dune shacks viewed by locals as historic relics 
rep gerry studds dmass met with constance harriman an 
official in the department of interior regarding the landfill 
dispute 
should this decision stand studds said it would worsen 
the already strained relationship between the town and the federal 
agency 
ringgold said his first responsibility is to the environmental 
integrity of the seashore but he conceded that good public 
relations with the six communities that encompass the seashore are 
crucial 
one of my biggest responsibilities is to develop and maintain 
cooperative working relationships with officials of these 
communities ringgold said but he added cooperative working 
relationships doesnt always mean were going to agree on 
everything 
ringgold who took over his job in november was not around 
during the earlier battles between the town and the park service 
on july 4 1989 a parade of fourwheeldrive vehicles drove 
through provincetown to underscore the local popularity of motor 
access to the dunes 
there have been delays in recent years in receiving federal 
approval for meetings of the seashore advisory commission a 
sounding board for local concerns about the seashore and its 
management 
and only after a long battle did local preservationists save 
dune shacks some of which were used by famous authors and artists 
from demolition 
but ringgold said he resents the efforts by locals to portray 
the seashore as a faceless bureaucracy beating up on a tiny 
community 
i dont think that this ought to be painted as a pr problem 
or a battle with the town ringgold said its just an accident 
of geography

air travel for families with young children 
could become more costly under the airline industrys proposed 
infant safety seat requirement 
in an unusual step the air transport association asked the 
federal aviation administration to set a tougher requirement than 
the agency itself is considering 
the faa on thursday proposed regulations to require airlines to 
allow passengers to use safety seats if they want to airlines now 
have the option of barring them and said it would consider making 
the seats mandatory after receiving public comment on the issue 
the ata which represents major air carriers wants the seats 
required for all passengers under 2 years old the ata proposes 
that the rule change go into effect a year after it is adopted 
the proposal if adopted by the faa could require thousands of 
parents each day to buy tickets for children who now fly free 
airlines however still would have the option of offering free 
rides or reduced fares 
if you buckle your children up at 50 miles per hour why not 
at 550 miles per hour asked ata president robert aaronson 
he referred to laws in all states that require safety seats for 
infants in automobiles faa rules say children under 2 may be 
carried in adult airline passengers laps 
airlines previously encouraged infant seat use but opposed rules 
to require them 
faa administrator james busey said he welcomed the industrys 
willingness to enhance passenger safety 
the airline group also announced a campaign to distribute cards 
advising parents to buy tickets for their youngsters and take along 
car safety seats when they fly even though they are not now 
required 
concern over infant safety seats increased after the july 19 
crash of a united airlines dc10 at sioux city iowa in which an 
unsecured infant was among 112 people killed scores of other 
passengers escaped 
in the avianca crash that killed 73 people in new york a month 
ago 17 infants were among the 159 passengers one child was killed 
and six were injured 
aaronson told a news conference that the 5000 to 10000 infants 
carried by us airlines daily would be far safer strapped into 
car seats than in adults laps nearly all car seats carry labels 
saying they are approved for planes by the faa 
if the rule is imposed airlines likely would continue to accept 
infants free on flights when extra seats are available he said 
acknowledging that parents might have to pay full or discount fares 
to take them on heavily booked flights 
asked why the industry does not adopt the infant seat 
requirement on its own aaronson said there is a growing consensus 
among airlines medical organizations consumer groups and others 
that a uniform faa rule would be best 
just before the ata news conference rep jim lightfoot riowa 
and sen christopher bond rmo told a news conference they will 
push legislation that would order the faa to require the seats 
if you have a corpse on an airplane it has to be tied down 
said lightfoot but a kid can be left to fly free around the 
cabin 
bond said that when he was missouri governor he had difficulty 
getting airlines to allow him to use a car seat for his infant son 
bond held a lifelike doll against his chest and to demonstrate 
what could happen aboard an airliner tossed it out of his hands 
a baby becomes a ballistic he said 
the faa has resisted calls for tougher rules partly because of 
the cost to parents and the low number of infant casualties in 
airliner accidents a harvard medical school study estimated in the 
early 1980s that three lives could have been saved over five years 
with the use of safety seats

the witness was affable he took the oath 
took the stand winked at the defendant stated his name spelled 
it out ronald reagan and said he used to be in politics 
and before that in the movies and prior to that i was a sports 
announcer in radio 
but in his command performance for the cameras of the court 
ronald reagan had trouble remembering 
dates pictures documents memoes aides meetings 
he is 79 years old now and some of the events he was questioned 
about took place years ago he has always denied directing them 
there were so many meetings and so many different places he 
said on the witness stand 
i know it is tough mr president said lawyer richard 
beckler 
asked if he had dispatched john vessey to central america 
reagan had trouble identifying vessey who served as chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff from june 1982 to september 1985 
counsel could you explain to the members of the jury who 
general vessey was 
reagan oh dear i could ask for help here the name i know 
is very familiar i am wondering if 
counsel this is in connection with a trip by the joint chiefs 
of staff 
reagan well that i dont i dont think this was my 
military aide but obviously he was in a position to do this if he 
was the chief of staff 
questioned in his videotaped deposition last week to be used in 
the trial of his former national security adviser john m 
poindexter reagan was treated with deference 
mr president he was called at one point a lawyer went 
too far directing the witness perhaps you could tell the 
jurors as much as you can remember about that whole scene right 
there with mr jacobson and judge harold greene interrupted 
no said greene no no no no no were not here to 
inquest the entire contra affair 
greene himself is a testament to the democratic system he was 
born heinz grunhaus in 1923 in frankfurt an der oder in what is now 
east germany he presided over one of the most important cases 
the breakup of atampt in american commercial history 
now he is presiding over a trial of a former top presidential 
aide charged with obstructing congress conspiracy and making false 
statements about the sale of arms to iran and the transfer of the 
proceeds to the contras 
poindexter wants to show he was following reagans orders 
reagan was generally relaxed genial occasionally testy he 
offered a broad wink to defendant poindexter he talked directly 
into the camera 
it was vintage reagan a man of iron conviction on the big 
picture but fading on the details 
he told anew of lenins plot to take over eastern europe then 
the hordes of asia then latin america so america would be left 
alone the last bastion of capitalism 
but he was rusty about the role of col oliver north asked what 
he thought north had been doing he said you have to have people 
that can be available to make contact with the leaders of the 
contras and so forth sometimes closer than just writing a letter 
it was my understanding because his name would crop up in memos 
and so forth that thats what he was doing 
he was asked if he remembered what position rep lee hamilton 
dind took on contra aid when he ran the house intelligence 
committee 
i dont recall what position he was taking or where he was 
there are 435 of them remember 
he was asked about a meeting with a european prime minister 
since i met with 400 heads of state heads of government 
foreign ministers and so forth in the eight years no i cant 
recall what i particularly said to any of them 
he was asked if he remembered reading a memo which bore his 
initials on the bottom 
he said the papers generated in his white house were numerous 
there are 50 million pieces of paper 
he was asked if he recalled meeting contra leader adolfo calero 
who posed with him in a white house picture 
i hate to keep throwing figures at you he said but i 
have been told that because of the business of our hollywood 
photographers i have got something over a million photos of people 
that came in there as visitors

here are some of the highlights from former 
president reagans testimony for john poindexters upcoming trial 
in the irancontra affair 
reagan said he never had any inkling his aides were 
secretly arming the nicaraguan contras 
he said he remained unconvinced there had been a diversion of 
iran arms sale money to the rebels until prosecutors confronted him 
with the report of the tower commission he appointed 
reagan said he would have expected poindexter his former 
national security adviser to inform him of any diversion of funds 
to the contras unless maybe he thought he was protecting me from 
something 
reagan said he agreed with a letter poindexter sent to congress 
saying the white house was complying with the congressional ban on 
help for the contras a letter that forms part of the basis for 
one charge poindexter faces however reagan said he was unfamiliar 
with references in the letter to earlier denials that north was 
raising funds or supplying the contras with military advice 
during crossexamination prosecutors introduced evidence that 
poindexter lied to reagan about the secret aid operation after a 
c123 cargo plane was shot down over nicaragua during a supply 
flight on oct 5 1986 in written interrogatories to the 
irancontra grand jury earlier reagan said poindexter first told 
him that the sole survivor of the crash eugene hasenfus was not 
connected with the us government 
reagan may have helped poindexter by testifying that he could 
not recall when he knew about a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran the shipment figures in four of the five criminal 
charges against poindexter poindexter is accused of telling 
congress in november 1986 that us officials didnt find out that 
hawks were aboard the 1985 shipment until january 1986

the city wants oh calcutta 
broadways longrunning nude revue to bare all somewhere else 
officials filed suit thursday in hamilton county chancery court 
to block the showing of oh calcutta at the tivoli theater on 
grounds the musical is obscene and lewd 
oh calcutta the secondlongest broadway musical with 
5959 performances raised eyebrows and was threatened with banning 
when it opened in 1969 when nudity on stage and screen was still 
something of a novelty 
many critics consider oh calcutta a fairly tame show but 
its current sixmonth tour of more than 90 cities has shown the 
passions it aroused 20 years ago still linger 
on feb 7 the city authorities of springfield mo forced the 
actors to wear bras fleshcolored underwear and gstrings during a 
performance before 5000 people the first time the calcutta cast 
had been clad 
a chattanooga promoter wants to stage the play may 2 or may 6 
but the memorial auditorium board which runs the tivoli voted 
last week against bringing in the production 
al stewart spokesman for the musicals promoter singer 
entertainment consultants of port murray nj said the play was 
not obscene 
something that has been around for 21 years and has played in 
15 countries before 60 million people i wouldnt go that far 
to say it is obscene said stewart it is done in art its 
theater 
city attorney randy nelson said the board just wants to do 
what it feels is best for the community and have shows that are in 
tune with community tastes 
the 10page lawsuit contends the musical violates the states 
obscenity law as well as state and local laws against indecent 
exposure and a local ordinance against lewd and indecent conduct 
the musical includes simulated intercourse 
officials filed the lawsuit because the tivoli is publicly owned 
and can only deny use if an event violates local laws or business 
criteria 
it is not the first time in recent history that city officials 
tried to ban a theatrical production in 1975 an effort to block a 
production of the rock musical hair went all the way to the 
us supreme court 
the justices did not rule on whether hair was obscene but 
they did strike down the ban on grounds that officials did not have 
sufficient evidence to halt the play 
the reason the city lost the hair case was they banned the 
play without firsthand information they did so on hearsay 
said david johnson manager of the tivoli here they have read 
the actual script of this particular presentation

there are 270 dead sheep 100 aborted 
calves six sick people traces of chemicals and sightings of a 
mysterious crop duster airplane 
and while some tantalizing hints have been raised no one really 
knows the solution to this rural whodunit in southeastern 
washingtons cattle and potatogrowing country 
how to poison that many animals that fast is still a 
mystery said clarke brown a state department of agriculture 
investigator for that many to get poisoned without finding the 
obvious source is extremely unusual 
investigators are focusing on two farm chemicals but say they 
dont account for all the problems in fact they say the animal 
deaths which occurred in adjacent fields could be unrelated 
according to the investigators some evidence was initially 
withheld by witnesses and so much time passed before a 
veterinarian was called after the midjanuary cow abortions that 
any chemical traces had disappeared 
all i know is a bunch of cattle died and sheep said len 
mcirvin the rancher who lost 15 cows and about 100 calves in the 
spontaneous abortions 
one possible culprit the hanford nuclear weapons plant has 
been ruled out by investigators the government plant the most 
contaminated nuclear waste site in the nation is a few miles west 
of burbank 
its proximity seems to have made residents of the snake river 
town of 700 immune to sudden panic weve lived around a nuclear 
plant all our lives john hash of burbank said why worry about 
a few sheep dying 
investigators admit they may never know the full story 
ive been involved in looking at cases for 15 years and ive 
never seen anything like it said lynden baum an investigator 
for the state department of health 
this much is known 
about 270 sheep were found dead in a field near burbank on 
nov 21 investigators have ruled out overeating bad water weeds 
or diseases tests of the animals stomach fluids found traces of 
the pesticide aldicarb used to kill insects in potatoes 
investigators dont know how the chemical got there but there 
is some suspicion that the sheep may have eaten from bags of 
aldicarb that had not yet been used brown said 
the bags were not mentioned for the first full week we were 
well into the investigation when we learned that some bags were out 
there brown said 
the only known farm chemicals being applied at the time the 
sheep died was telone used to control worms in potatoes it was 
found in the kidney of only one sampled sheep brown said 
six people who traveled in the vicinity of the field that day 
have reported becoming ill with respiratory problems three are 
still reporting breathing problems the agriculture department 
said we dont know what hurt the people baum said 
one dead hereford cow was found in an adjacent field the day 
after the sheep died along with signs that four pregnant cows had 
aborted in midjanuary two weeks before the calving season about 
half the 226 heifers on mcirvins nearby diamond m ranch had 
miscarriages the normal miscarriage rate that late would be almost 
zero mcirvin said about 15 cows also died in january 
ranchers did not call a veterinarian into the case until last 
week brown said by then it was impossible to find traces of 
chemicals in the animals he said 
we assumed what was killing the sheep killed the cattle 
mcirvin said 
a ranch employee who became ill waited several months before 
reporting the sighting of a propellerdriven airplane dropping a 
white powder near the cows on nov 21 others nearby saw no 
airplane officials arent sure why the plane was not reported 
before

prince charles makes it plain as the nose on 
his royal face that he isnt very fond of modern british 
architecture what then an american asked does he think of 
washingtons gleaming new skyline of glass and steel 
the 41yearold heir to the british throne rocked on his heels 
at the embassy reception thursday paused a long moment and smiled 
mischievously i prefer paris he said 
his reply foreshadowed the indictment of modern urban design 
that he delivered a few hours later at a blacktie awards gala of 
the american institute of architects at the national building 
museum where roast beef was served by candlelight at 250 a plate 
if the 1200 architects and their guests wanted their dessert 
laced with princely scorn charles scorn charles didnt disappoint 
them 
much of the commercial building of today bears as much 
relation to architecture as advertising slogans bear to 
literature he said charging that their designers ransack 
history as if it were a wardrobe full of old clothes 
charles challenged american architects to reverse the trend 
toward cities that are the epitome of the throwaway society 
torn down and rebuilt by successive generations and design 
buildings of lasting beauty that are fit for human beings 
it sometimes seems to me that the richer we get the uglier we 
tend to make our surroundings he said what is worse not only 
do we seem to have mislaid the ability to create beauty but we 
also set out to destroy what beauty there is left in the world 
the prince said his invitation to speak was mystifying 
considering his criticism of the frankenstein monsters created 
by some british architects is there an epidemic of masochism 
sweeping the ranks of the aia he asked the audience roared 
charles speech was the highlight of a oneday washington visit 
that also included lunch with president bush and his top advisers 
at the white house a visit to aia headquarters and a british 
embassy reception 
outside the banquet hall about two dozen protesters stood 
behind police lines silently holding placards demanding withdrawal 
of british troops from northern ireland 
but charles was greeted by friendly demonstrators when he 
arrived at the aias octagon museum in midafternoon to open an 
exhibition of artifacts from sir christopher wrens design and 
construction of st pauls cathedral in london 
gee whiz charles said as he emerged from his rollsroyce 
limousine and saw picketers waving signs that read our knight in 
shining armor and humane architecture happy people 
as he left aia headquarters the prince shook hands with 
10yearold christopher wren of chevy chase md whose mother 
sherry said he decided to become an architect when he learned 
about his famous 17th century english namesake 
i hear youre a practicing architect charles said 
well id like to be someday young christopher replied 
adding that he already had a drafting table and a portfolio of 
designs 
it was really neat meeting him the boy said after charles 
left for the embassy reception honoring alumni of the marshall 
scholars program 
under the program that began in 1954 a small group of 
exceptional american students currently 30 each year are chosen 
to spend two or three years at british universities with all 
expenses paid by the british government 
charles urged the alumni to use the power of the lobby to 
carry out his goals of improving education protecting the 
environment and encouraging private investment to revitalize 
deteriorating urban neighborhoods 
embassy sources said the princes luncheon discussion with bush 
dealt with environmental concerns and charles plan to visit 
hungary in early may one purpose of that trip they said will be 
to explore opportunities for private investments aimed to building 
a freemarket economy in that country

the typical farmer may be ready to buy 
something new for the first time in seven years instead of paying 
off old debts 
it could be additional land machinery or other items needed to 
produce crops and livestock says the agriculture department in 
any case the purchases probably will require at least some 
borrowed money 
farm debt nationally is expected to grow slightly in 1990 
ending an unprecedented paydown that began in the mid1980s for 
most farmers there was little choice as heavy debt loads and 
declining land values shrank their options 
but now after several years of financial recovery the 
departments economic research service says 1990 will be a turning 
point and farm debt will grow again 
economist jerry stam said thursday it will be a real weak 
turnaround certainly not the thunderous kickoff of another boom 
era that happened in the 1970s when soaring farmland prices and 
quick credit convinced thousands of farmers prosperity was around 
the corner 
it wasnt and in the early 1980s the financial crunch was on 
as land values plummeted so did credit ratings and farmers had to 
reorganize to survive paying off some of the old debt was part of 
the drill 
total us farm debt peaked at 1927 billion in 1983 more than 
double what it was a decade earlier 
since 1983 farm debt has declined for six straight years to an 
estimated 1356 billion in 1989 at 571 billion the biggest 
paydown on record 
now stam said the lenders are really competing for 
topquality loans so theyre starting to fight over market share 
again 
but the farmers have so adjusted to the way theyre operating 
that i dont see any great change in total debt it wouldnt 
surprise me if it didnt do much at all he said 
until the sixyear paydown there had been only one year 1953 
since 1945 in which farm debt did not increase the figures by 
themselves are boggling in 1945 farmers owed 67 billion it 
took until 1977 for farm debt to top 100 billion 
the figures do not include operator household debt owed for 
consumer items such as cars furniture and other family items 
bought on credit 
stam said an end to farm debt increases in 1990 depend on a 
number of factors including farmland values net cash income and 
decisions by farmers to buy additional land or replace worn 
machinery 
the record 571 paydown in the six years after farm debt peaked 
in 1983 was also spurred by writeoffs of bad loans by major 
lenders stam said in all those totaled about 138 billion 
stam said the farmers home administration accounted for about 
half of the writeoffs with commercial banks and the farm credit 
system the remainder 
the historical upward creep of farm debt culminating in the 
recent tumble is not necessarily an indicator of good times or bad 
for farmers 
i think you have to compare it with income cash flow and a 
lot of other things he said of course in the condition we 
had in the 70s everybody said it was a good thing to leverage and 
all that we got fooled its neither good nor bad by itself 
stam said that in the final analysis farmers must have enough 
cash flow to cover expenses but he added in modern 
agriculture its hard to operate without the use of debt capital

an agriculture department analysis shows 
cattle producers are headed for another year of recordhigh market 
prices and consumers will pay more for burgers steaks and chops 
total beef production by slaughter plants is expected to rise 
about 2 percent because of increased cattle marketings and heavier 
weights the departments economics research service said thursday 
but an expanding us population and increases in net beef 
exports will more than offset the larger output the report said 
that will mean less beef available on a per capita basis 
consequently market prices of choicegrade fed steers sold on 
the omaha neb market in 1990 may average about 1 more than last 
years record of 7250 per pound the report said that would push 
retail prices up 1 percent to 3 percent 
hog prices also are going up and may average in the range of 47 
to 53 per 100 pounds in 1990 compared with a little more than 44 
last year at the major markets 
retail pork prices have risen in recent months reflecting 
higher hog prices and wider farmtoretail marketing spreads 
the report said retail pork prices for the year may increase 6 
percent to 8 percent from last year

vice president dan quayle told a 
gathering of republican members of congress that the revolutions in 
eastern europe were a testament to american democracy but he said 
american society was troubled 
the united states is confronting a growing underclass of 
impoverished singleparent households that threatens the workforce 
of tomorrow a labor pool that will have to be highly trained and 
educated quayle said thursday night 
his speech was briefly interupted when several hecklers shouted 
from the balcony stop the killing and dan quayle there is 
blood on your hands apparently in reference to american 
involvement in central america 
two of the hecklers were arrested charged with disorderly 
conduct and disrupting a meeting and later released a third 
demonstrator was detained when he allegedly lunged at quayle 
outside the building where the speech was held 
quayle said 15 million children are growing up in homes with no 
father 25 percent of the nations children live in singleparent 
households and a majority of black children live with only one 
parent 
how will we compete with japan and germany and other nations 
that do not have this underclass he said to a gathering of about 
200 how will we produce a skilled workforce without 
strengthening the family structure 
quayles speech opened a retreat of republican members of 
congress sponsored by the congressional institute 
the institute is a republican think tank set up several years 
ago to study public policy issues the princeton conference is 
focusing on longrange economic social and demographic changes 
the revolution of 1989 was no accident it erupted from a 
swelling realization that democratic values are the wave of the 
future economic freedom generates wealth and political freedom is 
a requisite for peace and prosperity quayle said 
the cold war is not over but its funeral is close he said 
a protest outside the hall was waged by activists for homosexual 
rights aids research a stop to american involvement in panama and 
central america and abortion rights 
as he left the auditorium quayle greeted some of the 
protesters one of whom was grabbed by police after lunging at the 
vice president said princeton police

us officials are confused over a soviet 
proposal for troop cuts that they say is a step backward from an 
earlier agreement 
soviet negotiators in vienna suggested thursday the east and 
west blocs agree to a ceiling of 700000 and 750000 soldiers each 
in central europe say american and east german diplomats 
but us and soviet officials involved in the conventional force 
reduction talks already had agreed not to set an overall ceiling 
and instead to limit the americans to 225000 and the soviets to 
195000 troops in europe 
we are so confused we cannot be indignant said one 
administration source in washington commenting on the latest 
soviet suggestion he spoke on condition he not be further 
identified 
soviet envoys floated the idea as a suggestion but met with such 
opposition they decided not to make it a formal proposal the 
official said 
they could not even get their warsaw pact allies to agree to 
it and the western response was this is a nonstarter said 
the official 
the issue of troop levels in the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the sovietled warsaw pact has been complicated by 
the announcement by three members of the eastern bloc 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland that they were cutting the 
armed forces 
the soviets and east germans argue the combination of troop cuts 
would leave nato with a maximum of 1 million soldiers compared to 
700000 for the warsaw pact 
that situation is totally unsatisfactory ernst told 
reporters in vienna ernst said the overall ceiling suggested by 
the kremlin would include national armies and soviet troops 
stationed on foreign soil 
last week soviet and american officials cleared the way for the 
16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations to sign a conventional force 
reduction agreement by the end of the year as proposed by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
under that deal the soviet union and united states would reduce 
to 195000 each their forces stationed in germany belgium 
czechoslovakia denmark hungary luxembourg the netherlands and 
poland 
another 30000 us soldiers would be allowed in britain and 
southern europe to compensate for the distance between the united 
states and europe 
hungary and czechoslovakia are negotiating for total withdrawal 
of soviet forces from their territory about 50000 soviet troops 
are in hungary and 75000 in czechoslovakia 
the alliances have not agreed on how to define some types of 
weapons to be covered in the proposed pact or on rules for 
counting attack aircraft

former secretary of defense caspar weinberger 
says it is too soon to seek a peace dividend because of the 
fall of communist regimes in eastern europe and warming relations 
with the soviet union 
accepting the annual statesman of the year award at george 
washington university on thursday weinberger said i think it is 
vital that we remember that it was a strong defense and a greatly 
strengthened defense that led to a lot of these changes 
weinberger led the pentagon during most of the reagan 
administration a period that saw a large increase in american 
military spending 
reagan and his supporters argued it was the military buildup 
that forced the soviets to seek accommodation 
its awfully early for us to assume that things are such that 
we can in effect dismantle the military strength that helped 
bring the situation about and hunt around for a peace dividend 
weinberger said 
he said any such shift of money from the military is not 
going to be used to reduce our deficit it will be used for 
federal programs that are perceived to be more popular than 
military spending 
the former secretary said the soviets have not yet dismantled 
their military what they are doing is taking out their oldest 
tanks and oldest artillery and oldest planes and their oldest 
nuclear weapons and they are modernizing all of those categories 
and the soviet union remains the only country in the world 
that can destroy the united states overnight he said 
weinberger also argued that americans ought to worry a little 
bit about the effect on our economy of these very deep cuts 
you dont do a defense budget because its a very good jobs 
bill he said you dont do it to help the economy it does not 
hurt the economy however 
the fact is that the defense spending we did was a substantial 
help to the economy and if you reduce the armed forces sizably and 
if you stop weapons systems you are going to affect employment 
weinberger now publisher of forbes magazine was the third 
person to receive the statesmanship award it is presented by the 
alumni association of the school of government and business 
administration and by the national law center at the university 
the previous recipients were gen colin l powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state george p 
shultz

a veteran senate republican says his party 
will fight against strict campaign spending limits because the 
curbs would favor the majority democrats 
its not going to happen sen ted stevens ralaska said 
thursday as the senate rules committee began hearings on the 
politically divisive issue of campaign finance reform 
stevens the ranking republican on the committee told two 
democratic witnesses that spending curbs on all candidates would 
allow incumbents to win 99 percent of the time challengers he 
said have to outspend incumbents to win elections 
i dont think our side of the aisle is going to change he 
said while democrats control the senate 5545 and the house 
257175 
stevens suggested democrats drop proposals for spending limits 
and public financing and pass legislation that would curb mailing 
broadcast fees and other costs that would win wide bipartisan 
support 
stevens added public financing wouldnt curb runaway costs 
because the government money would only become a substitute for 
private donations 
but sen dennis deconcini dariz and rep dan glickman dkan 
told the committee campaign spending limits and public financing 
were essential to any agreement on campaign finance reform 
deconcini testifying on a bill he introduced this week told 
the panel reform without spending limits is no reform at all 
from 1976 to 1986 the cost of running a senate campaign didnt 
double didnt triple but increased fivefold 
deconcinis proposal which would apply only to the senate 
would base general election spending limits on a states voting age 
population the general election limit would be no lower than 
400000 and no more than 55 million the primary limit would be 
50 percent of the general election figure 
fully half of the senate races would be kept below 15 
million for the total spending cycle deconcini said he conceded 
the figure was high but said it would be a great improvement 
over the average of 37 million in 1988 
a formula based on the amount of small contributions received 
would determine the amount of public financing 
this would substantially reduce the amount of time a candidate 
is forced to spend on fundraising and would return the focus of a 
campaign to the issues of the day deconcini said 
glickman backed deconcini and urged that spending limits and 
public financing also apply to house races 
a potential challenger often must be a millionaire in order to 
stand a chance against a sitting incumbent glickman said noting 
most of my colleagues in the house have few serious challengers

governors would like more federal money for 
education health care transportation and repairing bridges and 
roads but most of the state officials say theyd just as soon see 
any peace dividend used to reduce the federal deficit 
with few exceptions the governors responding to an associated 
press survey said they expect defense spending to drop as a result 
of the dramatic changes in eastern europe where communist regimes 
have crumbled in recent months 
they sounded much more confident that federal funds would be 
freed for domestic needs than has president bush or his budget 
director richard g darman 
gov william donald schaefer a democrat from maryland has 
drafted a letter to congressional leaders urging that any defense 
savings be used to ease the pain of transition for the workers 
and businesses most affected by the reductions 
an aide to schaefer said thursday that several other governors 
including michael dukakis of massachusetts richard celeste of ohio 
and l douglas wilder of virginia were joining the maryland 
governor in the appeal 
schaefer hoped to use the annual winter meeting of the national 
governors association opening saturday to argue his case 
schaefer wants money for retraining displaced workers 
increasing research and development and rebuilding the nations 
infrastructure 
bush has brushed aside suggestions that a substantial peace 
dividend is in the offing 
many speak of the peace dividend few discuss the shortterm 
cost of peace he said in an address to the commonwealth club in 
san francisco earlier this month 
there will be costs as we cross the bridge to a better 
future he added 
in an introduction to the bushs 1991 budget darman director 
of the office of management and budget said people were 
overestimating the dividend he portrayed members of congress as 
devising spending plans that would total about 10 times the 
overestimated dividend 
gov buddy roemer of louisiana a democrat predicted the 
savings from reduced military spending could total 100 billion 
over the next three years 
the thing that can help louisiana the most is to lower the 
deficit he said 
theres no question theres going to be a dividend if youre 
using that term in the sense that the defense budget will come 
down said republican gov william clements of texas a former 
deputy defense secretary 
arguing that any such savings should go toward reducing the 
deficit clements said the proliferation of our domestic 
programs is a nono as far as im concerned 
clements emphasis on reducing the budget deficit was echoed in 
the responses of most of the governors 
first and foremost we should reduce the national budget 
deficit said republican george deukmejian of california 
any peace dividend should go primarily to balancing the 
budget said democrat george sinner of north dakota 
a few governors were hesitant about advocating sharp cuts in 
defense spending 
i believe the peace dividend is probably overstated said 
gov mike hayden a republican from kansas if there is one it 
should be used to lower the deficit 
republican gov stan stephens of montana warned against getting 
carried away with the euphoria of what is happening in eastern 
europe 
stephens said that if there was a peace dividend it should be 
used to lower taxes it belongs to the people he said i 
think we should give the taxpayers of this country a break 
among the dissenters from the call for earmarking the money for 
deficit reduction were govs robert casey of pennsylvania and neil 
goldschmidt of oregon both democrats 
goldschmidt called for shifting resources to those things we 
care about in life arts science health education and above 
all children 
as billions are pared from the pentagon budget its time for 
the federal government to return a substantial portion of that 
dividend to the states said casey 
he singled out mass transit as an area where federal funds are 
needed he said the budget proposed by bush includes no money for 
the philadelphia area transit system which was receiving 274 
million this year

with the opening of the berlin wall west 
germans are crossing the border to press thousands of claims on 
land or buildings east germans live in 
the claims may even affect some of east berlins most important 
public buildings they are another reminder of the difficulty of 
uniting the two germanys despite recent political progress 
according to the hamburgbased newsmagazine spiegel the east 
german foreign ministry is built on land claimed by a west berlin 
lawyer and the ground below east berlins huge tv reception tower 
is claimed by a swiss insurance company 
at least 500000 west germans have claims on buildings or land 
in east germany that was confiscated with little or no compensation 
by communist authorities west german officials say 
many of those making claims escaped to the west during the 
postwar soviet occupation or after communist east germany was 
founded others are the children of refugees or west germans who 
have inherited property from relatives in the east 
now after years of silence some of those owners are trying to 
get their possessions back 
the issue rests on complicated legal ground and could lead to 
lawsuits authorities on both sides of the border say 
a whole morass of property problems is coming down on us that 
well somehow have to solve said jutta probst a spokeswoman for 
the gesamtdeutsches institut in west berlin the institute is a 
branch of the bonn government that monitors east germany 
a special commission has been set up with representatives from 
both german governments to consider property disputes ms probst 
said in an interview 
aggression is mounting on both sides from the owners who want 
their property back on the one hand and east germans who fear the 
consequences on the other she said most of the confiscated 
property is owned or controlled by the east german government 
but officials say that little can be done before east germanys 
first free elections set for march 18 and the replacement of state 
ownership with private property 
meanwhile confrontations between west german owners and their 
tenants across the border are becoming increasingly common 
several of my friends have had owners from the west suddenly 
drop by and are really frightened now said liselotte nikolenko 
an east berlin retiree 
theyre worried that either their rents will be hiked so high 
they cant pay or theyll be forced out because the owner decides 
to do something else with his property ms nikolenko said 
deputy mayor reinhild zagrodnik said hundreds of calls daily 
are coming in from worried renters 
there have been incidents of owners just appearing on the 
doorstep and there were ill put it very politely 
discussions she said 
spiegel in the feb 12 article entitled fear of rent 
sharks said a west german homeowner had armed himself with a 
special spray to fend off his east german tenants ferocious dog 
fear of rent increases is well founded held down by the 
government to immediate postwar levels rents are inexpensive even 
by east german standards an east german employee rarely spends 
even 10 percent of his monthly income on rent 
the west german government has paid 32 billion in compensation 
to people and companies who have lost property in east germany a 
spokesman of the federal compensation office in bad homburg said 
those payments however have not covered all claims 
any people who later recover property have to pay back 
compensation the office said

the pentagon should delay buying the b2 
bomber until it is certain the aircraft can pass critical flight 
tests says an investigative agency that forecasts the program will 
cost more than its estimated 70 billion 
in its first unclassified report on the radarevading aircraft 
the general accounting office said defense secretary dick cheney is 
reviewing a revised cost estimate for the program due to changes in 
the inflation rate and a recent strike at the boeing co a major 
subcontractor 
we estimate that the changes will add another several billion 
dollars to the b2s estimated cost said frank c conahan 
assistant comptroller general and a member of the gao the 
investigative arm of congress 
questioned after the house armed services committee hearing 
about the increase conahan said that due to inflation the revised 
fiveyear plan for defense spending beginning in fiscal 1992 shows 
a jump of 51 billion for all defense programs 
conahan said he did not know how much of the 51 billion was for 
the stealth bomber 
the air force was forced to raise the cost of buying 132 b2 
bombers due to a redesign of the plane to enable it to fly at low 
altitudes extensions in the production schedule and underestimates 
of material costs 
in 1981 the service said the planes would cost 327 billion 
but by june 1989 the cost had risen to 70 billion 
the gao official also told the committee the cost of the 
electronic navigation and communications systems for the b2 had 
increased from 19 billion in 1986 to 57 billion in 1989 
the gao recommended cheney and the planes contractor northrop 
corp analyze the cost of a production delay and provide congress 
with the study of alternative plans for acquiring the plane 
the batwinged stealth bomber is considered the most expensive 
in history at 530 million apiece 
we believe that it would be prudent to reduce the pace of 
funding and production for the b2 to limit upfront investment 
until the critical performance elements of the aircraft are 
adequately evaluated conahan said 
the gao official said he did not have any estimates on what a 
production delay would cost but several members of the panel said 
northrop corp has determined a oneyear slowdown would cost 42 
billion 
rep norman dicks dwash a guest of the committee lashed out 
at conahans assessment for failing to include the cost to the 
american taxpayer of a production delay 
why dont you go back and do the job right said dicks 
whose district includes the boeing co 
we have responded to what we were asked to do conahan 
answered 
dicks said congress already scaled back the program in fiscal 
1990 when it reduced the bush administrations request for three 
bombers to two and trimmed about 400 million from the program 
the administration in its 292 billion defense budget for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 has requested 55 billion for five 
b2 stealth bombers 
under the current plan critical performance tests on the 
aircraft wont be done for at least three years 
it has been during this critical performance testing that 
significant performance problems have been discovered in other 
advanced weapon system programs conahan said 
the buying schedule during that testing period raised concerns 
among the committee members 
we would have bought 31 aircraft and spent 48 billion and we 
wont know whether its performing said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the armed services committee 
this flyway robbery is being done of the taxpayers money 
48 billion before we have any idea whether the b2 aircraft is 
going to work said rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of 
the panel said on the house floor

investors flocking to take part in tremendous 
investment opportunities in eastern europe are driving up longterm 
interest rates around the world federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan says 
however the central bank chairman said the trend probably wont 
continue 
greenspan presenting the central banks semiannual report to 
congress on thursday said money is flowing to nations emerging 
from 40 years of communist rule because the potential for growth 
is extraordinary 
the resulting competition is driving up interest rates in the 
united states and other countries longterm rates started heading 
up in early january with the 30year us treasury bond hitting a 
ninemonth high of 866 percent on tuesday 
this is an extraordinary change in the nature of world savings 
and investment and i dont think it has any exact historical 
precedent he said its the most important financial issue of 
the decade 
but greenspan told the senate banking committee rates probably 
would not continue rising unless some currently unknown need for 
investment is revealed 
there is a very general knowledge of the size of the potential 
investment and i would suspect that most of the information about 
this is already in the markets hence unless something 
fundamentally new occurs im not that concerned that interest 
rates would just continue up he said 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the committee 
said that by relying on foreigners to help finance trade and 
federal budget deficits the united states is in danger of losing 
control over domestic interest rates and of its economy in general 
i must tell you i think we are boxing ourselves in he said 
riegle said research by his staff shows foreigners last fall held 
about 20 percent of outstanding us government debt up from 15 
percent five years earlier

senate minority leader bob dole says hell 
keep pressing his reluctant colleagues for a floor vote on a 
resolution to designate a day commemorating an armenian genocide 
dole rkan failed to cut off debate on the controversial 
measure thursday as the senate refused by a 4949 vote to break a 
filibuster sixty votes are needed to invoke cloture 
sen robert byrd dwva led a filibuster for three days 
arguing the resolution could irreparably damage us relations with 
turkey a member of nato 
senate approval of this resolution would offend a trusted and 
loyal ally an ally that protects natos southern flank an ally 
that provides access to a variety of important military 
facilities byrd said 
another cloture vote is scheduled next tuesday if he fails to 
break the filibuster and bring the measure to the senate floor 
dole has said hell try to find other ways to force a vote on the 
resolution 
the house might be able to tackle a companion bill or perhaps 
creative minds can concoct an amendment to some upcoming bill he 
said 
addressing senators who may want to skirt a vote on the 
resolution by keeping it off the floor dole said i hate to 
burst any bubbles but to paraphrase a comment a champion boxer 
once made about his opponent you can run but you cant hide 
democrats and republicans showed little party loyalty on the 
procedural vote 
the bush administration opposes the resolution although it is 
favored by dole and several gop senators such as pete wilson of 
california and arlen specter of pennsylvania 
members of byrds party also went against him including senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine and claiborne pell of 
rhode island chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
the resolution would designate april 24 as a national day of 
remembrance of the armenian genocide of 19151923 
a massacre of 15 million armenians allegedly occurred in the 
ottoman empire before the establishment of the republic of turkey 
but the turks contend at most 600000 armenians died some of 
disease famine or attacks by marauding bands during world war i 
although dole said he is willing to compromise on language in 
the resolution the turks are furious about the word genocide 
he said he wont sacrifice principles 
the bush administration meantime issued a statement saying it 
opposed the senate resolution because it lacks balance 
officials said president bush would veto it if it passed both the 
senate and the house a companion measure is in a house committee 
the administration said it supports commemorating the victims 
of that tragic period such a commemorative resolution must be 
balanced however in recognition of the differing views of how the 
terrible events of 19151923 should be characterized 
turkish officials call the resolution a national insult 
objected strenuously to the word genocide and threatened to 
retaliate if the measure passes 
in ankara premier yildirim akbulut did not specify what turkey 
would do but added the united states will lose its respected 
position in the eyes of the turkish people

only four states hawaii mississippi south 
dakota and vermont have enough unemployment insurance in reserve 
to maintain jobless benefits for 18 months in a severe recession 
congressional auditors say 
and only 22 state programs could survive a year without raising 
unemployment compensation taxes curtailing eligibility or 
borrowing heavily from the federal government as they did in the 
last downturn in 198182 
three states illinois michigan and ohio with the highest 
concentration of the manufacturing workers who would be most 
subject to layoffs in a recession have reserves of six months or 
less a house subcommittee was told thursday 
nonetheless the bush administration and the national governors 
association told the panel they oppose a bill by house tax writers 
to raise the federal unemployment insurance taxable wage base from 
7000 to 10000 by 1993 
we see no programmatic justification for such an increase 
deputy assistant labor secretary carolyn golding told the house 
ways and means committees subcommittee on human resources 
she testified that as of dec 1 overall state accounts had 
reserves totalling nearly 38 billion compared with just 86 
billion a decade ago 
employers must now pay 434 in combined state and federal taxes 
a year on the first 7000 of each covered workers wages about 
56 goes to the federal government and the states get the rest 
thirtysix states have adopted bases above the 7000 level 
ranging from 7100 in connecticut to 20900 in alaska subject 
to state taxes the federal base was last raised in 1983 when it 
was 6000 
subcommittee chairman thomas downey dny and other tax 
writers want to raise the base to 10000 over the next three years 
to avert a repeat of the eligibility cutbacks by many states at the 
depth of the last recession 
by 1983 the system had run up a 21 billion debt it was paid 
off last year with the exception of michigan which still owed 800 
million as of last june after the reagan administration began 
charging states interest on their borrowings 
although the state and federal unemployment trust funds now have 
combined reserves of 45 billion the general accounting office 
said that would last only 11 months in a recession similar to the 
16month downturn in 198182 
the reserves still appear to be inadequate to handle a severe 
recession assistant comptroller general lawrence thompson told 
the subcommittee 
using a model developed by the labor department congressional 
auditors projected 13 state funds becoming insolvent to the tune of 
89 billion if a similar recession begins next year 
the governors expressed anger at having to close unemployment 
offices and spend more to run the program because of a 124 million 
shortfall in fiscal year 1990 from budget cuts and more claims as a 
result of greater joblessness than they had anticipated 
but they said through a representative at the hearing ohio 
employment services administrator ellen obrien states should get 
a larger share of the existing taxes rather than have to raise 
taxes 
employers who finance this system through the federal 
unemployment tax act are investing enough money to provide adequate 
service she said no new taxes are necessary to return the 
program to its proper funding level

the senate appears set to confirm conservative 
civil rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge 
but his progress still is being plagued by doubts about his record 
in the reagan administration 
mr thomas has the ability to serve with distinction on the 
court of appeals sen edward m kennedy dmass said thursday 
as the senate judiciary committee voted 121 in favor of the 
nomination 
opponents said it seemed certain that the full senate would 
confirm thomas who as head of the equal employment opportunity 
commission over the last eight years was one of the reagan 
administrations most visible blacks 
the solitary vote against thomas on the committee came from sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio who said the nominees remarks at his 
confirmation hearing two weeks ago left him flabbergasted 
but efforts by civil rights forces to block thomas lost momentum 
when benjamin hooks head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people announced that he would not stand in 
the nominees way 
the chief complaint has been that thousands of age 
discrimination cases expired without government action in recent 
years 
thomas said that state fair employment commissions were to blame 
he came in for renewed criticism late thursday however as sen 
david pryor dark inserted a statement in the congressional 
record complaining that several thousand age discrimination 
claimants during chairman thomas watch lost their rights largely 
due to eeoc neglect and mismanagement 
pryor echoed civil rights groups in saying that thomas fell 
short in estimating at his confirmation hearing that the number of 
lapsed cases was around 900 
pryor chairman of the senate aging committee said many answers 
that thomas gave at the hearing appeared to be shaky attempts at 
revisionist history pryor said he had not yet decided how to 
vote on confirmation 
congressional liberals did not hide their concern over 
speculation that within a few years thomas could be ripe for 
advancement to the supreme court i have some concerns about this 
man in terms of whether i could support him for the supreme 
court said sen herb kohl dwis 
judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
standards for a supreme court justice are different from those for 
the appeals bench 
the senate is considering thomas for the vacancy left by the 
resignation of robert bork from the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia bork resigned after the senate rejected him 
for the supreme court in the most embittered confirmation fight in 
decades 
thomas who climbed from an impoverished childhood in rural 
georgia to graduation from yale law school is an outspoken critic 
of racial hiring quotas and affirmative action programs civil 
rights forces have long been cool to him because of these views 
the alliance for justice a liberal courtwatcher group that was 
among the severest critics of the nomination issued a statement 
thursday saying it was clear that senators hold grave doubts 
about the nominees qualifications 
the organization said his performance on the bench will be 
watched carefully to determine whether he is truly committed to the 
rule of law 
metzenbaum a leading congressional liberal told the committee 
he had initially expected to vote to confirm thomas but changed his 
mind at the confirmation hearing when thomas blamed state fair 
employment agencies for problems involving numerous age 
discrimination cases in these cases the statute of limitations 
for action expired before the complaints were processed 
i was flabbergasted that he did not know that the state 
agencies are under contract to process state age discrimination 
claims metzenbaum said he said the federal commission is 
responsible for enforcing the contract and regulating the actions 
of the state agencies

injury resulting from the problem hurd said

the bush administrations proposal to modify a 
proposed civil rights bill for disabled americans would deny them 
the protection given blacks other minorities and women critics 
say 
we are incredulous that the administration would be willing to 
treat persons with disabilities differently from other victims of 
intentional discrimination civil rights advocate ralph g neas 
said thursday after hearing of the administrations proposal to 
alter the americans with disabilities act 
the premise of this law is parity with other civil rights 
law said arlene b mayerson a law professor and directing 
attorney of the disability rights education and defense fund a 
group that has worked on the bill 
in testimony thursday before a house committee the acting us 
attorney general for civil rights reiterated the administrations 
support of the proposed law but james p turner said its provision 
governing remedies for job discrimination should be rewritten 
a new impediment to the quick passage of the ada has arisen 
and the administration seeks to resolve affirmatively this 
difficulty turner told the house small business committee i 
speak of course of the remedies provisions of the recently 
introduced civil rights act of 1990 
turner said the administration opposes that proposal which 
seeks to strengthen the landmark 1964 civil rights law which 
forbids discrimination because of race or creed the new proposal 
would allow lawsuits for compensatory and punitive damages in cases 
of intentional job discrimination 
turner said that to avoid delays in passing the disabilities 
law its reliance on that section of the civil rights act should be 
deleted instead the disabilities bill should outline specific 
remedies for violations including court injunctions reinstatement 
and back pay he said 
the proposed law would guarantee the rights of disabled people 
to employment goods and services the senate version 
overwhelmingly passed in september was a compromise with the white 
house 
turner suggested the new civil rights bill could upset that 
compromise 
inclusion of such extraordinary relief as punitive damages is 
simply unwarranted in a statutory scheme as new bold and complex 
as the provision of disabilities rights concepts to the american 
business community turner said 
neas executive director of the leadership conference on civil 
rights countered we cannot understand why the bush 
administration would oppose monetary damages for victims of 
intentional discrimination 
the conference is an umbrella group for 185 civil rights 
organizations and is actively supporting both bills 
neas said he believed the house will pass the disabilities act 
in the spring and will pass the civil rights act in the summer

a former cia agent who worked in oliver 
norths arms supply network to the contras is accused in an 
indictment of failing to report some of his income from the 
operation 
thomas g clines a business partner of irancontra figures 
richard secord and albert hakim was accused thursday of 
underreporting his earnings to the internal revenue service and of 
falsely stating that he had no foreign financial accounts 
clines reported receipts of 265000 for tax year 1985 and 
402513 for 1986 according to the federal grand jury indictment 
returned in baltimore md 
during the period in question hakim set aside more than 
972000 in commissions for clines in an offshore entity codenamed 
c tea according to a congressional report on the irancontra 
affair issued in 1987 
two counts of the indictment accuse him of underreporting his 
gross receipts each count carries a maximum penalty of three years 
imprisonment and 100000 in fines on conviction 
the other two counts accuse clines of failing to report his 
foreign accounts with maximum penalties on conviction for each 
charge of 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines 
clines and his lawyer regard the decision to bring the case as 
an illadvised step taken by overzealous prosecutors said 
his attorney paula junghans clines intends to defend himself to 
the fullest she added 
sources familiar with the matter say clines filed an amended tax 
return for 1985 in the fall of 1987 nearly a year after the 
irancontra affair came into public view reporting additional 
expenses and additional income 
clines takes the position that he has reported all his income 
from the contra transactions say sources familiar with clines 
situation 
clines collected the money in connection with his work for the 
enterprise the complex of foreign corporations and swiss 
accounts which hakim and secord used to move money in the 
irancontra affair 
hakim is a key witness in the investigation of clines according 
to sources familiar with the investigation hakim was placed on two 
years probation and fined 5000 on feb 1 for his role in the 
irancontra affair 
at the request of his friend secord clines helped procure arms 
for the contra rebels starting in 1985 in addition to locating a 
european arms dealer as a source of weapons clines helped arrange 
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the 
rebels 
clines worked for the cia for 30 years he was an agent in 
southeast asia was involved in the bay of pigs invasion in cuba 
and became director of training in the directorate of operations 
also known as the clandestine services 
he also was a close associate of edwin wilson the former cia 
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally 
selling guns and explosives to libya 
clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned 
company to inflating bills submitted to the defense department for 
shipping us military equipment to egypt he was fined the maximum 
10000 and paid the government 100000 on behalf of his firm

the senate ethics committee plans to begin 
triallike hearings on substantial credible evidence that sen 
dave durenberger rminn broke senate rules and federal law 
most of the allegations stem from a book promotion arrangement 
that the minnesota republican used to raise 100000 in possible 
violation of senate honoraria limits 
durenberger called on the committee to reach a conclusion with 
all possible speed and said it was never my intent to 
circumvent senate rules for my own benefit an aide characterized 
most of the alleged violations as bookkeeping mistakes 
committee chairman howell heflin dala said the vote thursday 
to proceed from the committees grand jury phase to the trial stage 
was unanimous 
during the trial stage the committee will decide whether to 
recommend disciplinary action to the full senate the possible 
punishments ranges from a reprimand to expulsion 
the sixmember committee said durenberger may have 
violated outside income limits by being paid for speeches in 
1985 and 1986 durenberger made numerous appearances which he 
characterized as book promotion speeches for his publisher piranha 
press inc of minneapolis 
failed to report on his financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 
1986 reimbursement for trips he made in connection with the book 
publishing deal 
violated a rule by converting a campaign contribution to 
personal use and violated federal election law by failing to 
report and deposit the contribution which he transferred to his 
publisher the check of 5000 was made out to durenberger for 
us senate 
violated federal law and a senate rules committee regulation 
prohibiting the commercial use of senate space the committee said 
he was paid an honorarium or other fee for six appearances in 
senatecontrolled areas 
failed to disclose that he accepted limousine service in the 
boston area during 1985 and 1986 in connection with personal 
travel to concord mass where he visited a marriage counselor 
the committee said it was continuing its investigation into 
senate reimbursement that durenberger received for stays in a 
minneapolis condominium he partly owned 
the committees hearings which could be open to the public 
probably will not start before midmarch said new hampshire sen 
warren rudman the panels ranking republican 
the panel has not investigated recently published reports that 
durenberger received preferential treatment on 13 million in 
unsecured loans from a st paul bank rudman said 
nothings closed rudman said at a news conference 
the committee said it failed to find substantial credible 
evidence that durenberger violated rules in obtaining speaking 
engagements in boston he combined the trips with visits to the 
marriage counselor 
the committee said there was an absence of evidence that 
durenberger used senate staff in connection with his book deal 
durenberger appeared before the committee feb 8 at his request 
and later told reporters the cloud of questions that has been 
hanging over my head has finally started to clear 
he said in a statement thursday i made every effort to seek 
opinion from the appropriate bodies and from legal counsel and i 
believed that i had fully disclosed all income received under my 
financial arrangements 
durenberger spokeswoman carrie collins said the ethics committee 
had narrowed the focus of its investigation she characterized 
all the allegations except the possible outside income rule 
breaking as alleged bookkeeping violations 
the senators travel reimbursements for his book promotion 
appearances were added to his disclosure statements last july only 
after the ethics committee began its investigation the committee 
was concerned that he didnt disclose them in a timely manner 
ms collins said 
she said the 5000 check to durenbergers campaign committee 
was supposed to be made out to the publisher that was a 
mistake ms collins said 
groups that sponsored durenberger appearances in the boston area 
provided the limousine service to the concord mass office of the 
senators marriage counselor the spokeswoman said he regarded 
it as a convenience and not a gift

defense secretary dick cheney confirmed for the 
first time today that the pentagon wants to cut in its forces in 
asia by withdrawing about 12000 military personnel over the next 
three years 
cheney wrapped up his twoweek visit in the pacific rim with a 
major policy address before the national press club stressing the 
proposed reductions are moderate and should not be seen as a 
first step towards withdrawal from the pacific 
cheney is scheduled to return saturday to the united states 
the united states intends to remain involved in asia said 
cheney attempting to reassure governments in the region that have 
relied on us forces to maintain peace and stability 
the defense chief spoke with the governments in japan south 
korea and the philippines about proposals for troop reductions and 
sought increased support for the 120000 american forces based in 
asia spurred by a congress that is eager to trim defense spending 
the new message has been stark there will be fewer troops and 
less money to pay for them 
amid the lessening of superpower tensions in europe cheney has 
been pressed by congress to slash his defense budget and reassess 
the reasons for keeping us troops in the region 
in a questionandanswer session cheney declined to cite a 
specific figure for the proposed withdrawal but said hed been 
discussing a range of cuts with the host governments 
cheney spoke about such cuts during his trip but he never spoke 
openly of any figure 
it is on the order of 10 percent scattered about the 
region cheney explained the first phase for the withdrawal 
is approximately three years 
the secretary said there will be more talks with military 
commanders and congress before final decisions are made but he 
said he believed congress would resist pressure from some lawmakers 
for 20 percent to 30 percent cuts and maintain a major us 
presence in the pacific 
increased support for us troops has been the other key topic 
of discussions with asian leaders 
asked how much more he had requested from japanese officials 
cheney said wed like as much support as we can get the 
secretary said japan has significantly increased its funding 
for american forces in japan recently adding we think that is a 
very positive trend 
cheney met thursday with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
defense minister juro matsumoto and foreign minister taro nakayama 
in the daylong meetings cheney sought increases in the 24 
billion annual support toward the 7 billion cost of the american 
deployment in japan 
japanese officials following daylong discussions thursday with 
cheney called plans for reducing the 50000 us troops in japan 
prudent and appropriate 
and cheney hinted in his speech there might even be more changes 
in store 
we are thinking about some force adjustments cheney said in 
his speech emphasizing they would be moderate adjustments 
that would not harm the security balance in the region 
we are not talking about a first step toward withdrawal 
cheney said in the future if there are solid indications that 
regional stability will not be threatened we may in consultation 
with our allies make other adjustments that would be 
appropriate 
to emphasize americas commitment to the region the secretary 
announced the aircraft carrier uss midway now based in yokosuka 
japan and due to be retired will be replaced by the carrier uss 
independence in the summer of 1991 
the midway was commissioned in 1945 the independence 
commissioned in 1960 will leave its current home port in san 
diego calif 
cheney in a message for washington lawmakers also said it 
would be a mistake to reduce the us presence in asia just 
because of the lessening of tensions in europe 
america must look at the region on its own terms cheney 
said 
the soviet union hasnt acted to reduce tensions in asia as it 
has in europe cheney said and he called on moscow to help calm 
the regions flashpoints 
i would welcome soviet acts that would contribute genuinely to 
a reduction of tensions in the asiapacific region cheney said

eight close friends of mayor marion barry are 
under subpoena in an expanding investigation into barrys alleged 
drug use law enforcement and city government sources say 
the eight men described by one top city official as late 
night traveling companions of barrys were subpoenaed thursday 
the sources said 
the action came as barry according to his press aide left a 
florida rehabilitation center to start a second phase of his 
treatment for alcoholism 
barry who had been a patient at the hanleyhazelden center in 
west palm beach fla since jan 21 was moved to the fenwick hall 
treatment center off the coast of south carolina according to a 
statement issued by his spokeswoman lurma rackley 
a law enforcement source said the eight men would be asked 
whether they have ever used drugs with the mayor who was indicted 
last week on cocaine possession and perjury charges 
barry has repeatedly denied ever using drugs 
in addition subpoenas were served on the city government for 
records of any city contracts issued to any of those individuals 
the source said 
prosecutors want to know whether the mayor ever offered city 
contracts in exchange for drugs or whether he improperly steered 
contracts to his friends the source said 
barry is scheduled to appear in us district court on wednesday 
to enter pleas to the eightcount felony perjury and misdemeanor 
cocaine possession indictment returned against him last thursday 
the indictment stemmed from an arrest that followed a sting 
operation in which fbi agents reportedly videotaped the mayor 
smoking cocaine 
barrys attorney r kenneth mundy has said the mayor will 
plead innocent to all eight charges 
rackley said the mayor chose fenwick hall after he and his wife 
effi consulted with specialists and others familiar with the 
numerous treatment facilities in the country 
the south carolina center was chosen because it provided what 
was called an adult chemical dependency inpatient family 
treatment program according to rackleys statement

the leading presidential candidates 
top election observers and the roman catholic church endorsed 
efforts to reduce the possibility of violence in sundays elections 
all parties and alliances should let feb 25s voting take 
place without demonstrations or victory celebrations that could 
provoke violence said opposition presidential candidate violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
mrs chamorros united national opposition and president daniel 
ortegas sandinista party have accused each other of planning 
violence but their rhetoric has toned down as election day 
approaches 
ortega said he believes mrs chamorro is sincere in her wish to 
avoid violence but said he was not so certain of others in her 
14party coalition 
we need to create a climate of reconciliation and speak a 
language of peace said cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
nicaraguas roman catholic prelate if nicaragua does not put an 
end to violence violence will put an end to nicaragua 
joao baena soares the secretarygeneral of the organization of 
american states addressed a special appeal to those involved in 
military activities which would include the sandinista army and 
the usbacked contra guerrillas 
baena soares and other observers said conditions for a fair vote 
sunday exist although secretary of state james baker said in 
washington that the united states would have to make up its own 
mind about that 
baker ruled out normal ties with a sandinista nicaragua unless 
it maintains the democratic opening to the opposition and refrains 
for a sustained period from supporting leftist rebels in el 
salvador 
ortega has struck conciliatory notes toward both the opposition 
and the united states as he sniffs victory especially after a 
massive wednesday night rally by 300000 people onetenth of the 
nations population 
after the election i will propose a political truce so that we 
can concentrate all our forces and resources on lifting the 
economy ortega said at a news conference 
when asked about bakers comments ortega said i expect mr 
baker will be disposed to discuss the fundamental problems between 
us we have to do away with political rhetoric and work for peace 
nicaraguas 175 million voters will elect a president vice 
president a 90member assembly 144 town and city councils and two 
regional councils on sunday 
the main faceoff is between mrs chamorro and ortega who is 
seeking reelection to a sixyear term 
eight other candidates are running for president but only erick 
ramirezs social christians are considered significant ramirezs 
party expects the 14party uno coalition to founder whether it wins 
or loses and hopes to end up as the second largest single party in 
nicaragua 
with campaigning legally halted as of wednesday night 
candidates and official observers made a round of appearances for 
the benefit of the international media 
former us attorney general elliot richardson representing the 
united nations made a trip to the northern countryside and said 
the elections are a step towards reconciliation and unity for all 
nicaraguans who need peace 
other observers were already spreading out across the country in 
anticipation of sundays voting violence was considered most 
likely to occur in small towns and rural areas where local feuds 
combine with politics in a volatile brew 
ortega drew the largest crowd more than 300 reporters and at 
least another 100 photographers and television crew members 
actor ed asner singer jackson browne and bianca jagger exwife 
of rock star mick jagger were among the celebrities at various 
functions drawing considerable attention from press and 
politicians

biologists say polar bears seem to be 
making their dens more often on the coastal plain of the arctic 
national wildlife refuge where oil companies want to start 
exploration drilling 
caribou have been the primary wildlife concern in the debate 
thus far with environmentalists arguing that the coastal plain is 
a key calving area 
the discovery of the bears use of the land gives opponents to 
drilling more ammunition in the debate environmentalists said 
the interior department has recommended opening the refuge to 
drilling it has called the area the most promising unexplored 
prospect for a major oil find in the country 
congressional action on the refuge has been stymied since the 
exxon valdez ran aground march 24 in prince william sound spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
but the push to open the refuge is expected to resume as early 
as late this year and the bush administration is counting on 26 
billion in oil revenues from the refuge by 1993 
the continuing research shows that the 15millionacre coastal 
plain is the most suitable terrain in the region for pregnant polar 
bears to make their dens 
because bears that den on land are much more likely to produce 
surviving cubs the research suggests that disturbance of denning 
patterns in the refuge could result in population declines for the 
species 
this is more evidence of the tremendous biological values that 
would be compromised by oil development on the coastal plain 
said allen smith alaska director of the wilderness society we 
are on the threshold of seeing impacts that go well beyond what the 
oil industry is saying 
mark fraker senior environmental scientist for british 
petroleum said the research does point to the importance of the 
refuge for polar bears but fraker said good planning should 
protect them from harm 
by knowing about areas used for denning it should be possible 
to place facilities where they avoid dens fraker said 
the polar bear research was conducted by steven amstrup polar 
bear project leader for the us fish and wildlife service who 
stressed that his findings are tentative 
amstrup was the first wildlife biologist to successfully outfit 
polar bears with radio collars for satellite tracking his research 
findings are a result of that trackin 
he said most pregnant bears choose to den on pack ice where 
harsher weather conditions and ice breakups lessen the chances of 
cub survival 
the greatest concentration of recent land dens has been on 
the wildlife refuge he said if oil and gas development in anwr 
and around barrier islands of alaskas north coast caused polar 
bears to avoid current land denning areas annual production of 
cubs would be compromised 
previous research has identified about 2000 beaufort sea polar 
bears of that number about 450 are sexually active females 
females get pregnant about every three years meaning that in 
any given year about 150 females will dig dens as many as 15 
percent of those will show up on the refuge amstrup said 
amstrups research also raises questions about whether 
disturbing the polar bears would be acceptable under an 
international treaty that the united states signed in 1976 
the international agreement for the conservation of polar bears 
binds the country to protecting females and their young and polar 
bear ecosystems 
fraker said that treaty is a consideration but it doesnt 
mean you cant do anything he said

a torah that survived the holocaust was 
among six sacred scrolls stolen this month from synagogues in new 
jersey and pennsylvania and authorities said they suspect a ring 
that targets religious artificats 
john h kundts a fbi spokesman said thursday that 
investigators believe the thefts this month may be related all 
occurred in or around philadelphia 
investigators also are looking into a possible connection 
between the stolen torahs and silver pieces with hebrew writing 
that turned up at a pawn shop in runnemede nj 
it wasnt known if the silver pieces had been removed from any 
of the synagogues in question 
police and religious leaders said they doubt the thefts are the 
result of antisemitism or vandalism 
there is no indication of defamation or desecration theyre 
not painting swastikas or damaging property kundts said this 
is a specific criminal act to steal a specific religious object 
the torah is a sacred scroll handwritten on parchment that 
contains many of the basic teachings of judaism a torah inside its 
special holder can fetch up to 35000 religious leaders said 
two torahs were taken feb 10 from congregation mkor shalom in 
mount laurel nj said rabbi fred neulander one of the scrolls 
was known as the milevsko torah and was recovered after world war 
ii in prague czechoslovakia 
the congregation feels violated individually and 
collectively neulander said their reactions are very similar 
to reactions of death 
neulander said it would cost between 15000 and 40000 each to 
replace the torahs he said he was doubtful they would be recovered 
because the only means of distinction is the handwriting 
these are the most sacred possessions we have neulander 
said to lose one is devastating 
several jewish institutions including a school community 
center and a synagogue were burglarized in cherry hill nj 
between feb 1 and feb 3 said police sgt richard tomlinson a 
torah was taken from the synagogue 
last saturday two torahs were discovered missing from a 
synagogue in northeast philadelphia and another torah was reported 
missing feb 5 in the suburb of cheltenham 
there was no sign of a breakin in either case said 
philadelphia police capt jim nocco 
obviously it was someone who had free access to come and go 
without suspicion nocco said

mongolians renounced the legacy of 
dictator josef stalin toppling his last statue in the capital and 
opening an exhibit displaying a torture chamber model and other 
horrors of the purges he inspired 
cheers broke out thursday when the 51foot granite statue was 
lifted from its pedestal onto a truck and carted away some people 
applauded its removal some even kicked it 
the whole people wanted this said hortsbar 36 an 
electrician who passed the statue every day on his way to work 
it had stood in front of the national library in the city center 
since 1951 workers said they did not know where the statue was 
taken or what would happen to it 
last month the ruling mongolian peoples revolutionary party 
bowed to public pressure and removed a smaller statue of stalin 
from in front of an army club 
it was one of its few concessions to a new vocal opposition 
movement that has staged repeated rallies for democratic reform 
the movement organized itself this week as the mongolian democratic 
party 
the larger statues removal under cover of darkness may have 
been to avoid confrontations in this nation where officials say 
more than 38000 people were purged or killed during a 
stalininspired era of terror in the 1930s and 1940s 
at the revolutionary museum just across the citys central 
square from the library the nations first exhibit about that era 
opened wednesday it was organized jointly by the museum and the 
ministry of state security 
titled history will not forget them the exhibit contains 
pictures of purge victims and documents from the oncesecret 
ministry archives its aim is to tell the truth of history 
museum officials said thursday 
stalin came under criticism in the soviet union more than 30 
years ago but until 1984 mongolia remained in the grip of stalin 
protege yumjaagiyn tsedenbal who now lives in moscow 
the purges began under tsedenbals predecessor horloogiyn 
choybalsan when a northern minority group on the sovietmongolian 
border was accused of spying for the japanese 
one chart in the exhibit said 19895 people were executed from 
1937 to 1939 alone most were ordinary workers and herdsmen but 
buddhist monks called lamas were key targets and even some 
highranking officials were accused of being enemies of the 
revolution 
the exhibit included a mock torture room with a 4foothigh 
stool that prisoners were forced to sit on the room was said to be 
soundproof 
the exhibit dedicated one section to attacks on religion 
showing scorched and scarred buddhist scriptures it said all of 
mongolias 761 monasteries were destroyed during the purges only 
three or four have been reopened 
although they had no figures museum officials said attendance 
was high at noon thursday about 75 people were slowly moving 
through the small room studying each display 
its the wish of the people to get the truth about what really 
happened during stalins time said oilzibaatar a historian at 
the state security ministry who was a consultant for the exhibit 
outside in temperatures of about 4 degrees below zero 
fahrenheit small crowds watched as workers with hammers and drills 
dismantled stalins pedestal 
from childhood i believed that stalin was a good man who 
did many great things said lchawgsuren a 45yearold member of 
the ruling party because of the new policy of restructuring it 
enabled us to see also the shadows of this man and his policies

since taking over the commercial end of the ariane 
space program 10 years ago arianespace has rejected starry visions 
like the 1960s moon race for the downtoearth goal of making money 
the 31 successful ariane launches five rockets have exploded 
including thursdays 44l launcher have brought the company more 
than 25 billion in contracts to put 43 satellites in orbit 
thirtytwo more satellites are on the schedule for future 
launches worth 236 billion 
the program got off to a rough start dec 24 1979 when the 
european space agencys first ariane rocket exploded after liftoff 
at the launch site in french guiana 
but luck changed after arianespace took over commercialization 
of the program from the european space agency in 1980 just as 
private satellites became a vital link in communications 
despite three rocket explosions through 1986 arianespace 
successfully focused on turning itself into a cheaper alternative 
than its main competitor the us space shuttle 
the challenger disaster in 1986 left ariane with an enviable 
monopoly on the satellite launch business exploiting americas 
failure to develop unmanned launchers during the shuttle years 
though the shuttle returned to the skies in 1988 ariane retains 
a commanding grip on commercial launch services holding more than 
50 percent of all satellites in the lucrative market 
flexibility is part of the success the series 4 rocket can be 
configured eight different ways to boost varying payloads into 
orbit in a more costeffective mode than the manned shuttle 
the larger series 5 due to hit the launch pad in the mid1990s 
will enable arianespace to put up larger and bigger satellites the 
rockets are built by 100 companies in 11 countries 
the european space agency which started the ariane program in 
1973 still maintains dreams of a building a sovietstyle european 
space station and an americanstyle hermes space shuttle 
prohibitive costs have kept such projects on the ground while 
the ariane rockets have grown into unglamourous but profitable 
stars 
whether that remains so may depend on how fast arianespace can 
identify and correct what caused thursdays explosion

foreign minister farouk alsharaa has 
told the sister of one of the american hostages in lebanon that he 
will visit iran soon to push for a hostage release 
in a meeting late thursday sharaa said syria has already told 
irans leaders that it is their interest to work with us in 
gaining the release of the hostages 
he told peggy say sister of hostage terry anderson that he 
would work intensely with the top iranian leaders on the 
hostage issue 
i hope we will be able to arrive at good results he said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the 18 western hostages in lebanon 
he was abducted march 16 1985 
mrs say of cadiz ky and an associated press delegation was 
in damascus as part of trip to discuss with world leaders her 
campaign to free her brother 
the meeting came the same day as an editorial in the english 
language tehran times in iran said the hostages in lebanon should 
be released without conditions the paper is close to iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani 
the hostages fate is believed linked to a power struggle within 
the iranian government the times is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani who has offered to help free the hostages before but 
has been criticized for such moves by hardline government factions 
sharaa called the editorial a good sign and mrs say added 
she found the newspapers viewpoint encouraging 
syria has good ties with iran it was the only major arab 
country to back iran in its eightyear war with iraq which is 
ruled by a rival wing of the arab baath socialist party 
sharaa told her that a hostage release will be difficult until 
the clashes between various lebanese factions ends 
syria is the major power broker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in the country under a 1976 arab league provision to end the 
christianmoslem civil war 
sharaa said the hostagetakers must be isolated then they 
would rush to give up the hostages he said the kidnappers feel 
comfortable in the blackout of security in lebanon 
he said the united states was not using its influence 
sufficiently to bring peace to lebanon or to encourage iran to 
press the kidnapping groups to release their captives he did not 
give specifics of what action the united states should take 
mrs say thanked sharaa for syrias efforts and said hundreds of 
thousands of americans are praying for syria and its role as a 
mediator 
in its editorial the tehran times said the struggle against 
western influence in the middle east was legitimate and should 
continue but that all forces in lebanon should work to free 
hostages of whatever nationality 
it said the release should be on islamic and humanitarian 
grounds adding maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of 
all the hostages

a surgical procedure that corrects 
nearsightedness gives an unacceptable variety of outcomes although 
twothirds of people who undergo it eventually are able to see 
without glasses doctors say 
the procedure called radial keratotomy changes the curve of 
the cornea which acts as a lens for the eye surgeons make tiny 
incisions in the cornea resembling the pattern of spokes in a wheel 
in a painless outpatient procedure 
for four years researchers tracked 390 patients who underwent 
the surgery on one eye between march 1982 and october 1983 visual 
sharpness was improved to better than 2040 in 76 percent of the 
eyes the researchers reported 
most patients 69 percent had visual sharpness of 20200 or 
worse before the operation and no one had sharpness better than 
2040 the researchers reported in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
but eleven patients who had 2020 vision or better with 
corrective lenses before the surgery suffered a significant loss of 
visual sharpness after the procedure even with glasses or contact 
lenses they reported 
however everybody all except one became less nearsighted 
without corrective lenses so the operation obviously works 
said dr george o waring iii national director of the study 
the one patient whose acuity did not improve stayed the same 
waring said in a telephone interview thursday 
infections developed in two patients who were successfully 
treated with antibiotics without losing visual acuity said john 
carter coordinator of the study based at emory university in 
atlanta 
our study and others have demonstrated fairly well that there 
are some adverse outcomes but they are relatively rare said 
carter also in a telephone interview 
the surgery costing about 2000 per eye was introduced in the 
united states in 1976 it is most widely practiced in the soviet 
union 
most patients also saw lines around lights at night because of 
light bouncing off the scars in the cornea but it didnt bother 
them said waring it was like dirty glasses or contact lenses 
he said 
one year after the surgery 48 percent of the patients said they 
were very satisfied with it 42 percent were moderately 
satisfied and 10 percent were dissatisfied the researchers said 
among the 323 patients who had both eyes operated on 64 percent 
said they wore no visual correction four years after the surgery 
the researchers said 
however the unpredictability of the outcomes remains 
unacceptable 14 years after the procedure was introduced 
despite improvements in surgery techniques the researchers said 
i think its safe to say that the predictablity is better now 
than it was but theres still a range of outcomes carter said 
dr perry s binder of the university of california at san 
diego cautioned that radial keratotomy is not intended for all 
myopic patients just because they wish to see without spectacles or 
contacts 
surgeons who dont specialize in the procedure are leery of it 
because the tissue being operated on is healthy binder said in an 
editorial in fridays journal 
an estimated 80 million people in the united states are 
nearsighted

guerrilla base before dawn near this southern port city in the 
fourth israeli attack on bases in lebanon in eight days 
witnesses said the planes drew heavy fire from the guerrillas 
while they fired rockets at the base and released balloons to 
detract groundtoair missiles 
there was no immediate word on casualties 
in jerusalem the israeli army said the jets returned to base 
safely 
it said the base was used by a terrorist organization to launch 
attacks on israel it did not identify the group 
a police spokesman said the raid targeted a base manned by 
guerrillas of george habashs popular front for the liberation of 
palestine in hills east of sidon 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said at least three israeli jet fighters carried out the 
fiveminute attack 
the jets fired six airtosurface missiles against the base he 
said 
at dawn around three hours after the air attack smoke still 
billowed from the stricken target a twostory building used by 
palestinian guerrillas for about four years 
witnesses in sidon 20 miles from beirut said the jets roared 
low over the city shaking them out of bed 
we rushed to basements and air raid shelters assuming the city 
was under attack fatima hableh said 
her husband hassan hableh said he watched the planes releasing 
scarlet balloons to deflect heatseeking antiaircraft missiles 
the raiding jets hableh said also released parachute flares 
that illuminated the area 
guerrilla defenders fired at the planes from antiaircraft guns 
i could see tracer antiaircraft rounds in the sky exploding 
around the planes into small puffs of white smoke but none of the 
planes was hit he said 
police said the attack came less than 10 hours after a raid that 
targeted proiranian moslem guerrillas in the nearby village of 
libaa wounding three fighters fridays attack was israels 
seventh air raid this year

inflation is running at 70 
percent rios crime is so bad pizza companies have suspended 
deliveries because their drivers are getting mugged the whole 
country in fact seems headed for catastrophe 
but many of brazils 150 million residents wouldnt dream of 
letting all that spoil carnival billed as the worlds largest 
party 
from the steamy amazon jungle to the southern pampas they are 
donning sequined and feathered costumes in preparation for the 
prelenten revelry which begins saturday and runs through ash 
wednesday 
i work all year long until my body aches the worlds so full 
of misery and suffering but carnival lets me let it all hang 
out said leila de souza 32 she works at odd jobs makes 20 a 
week and plans to parade with one of rios famous samba schools 
clubs from largely black slums 
carnival in rio features grand balls at exclusive clubs and a 
costume parade that costs millions to produce in the northeast 
large outdoor dances are led by bands playing on the back of trucks 
for the rich there are balls that attract from 6000 to 10000 
people each 
rios monte libano club is charging 10000 for a reserved box 
for 12 at its night in baghdad ball the club hired 120 
security guards to protect drunken partygoers from themselves and 
each other it expects guests to swill down more than 2000 gallons 
of beer and 1000 bottles of whiskey 
other popular dances are the grande gala g for homosexuals 
and the girl from ipanema ball known for its glorification of 
the female posterior 
the soul of carnival here is the same as it is in other places 
a cry for liberty we just have a slightly different way of 
expressing ourselves said jose geraldo machado a director of 
rios municipal tourism board 
machado said the special nature of brazils carnival derived 
from the populations diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds 
the samba rythmn descends from our african roots the melodic 
line comes from europe and the visual beauty from the indians 
he said 
the undeniable highlight of rios carnival the samba school 
parade is held in two 15hour marathon sessions on sunday and 
monday nights 
sixteen schools take part each with 5000 dancers and 
percussionists who perform original samba music with floats and 
costumes based on the musical theme 
the schools which compete for a top prize based on points 
awarded for lyrics dancing rhythm floats and other categories 
march down a sixblock outdoor paradeway known as the 
sambadrome 
female paraders usually wear little more than rhinestone bikinis 
and feather headresses but some dancers spend as much as 15000 
on their attire 
as always there are complaints that carnival is in danger of 
becoming a commercialized brazil follies not a popular 
celebration but a show for tourists 
the poor are the greatest samba performers but they are 
increasingly shut out the cost of a costume is so high they cant 
afford to take part said rio city councilman sergio cabral 
but many disagree sambas in my blood ill be out there 
dancing every year until i drop said jose menezes ferreira 50 
who has paraded with the villa isabel samba school for 40 years 
machado said that depite a bad year for tourism in rio the 
13200 parade tickets reserved for overseas visitors ranging in 
price from 116 to 170 were sold out

the fbi is investigating claims that city police 
mishandled their probe into the murder of carol stuart by 
intimidating and coercing witnesses into implicating an early 
suspect 
police commissioner francis m roache promised the his 
departments cooperation with the investigation according to a 
statement thursday from fbi agent thomas hughes 
mayor raymond flynn said he welcomed the probe and vowed to take 
disciplinary action if any police officers were charged with 
wrongdoing 
police named william bennett as a suspect after the pregnant 
mrs stuart was shot oct 23 and her husband charles stuart was 
seriously wounded in the citys mission hill neighborhood 
stuarts statement to police that a black gunman shot him and 
his wife touched off a massive manhunt that many black residents 
said violated their civil rights 
bennett was cleared of suspicion after stuart apparently 
committed suicide jan 4 after learning that his brother had 
implicated him in the crime 
the fbi investigation stems from statements by several people 
who claim police coerced them into implicating bennett 
derek jackson 17 has claimed that police threatened him with 
20 years in prison if he did not tell them under oath about an 
alleged confession made by bennett he claims also to have been 
threatened with a beating 
jackson said he recanted his story when he voluntarily appeared 
before the grand jury investigation into the stuart case in 
november 
three other teenagers that police said were present when 
bennett made his alleged confession also have said they were forced 
into making false statements 
mary smith 43 has claimed that police offered to release her 
son from juvenile custody and relocate her family if she cooperated 
in the stuart investigation 
ms smith told police she had seen bennett on the night of the 
shooting with what appeared to be a gun but noted that his 
clothing was not similar to the description originally offered by 
stuart 
she said the police threatened to put her daughter in juvenile 
detention if she did not amend her statement to make it match 
stuarts description

three children who initially tested 
positive for gonorrhea apparently do not have the disease which 
means speculation about the owner of the daycare center they 
attended should stop the mans attorney said 
j david bogenschutz who is defending john shaver against 
charges of child pornography said thursday that subsequent 
negative tests on the children brings the accuracy of the previous 
examination into question 
now the case has gone from something with the stigma of 
gonorrhea and possible child molesting to the fact the state has 
some pictures they dont like he said and maybe its time to 
take a look at how the testing is being done before someone really 
dangerous does fall through the cracks 
police have not charged shaver 56 with molesting children he 
was arrested jan 28 and charged with five counts of possessing 
child pornography for magazines police say they found in his home 
police also seized hundreds of nude photos of children 
shaver was tested for gonorrhea this month and proved negative 
after police said the children who attended his nowclosed rainbow 
learning center had positive throat cultures for the disease 
police spokesman ott cefkin said health officials have told 
police that false negatives are not uncommon on gonorrhea tests 
we were told that the health department was 100 percent sure 
when they found the gonorrhea that they were certain that that was 
what it was cefkin said they said it was virtually impossible 
to have a false positive 
and now you have a negative it could be a false negative 
he said 
prosecutors were considering having a third test done on the 
children bogenschutz said 
police capt bruce smith said thursday that even if john shaver 
had tested positive for the disease police wouldnt have charged 
him with child molestation because the three children have not 
incriminated shaver 
shaver was hospitalized briefly following a suicide attempt 
before being arrested again on charges of using photos of children 
to make pornographic montages he later posted bond and was 
released from jail

prince norodom sihanouk today 
ended 11 years of exile and returned to the land he once ruled 
greeted by cambodians who waved flags and chanted long live his 
royal highness 
all cambodians want to live in cambodia and die in cambodia 
the guerrilla leader told about 100 reporters bused in for the 
homecoming i am 68 years old and i feel more and more i could 
die on foreign soil even if it is friendly foreign soil like china 
or north korea 
since fleeing after vietnamese invasion in december 1978 
sihanouk has lived in palaces and luxury hotels in china north 
korea thailand france and other countries that back his guerrilla 
movement 
starting today the prince was to take up residence in a 
oneroom house without running water or central heating said his 
spokesman ek sereywath 
the prince smiled and waved as his car crossed from thailand to 
parched scrubland about 300 feet inside the western border province 
of oddar meanchey where his guerrillas have made significant 
inroads in recent months about 100 civilians greeted him as did 
dozens of rifletoting guerrillas 
sihanouk said he would live in the liberated zone until the 
entire country was liberated from the vietnamesebacked government 
officials said the prince is to live with his wife monique and 
two aides cooks will be on hand and food and supplies will be 
brought in from thailand 
ek said the prince will divide his time between two newly 
liberated villages that have been renamed sereipheap or freedom 
and ekareach or independence 
officials said sereipheap was about 12 miles from the thai 
frontier but did not give a location for ekareach reporters were 
not allowed go to see either village 
they have artillery not far from my house so i have to keep 
the location secret the prince explained 
sihanouk said he would not command his army from his new home 
but instead concentrate on helping civilians in the liberated zone 
with food medicine and clothing 
sihanouk ascended the throne in 1941 and led cambodia to 
independence from the french in 1953 his rule ended in a 1970 
military coup after he resisted us attempts to draw cambodia into 
the indochina war 
he spent 197578 under house arrest as the communist khmer rouge 
group embarked on a radical agrarian revolution in which hundreds 
of thousands of people died of famine and in slave labor camps and 
execution chambers 
since 1982 sihanouk has led the guerrilla coalition that also 
includes the khmer rouge and the khmer peoples national liberation 
front he resigned as coalition president recently citing charges 
that he was an accomplice of the khmer rouge 
sihanouks return home came after peace talks in bangkok 
wednesday with hun sen prime minister of the vietnameseinstalled 
government their joint communique vaguely agreed on the need for a 
un presence in the country and formation of a supreme national 
body but there apparantly were no breakthroughs 
sihanouk said he repeated his demand for dismantling of the 
phnom penh government and installing an interim authority 
comprising personnel from the united nations and from the 
association of southeast asian nations but he said the khmer rouge 
opposed a un administration 
the guerrillas the hun sen government vietnam france and 
southeast asian countries are to meet in cambodian peace talks 
starting monday in jakarta indonesia

a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by a 
smokers widow despite a state supreme court ruling that she had 
the right to sue rj reynolds co for failing to warn her late 
husband of smoking risks 
ann forster claimed that her husband john forster of golden 
valley who died of lung cancer in 1985 at age 46 had relied on 
representations by reynolds that cigarette smoking was not 
hazardous he had smoked camel cigarettes for more than 30 years 
in the ruling filed earlier this month hennepin county district 
judge jonathan lebedoff said forster could not show that her 
husband had relied on the slogan id walk a mile for a camel 
as an indication that smoking was not harmful 
forster claimed that the cumulative effect of 30 years of 
advertising promotion and public relations was to convince 
consumers that there were no health dangers associated with smoking 
also dismissed was her claim for breach of express warranty on 
the product lebedoff ruled that because john forster was expected 
to know about the hazards of smoking he could not have relied on 
any promise to the contrary 
forster claimed that rj reynolds had a duty to warn about the 
hazards of smoking before 1966 when the federal cigarette labeling 
and advertising act requiring such warnings went into effect 
lebedoff said the company was not obliged to warn consumers of 
health risks before 1966 
the minnesota supreme court ruled a year ago that the labeling 
law made cigarette companies immune from lawsuits claiming that 
customers were not warned but said that it did not relieve them of 
the duty to tell the truth in their advertising 
lebedoff said he was reluctant to dispose of the case as he did 
and was not insensitive to the effect it will have on the forster 
family

the general secretary of the south african council 
of churches today said prime minister margaret thatcher has moved 
too soon to lift sanctions against south africa 
the key issue is the dismantling of apartheid and when we have 
reached the stage where the dismantling of apartheid is 
irreversible we will blow the whistle the rev frank chikane 
said as he arrived at heathrow airport 
we are saying that no one has the right to blow the whistle 
particularly the prime minister of this country 
britain split with its partners in the european community 
earlier this week and announced it would lift a ban on new 
investment in south africa 
mrs thatcher has argued that it is important to make a gesture 
of support for south african president fw de klerk following his 
decision to release black nationalist leader nelson mandela from 
prison 
we have asked for sanctions we have understood that anything 
we do to remove apartheid is costly and we are prepared to face 
that chikane said 
our concern is that mrs thatchers position has been that of 
consent for the leadership of the apartheid system rather than the 
peoples organizations 
it is clear she is operating at a level of the interests of 
business rather than the interests of the victims of apartheid 
chikane plans to go to parliament on tuesday for an 
antiapartheid protest

the united nations has developed a 
drugfighting plan that calls for global cooperation in targeting 
smuggling moneylaundering and illicit crops 
the battle plan shaped during a fourday special session on 
drugs and expected to be approved today is another blow against 
those trying to peddle drugs around the world said melvin 
levitsky assistant us secretary of state for narcotics matters 
the plan urges countries plagued by trafficking to establish 
joint border checkpoints it also encourages national drug 
enforcement agencies to work with interpol the international law 
enforcement organization to help investigate druglinked 
activities and train personnel in countries facing mounting 
narcotics problems and related crimes 
the document however stresses that the antidrug efforts must 
not violate the international rights of any countries 
it is very important to create an international code against 
drugs so that those who either take drugs or sell drugs are 
considered pariahs in the international community levitsky said 
a senior us administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said some of the measures were not as strong as american 
negotiators had hoped they would be 
he said the us government wanted more precise language 
outlining the obligations of all countries in the areas of law 
enforcement and economic aid for nations battling powerful drug 
traffickers 
but its a document we can support the official said 
the plan stresses the need to prevent the international banking 
system and other financial institutions from being used for 
laundering profits from the illicit drug trade 
it also calls for prompt eradication and substitution of crops 
that produce raw material for illicit narcotics such as coca 
plants used in making cocaine and opium poppy plants that yield 
heroin 
measures to expand opportunities for trade and investment for 
countries where illegal drug production has led to severe economic 
problems should be high priorities the document said 
the plan also calls for steps to prevent covert transfers of 
arms and explosives to drug traffickers and urged strict measures 
to prevent private aircraft and ships from engaging in illicit 
trade

panicbuying by east germans is emptying 
store shelves of flour sugar and meat but the government promised 
emergency measures to keep up basic food supplies and called in the 
army to help with food deliveries 
in east berlin communist mayor erhard krack resigned today 
assuming political responsibility for a rigged election in may he 
was the latest communist official to quit under pressure in recent 
weeks 
others have defected to the leftwing social democratic party 
widely expected to be the dominant political force in east germany 
after elections march 18 the party on thursday opened its first 
national convention in leipzig 
communist premier hans modrow and other east german leaders have 
called for an end to the hoarding and panicshopping that have hit 
the nations already poorly stocked stores 
we are in an extraordinary situation in which emergency 
measures have become necessary commerce minister manfred flegel 
told a news conference thursday in east berlin 
he said the government has ordered steppedup slaughtering of 
animals for more meat and more shifts in food production he said 
it was considering extra imports 
officials may have to dip into the national emergency food 
reserves the government keeps on hand in case of a major crisis 
flegel said but he declined to elaborate 
the government will maintain a stable food supply under all 
circumstances flegel said the army has already had to provide 
vehicles to help with food deliveries 
flegel said the governmentrun food stores were reporting 
three to four times their normal revenue as consumers rush to 
buy flour sugar meat butter and jam 
tens of thousands of east germans also have bought food in 
neighboring west germany and west berlin 
a cut in subsidies for food production has helped to trigger the 
run on food east germans also are concerned about the expected 
adoption of the west german mark as a first step toward a unified 
germany and the rate at which they will be able to exchange their 
savings 
in leipzig social democratic chief ibrahim boehme told more 
than 500 party delegates that the social democrats are asking 
people to stay in this country and to work together in building up 
a democracy 
boehme was referring to the continuing daily drain of about 
2000 east germans to the west despite moves toward reform and 
german unification since the hardline communist government of 
erich honecker was ousted in october 
east germanys social democrats will make former bonn chancellor 
willy brandt an honorary chairman during the convention the 
leftist west german social democrats under brandts guidance have 
been providing support to their east german sister party 
west german politicians have been become increasingly active in 
the east german election campaign leading to protests from the 
communists 
modrows caretaker government called for slashing the armed 
forces of the unified germany by twothirds of present combined 
forces and called for some us and soviet troops to remain during 
the unification process 
east germanys defense minister adm theodor hoffmann said a 
joint german military should be reduced to about 300000 members 
initially and later to 150000200000 
west germany belongs to nato and east germany is in the 
sovietled warsaw pact about 380000 soviet soldiers are stationed 
in east germany and nato has more than 300000 in west germany 
including about 250000 americans 
in munich the sueddeutsche zeitung daily newspaper said modrow 
had decided against being the embattled communists top candidate 
in next months national elections however a party spokesman said 
no final decision had been made 
in bonn a west german government spokesman said only the 
government of a united germany could give poland a guarantee of its 
borders west german television reported 
the zdf television report quoted government spokesman dieter 
vogel as saying the formula for achieving german unification had 
been set by the victorious world war ii allies in ottawa last week 
under the plan the allies and the two germanys would take part 
in unification talks 
but he said this would include consultations with polands 
government according to the tv report 
poland invaded by a unified germany in world war ii has 
demanded west germany guarantee that the existing borders of the 
germanys would not change under unification 
some west german conservatives believe that germany maintains a 
claim on polish territory that belonged to germany before the war

the dollar was higher against other major 
currencies in moderately active trading in europe late this 
morning but traders said the us currency was expected to remain 
in a narrow range 
gold prices fell 
the main feature of the foreign exchange market was that the 
bank of japan moved twice to support the yen in europe through the 
sale of dollars selling the dollar at 147 yen market sources said 
traders said it appeared the bank of japan was trying to force 
the dollar to hold at or move below 147 yen and might intervene 
directly or through other central banks throughout the day 
the yen support in europe follows dollar sales by the bank of 
japan in tokyo earlier in the day dealers said 
reports that japans ministry of finance has come out against a 
further rise in the countrys discount rate against the judgment of 
the bank of japan had led to dollar buying by investors throughout 
the asian day 
in tokyo the dollar was up strongly against the japanese yen 
closing at 14647 yen up 124 yen from thursdays close later in 
london the dollar was quoted at 14705 yen 
in europe the dollar benefited from a sudden weakness in the 
west german mark traders said 
but traders said the dollar ran into strong resistance as 
profittaking set in 
traders said the dollar was viewed as weak from a fundamental 
point of view 
the us economy seems to be entering into a situation of 
stagflation and thats not good one milan trader said 
the mark has lost some of its attraction because of indications 
that the german monetary unification might not be as smooth as 
believed earlier 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late thursday 
16764 west german marks up from 16695 
14747 swiss francs up from 14725

18915 dutch guilders up from 18845 
123885 italian lire up from 123425 
12010 canadian dollars up from 11945 
in london the dollar traded at 17081 compared with 17145 
late thursday 
gold opened at 41450 in london and by midmorning londons 
major gold dealers fixed a recommend price of 415 a troy ounce 
down from 41745 bid late thursday

gov bob martinez called for a criminal 
investigation of a rap group because of its hotselling album with 
sexually explicit lyrics 
martinez asked peter antonacci floridas statewide prosecutor 
to conduct an investigation into whether floridas racketeer 
influenced corrupt organizations act and obscenity laws have been 
violated by the widespread distribution of records by the 2 live 
crew and other rap groups 
a fort myers judge ruled two weeks ago that there was probable 
cause to find that as nasty as they wanna be was obscene and 
ordered the album which has sold more than 1 million copies 
pulled from the shelves in lee county 
shortly after martinez released his letter thursday a jury 
acquitted an alexander city ala record store owner of obscenity 
charges for selling a sexually explicit tape of move somethin 
by 2 live crew 
the circuit court jury took less than 1 hours to decide in 
favor of tommy hammond who earlier was found guilty in municipal 
court in what the american civil liberties union called the 
nations first obscenity conviction for music hammond had appealed 
that conviction and was granted a trial in the higher court 
in martinez letter he said he was appalled that music a judge 
has already determined may be obscene was easily available to 
florida children he said he was horrified by reports that 
seventhgraders can recite some of the lyrics 
some of the fourmember bands lyrics include descriptions of 
gang rapes sex acts and sadomasochism 
a spokeswoman for skyywalker records the miami record company 
that produced the album referred inquiries to the companys 
lawyer who was unavailable for comment thursday 
martinez said he did not think the state should try to censor 
the kind of legitimate public expression protected by the first 
amendment he claimed that 2 live crews album doesnt meet that 
standard 
under state law the penalty for distributing an obscene record 
or tape is a maximum fiveyear sentence and a 1000 fine 
the state racketeer influenced corrupt organizations statute 
which includes obscenity violations carries a maximum prison term 
of 30 years 
since the sale of the recording apparently has numbered in the 
tens of thousands the pattern of racketeering activity is arguably 
present martinez wrote antonacci 
but charlene carres a tallahassee attorney for the aclu said 
works with literary artistic political or scientific value were 
not covered by the obscenity statute 
from washington people for the american way issued a scathing 
statement noting martinez failed attempt last year to pass an 
antiabortion statute 
first governor martinez tried to rob women of their 
reproductive rights said elliot mincberg legal director of the 
organization now hes advocating censorship and taking aim at 
the first amendment one wonders what fundamental right is next on 
his hit parade

law professors at the university of 
notre dame voted to end the schools payment of their american bar 
association dues to protest the associations vote to condemn 
curtailment of abortion rights 
the school traditionally has paid the 1900 aba dues for each 
of the 30 law faculty members but they voted monday to end the 
perquisite and leave each law professor the decision to maintain 
membership at their own expense 
were not saying they should have taken the opposite 
position said law dean david t link of a bar association vote 
opposing government intervention in a womans decision to end a 
pregnancy 
they just shouldnt be in this when you think of the division 
that still exists among members of the bar association and in the 
courts he said thursday 
no other law school or legal organization has taken a similar 
step said nancy slonim a spokeswoman at the abas chicago 
headquarters the texas state bar has scheduled a vote to decide 
whether to withdraw from the abas policymaking house of delegates 
over the abortion issue 
the delegates meeting feb 13 in los angeles voted by a 21 
margin to oppose legislation or other government action that 
interferes with the confidential relationship between a pregnant 
woman and a physician or with the decision to terminate the 
pregnancy 
supporters of the resolution were reacting to the supreme 
courts webster decision in 1989 affirming missouri efforts to 
restrict access to abortion 
link said the faculty stand should not be interpreted as 
opposition to womens rights like any other constitutional 
question its not a matter of whether rights exist but how do you 
balance competing rights he said 
about 80 percent of the law faculty at the catholic school are 
members of the roman catholic church link said but the faculty 
vote represented a professional not a religious objection he 
said 
link did not disclose totals of the vote 
the aba ought to take positions in things unifying to the aba 
rather than divisive because it interferes with the rights of some 
minority members link said 
the aba has received about 80 resignations from among 365000 
members nationwide since approving the abortion policy ms slonim 
said the association has taken stands on controversial unresolved 
issues including opposition to discrimination against homosexuals 
and opposition to the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally 
disturbed she said 
link said he may resign his personal membership if the aba 
resolution is allowed to stand 
notre dame enrolls 510 students in its 121yearold law school 
the nations oldest catholic law school

gov george deukmejian unsuccessfully tried 
to persuade local officials to abandon their newest legal 
challenges to the states aerial pesticide spraying program to 
eradicate the medfly 
the republican governor met in pasadena on thursday with 
pasadena and glendale city officials but the discussion yielded no 
agreements on the states pesticide spraying program or on a new 
pasadena ordinance prohibiting lowlevel nighttime helicopter 
formation flights 
deukmejian said spraying of the pesticide malathion will 
continue despite local leaders growing opposition and their 
concerns the pesticide could cause health risks 
i know in my own heart that what we are doing is not harmful 
to the people not only in my heart but in my mind based on the 
evidence he said 
after the meeting pasadena and glendale city leaders said they 
will continue to oppose spraying because of health concerns 
there continues to be a very honest difference of opinion 
said glendale councilman carl raggio we went into the meeting 
with that and came out of the meeting with the same feelings 
a joint lawsuit by the cities of los angeles burbank and 
glendale was filed against the state in superior court thursday 
seeking an immediate halt to helicopter missions raining malathion 
on southern california communities 
the orange county cities of garden grove huntington beach and 
westminster recently failed in a similar suit heard by a sacramento 
county superior court judge 
the suit filed thursday alleges the missions violate residents 
civil rights because they have a right to be free of health risks 
from toxic chemicals 
helicopters took to the skies overnight to spray a 
30squaremile area of the verdugo hills in burbank and glendale as 
part of the states 30 million medfly eradication campaign which 
covers over 400 square miles of los angeles and orange counties 
pasadena city attorney victor kaleta was awaiting a police 
report that could enable him to file criminal misdemeanor 
complaints against helicopter pilots who sprayed malathion over the 
city early thursday 
agriculture officials maintain malathion is safe and its use 
necessary to prevent the medfly from causing up to 200 million in 
annual losses to the states agricultural industry 
the medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits 
vegetables and nuts grown in california the crops are destroyed 
when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat their way out

the state senate passed a bill giving 
california one of the earliest presidential primaries in the 
nation but political leaders said the real fight over the bill was 
still to come 
the bill approved in the senate on thursday would jolt the 
nations candidateselection process 
it had been bottled up in the senate since september and was 
approved only after its supporters promised to send it to a 
democratdominated twohouse conference committee for more 
negotiations 
but democrat and republican leaders expressed doubt that the 
committee could draft a bipartisan compromise the bill appears to 
need to become law 
its not looking very good right now said senate republican 
leader ken maddy 
in june the assembly approved a version of the bill that would 
schedule californias primary election on the first tuesday in 
march during presidential election years with the change beginning 
in 1992 
that would place the primary of the nations most populous 
state now one of the last to be held on the heels of the iowa 
caucuses and the new hampshire primary according to the latest 
state finance department figures california has about 291 million 
people 
california has not played a key role in a presidential primary 
since 1972 when george mcgoverns victory propelled him to the 
democratic nomination supporters of the bill say a june primary 
usually gives california voters little voice in selecting 
presidential nominees 
in nonpresidential years the primary would remain on its 
current date the first tuesday after the first monday in june 
the vote thursday in the democratcontrolled senate was 2411 
six republicans joined 17 democrats and an independent in 
supporting the bill seven republicans and four democrats voted no 
the bill has hit a series of snags since it was introduced 
senate republicans fear the reapportionment of their legislative 
districts following the 1990 census may not be completed by march 
1992 they do not want to run for reelection in 1992 in the 
current districts which were drawn up by democrats 
one solution would be to hold two primaries one in march for 
presidential candidates and another later in the year probably 
june or september for state and congressional candidates 
but senate leader david roberti a democrat is strongly opposed 
to the idea of two primaries saying three statewide elections in a 
year a general election and two primaries would boost costs and 
reduce voter turnout 
i am opposed i am very opposed he said adding that a 
twoprimary bill would face rough sledding in the senate 
whatever the conference committee produces would need final 
approval from both houses to go to republican gov george 
deukmejian who has said he favors the idea of two primaries

an opposition lawmaker said 
today the government should investigate a magistrates decision to 
impose only a small fine on a white farmer convicted of beating a 
black worker who died the next day 
the farmer wilhelm rabe was fined the equivalent of 40 on 
feb 12 for assaulting ekati xaba last year on a farm near the 
eastern border with swaziland 
magistrate jd jacquire accepted evidence that rabe had beaten 
xaba with an electric cord but rejected testimony that the worker 
also was thrown to the ground and kicked 
jacquire said there was no proof that the beating caused the 
brain haemmorrhage and ruptured spleen that were blamed for xabas 
death the day after the beating 
lester fuchs a parliament member for the antiapartheid 
democratic party said the sentence was excessively lenient and 
could cause negative publicity for south africa at a time when the 
government is promoting racial reconciliation he asked that 
justice minister kobie coetsee account for the magistrates ruling 
according to the sowetan the countrys largest blackoriented 
daily newspaper two people who witnessed the beating had given 
statements to police but were never called to testify in court 
the sowetan said xabas widow and six children were forced to 
leave the farm after his death and now live in a oneroom cardboard 
shack 
there have been at least two other similar cases in the past 
three years in which white farmers avoided prison despite being 
convicted of fatal assaults of black employees 
several blacks convicted of murdering white farmers are on death 
row facing hanging if the government lifts a recently declared 
moratorium on executions

the communist party today repeated an appeal for 
soviets to avoid chaos during nationwide rallies planned this 
weekend indicating a growing concern the protests might lead to 
renewed unrest 
the partys policymaking central committee urged the soviet 
working people to rebuff all who push people to chaos provoke 
conflicts ethnic strife and enmity and create instability in 
society 
the appeal was issued thursday and repeated on radio and tv 
today 
rallies are planned sunday a week before the balloting in some 
republics and grew out of the success of a feb 4 protest when 
tens of thousands paraded through moscow demanding the communist 
party give up its grip on power 
the rallies and demonstrations will be the first major public 
gatherings since the central committee voted to renounce its 
monopoly on power feb 7 paving the way for establishment of a 
multiparty democracy 
many of the rallies are being organized by popular front 
movements striving for greater pluralism since they sprang up in 
the last two years 
on tuesday the soviet legislature issued a decree calling on 
local authorities to crack down on illegal protests sunday and to 
strictly control those demonstrations that are permitted 
organizers of sundays rally in moscow have received permission 
to gather and the official news agency tass quoted vladimir 
kamchatov of the electors association as saying that up to 300000 
people could turn out 
demonstrations are planned in a number of provincial cities in 
the sweeping russian republic which stretches from finland to the 
sea of japan and come shortly before elections to the local 
legislatures in russia on march 4 elections are scheduled in the 
ukraine and byelorussia on that day as well 
groups in the uzbekistan capital of tashkent have been denied 
permission to hold an outdoor rally although an indoor meeting 
will be allowed leningrad activists were denied a request to stage 
a march and instead will hold a rally at a sports complex 
mikhail tkachev leader of the byelorussian popular front said 
his movement will demand registration of candidates that local 
authorities have refused to place on the ballot at the meeting in 
the capital of minsk 
at the rally he said demonstrators will express our distrust 
in the republics political leadership and press for their 
resignation and the banishing of party organizations from 
enterprises colleges army and law enforcement organs 
demonstrations are planned throughout the ukraine which last 
summer was rocked by strikes and where regional party leaders have 
been resigning with growing regularity under public pressure 
all independent political groups have been invited to take part 
in a rally in the ukrainian capital of kiev while the regional 
strike committee formed last summer is leading the rally in donetsk 
in azerbaijan where a state of emergency imposed jan 20 
following a bloody week of ethnic unrest is still in effect yusis 
samed oglu of the popular front said no rallies were planned out of 
fear that soldiers would use force against the crowd 
the three baltic republics where the drive for independence is 
strong and the achievements in gaining autonomy have been greatest 
of all 15 republics are so far taking a lowkey approach to the day 
of demonstrations 
rallies are not scheduled in lithuania which is holding 
elections saturday or in neighboring latvia which is gearing up 
for elections to the republican legislature on march 18 
however activists in the third and smallest baltic republic of 
estonia said a gathering was being organized for sunday

hundreds of demonstrators clashed with 
police outside the vienna state opera as socialites waltzed inside 
and authorities said today that at least 69 people were injured 
the 1300 demonstrators were demanding that funds raised to 
finance the annual opera ball be spent for social programs to help 
the poor and homeless 
the violence outside the opera peaked as president kurt waldheim 
and his wife arrived to attend the event thursday night but the 
nearly 3000 police officers on hand ushered them and other 
dignitaries safely inside 
although two leftist groups received permits for the protest 
police said they were not responsible for the violence police 
president guenter boegl said the clashes were triggered by 
rightwing radicals who joined the protest 
a police communique today said at least 69 people were injured 
in clashes around the opera including 60 policemen and nine 
demonstrators ten other demonstrators were taken into custody it 
said 
the demonstrators were protesting the display of wealth and 
pageantry at the ball some posters said gobble up the rich 
police used shields to ward off stones and bottles as they 
charged the crowd with clubs and dogs witnesses and reporters 
said scuffles also broke out between demonstrators and groups of 
rightwingers police reported 
reporters watching the scene said police action at times 
appeared uncoordinated and haphazard with some officers rounding 
up inactive demonstrators and others driving into the crowd on 
motorcycles 
some of the chaos may have resulted from police radio contact 
being briefly disrupted by pirate transmitters deriding or abusing 
police officials 
radical demonstrators smashed shopwindows and damaged cars in 
streets near the opera a police statement said 
cordons of police ringed the opera blocking access to the 
building 
in demonstrations last year about 40 people were reported 
injured 
inside the opera an unsmiling princess caroline of monaco was 
almost crushed by more pushing and shoving by scores of news 
photographers trying to get the best shot one stepped on her gown 
caroline ascended to her box trying to ignore the 
photographers she later refused an interview for austrian state 
television sitting stolidly in a box 
about 7000 people attended the opera ball the price of a 
ticket was 183 the most expensive box cost more than 12000

a record medical malpractice award is 
causing some west virginia obstetricians to turn away new patients 
and consider leaving the state where their ranks already have been 
halved in five years 
some will probably leave if they get a chance i would 
leave dr ujjal sandhu said thursday i dont want to worry 
about losing my shirt the patients will have to go out of state 
just like the doctors are leaving 
a county jury in charleston last week awarded a couple 1525 
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a 
caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their newborn it was 
the states highest malpractice award against an obstetrician 
mark and julie robinson of cabin creek about 15 miles east of 
charleston said dr kanoj k biswas a charleston obstetrician 
should have performed the caesarean section on july 31 1987 after 
their son who weighed more than 10 pounds became stuck in the 
birth canal 
instead the couple said biswas used forceps to remove the baby 
causing fetal asphyxia and a brain hemorrhage the doctors lawyer 
had argued that the child had an abnormal heart and the his 
treatment during birth was not the cause of his medical problems 
were working scared sandhu said malpractice awards are 
skyrocketing there should be some reasonable compensation to 
victims but they shouldnt be made millionaires overnight 
sandhu and at least seven other charleston obstetricians have 
decided not to take new patients he said some are leaving to 
practice in neighboring states with lower insurance costs and 
limits on medical malpractice awards 
the decline in obstetricians has worsened in the state in recent 
years said dr bruce berry chairman of west virginias section of 
the american college of obstetrics and gynecology 
berry said the state now has 65 registered obstetricians down 
from 135 five years ago twentyone family practioners also deliver 
babies but the state hasnt been able to recruit new physicians 
berry said 
there were 23045 babies born in west virginia last year 
according to state figures 
west virginia has been troubled by problems keeping physicians 
of all kinds last year the state had 152 doctors per 100000 
residents 37th among the states according to the american medical 
association some counties have no doctors at all 
berry said he quit practicing obstetrics 14 months ago in 
charleston mainly because of the high cost of malpractice insurance 
west virginia medical association officials are trying to 
determine how other obstetricians are reacting to the malpractice 
award said executive director george rider 
dr paul fulcher of charleston who also stopped taking new 
pregnant patients because of the recent case said such malpractice 
awards leave him virtually uninsured 
fulcher said most obstetricians carry a minimum 1 million 
malpractice insurance the maximum coverage is 10 million berry 
said 
west virginia physicians pay about 63000 in liability 
insurance annually sometimes twice as much as doctors in virginia 
and kentucky rider said he said he is uncertain why malpractice 
insurance costs more in west virginia 
high insurance costs are making it harder for pregnant women to 
find a physician fulcher said 
the main thing is we want to ensure the availability of health 
care and provide our expertise without our personal and family 
assets being on the line fulcher said i want to continue 
practicing in this state but i wont make my family liable 
berry said the average delivery costs 1200 to 1500 patients 
would have to pay 500 more to cover liability insurance if an 
obstetrician took out a 10 million policy he said 
the medical association has been unsuccessful in attempts to cap 
malpractice awards other states caps have been declared 
unconstitutional officials said 
instead fulcher said some obstetricians have proposed a 
reserve fund to cover large malpractice awards but he said another 
15 million award would wipe out the fund 
del bobby hatfield of kanawha chairwoman of the house health 
and human resources committee said the state will consider 
legislation establishing excess insurance funds to help physicians 
obstetricians said they need help soon 
i love my job and delivering babies but i want better 
protection sandhu said they may just quit delivering babies 
in this state

busy los angeles harbor was closed to ship 
traffic while authorities pondered how to remove a leaking canister 
of propane gas from a cargo ship today without sparking an 
explosion or fire 
the harbor was closed to incoming and outgoing vessels about 
1130 pm thursday after officials discovered propane leaking from 
a canister in the cargo hold of the evergroup said coast guard 
spokeswoman elizabeth fleming 
no evacuations from nearby ships and no injuries were reported 
crew members who left the ship when the leak was discovered 
reboarded the vessel at berth 229 to shut down all the ships 
systems anything that might cause a spark ms fleming said 
the gas is not poisonous but it is flammable said coast 
guard petty officer robert beals theyre thinking about flooding 
it with carbon dioxide in the moring to prevent a fire or 
explosion in the port 
coast guard and city fire officials planned to huddle this 
morning to determine the safest way to remove the canister said 
fire capt craig fletcher 
fire officials first began receiving reports about a strange 
smell in the harbor late wednesday but were not able to discover 
its source until late thursday fletcher said 
it was really hard to find because the winds kept changing 
he said 
fire officials initially dispatched a fire boat six engine 
companies and hazardous materials team to the scene said fletcher 
firefighters were released overnight but are expected to be 
sent back when the canister is removed from the ship he said 
the harbor located about 25 miles south of downtown is the 
nations second busiest port

the us navy today told vessels to steer 
at least four miles clear of a burning kuwaiti tanker while an army 
of salvage boats worked around the clock to keep its volatile cargo 
from exploding again 
the usflagged surf city was loaded with naphtha and diesel 
fuel for italy on thursday when a blast ripped through it in the 
persian gulf 20 miles off the united arab emirates coast the ship 
was still billowing smoke today 
its american captain and first mate were killed but the 23 
other sailors all americans but one were rescued by us 
warships four were hospitalized but their conditions were not 
known 
officials ruled out sabotage or a floating mine as the cause and 
said a short circuit may have sparked the blast aboard the ship 
which was owned by the kuwaiti oil tanker co it had been reflagged 
for us protection during the iraniraq war 
the explosion according to our reports occurred above the 
waterline said c miles sheldon head of chesapeake shipping 
inc the subsidiary used by the kuwait oil tanker co to operate 
its americanowned tankers 
the huge blaze that burned through the night on the ship was 
contained but the ships condition was uncertain sheldon told a 
news conference in dubai in the united arab emirates 
he said the surf city was listing three degrees as a result of 
the loss of cargo the lost cargo was only naphtha which burns 
easily and evaporates causing minimal pollution he said 
us navy officials told ships in the area to stay at least four 
miles away from the ship which was being monitored by the uss 
simpson a missile frigate 
the accommodation quarters are still smoldering and the heat 
could blow up the cargo which would be a major disaster said a 
shipping source in the southern persian gulf who spoke on 
condition on anonymity 
two salvage tugboats from the kuwaiti oil tanker co joined half 
a dozen others from the united arab emirates overnight dousing the 
tanker with foam and water to fend off a more serious explosion 
the shipping sources said 
the source said the front part of the ship was only about two 
feet above water the tugboats were trying to keep it from sinking 
because the explosion occurred halfway near the iranian island 
of abu musa it provoked speculation that it might have been caused 
by an iranian mine or other explosive the iranian revolutionary 
guards used the island as a base for ship attacks during the 
198088 iraniraq war 
capt ron wildermuth chief spokesman for the central command in 
florida which oversees the us naval forces said initial reports 
indicated the explosion was caused by an internal accident 
abdulfattah albader the chairman of the kuwait oil tanker 
co told reporters in kuwait that he ruled out sabotage 
attributing the fire to a short circuit 
the us navy identified the dead as derrick f linardich the 
38yearold captain of norfolk va and steven p mchugh the 
34yearold first mate from east bridgewater mass 
sheldon said the bodies had been recovered and would be sent 
home after formalities were completed in dubai 
the us navy has a 10unit middle east force in the gulf and 
monitors movement of usflagged ships in the gulf from a 
distance it officially ceased the regular escorts it used to 
conduct at the height of the iraniraq war mainly from iranian 
threats 
kuwait whose tankers were a primary target of the iranians 
reregistered 11 of its tankers in the united states to give them 
the right to the us navy protection a few months after the un 
ceasefire halted the 8year persian gulf war in august 1988 
kuwait deflagged six of the tankers 
surf city was one of the five still flying the us flag with 
the kuwaitis geared to discuss their deregistration this month

shell oil co said a pipeline accident this 
week spilled an estimated 672000 gallons of crude oil 16 times 
more than the company first estimated 
the new figure stunned state environmental officials 
this came as a tremendous shock will flower a spokesman 
for the illinois environmental protection agency said thursday 
we knew the 42000 gallon figure was conservative but to find 
out that it was 672000 gallons was quite a shock 
an underground pipeline connecting two crude oil storage tanks 
burst monday spewing crude oil above the ground near the tanks at 
a shell refinery across the mississippi river from st louis 
shell spokesman tony canino defended the delay in reporting the 
larger estimate saying the company wanted to be absolutely 
firm about any figures released 
we think its perfectly reasonable not to release a number 
until its firm canino said we would rather be right than 
fast 
canino also said that shell has not determined yet what caused 
the underground pipeline to rupture in this southwestern illinois 
town 
on wednesday the illinois epa called for a study of the 
refinery to discover the cause of recurring spills emissions and 
fires and come up with ways to prevent them 
in pipeline leaks alone there has been more than a million 
gallons of product loss since middecember said flower 
the cleanup of the spill was continuing flower said with 
company crews picking up all liquid crude oil on the ground 
in our last inspection the oil didnt get into a nearby 
retention pond but the rain today moved the oil toward the 
retention pond said flower 
he said shell deployed absorbent booms to collect oil in the 
pond 
state epa officials and representatives from illinois attorney 
general neil hartigans office were scheduled to discuss the spill 
with shell officials this afternoon hartigan filed a lawsuit in 
september against shell seeking 12 million in penalties for 
various environmental mishaps

nationalization of south africas mines planned to meet monday 
with the chairman of the countrys largest mining conglomerate 
gavin relly whose anglo american corp is the worlds no 1 
gold producer accepted an invitation to visit mandelas house in

mandela earlier today at his home his party represents 
antiapartheid whites in parliament also at the meeting was the 
reb allan hendrickse leader of parliaments mixedrace chamber 
mandelas african national congress has urged boycotts of 
elections for the mixedrace and asian chambers of parliament 
saying their creation was part of an effort to entrench the 
exclusion of blacks but hendrickse said after the meeting that the 
anc and the labor party which controls the mixedrace chamber 
would be able to work together 
denis worrall one of the democratic party leaders said his 
delegation and mandela agreed on the need for universal voting 
rights but differed over the ancs support for guerrilla violence 
economic sanctions and nationalization

reaffirmed his support for the ancs economic policies which call 
for nationalization of mines banks and monopoly industries 
mandela whose last trip abroad began with a clandestine border 
crossing in 1962 shortly before his imprisonment plans to fly 
tuesday to lusaka zambia there he will meet leaders of several 
african countries and confer with the ancs exiled leadership 
he then plans to spend three days in zimbabwe and six days in 
tanzania before flying to sweden on march 12 to visit anc president 
oliver tambo who is recovering from a stroke in a stockholm clinic 
relly has spoken out frequently against apartheid and his 
corporation although occasionally at odds with black unions over 
wage disputes espouses relatively liberal employment policies 
in 1985 when the government was condemning all contact with the 
anc relly was among a group of south african businessmen that 
traveled to lusaka for talks with the movements leaders another 
member of that delegation tony bloom also is scheduled to meet 
mandela on monday 
bloom formerly was chairman of the premier corp one of south 
africas biggest food companies but he left the country in 1988 to 
work in london 
mandela and the anc contend that some degree of socialism is 
needed to help reduce the enormous gap between white wealth and 
black poverty 
several business leaders have conceded that some redistribution 
of wealth is needed but say this can be done better without 
nationalization

computerized selling and interestrate jitters 
pushed stock prices into a tailspin today causing the fifthworst 
loss in history on the worlds largest exchange 
the fall comes two days after the tokyo markets thirdlargest 
decline and puts the nikkei index of 225 selected issues down 
256935 points or nearly 7 percent for the week 
the government acknowledged confusion over arbitrage trading and 
today directed the securities industry to report on their arbitrage 
activities said a finance ministry official on condition of 
anonymity 
the nikkei lost 93587 points or 261 percent in light trading 
to end the week at 3489097 it was the first time the nikkei has 
fallen below the 35000point level since oct 17 1989 
meanwhile the dollar rose against the japanese yen closing at 
14647 yen up 124 yen from thursday the yen also lost ground 
against other major currencies including the west german mark 
in hong kong stock prices reacted to the drop in tokyo with 
the hang seng index losing 3361 points to close at 289431 
stocks in london also stumbled by midday the financial 
timesstock exchange 100share index was off 306 points or 13 
percent at 22386 
the nikkei index which on wednesday lost 116119 points or 
more than 3 percent won back 9251 points on thursday but it 
quickly began sliding when trading began today 
declines in the futures market triggered a wave of program 
selling in the afternoon pushing the nikkei down to a fourmonth 
low institutional investors primarily foreign trust funds sold a 
large volume of indexrelated shares in the spot market through 
program trading analysts said 
securities and trust fund companies were hesitating to increase 
their holdings for fear of reporting losses at the upcoming end of 
the fiscal year said michio katsumata of nomura securities co 
most japanese companies close their annual accounts at the end of 
march securities companies often cash in some of their holdings at 
that time to offset earlier losses 
extremely thin volume accentuated the decline 
the market is extremely vulnerable right now to such selling 
because of the low volume of stocks being traded and small number 
of investors taking part katsumata said most major players 
remain on the sidelines 
volume in the morning session was estimated at a low 430 million 
shares about half the usual amount 
dealers said anticipation that the bank of japan would hike the 
discount contributed to the nikkeis decline higher interest rates 
tend to discourage stock investment 
officials at the central bank whose official discount rate now 
stands at 425 percent after three increases last year have said 
they are still monitoring economic conditions and have not decided 
on another increase 
rising inflation in recent months and strong growth in the 
economy and the money supply led analysts to predict a discount 
rate increase 
rumors about the possible emergence of a stock scandal 
following last years recruit scandal also discouraged many 
investors dealers said one rumor suggested a major governing 
party politician may be arrested for illegal stock dealings they 
said

former president reagans videotaped testimony 
gives little support to the defense in john m poindexters 
upcoming irancontra trial and could undermine it in several 
important ways observers say 
reagan steadfastly maintained that poindexter and other white 
house aides were not breaking the law when they advised the 
nicaraguan contras during a congressional ban on us aid to the 
rebels 
the former president said he was in total agreement with a 
letter poindexter sent to congress in july 1986 denying that the 
national security council staff was giving the rebels covert 
military assistance 
if i had written it myself i might have used a little 
profanity reagan said of the letter which prosecutors charge 
was a false statement to lawmakers by poindexter 
former irancontra prosecutor michael bromwich said it the one 
line that dramatically helps the defense during eight hours of 
testimony 
the president sees this letter and says it looks fine to 
him bromwich said i think it has a psychological effect on 
the jury 
but reagans confusion and lack of knowledge about the 
participation of poindexter and white house aide oliver l north in 
the irancontra affair is damaging said bromwich a member of the 
team of lawyers that successfully prosecuted north last year 
reagan seems to have very little idea of what was going on so 
he certainly didnt authorize or approve of what north or 
poindexter was doing based on full knowledge of the facts said 
bromwich now in private law practice in washington 
also damaging are reagans statements that he didnt authorize 
any of the actions poindexter took that prosecutors allege violated 
the law bromwich said 
on the ultimate question did you authorize did you 
approve the answer is no no no bromwich said 
at the white house today spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
have no comment on reagans testimony 
the transcript of reagans eighthour pretrial deposition 
given last week behind closed doors in los angeles was released 
thursday by us district judge harold greene 
the public was allowed to view the videotapes of reagans 
testimony in the courtroom where poindexter is scheduled to go to 
trial march 5 on charges of obstructing congressional inquiries 
into the irancontra affair 
reagan testified he never had any inkling that north was 
providing strategic advice to the contras 
the former president steadfastly maintained that no one has 
proven to me that profits from the usiran arms sales were 
diverted to buy arms for the rebels 
nor did he know that north had sought help from arms dealers 
albert hakim and richard v secord a retired air force major 
general in arming the contras both have pleaded guilty to charges 
arising from their roles in the irancontra affair 
only when prosecutor dan webb produced a copy of the report by 
the tower commission which reagan appointed to investigate the 
irancontra affair did the former president acknowledge that the 
diversion must have occurred 
this is the first time that i have ever seen a reference that 
actually specified there was a diversion reagan told webb 
asked if he expected poindexter to report the diversion to the 
president reagan said yes unless maybe he thought he was 
protecting me 
in fact poindexter told congress in 1987 that he didnt tell 
reagan about the diversion 
reagan admitted to webb that he never authorized his former 
national security adviser to obstruct congressional inquiries into 
the irancontra affair by destroying documents or making false 
statements 
this testimony takes away one of the defenses that admiral 
poindexter was asserting said rep lee hamilton dind who was 
a recipient of one of poindexters letters when he chaired the 
house intelligence committee 
that defense was that he was specifically authorized to do 
what he did hamilton said 
paul rothstein a georgetown university law professor said webb 
may have made a lot of mileage by getting reagan to say he 
didnt authorize the specific acts by poindexter that prosecutors 
say violated the law 
the defense probably will focus on the claim that reagans 
fervent support for the contras created a certain environment or 
climate in the white house that gave the signal or the impression 
to admiral poindexter that he could do what he did hamilton said 
reagans testimony may give some support here because the former 
president was so firm in his criticism of congress for tying his 
hands when he was trying to help the contras bromwich said 
there is throughout this deposition a clear suspicion of 
congress that comes out loud and clear bromwich said 
the former presidents testimony also makes clear that reagan 
viewed himself in a war with congress on contra aid bromwich 
said he made very clear to all his subordinates that he felt 
very strongly on the issue 
but webb used written answers that reagan gave to the 
irancontra grand jury in 1987 to cut his legs out from under 
him when his testimony conflicted with the prior statements 
bromwich noted 
reagan testified that he didnt know which white house official 
told him that a c123 transport plane that was shot down over 
nicaraguan on oct 5 1986 was not connected with any us 
government effort to help the contras 
but webb produced reagans written answers in which he 
specifically stated that it was poindexter who gave him those 
assurances

czechoslovak president vaclav havel dashed 
around manhattan receiving a heros welcome from writers and 
artists hobnobbing with punk rockers and meeting a legend 
paul newman 
ive been in the presence of some great artists and ive been 
in the presence of some great statesmen but ive never before been 
in the presence of a great artiststatesman newman said thursday 
at a reception for havel 
with the wit and selfdeprecation that typified the comments he 
made in broken english in his oneday whirl around the city havel 
called newman such a big legend that i didnt believe he 
physically exists now im standing here with him 
the czechoslovak parliament elected havel president a few weeks 
after a peaceful revolution in december that led to the ouster of a 
hardline communist government that regime had jailed havel for 
five years for his satirical plays and other activism 
after receiving the spirit of freedom award from the cathedral 
of st john the divine on thursday havel told an audience of 
several thousand 
im sorry i had no opportunity to write my speech because i 
was not today two hours in prison some of havels works were 
produced in the solitude of incarceration 
havels caretaker government is preparing for parliamentary 
elections in june he left for home early this morning and arrived 
in czechoslovakia later in the day the czechoslovak state news 
agency reported 
his first taste of the big apple in a generation began late 
wednesday in lower manhattans east village his boyhood 
schoolmate filmmaker milos forman took him on walks to places 
havel visited in 1968 
they dropped in on cbgbs one of the first punk rock clubs and 
rock hangout the bitter end 
people were recognizing him in the streets forman said 
their faces were lighting up 
at a concert in havels honor thursday playwright arthur miller 
said i welcome him as the worlds first avantgarde president 
among the other artists who spoke at the concert at the 
cathedral of st john the divine was actor ron silver who said 
vaclav havel has shown the world that art matters 
addressing havel he added help us overcome our cynicism and 
let us bask in the glory and joy of an artist leading us 
earlier havel received an honorary doctor of law degree from 
columbia university where forman teaches film 
columbia president michael sovern told the playwright we are 
especially pleased to award you a degree because as a young man you 
and many other promising leaders of your generation were 
deliberately prevented from earning one by the oppressive regime 
havel breakfasted with mayor david dinkins and theater producer 
joseph papp who announced his intention to produce havels play 
slum clearance 
papp had invited havel to new york in 1968 with an invitation to 
see the public theaters production of his play the memorandum 
havel told reporters thursday that as a playwright he never 
could have conceived a plot in which he would become president 
like many tourists havels agenda included the metropolitan 
museum of art where he viewed 20thcentury works 
havel also met with un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar 
the concert at the cathedral featured performances by paul 
simon james taylor roberta flack opera star placido domingo and 
the brooklyn philharmonic orchestra conducted by zubin mehta

antonin dvoraks new world symphony and mozarts don 
giovanni which premiered in prague 
a dozen actors and writers including gregory peck and saul 
bellow read from havels speeches and letters and paid tribute to 
his achievements 
forman the filmmaker summed up their sentiments by saying 
if a playwright makes us laugh or cry hes an artist but if 
a playwright succeeds to orchestrate the overthrow of a communist 
dictatorship without one bullet fired its a miracle 
on wednesday havel addressed congress in washington dc and 
said the united states could best help czechoslovakia by helping 
the soviet union stay on the road to democracy

nasa today postponed for a third 
time the flight of atlantis on a secret military mission saying 
its commander had recovered from an illness but the threat of 
storms still prevented the launch 
nasa managers ordered the delay until at least sunday blaming a 
weather front that moved into the area this morning packing rain 
and brisk winds and bringing the threat of thunderstorms the 
forecast for sunday is much better with an 80 percent chance of 
favorable conditions 
the postponement came just hours after doctors pronounced 
atlantis commander john o creighton fully recovered from a 
respiratory infection that along with the weather forced two 
earlier postponements 
nasa spokesman bruce buckingham said today that after doctors 
decided creighton was healthy enough to fly atlantis the astronaut 
and a crewmate spent part of the morning flying practice landings 
in the space shuttle training aircraft 
atlantis originally was scheduled for launch early thursday but 
creighton became ill hopes of launching this morning instead were 
dashed when physicians recommended creighton be given another 24 
hours to recover that slipped the launch to early saturday and 
then the weather forecast today put it back another 24 hours 
sources said atlantis will deploy a spy satellite during a 
fourday mission 
creightons illness described formally as an infection of the 
upper respiratory tract developed suddenly on wednesday he 
received unspecified therapy and by thursday afternoon nasa said he 
was on the mend 
because of the military secrecy of atlantis flight nasa has 
not announced a precise launch time saying only that it would come 
between midnight and 4 am the countdown is kept secret until the 
final nine minutes before the rockets ignite 
once atlantis fades from the view of launch observers progress 
of the mission will be blacked out nasa will not release the 
airtoground communications as is done with most shuttle flights 
or give reports on the astronaut activities 
the blackout will be lifted just an hour before atlantis returns 
to earth for a landing at edwards air force base in california 
creightons illness came as a surprise all five of atlantis 
crew members were found to be healthy during a routine medical 
examination on tuesday the next day the astronaut complained of a 
sore throat 
nasa doctors enforce a strict isolation for the astronauts seven 
days before a launch the system requires most people working 
within six feet of the astronauts to wear masks 
a nasa spokesman claimed on wednesday that an astronaut illness 
had never before forced a mission postponement but after a bit of 
filechecking on thursday the agency said that the apollo 9 flight 
in 1969 had been delayed three days because the crewmen developed 
upper respiratory infections 
in 1970 astronaut thomas k mattingly was taken off the crew of 
apollo 13 doctors learned he had been exposed to the measles he 
was replaced on the crew by backup pilot john swigert and the 
launch was not delayed 
nasa officials said there were no plans to replace creighton 
creightons four crewmates on atlantis are air force capt john 
h casper marine lt col david c hilmers air force col richard 
m mullane and navy lt cmdr pierre j thuot 
atlantis according to sources who asked not to be named is to 
carry into space a 37300pound 500 million spy satellite called 
afp731 the device is said to be capable of taking highresolution 
reconnaissance photos and of eavesdropping on electronic 
communications around the world 
the satellite is to be placed into a high inclination orbit that 
will cover more of the earth than satellites previously launched by 
the shuttle this orbital path will carry it over most of the 
soviet union including areas far to the north 
atlantis flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the 
sixth secret military mission

the 1980s ended with the lowest annual traffic 
death rate ever capping a decade in which many americans declared 
war on drunken driving and began using longneglected safety belts 
federal officials say 
the 1989 fatality rate was 22 deaths per 100 million miles 
traveled down from 23 the previous year and onethird lower than 
the 1980 rate of 33 the national highway traffic safety 
administration reported 
fatalities in 1989 are estimated at 45500 compared with 47093 
in 1988 final numbers for last year are still being tallied but 
are unlikely to change significantly officials said 
the reduction in traffic deaths during the 1980s reflects our 
national resolve against drunk driving increased safety belt use 
and a generally heightened awareness of highway safety 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner said thursday 
the death rate probably will continue downward in the 1990s 
even if more miles are driven as the government expands safety 
regulations and the automobile industry makes vehicles more 
crashworthy officials said 
this means that american motorists are less at risk than ever 
before nhtsa administrator jerry r curry said 
the fatality rate is the most widely accepted measure of highway 
safety trends curry said it takes into account changes in miles 
driven from year to year and even a slight increase or decrease 
can reflect a difference of thousands of lives 
if last years rate were the same as in 1980 for example the 
number of deaths would have been 69800 instead of 45500 
the highest fatality rate on record is 241 deaths per 100 
million miles in 1921 the first year the government attempted to 
establish a rate nhtsa spokesman tim hurd said by 1940 when 
statistics were more reliable the rate had fallen to 109 deaths 
per 100 million miles still far higher than recent years 
joan claybrook nhtsa administrator during the carter 
administration who criticized the agencys performance in the 
reagan years also hailed the improved fatality rate but it 
resulted in part from standards the federal government adopted 
grudgingly she said 
even when reagan was saying get the government off our backs 
state legislatures were continuing to pass these safety 
requirements with these incredibly high payoffs said ms 
claybrook now president of public citizen a public interest group 
founded by ralph nader 
thirtythree states and the district of columbia have enacted 
mandatory seat belt laws since 1984 the total fell from 34 last 
fall when north dakota voters rejected by referendum a bill that 
had cleared the state legislature 
seat belt use has increased from 10 to 15 percent in the early 
1980s to around 47 percent said jeffrey miller deputy nhtsa 
administrator 
a regulation that took effect in september requires all cars 
made in the united states to have air bags or automatic safety 
belts 
that will save thousands of lives every year ms claybrook 
said its the most important health standard in america 
meanwhile all states now require child restraint seats and have 
established 21 as the minimum drinking age alcoholrelated highway 
deaths have fallen from about 28000 in 1980 to 23500 in 1988 a 
17 percent decline the number of teenagers involved in such 
crashes fell by onethird between 1982 and 1986 miller said 
the numbers are still obviously high but were making some 
noticeable inroads he said 
state drunken driving laws were toughened across the nation 
during the 1980s while police and prosecutors became more adept at 
handling impaired driving cases miller said public tolerance 
waned spawning designated driver programs and awareness campaigns 
curry appointed by president bush last year has promised to 
quicken his agencys consideration of new safety regulations he 
said thursday that new sideimpact standards the subject of fierce 
debate for more than a decade will be established this year 
theres a lot of emotion involved a lot of money involved 
for the manufacturers he said its going to be expensive 
the new standards will envision a 10 to 15 percent reduction in 
sideimpact deaths which total onethird of all fatalities in 
passenger cars said barry felrice associate nhtsa administrator 
for rulemaking 
but curry voiced concern about overburdening automakers with 
tough clean air and gas mileage requirements pending in congress 
the automobile industry is fragile and we have dumped an awful 
lot of safety regulations on them in the last 12 months he said

an unmanned ariane rocket carrying 
two japanese communications satellites exploded just after liftoff 
prompting the competitor to the us commercial launch industry to 
suspend future flights 
the ariane 44l rocket powered by four strapon boosters blew 
apart thursday less than two minutes after takeoff apparently 
because of a fire in the propulsion system arianespace president 
frederic dallest said at the launch site late thursday 
all ariane flights are suspended until we discover the reasons 
of this accident he said we are going to analyze this failure 
and explain the catastrophe of this flight as rapidly as possible 
the ariane rocket carrying two telecommunications satellites 
for the japan broadcasting corp and space communications corp 
exploded over the atlantic ocean about 7 miles from the launch pad 
at the ariane space center in kourou french guiana on the 
northeast coast of south america 
it was the first such failure after 17 consecutive successful 
ariane launches 
one of the boosters powering the 582ton vehicle experienced a 
sudden drop of pressure just 62 seconds after the end of the 
countdown arianespace officials said two other boosters tried to 
prevent the rocket from tipping but were unable to stabilize the 
flight 
at 90 seconds technicians realized the mission would have to be 
abandoned and the explosion took place 11 seconds later officials 
said 
arianespace had planned at least eight more launches this year 
but all have been suspended until the fault can be discovered and 
fixed dallest said in the meantime arianespace will continue to 
manufacture and prepare rockets to be ready to resume launches 
speaking to reporters today dallest said arianespace was eager 
to reassure customers of its reliability and would establish a 
special investigative panel next week to determine the reason for 
the rockets failure customers will be given all the details of 
the findings so they can be comfortable that we can resume 
flights safely he said 
japanese officials said they would continue to cooperate with 
arianespace despite the loss of the two satellites that were 
insured for more than 200 million 
witnesses who saw the flight on the video monitors at launch 
headquarters in evry france said flames appeared to break out in 
the first stage of the rocket before it was due to detach at 2 
minutes 30 seconds into flight 
technicians said the rocket appeared slightly off course and 
passed unexpectedly close above the support scaffolding as it rose 
with flame from one of the boosters burning the structure 
however there was no indication this caused the explosion 
technicians who replayed videotapes thursday night suggested a 
turbopump failure might have contributed to the blast 
debris from the vehicle rained over the coast but no injuries 
were reported 
winds carried a cloud of the fuel back to land forcing the 
launch staff and the 12000 residents of kourou indoors until it 
passed some residents complained of burning eyes and sore throats 
french police and soldiers using a helicopter searched today 
for debris along the coast 
arianespace a consortium of european companies took over the 
commercialization of the ariane program from the european space 
agency in 1980 it is responsible for building operating and 
marketing launch services 
ariane shots have become routine with successful missions about 
once a month the reliability of the program has made arianespace 
the worlds leading provider of commercial launch services 
four other ariane rockets have exploded in flight thursdays 
was the first explosion since may 31 1986 and the first of the 
no 4 rocket series the 44l is the most powerful in the series 
the launch was the 36th ariane mission since the first flight in 
the unmanned space program overseen by the european space agency 
was held dec 24 1979 
the united states depended on its space shuttles to launch 
commercial satellites until the challenger exploded on jan 28 
1986 since then three major american aerospace companies martin 
marietta mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics have been 
developing and launching commerical satellites 
but with its early start ariane has captured about 50 percent 
of the market and it drew business from the american program after 
the challenger explosion 
for thursdays launch the bs2x satellite was built by general 
electrics aerospace division to direct broadcasting for japans 
national nhk television network 
in tokyo yoshiro nakamura chief technician for the network 
said the failure was very disappointing but nhks staff would 
continue to cooperate with arianespace 
the second satellite the superbird b built by ford aerospace 
was owned by mitsubishis subsidiary space communications corp 
the bs2x was insured for 150 million to 180 million 
arianespace said while the superbird b was insured for about 60 
million 
jungi inoue of the space communications corp put launch and 
insurance costs at 600 million

gen dien del and confirmed by the radio of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government 
dien del deputy commander of the noncommunist khmer peoples 
national liberation front guerrillas charged that vietnamese 
soldiers were involved in the attack although vietnam claimed it 
withdrew all its troops in september captured soldiers told of 700 
vietnamese at two bases near svay chek 
the new york times today quoted eastern european diplomats as 
saying several thousand vietnamese troops and military advisers 
returned to cambodia in october to help government troops defend 
battambang and sisophon two important cities

completely recapturing svay chek we are now in full control of 
this area 
the fighting came three days before peace talks are to begin in 
indonesia between the vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh 
and the three guerrilla groups led by prince norodom sihanouk 
the guerrillas have made major gains in the west bordering 
thailand since september the sihahouk guerrillas seized the 
strategic town of thmar puok while the khmer rouge guerrillas took 
the gemmining town of pailin 
the fighting had been at a relative lull in more recent weeks 
in the past it has intensified just before peace talks as the 
government and guerrillas try to strengthen their bargaining 
positions 
dien del interviewed in the key thai border town of 
aranyaprathet said svay chek was heavily shelled by tanks and 
sovietmade multiplerocket launchers during the final assault 
four days after the counteroffensive began 
he said the 600 guerrillas defending the town fled in confusion 
after they failed to receive word that a frontline position had 
fallen earlier they regrouped in three towns north of svay chek 
he said 
the general had no reports on casualties 
the liberation front had taken svay chek dec 5 after three 
major assaults 
the guerrillas brief control of svay chek allowed them to 
attack sisophon a government military operations center 13 miles 
to the south svay chek is near the thai border and in the province 
of banteay meanchey 
the guerrillas will not immediately try to retake svay chek 
because of shortages of chinesesupplied ammunition dien del said 
guerrilla sources also reported that chinesesupported khmer 
rouge guerrillas on thursday night attacked a major government 
military garrison at sophy which is south of svay chek details 
were not immediately available

president bushs press secretary gave a 
lighthearted tonguelashing today to the nations lawyers saying 
they deserve all the criticism they can get

the former justice minister who was 
forced to resign amid allegations she disclosed secret government 
information to her husband was cleared of wrongdoing today 
a supreme court jury said evidence did not support prosecution 
claims that elisabeth kopp violated official secrecy laws a crime 
punishable by up to three years in prison but the court said mrs 
kopp had lacked the required care 
the fivemember court convicted kopps former personal assistant 
but imposed no penalty it acquitted another former justice 
ministry aide 
the case involved a government investigation in 1988 into 
laundering of drug money and its scrutiny of the currency dealing 
firm shakarchi trading ag 
mrs kopps husband hans w kopp resigned as vice president 
of the firm oct 27 1988 the day he received a phone call from 
his wife urging him to break ties with the company 
no charges have been filed against shakarchi and the company 
denies wrongdoing 
several dozen supporters cheered when mrs kopp smiling 
broadly left the supreme court building in lausanne today 
mrs kopp admitted in court that she made the phone call to her 
husband a businessman and lawyer but said she thought the 
information she gave to him had come from banking circles not from 
government secrets 
mrs kopps personal assistant at the time was katharina schoop 
who told her boss of the probe involving shakarchi ms schoop said 
she learned of it from justice department documents shown to her by 
another ministry aide renate schwob 
ms schoop said that when she told mrs kopp her husbands firm 
was under suspicion the source of information was never mentioned 
but that she was convinced mrs kopp knew it came from inside the 
government 
after mrs kopp called her husband she told him to call ms 
schoop for more information 
the court convicted ms schoop of giving details to mr kopp but 
did not impose a penalty saying ms schoop was acting on her 
bosses orders and was not aware she was breaking the law 
ms schwob was acquitted 
all had been charged with violating official secrecy laws an 
offense carrying a maximum threeyear prison term and fines of up 
to 27000 
mrs kopp was switzerlands only female government minister and 
was in line to be the countrys first woman president a largely 
ceremonial post she resigned over the affair in january 1989

today to pay respects to his mother after the state correction 
commissioner set aside a state law adopted in reponse to the willie 
horton case 
the decision thursday is the first time an inmate serving a life 
sentence for firstdegree murder has been granted a nonmedical 
emergency furlough since massachusetts adopted the statute 
the law was approved after horton a convicted murder fled 
while on furlough from massachusetts and assaulted a maryland 
couple president bush used the issue in his campaign in 1988 
against gov michael s dukakis 
the state statute prohibits emergency furloughs except for 
medical reasons to inmates serving life sentences for firstdegree 
murder 
following a series of court decisions correction commissioner 
george vose agreed to allow philip pennellatore to be taken under 
guard for a private viewing of his mother nettie pennellatore

visit his mother feb 5 but she died before a ruling was made

but a superior court judge ruled against it wednesday 
vose granted the emergency furlough after a state appeals court

secretary of state james a baker iii says he 
will impose stiff conditions on normalizing relations with 
nicaragua even if the leftist government is returned to power on 
sunday in a free and fair election 
baker ruled out normal ties on thursday unless nicaragua 
refrains for a sustained period after the election from 
supporting leftist rebels in el salvador 
in addition he said the administration must be satisfied that 
the sandinista government will not shut down the democratic opening 
which president daniel ortega has given to opposition groups during 
the campaign 
asked about us policy during a hearing of the house foreign 
affairs committee baker said it is normal for those who believe in 
democracy to respect the results of a free and fair election 
but he said the us government will make its own judgment 
about the fairness of the election suggesting that he will not 
take at face value the assessments of the hundreds of international 
observers who will be in nicaragua on sunday 
the administration has provided assistance to opposition 
candidate violeta chamorro in her campaign to end ortegas 10year 
grip on power 
a consensus has emerged among state department officials that 
mrs chamorro has the votes to defeat ortega but that the 
sandinistas will devise a way to rig the outcome in their favor 
at the white house today sen richard lugar rind and allen 
weinstein president of the center for democracy independent 
monitoring organization also cited a possibility for fraud in the 
nicaraguan election 
the two who met with vice president dan quayle said the 
nicaraguan system of taking vote counts off official tally sheets 
and relaying them by telex to managua leaves open opportunities for 
meddling with the results out of the view of official observers 
the chain of observation has been broken said lugar 
weinstein also said that delegations from costa rica and 
honduras were told they could not join his observer group 
lugar said president bush should go slow in improving ties 
should ortega win the election until it can be determined if the 
process was fairly conducted 
in discussing the possibility of a sandinista victory baker 
said thursday i dont think we should assume this at all 
most recent polls show ortega with a comfortable lead but 
officials here believe that many nicaraguans fearing retaliation 
are not inclined to be honest with pollsters 
the administration has highlighted perceived campaign abuses by 
the sandinistas but former president jimmy carter has described 
most such complaints as highly exaggerated 
carter heads the observer delegation of the council of freely 
elected heads of government which has made a number of trips to 
nicaragua 
although us military aid to the contra rebels was suspended 
two years ago usnicaraguan relations are far from normal a 
trade embargo imposed by the united states in 1985 remains in 
effect and the respective embassies of the two countries have not 
been represented at the level of ambassador since 1988 
it is assumed that if mrs chamorro wins on sunday the 
thousands of contra rebels now assembled at border camps in 
honduras will return to nicaragua in peace 
the fate of the contras in the event of a sandinista victory is 
less clear us officials without being specific have told 
contra leaders that the united states will not abandon them 
regardless of the outcome sunday a 495 million us humanitarian 
aid program expires at the end of the month 
the level of suspicion between the united states and nicaragua 
remains high the sandinistas reject washingtons assertion that 
us aid to the contras is limited to food and other humanitarian 
items charging that us logistical support is being provided as 
well although an informal ceasefire was suspended late last year 
the fighting has been no more than sporadic 
the bush administration has its own list of grievances against 
the sandinistas chief among them is the administration contention 
that nicaragua continues to arm and train the salvadoran rebels in 
violation of a pledge ortega has made in writing to other central 
american presidents 
nicaragua also maintains close ties with cuba reinforcing us 
concerns that the sandinistas are intent on exporting their 
revolution

tycoon donald trump who usually delights in 
media attention says he hates the splashy publicity about his 
breakup with wife ivana but believes it has a silver lining its 
good for business 
trump said in an interview thursday that the screaming tabloid 
headlines and talkshow jokes about his marital travails actually 
have benefitted his multibilliondollar casino hotel and airline 
empire 
the business has never been better he said but because 
its a private company most people dont know about it 
unfortunately for all the wrong reasons the last two weeks its 
been even better yet 
trump said business has been up at his two hotelcasinos in 
atlantic city nj the plaza hotel and the trump shuttle which 
links new york with washington and boston since the breakup first 
hit the headlines two weeks ago 
still he said having his name splashed over the media has taken 
a toll 
its horrible i hate it i hate the publicity trump said 
in his glitzy 26thfloor office commanding a view of central park 
and the plaza hotel one of his properties 
its been on a personal basis difficult because i happen to 
like ivana but its something you have to go through and in 
many cases a lot of people have to go through it people grow 
apart 
under an agreement ivana is contesting she would receive 25 
million and the couples home in connecticut as well as custody of 
their children trumps holdings are estimated to be worth up to 4 
billion 
although trump insisted the publicity was a business plus some 
marketing analysts said the headlines could hurt an empire built 
the developers name 
hes becoming a joke said jack trout president of trout amp 
ries a marketing consulting firm in greenwich conn 
mrs trump declined through spokesman john scanlon to comment on 
her husbands remarks 
all mrs trump wants is a fair and equitable share of the 
fortune that they accumulated together while they were married 
scanlon said were disappointed that mr trump is prepared to 
offer his wife and children less than 1 percent of his accumulated 
wealth we really expected better of him 
the daily news in new york reported today that mrs trumps 
friends said she was seeing an analyst several times a week in 
an effort to keep a grip on her emotions and help her through the 
rough spots the newspaper did not identify the friends nor did 
the report indicate whether mrs trump had ever consulted an 
analyst before the breakup 
on thursday meanwhile trump accepted the outstanding new 
yorker award from the new york society of association executives 
he appeared unflustered by the medias microscope until city 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman praised his achievements and listed 
those which have brought him and new york acclaim 
and to me one of the most important things is his love 
affair she said pausing several seconds while she knocked on 
the wooden podium then she added with the city 
there was laughter throughout the crowd and then trumps face 
became red for at least a full minute

a store clerk has shot and killed a 
robbery suspect for the second time in seven months this time an 
unarmed man who had his hands in his pocket as if he had a weapon 
police say 
du jack nguyen 28 told police that the suspect frederick 
b henderson demanded money after entering the happy 7 food mart 
on thursday saying you want to do this the hard way or the easy 
way 
nguyen said he handed over an undisclosed amount of money then 
pulled out a 9mm handgun and told henderson to freeze said police 
investigator dennis waldron nguyen said he fired one shot when the 
suspect turned with his hands in his pockets 
although henderson never threatened the clerk nguyen said he 
believed his life was in danger waldron said 
last july 19 nguyen shot and killed calvin lee watts 29 who 
entered the store with a pistol and demanded money investigators 
said 
waldron said the state attorneys office will be asked to 
investigate the latest shooting 
it appears at this point that the shooting is well within 
the law but the investigation is ongoing he said the law 
says you can use whatever force is reasonable for protection of 
yourself or others if someone threatens to harm you 
it marked the fourth time that shots have been fired at the 
convenience store in pensacolas middleclass east hill district in 
the last 18 months 
other clerks fired shots at robbery suspects twice in 1988 but 
no one was wounded in either case

tornadoes passed through the region on thursday causing some 
serious damage in portions of mississippi and alabama and injuring 
at least 30 people 
heavy thunderstorms or rain showers were reported thursday from 
florida to michigan the wet weather was the result of low pressure 
that was pulling moisture northward out of the gulf

alabama and georgia but the fears were largely unrealized some 
residents of lowlying areas of southern mississippi expect 
flooding this weekend however as water rises in the pascagoula 
river from rainfall that occurred earlier upstream

negotiators reached agreement today on a pay raise 
of about 17 percent for ambulance workers to end a dispute that has 
disrupted emergency service across britain for six months 
some ambulance drivers said they would vote against the deal 
because it did not put them on the same footing as police and 
firefighters by including a formula for future wage increases tied 
to inflation 
but roger poole chief negotiator for the five unions involved 
called the pay deal simply staggering and said the ambulance 
unions had driven a coach and horses through the governments 
policy on curbing wage hikes 
the accord covering the period from march 1 1990 until march 
31 1991 was reached after 20 hours of talks between union 
officials and managers of the national health service 
poole said it gives ambulance workers a 176 percent pay 
increase while the health service put the package at 17 percent 
there is an option for local ambulance companies to add another 2 
percent 
the salaries of ambulance workers would rise from 17259 to 
18812 on march 1 and to 20298 on oct 1 crew members would 
also receive a lump sum payment of 1454 and there would be extra 
allowances for staff with specialized training 
poole said he was confident the 22500 ambulance workers and 
control room staff would overwhelmingly approve the settlement and 
return to their jobs after a vote is taken around march 13 
in the liverpool area branch secretary ray clayton of the 
national union of public employees said he was dismayed there was 
no pay formula to link wage increases with inflation i dont 
think the strike will be called off he said 
andy lawrence an ambulance workers spokesman in west sussex 
called the deal an insult to our intelligence 
job actions began sept 7 when ambulance drivers started 
refusing to work overtime in october emergency crews stopped 
using their radios or in some cases answering calls from control 
rooms 
prime minister margaret thatchers government ordered police and 
army ambulances to answer emergency calls starting nov 8 it was 
the first time they had been used for civilian ambulance calls 
since the winter of discontent of 197879 when a series of 
public service strikes hit a labor party government 
some health authorities hired taxis and asked relatives to drive 
nonemergency cases to hospitals 
in some cases ambulance crews suspended for joining the dispute 
carried out their own unofficial service accepting emergency calls 
direct from hospitals or members of the public but not from 
ambulance control rooms

the funeral of the slain foreign minister 
ended in violence today as riot police beat back a huge crowd of 
wailing stonethrowing mourners with nightsticks and tear gas 
scores of people were injured by rocks and sticks and reporters 
said they saw police club and arrest dozens of others before the 
spontaneous demonstration of grief and rage was brought under 
control 
cabinet ministers leading politicians and foreign envoys were 
caught up in the melee which erupted moments after president 
daniel arap moi left the grounds of the valley road pentecostal 
church in his official limousine 
no deaths were reported 
thousands of people had gathered outside the church about a 
mile from downtown nairobi for the service for robert ouko whose 
charred body was found with a bullet hole through the skull near 
his farm in western kenya on feb 16 
the crowd was largely quiet until the first mourners inside the 
church began to file out many of them weeping as the crowd 
outside joined in the moaning and crying police began to move it 
back 
a group of young people thought to be university students 
shouted and a hail of rocks sticks bottles and other missiles 
was let loose riot squads charged into the demonstrators chasing 
them through a nearby park and into the citys center 
hours later police and government paramilitary units were still 
on nairobis streets dispersing demonstrators and bystanders 
several cars were stoned and windows smashed in some sections of 
the city 
university students demonstrated in nairobi for four days 
earlier this week demanding an impartial investigation into oukos 
death the demonstrations were halted on orders of campus 
administrators wednesday night 
ouko was the fourth leading political figure to die violently 
since kenya gained independence in 1963 none of the three previous 
murders was solved and in each case the government of former 
president jomo kenyatta was accused of a coverup 
mois government has released only sketchy details of its 
investigation but has called in three scotland yard detectives and 
a british pathologist to assist it they began work wednesday 
ouko appeared to be more popular in death than he was in life 
although considered one of the most articulate and able members of 
mois cabinet he was largely out of the domestic political 
limelight as foreign minister a post he had held since 1979 
he had barely retained his parliamentary seat in the face of a 
strong challenge in his western kenya constituency in an election 
in 1988 
following the funeral service oukos body was to be flown to 
kisumu a major trading center near lake victoria in western kenya 
where his coffin was to be displayed at a sports stadium from 
there the body was to be taken to his nearby family home in koru 
for burial saturday 
oukos partly burned body was found in heavy brushland about 
four miles from his family farm three days after he left home 
before dawn on feb 13 without notifying employees or relatives

plo chairman yasser arafat said in a letter 
released today that he has approved the participation of 
palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip in peace 
talks with israel 
it was the first formal statement by the plo leader that he has 
approved terms for israelipalestinian talks although there have 
been hints from cairo that he was moving in that direction 
arafat said in the letter that the plo would prefer an 
international peace conference and guarantees that can only be 
provided by the great powers and the united nations 
but he added the plo once more leaned over backward and 
approved the idea of a dialogue between representatives of the 
israeli government and representatives of the palestinian people in 
the occupied territories and the diaspora 
he said that such talks would have to be part of a process 
aimed at a comprehensive and final settlement and that its 
agenda could cover all the conceptual ingredients of that 
process including the elections and the 10 egyptian points 
the 10 egyptian points were recommendations put forward by 
egyptian president hosni mubarak to try to get a concensus with 
israel on preliminary peace talks 
mubarak backed by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
has offered to host an initial israelipalestinian dialogue aimed 
at reviving stalled middle east peace efforts 
those talks are expected to help clear the way for 
israeliproposed elections in the occupied territories leading to 
limited autonomy of the areas 17 million palestinian residents 
hundreds of palestinians and more than 40 israelis have been killed 
in the palestinian uprising in the territories 
efforts to get the talks under way have been stalled by israeli 
concerns over the composition of the palestinian delegation and the 
agenda 
israeli which refuses to deal with the plo as a terrorist 
group has not yet agreed to participate in the prelimintary 
talks urged by mubarak 
arafats letter was sent to a meeting in jerusalem by jewish 
peace activists called the special emergency world jewish 
leadership peace conference which concluded thursday 
rita hauser a new york peace activist who attended the 
conference told reporters that the letter was received through a 
circuitious manner via fax on thursday but that conference 
leaders had been unable to get it fitted in amid the 
conferences heavy schedule 
it was presented at a board meeting today of the tel avivbased 
international center for peace in the middle east which sponsored 
the conference 
ms hauser an attorney and head of the centers american 
branch met with arafat in stockholm in december 1988 hauser said 
she had been in fax contact with the plo since that meeting 
shortly after their meeting arafat made a series of historic 
announcements recognizing israels right to exist and renouncing 
terrorism those statements led in turn to the united states 
resuming contacts with the plo for the first time since 1975 
arafats letter to the jerusalem meeting of jewish peace 
advocates was dated feb 17 and came from tunis where the plo is 
headquartered there was no explanation for the delay in its 
transmittal to jerusalem 
in the letter arafat repeated the plos call for creation of an 
independent palestinian state in the occupied territories which 
were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
we remain deeply convinced that the only real security 
guarantee for israel lives in a peaceful settlement based on the 
termination of the israeli occupation of the palestinian and arab 
territories and the acceptance of the twostate principle he 
wrote 
arafat noted that israel has been fearful of dealing with the 
plo and said that palestinians had similar concerns about dealing 
with the jewish state 
watching the convoluted maneuvers the israeli government has 
engaged in and the massive obstacles with which it has littered the 
path to peace the palestinian people are not filled with 
confidence in the good intentions of the israeli leaders arafat 
wrote 
he continued to them the only guarantee of their own 
security and their political future lies in the full participation 
of the plo in all stages of the peace process 
such a role has been ruled out by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir in an interview published today in the jerusalem post 
shamir was asked what the plo could do to make itself an acceptable 
negotiating partner 
the only thing it should do is dismantle itself shamir 
replied because its minimal demand is a palestinian state and a 
palestinian state cannot coexist with israel

birth control is practiced by 88 percent of 
chinese married women of childbearing age but poorquality 
contraceptives lead to a high rate of unplanned pregnancies a 
state family planning commission official said 
zhu yaohua said 46 percent of the 164 million women practicing 
contraception used intrauterine devices the china daily reported 
friday 
female sterilization or tubal ligation and vasectomies were 
the next two most common forms of preventing births she said 
figures on other methods were not listed state planning 
commission figures for 1988 showed iuds accounted for 411 percent 
of contraception female sterilization for 361 percent and male 
sterilization for 114 percent 
oral pills at 58 percent and condoms at 4 percent were far 
less popular 
zhu said structural faults in the chinesemade iuds and 
insertion problems resulted in a high number of unplanned 
pregnancies 
un population fund officials in beijing have said there is a 
10 percent failure rate for the iuds a major reason why there were 
1268 million abortions in china in 1988 more than one for every 
two live births 
china adheres to a strict onechildperfamily policy and women 
who become pregnant outside the state plan are often pressured to 
have abortions

the names of illegitimate children of british 
aristocrats have been printed for the first time in a famous guide 
to bluebloods 
its something of a revolution for debretts peerage and 
baronetage the weighty reference book that first came out in 
1769 and appears every five years 
we have put them in at the request of those families who 
wanted the names of natural children to appear said editor 
charles kidd at the launch of the latest edition thursday night 
across the country about one in every four children is born 
out of wedlock if parents agree we believe that debretts should 
record illegitimate issue to ensure the book is comprehensive 
although these children still cannot inherit a title he said 
kidd said about 200 names had entered the huge book as a result 
of changing social attitudes but he has not helped readers by 
printing a list 
youll have to search them out he said 
it takes some searching and will have to be done by someone who 
knows plenty about the offspring of the upper classes there are 
2300 families in the book involving tens of thousands of names 
but lady elizabeth berkeley gave permission for her entry to be 
publicized her composerhusband the late sir lennox berkeley was 
the son of an illegitimate member of the earl of berkeleys family 
and was barred from debretts 
although the earldom is extinct five lennoxes have gotten into 
the book as a result of the policy change and lady elizabeth said 
i am delighted my only regret is that my husband did not live to 
see it 
he could never have the title or the family castle but what 
really hurt him was that his father had no existence in 
debretts she said 
other entries of the illegitimate include offspring of the 24th 
earl of erroll a premier peer of scotland whose family motto is 
bear the yoke 
at the beginning of the 18th century fathers always claimed 
their illegitimate children and put them in the parish registers 
it was only victorian prudery that swept them all under the 
carpet said francesjane french a specialist on the angloirish 
aristocracy 
theres no reason at all why debretts should take a 
moralistic line a lot of our aristocrats sprang from the 
mistresses of king charles ii said jovial ian mccorquodale 
chairman of debretts peerage ltd 
the new debretts also includes adopted children for the first 
time although they also cannot inherit titles 
we are simply keeping abreast of changing social fashions 
said kidds coeditor david williamson 
among hundreds of other legitimate new entrants in the book is 
film actress jamie lee curtis who starred in a fish called 
wanda and entered the aristocracy by her 1984 marriage to the 
hon christopher guest a relative of viscount wimborne 
actor nigel havers is also in because his father the former 
sir micahel havers was given a life peerage after being forced by 
illhealth to resign the lord chancellorship in 1987 after holding 
it for four months 
the 169th edition of debretts peerage and baronetage weighs 
nearly 5 pounds and contains 2400 pages including 96 pages of 
advertisements for antique shops schools hotels and charities 
such as the international league for the protection of horses and 
the indigent gentlewomen of scotland 
it costs 205 a whopping price for a book and between 6000 
and 7000 copies will be sold worldwide the company says

vandals broke into a synagogue in a 
northwestern city and destroyed furniture and religious objects a 
jewish organization reported today 
in the city of oradea 330 miles northwest of bucharest 
unidentified assailants smashed windows and broke down the doors of 
the synagogue on the night of feb 1516 said teodor blumenfeld 
general secretary of the federation of romanian jewish communities 
they tore apart the building apparently in search of gold and 
silver objects he said they did not find any but destroyed prayer 
books and prayer shawls blumenfeld said 
he estimated the damage at 30000 lei or 1500 at the official 
exchange rate no one had been arrested he said 
romanias chief rabbi moses rosen said last week that he 
feared a surge of antisemitism in the more open climate following 
the december revolution that ended communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescus 24year rule 
he said groups like the iron guard romanias former naziallied 
fascist movement could be reborn 
rosen who has been chief rabbi for 41 years met last week with 
interim president ion iliescu and asked for a guarantee of 
existence for his community which has been reduced from some 
850000 on the eve of world war ii to 20000 today 
half of romanias jewish community was wiped out in the 
holocaust and 400000 were allowed by romanias communist 
authorities to settle in israel after the war 
blumenfeld said security guards and alarm systems were being 
provided for synagogues around the country nonetheless he called 
the attack in oradea an isolated incident 
the independent national daily romania libera which published 
news of the attack in todays editions condemned it as a grave 
act of vandalism 
the newspaper the most widely read daily in romania also 
contained what appeared to be a report of an attack by a rightwing 
group on government headquarters in the city of bacau 190 miles 
northeast of bucharest that left a man dead 
the bacau police chief gheorghita toader said in a telephone 
interview that no attack had occurred and the report apparently 
was describing a hypothetical situation

the justice department today defended its 
negotiations with exxon corp about settling possible criminal 
charges from the alaskan oil spill saying any deal will not 
compromise the states legal rights 
department spokesman david runkel responding to criticism of a 
possible deal by environmental groups and alaskan officials said 
the justice department was puzzled by comments which have been 
reported by persons who appear to have little grasp of what is 
actually involved in this case 
runkel said the discussions involve a number of complicated 
legal and factual issues 
no actions taken by the federal government in the enforcement 
of federal criminal laws will compromise the state of alaskas 
ability to pursue the violations of its criminal laws or 
appropriate civil remedies runkel said 
nor will the rights or private parties including the 
environmental groups and alaska residents to pursue appropriate 
civil claims be adversely affected by any actions of the federal 
government in the criminal law area runkel said 
he declined to discuss the specific items of the plea 
negotiations which sources say have been going on for several 
weeks 
as in most cases of this type there have been discussions 
with attorneys for exxon as to the admissible parameters of 
appropriate penalties and appropriate corrective measures in the 
event of a guilty plea to any criminal charges that might be 
brought runkel said 
runkel also declined to say whether any negotiated settlement 
would cover civil claims the federal government could bring against 
exxon 
his comments were in response to statements by environmentalists 
and alaskan officials that criticized what they understood to be 
the proposed deal 
alaska attorney general douglas baily speaking thursday in 
juneau accused the justice department of trying to get the state 
to issue a hasty endorsement of an inadequate draft proposal 
under the proposed agreement the federal government would 
abandon its commitment to alaska to assist with its civil claims 
against exxon baily told reporters he said he hoped the 
agreement would be revised to make it more acceptable to the state 
we are being asked to accept a pig in a poke and that pig 
smells awfully bad he said 
from all accounts the bush administration is giving exxon a 
wink and a nod a mere slap on the wrist added jay hair 
president of the national wildlife federation 
sources said the draft agreement calls for exxon to pay up to 
500 million into a natural resources restoration fund over the 
next seven years and possibly a significantly smaller amount in 
direct criminal penalties to the us treasury 
the agreement if made final would allow exxon whose tanker 
spilled more than 11 million gallons of oil into alaskas pristine 
prince william sound in march 1989 to avoid an embarrassing 
criminal trial and possible criminal prosecution of individual 
corporate officials 
the criminal laws used by federal prosecutors in oil spill cases 
allow fines of up to double the cost of the cleanup exxon has said 
it has spent nearly 2 billion to clean up the oil spill 
exxon attorneys in the negotiations with the justice 
department have tried to limit the amount of money to be paid to 
the us treasury as criminal penalties preferring to pay most of 
the money into the restoration fund sources said 
but one government source suggested exxon might have to pay only 
about 150 million initially and subsequent annual payments over 
seven years would be open to exxon challenges 
environmental lawyers said that money paid for restoration under 
the criminal settlement could be taxdeductible as an ordinary cost 
of doing business and could be used to reduce future assessments 
against exxon under various civil proceedings criminal penalties 
could not be deducted from future assessments nor would they be 
taxdeductible 
no criminal charges have been filed in federal court against 
exxon as a result of the alaska spill pending the outcome of the 
pleabargaining state officials last year agreed that the federal 
government would handle criminal charges against exxon while the 
state focused on civil litigation 
although details of the proposed agreement remained sketchy the 
process brought attacks from environmentalists and alaska state 
officials eleven environmental groups filed papers in us 
district court in anchorage asking that any outofcourt settlement 
between the justice department and exxon be reviewed in an open 
court hearing 
mike matz chairman of the alaska coalition a group of 
environmental and civic organizations said the bush administration 
was moving too quickly to settle with exxon he characterized the 
reported settlement as little more than a slap on the wrist 
michael fischer executive director of the sierra club accused 
the bush administration of being too eager to forgive exxon by 
trying to reach a quick and dirty settlement with the oil 
company 
rep george miller dcalif also criticized the justice 
department bargaining with exxon saying the agreement may not 
provide full damages and might jeopardize the rights of other 
parties seeking damages from the oil company

the threat of being eaten prompts some snails 
to grow bigger and live longer two zoologists report 
that doesnt mean that france is facing any danger from giant 
escargot 
but it does suggest that controlling snail populations may not 
be a simple matter of sending predators after them say todd a 
crowl and alan p covich in fridays edition of the journal science 
crowl and covich discovered that the widely distributed 
freshwater snail physella virgata virgata lives longer and grows 
larger when its being hunted by crayfish than it does when its 
left alone 
snails living in streams without crayfish grew rapidly to a 
shell length of about 4 millimeters 016 inch at which time they 
stopped growing and began reproduction they lived between 3 and 5 
months 
but snails living in streams where crayfish preyed on them 
continued growing until they reached the length of 7 millimeters 
027 inch to 11 millimeters 043 inch before starting to 
reproduce and these snails lived 11 to 14 months 
at first the researchers wondered if they had simply encountered 
different types of snails in different streams or if they were the 
same type and somehow responded to being hunted by crayfish 
to find out they treid raising snails in four types of stream 
water 
regardless of their origin snails were small and lived shorter 
lives when raised in water that had been exposed only to snails 
water that had been exposed only to crayfish and water that had 
been exposed to snails and crayfish separately the researchers 
found 
but raising the snails in water that had been exposed to 
crayfish who were hunting and eating snails resulted in snails that 
grew larger and lived longer they reported 
our results suggest that snails are capable of detecting a 
chemical cue that results from crayfish actively foraging snails 
concluded covich and crowl 
crayfish eat lots of juvenile snails but the prey rate declined 
as snail size increased they found 
thus by delaying the onset of reproduction and growing to a 
larger size snails decrease mortality due to sizespecific 
predation they observed 
rapid responses of this type may be more important than genetic 
changes in avoiding being eaten they concluded plus the 
reactions of the snails suggest that the application of simple 
predatorprey models to biologically control snail populations may 
be of limited use 
changes in life history in response to being preyed upon have 
been observed in some plants and invertebrates but the reaction is 
novel for snails they report 
covich is with the department of zoology at the university of 
oklahoma crowl formerly with that department is currently 
affiliated with the department of fisheries and wildlife at utah 
state university and the department of zoology at otago university

the first peace corps program in poland 
was established friday as us deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger continued talks with polish officials on american aid 
for economic reforms 
eagleburger appointed by president bush to coordinate aid to 
poland also heard polands demands that its western border be 
assured before german reunification 
the twoday trip that began thursday was described as a 
working visit by us officials with a series of closeddoor 
meetings between polish finance officials and the us delegation 
which included deputy treasury secretary john robson 
under the peace corps program about 60 volunteers will begin 
arriving this summer mainly english teachers to train polish 
instructors 
earlier this month the polish education ministry announced that 
russian study would no longer be required in schools but officials 
said the introduction of western languages to the schools would be 
slowed by the lack of qualified teachers 
the peace corps has launched similar language training in 
hungary but us officials said the polish effort may be expanded 
to include agricultural assistance and other peace corps programs 
usually offered to developing nations 
eagleburger also met with president wojciech jaruzelski and 
leaders of the roman catholic church which is distributing some 
us aid 
economic help for poland especially to lighten the weight of 
polands 40 billion debt to the west was to be the key agenda 
topic 
prime minister taduesz mazowiecki used the visit to press 
polands views on germany 
we talked also about the most topical matter at present that 
is the unification of germany and the polish presence at 
internatinal negotiations to that effect mazowiecki told the 
official pap news agency after meeting with eagleburger on thursday 
poland is pressing for a seat at reunification talks planned by 
the two germanys and the four world war ii occupying powers the 
united states soviet union france and britain 
on wednesday mazowiecki called for drafting a peace treaty 
establishing the border during the talks 
about onethird of poland is comprised of lands forfeited by 
germany after the war to compensate poland for an even larger 
eastern territory annexed by the soviet union 
east germany and west germany individually have signed 
agreements recognizing the border but west german chancellor 
helmut kohl some of whose political supporters still consider the 
lands part of germany has said he cannot make promises about the 
border on behalf of a reunified germany 
taking advantage of the presence of the representatives of the 
us administration i presented the polish point of view on this 
issue which was included in a letter to president bush 
mazowiecki said 
the united states has so far not endorsed polands demand to 
take part in the sixnation talks on reunification and eagleburger 
said he would not take a stand on this very complicated issue 
eagleburger said he expected mazowiecki would discuss the 
question with bush when he visits washington in march 
in the econmic arena polish finance minister lesek balcerowicz 
said the talks were not expected to yield any immediate 
announcements the official news agency pap said 
balcerorwicz who shaped the dramatic drive to reshape the 
economy as a marketdriven system said the eagleburger delegation 
showed much understanding for his request that poland be able 
to start drawing on a 45 million us enterprise fund after the 
first quarter of 1990 
also on the polish agenda for the meetings with eagleburger was 
the foreign debt more than 31 billion of which is owed to the 
united states and obtaining new credits 
the polish side also is seeking assistance in the agricultural 
sector including preferential sales of grain and foder 
investments in environmental projects and help rebuilding the 
infrastructure especially modernizing telecommunications the 
polish press reported

the federal government should correct the 
danger posed to thousands of fishing vessels by poorly buried on 
unburied pipelines in the gulf of mexico safety officials said 
friday 
the national transportation safety board in its investigation 
of an october fishing boat fire that killed 11 crewmembers urged 
the transportation and interior departments to identify inspect 
maintain and protect the more than 18000 miles of underwater 
pipeline along the gulfs outer continental shelf 
the boat the northumberland snagged and ruptured a 16inch 
natural gas pipeline about a half mile offshore near sabine pass 
texas 
the gas ignited and within seconds the vessel was engulfed in 
flames killing all but three of the 14 people aboard 
investigators determined that portions of the highpressure 
pipeline had been exposed for up to 10 years 
the board said at least 20 other incidents of ships damaging 
offshore pipelines have occurred in the gulf in recent years the 
most serious before the northumberland accident was in 1987 when 
the fishing vessel sea chief struck and ruptured a natural gas 
pipeline in louisiana water resulting in a fire that killed two 
crewmembers 
the continental shelf lies under shallow waters of from nine to 
12 feet in spots where the law requires that pipelines be at least 
three feet below the sea bottom but many older pipelines were 
never buried the board said 
in letters to interior secretary manuel lujan and transportation 
secretary samuel skinner the safety officials called upon the two 
departments to cooperate in protecting ships that may operate 
outside established sea lanes 
up to 35000 shrimping vessels as well as other fishing boats 
operate in the gulfs shallow waters over a web of pipelines the 
board said 
it quoted officials of the us geological survey as saying that 
coastal erosion can be severe along the gulf coast 
winter storms hurricanes and the placement of manmade 
structures such as jetties can accelerate the erosion and 
subsidence rates and lead to the removal of sediment covering a 
pipeline the board said 
marine vessel operators cannot presume that offshore pipelines 
in water depths less than 12 feet are buried and their vessels 
therefore are protected said the letter signed by board 
chairman james l kolstad 
the board said that although the number of reported incidents 
remains small it may be a growing problem 
the board called upon federal authorities to determine the 
extent of pipelines in the gulf and set up a system for inspecting 
them no regulations exist to ensure that pipes remain buried the 
letter said

west german chancellor helmut kohl joins 
president bush at camp david md this weekend to discuss where 
they think things are going in the surging drive toward german 
reunification 
both us and german officials are promoting the meeting away 
from the formalities of washington as symbolizing a personal 
relationship between bush and kohl both proponents of 
reunification 
kohl just back from a visit to moscow was flying to washington 
and on to the presidential retreat saturday to go over the recent 
ottawa agreement for reunification face to face 
the two presidents will discuss such questions as when 
implementation meetings should begin among east and west germany 
and the agreements four other parties the united states france 
the soviet union and great britain said one official they will 
also discuss the future of us troops in europe 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the two 
leaders would discuss the full range of issues related to changes 
in eastern europe including reunification a us proposal on 
reducing conventional forces in europe and the future of nato and 
the warsaw pact 
we dont anticipate any new agreements or announcements 
fitzwater said he characterized the weekend when bush will be 
accompanied by secretary of state james a baker iii national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and chief of staff john sununu as 
an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the status of 
events where they think things are going 
fitzwater said west germanys newly announced plans for a 
onetoone currency exchange with east germany probably will be one 
topic 
kohl also will give bush a firsthand account of his meeting with 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev who is talking now of a slower 
approach to reunification 
the camp david agenda could also include an issue that has 
caused consternation on the part of at least one of germanys 
neighbors poland is worried that a reunified germany might become 
aggressive about retaking territory that was part of germany before 
the world war ii victors carved new boundaries 
the poles seek a public statement by german leaders and the four 
other countries to respect the postwar boundaries on wednesday 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki stepped up the pressure by 
calling on the two germanys to sign a treaty guaranteeing polands 
current borders 
kohl who has not made a public statement about the matter is 
under pressure from west german conservatives who want to regain 
the territory 
the separate states of east germany and west germany recognized 
polands boundaries under the 1975 helsinki act on european 
security and cooperation signed by 35 nations 
asked about the matter last month bush said we have 
recognized under helsinki existing borders and i have no problem 
reiterating that but he said he had no judgment on whether 
there should be multilateral action to reaffirm the borders 
coming on the heels of kohls moscow trip and the germany 
reunification agreement reached feb 13 in ottawa kohls visit 
with bush highlights a very important historical turning point 
for germany and europe in general said a us official 
commenting only on condition of anonymity 
west german government spokesman hans klein said it showed the 
close friendship and responsible partnership between germans and 
americans 
bush called kohl twice on the day baker was in ottawa working on 
the unification document that accord called for the two germanys 
to develop a plan and meet with the four other powers to approve it 
and work out larger security issues 
kohls visit also comes shortly before the march 18 elections in 
east germany that will foretell the direction of a new government 
to replace the current caretaker leadership containing both 
communist and opposition members 
kohl embattled on his own home front is looking also to the 
possibility of reunification with an eye toward picking up support 
for his party after the two germanys are one elections in west 
germany are dec 2 
the social democrats have shown increasing strength against 
kohls christian democrats some observers predict that unification 
could occur in time to make the dec 2 election one covering the 
new unified country 
kohl in traveling to moscow and the united states continues to 
put himself forward as the leader of the unification drive 
as far as the us role administration officials have said the 
germans themselves must take the lead on unification however bush 
and kohl are in agreement that us troops should remain in the 
western part of germany and not move into the east 
both also believe that a united germany should be a member of 
nato

prochoice forces won two battles when the indiana senate 
defeated legislation to ban abortions in public hospitals and 
michigan gov james blanchard vetoed a bill requiring minors to 
obtain permission for an abortion 
abortion rights activists in indianapolis clapped in the senate 
gallery and hugged in the hallway when senators turned back the 
public hospital ban on a 2623 vote thursday evening it followed a 
twohour debate 
were not going to be debating this issue again in the indiana 
senate during this session said dinah farrington a lobbyist for 
planned parenthood inc attempts will be made to bring it back 
but i really dont think were going to see it on the senate floor 
again for a vote 
today blanchard announced his veto of the michigan bill which 
would have required minors to get permission either from their 
parents or a court the governor said he supported parental 
involvement in such decisions but the bill takes a womans right 
to help herself away from her 
the actions marked the latest swings in the seesawing fortunes 
of abortion legislation around the country earlier in the week 
legislatures in south carolina and michigan had given final 
approval to bills requiring parental consent for teenagers seeking 
abortions 
the veto of the measure in michigan leaves only one question in 
the abortion dispute in the state whether abortion foes will make 
a doomed override attempt or head straight to the voters 
barbara listing president of right to life of michigan had 
said thursday that the groups executive committee would wait until 
blanchard vetoed the bill before deciding its plan of attack 
its likely that we would simply begin as soon as possible 
with an initiative petition drive listing said 
blanchards counterpart in south carolina gov carroll 
campbell has not taken action on the parental consent bill passed 
there this week but has said he supports it 
the indiana legislation would have prevented doctors in public 
hospitals or clinics from performing abortions except in cases of 
rape incest or when the life or health of the mother is threatened 
under current law no public money can be used for abortions 
but some public hospitals perform the procedure by using private 
donations and fees 
the measure also would have required doctors to perform 
viability tests before performing abortions after the 20th week of 
pregnancy doctors failing to conduct the tests could have been 
jailed 
the us supreme court in july gave states more power to 
restrict abortions the ruling upheld a missouri law that banned 
abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees from 
counseling women about abortions 
it also required doctors planning to perform abortions to first 
test any fetus over 20 weeks to determine if it could live outside 
the womb

defense secretary dick cheney announced friday the 
pentagon wants to bring about 12000 us troops home from asia 
but a ranking soviet official said the plan was nothing to brag 
about 
cheney ending a twoweek visit in the pacific rim with a major 
policy address before the national press club said that during his 
tour he discussed a range of cuts on the order of 10 percent 
scattered about the region 
he said the first phase could take three years 
gennady gerasimov head of the soviet foreign ministrys 
information department criticized the proposed reductions as 
smallscale when compared to soviet efforts 
the plan is not much to brag about said the soviet 
official who is in tokyo to wrap up an asian tour of his own it 
was the natural result of fiscal policies and modernization 
both superpower officials arrived in tokyo from manila japanese 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said gerasimov is a guest 
of kyodo news service not the government and the simultaneous 
visits are simply accidental 
final decisions on the troop reductions will be made after 
further discussions with the military commanders and congress the 
us secretary said congress has pressed cheney to slash his 
defense budget and reassess the reasons for keeping 120000 us 
troops in asia 
cheney however said it would be a mistake to reduce the us 
presence in asia just because of eased tensions in europe and 
america must look at the region on its own terms 
he also said that despite calls from some lawmakers for 20 
percent to 30 percent cuts he believes congress will maintain a 
major us presence in the pacific 
in the future if there are solid indications that regional 
stability will not be threatened we may in consultation with our 
allies make other adjustments that would be appropriate he 
said 
however cheney said a total us pullout would open a 
vacuum in the region leading to destabilizing arms races 
regional tensions and possibly conflict 
cheney who toured south korea the philippines and japan said 
the soviet union hasnt acted to reduce tensions in asia as it has 
in europe and called on moscow to help calm the regions 
flashpoints 
but gerasimov speaking to reporters at the national press club 
just hours after cheney argued that moscow has already made 
substantive reductions including the mothballing of 50 ships in 
its pacific fleet and the recent withdrawal of aircraft from cam 
ranh bay in vietnam 
our presence in cam ranh bay will be replaced by mosquitos and 
grasshoppers he said 
such large reductions as we have carried out were the product 
of new thinking and cannot be explained by modernization as 
american military officials have charged he said 
gerasimov dismissed american calls for the soviets to help 
increase stability on the korean peninsula by exerting more 
pressure on north korea 
north korea is an independent country it is not our 
satellite he said pointing out that while there is no foreign 
military presence in the north the us maintains 43000 troops in 
the south 
north korea has made several proposals for peaceful 
reunification with south korea including tearing down the wall 
along their border he added some people say the wall doesnt 
exist but i have seen it from panmunjom this is a time for 
tearing down such walls 
the soviet diplomat said moscow is not considering returning to 
japan the disputed southern kurils small islands off the coast of 
hokkaido that have been occupied by the soviets since the end of 
world war ii 
japanese officials following daylong discussions thursday with 
cheney called plans for reducing the 50000 us troops here 
prudent and appropriate 
while in tokyo cheney also sought increases in japans 24 
billion annual support toward the 7 billion cost of the american 
deployment in japan but no specific figures were discussed or 
agreed upon officials said 
the secretary who leaves for the united states saturday said 
that japan has significantly increased its spending for us 
forces here we think that is a very positive trend he said 
adding that he hoped such increases would continue

the peoples daily isnt known for its sense of 
humor as it proved friday with a scathing frontpage report that 
us democracy is going to the dogs 
the communist party newspaper said the town of sunol calif 
had elected a dog as mayor the joke however may be on the 
newspaper 
western democracy has reached such a peak of perfection that 
not only can one talk of democracy between people but 
democracy between dogs and people the newspaper said with 
heavy sarcasm there is no distinction between people and dogs 
no wonder some people prostrate themselves in worship of 
western democracy 
the dog election can be seen as a wakeup tonic for those 
kindhearted people who are naive and ignorant and blindly worship 
western democracy the paper said in the final analysis 
western nomination systems are a very limited kind of democracy 
sunol is an unincorporated area of about 400 people in alameda 
county 40 miles southeast of san francisco 
some of the local residents jokingly refer to a beloved black 
labrador named bosco as the hamlets mayor following a mock 
election more than 10 years ago when the pooch supposedly beat two 
human rival candidates 
the town actually is governed by the alameda county board of 
supervisors 
local media have been known to do periodic stories on bosco 
the peoples daily published the story one day after the foreign 
ministry lashed out at us criticism of its human rights record 
it also carried articles friday about the spread of aids and 
drug use in the united states bolstering the official image of the 
united states as an anarchic and degenerate society

anyone who hates lawyers has a friend in the 
white house 
lawyers certainly deserve all the criticism they can get 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater declared friday 
those are universally held feelings by everyone who has ever 
dealt with the legal establishment 
fitzwater made his comments at a press briefing when a reporter 
asked about president bushs speech thursday in which he promised 
government help to restore common sense and fairness to americas 
medical malpractice system 
fitzwater did not explain the basis of his feelings but said 
ive never had any personal problem with lawyers you 
understand he said he was sure that all my good friends who 
are lawyers would appreciate his position 
after his briefing fitzwater declined an opportunity to back 
off his attack everyone ought to take every opportunity to blast 
lawyers its so easy to bash lawyers said fitzwater who works 
for a government that employs thousands of lawyers and has its own 
attorneys in the white house 
the american bar association said it was disappointed with 
fitzwaters comments 
i hope that he wasnt serious said aba president l stanley 
chauvin jr of louisville ky and if he was it was because he 
wasnt aware of all the things lawyers do to protect peoples 
rights 
moreover he said the aba was involved in projects such as drug 
education and protecting the rights of the elderly and children

the bush administration said friday that it 
would not retaliate against the 12nation european community and 
south korea regarding trade barriers imposed against us 
telecommunications firms 
instead us trade representative carla hills said the 
administration will extend for a year the current round of talks 
aimed at settling the dispute 
there is much additional work to be done before we obtain the 
full market openings we should have but a decision to end our 
negotiations now could halt the momentum we have achieved and 
jeopardize future prospects for liberalization hills said in 
announcing the decision 
south korea and the european community were accused by the 
administration a year ago of erecting unfair barriers that 
discriminate against the sale of us telecommunications products 
and services 
under the 1988 trade law us negotiators had a year in which 
to try to get the other countries to remove the offending barriers 
if the talks proved unsuccessful the administration could then 
have retaliated by imposing higher tariffs on imports from the 
european community and south korea 
hills said the administration decided to exercise the option to 
extend the negotiations for another year on the grounds that 
substantial progress had been made in the talks 
hills cited several areas where both the european community and 
the south koreans had liberalized their trade laws concerning 
telecommunications equipment 
the koreans are taking steps to open their market to us 
equipment manufacturers hills said citing particular progress 
in the areas of government purchases setting standards for foreign 
equipment sales and liberalizing tariffs on telecommunications 
equipment 
in 1988 the european telephone equipment market was estimated 
at 22 billion while the telephone services market was more than 
50 billion the south korean equipment market was put at 15 
billion 
us telecommunications companies are among the best in the 
world given the opportunity to compete fairly they could achieve 
a much larger share of the telecommunications markets hills said 
in a statement

jose napoleon duarte who 
became el salvadors first democratically elected president in 50 
years but was unable to end a civil war that battered his nation 
died today of cancer his doctor said he was 64 
the expresidents personal physician jose luis saca said 
duarte died at 1150 am at home in the fashionable san benito 
neighborhood on the south side of san salvador 
in may 1988 doctors at walter reed army medical center in 
washington diagnosed the cancer and removed 60 percent of duartes 
stomach but the cancer had spread to his liver at that time they 
gave him from six to 18 months to live 
duarte governed from 1984 until june of 1989 when his christian 
democrats lost control of congress and he had to turn the 
presidency over to alfredo cristiani leader of the rightist arena 
party supported by the oligarchy that duarte fought so long 
duarte who was once arrested beaten and exiled for his 
fidelity to democracy called his inauguration in 1984 a light in 
the long night of horror and he likened himself to moses 
delivering a people from their tribulations 
duarte was crucial to the replacement of an authoritarian 
semifeudal system with incipient democracy but he finished his 
term and his life burdened by failures compromises frustration 
and dashed hopes 
the war with the leftist farabundo marti liberation front 
continues after 10 years poverty remains endemic in this small 
central american nation of 5 million where the staggering economy 
is dependent on us aid 
he didnt work miracles said a highranking us diplomat 
who served in el salvador for most of duartes term but he must 
be credited with instituting the democratic system itself his 
great legacy is the transition of government the rest pales by 
comparison 
duartes opponents criticized his bombast and messianic complex 
some of his top aides were accused of corruption his supporters 
hailed his idealism and fighting spirit but adversaries and fans 
agree duarte played a historic role in el salvador 
one must acknowledge president duartes democratic vocation 
said cristiani just before he took over on june 1 he has with 
his aptitude and positions promoted the advance of democracy but 
i wouldnt go so far as to call him the father of salvadoran 
democracy 
duarte was born in san salvador nov 23 1925 the second of 
three sons to a tailor father and dressmaking mother the father 
later turned to candy making a business good enough to put all 
three boys through college 
in 1944 duarte who had been a boy scout and remained active in 
the organization for life went to notre dame in south bend ind 
he graduated as a civil engineer and came home to marry his 
childhood friend ines duran work in her familys construction 
business and raise six children 
the barrelchested blueeyed engineer joined a half dozen other 
roman catholic professionals in 1960 to found the christian 
democratic party they were mostly young liberals who hoped they 
could put the churchs social doctrine into practice through 
government 
he served three terms as mayor of san salvador gathering a 
political following that revered him through years of exile and 
trouble 
he ran for president in february 1972 and was winning handily 
when the army stopped the count and declared its candidate the 
winner 
a few weeks later a dissident military faction attempted a coup 
that duarte supported when the coup failed he was arrested 
beaten and told he would be shot 
he was instead allowed to leave the country he spent more than 
seven years in venezuela and returned to construction but kept 
active in politics and indulged his hobby of oil painting 
he came home after a 1979 coup by reformist minded military 
officers intent on dismantling the semifeudal economy that had 
made a very few salvadorans very wealthy while leaving the vast 
majority poor and illiterate 
duarte joined the ruling junta in 1980 and became its president 
in december that year the army and police embarked on a course of 
brutal repression that left tens of thousands of civilians dead 
many by officially sanctioned or tolerated death squads 
duarte was criticized for presiding over terror but he said 
things would be worse were it not for his presence 
in an effort to deprive the guerrillas of an issue the junta 
began what was envisioned as a radical land reform expropriating 
with compensation most of the countrys biggest farms and turning 
them into cooperatives 
the reform was a partial political success but it eventually 
bogged down because of organizational and production problems 
duarte popularly elected in 1984 promised his presidency would 
bring peace and with it prosperity but in three attempts at 
negotiations with the rebels he did not budge from the demand that 
they lay down their arms and join the political process something 
they are now considering in talks with the cristiani government 
but at the time the rebels contended conditions for democracy 
were absent in el salvador 
duarte who was fond of weather metaphors compared the war to a 
typhoon in a 1987 interview with the associated press 
mainly because of the war the economy crumbled the decline was 
hastened by droughts and a 1986 earthquake that killed an estimated 
1500 people and left tens of thousands homeless 
us economic and military aid reached nearly 2 million a day 
duartes ability to impress foreign leaders particularly 
members of the us congress and elicit aid was universally 
recognized but his opponents on both right and left decried what 
they called subservience to us influence 
even his supporters cringed when duarte at a white house 
ceremony before dozens of tv cameras kissed the us flag 
as he was being treated for cancer in washington in june 1988 
his stateoftherepublic address was read to the legislature 
aware of the gravity of his disease duarte offered an evaluation 
of his term 
the will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day 
more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents the 
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route 
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims he 
said

norwegian prime minister jan p syse proposed 
friday a 35nation north americaneuropean security conference 
today our task is to link the countries of europe all of 
them and north america so closely together that a return to the 
quarrels of the past can never take place he said in a speech to 
the national press club 
he predicted that there will be the unavoidable call in some 
european quarters for the dissolution of the north atlantic 
treaty alliance and the warsaw pact 
and there will be the calls on this side of the atlantic for 
bringing the troops home not some of them but all both views 
are equally dangerous 
he also said that intensified economic competition and the 
declining military threat could tempt us to focus more on what 
divides us and less on what unites us 
he suggested that the 12 countries of the european economic 
community join with norway and the five others that belong to the 
european free trade association to set up what he called a european 
economic space it could be a model for future relations between 
eastern and western europe he said 
earlier syse met privately for 30 minutes with president bush 
at the white house 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that the two 
leaders discussed eastwest relations maintaining the strength of 
nato german reunification arms control and european troop 
reduction

atlantis commander got over his 
cold friday but the weather remained bad forcing nasa to postpone 
for the third time the launch of the shuttle on its secret military 
mission 
shuttle managers slipped the launch 24 hours to sunday morning 
after weather forecasters predicted high winds and thunderstorms in 
the hours leading up to a saturday launch 
the forecasters said the cold front causing the problems would 
move out by sunday and there was an 80 percent chance of favorable 
weather at the scheduled liftoff time of about 1 am 
thats the best outlook so far for the shuttle mission which 
was originally scheduled for liftoff thursday 
the heavy rains and high winds would have prevented crews from 
pumping propellant into atlantis fuel tank for the fourday 
mission to put a spy satellite in orbit the craft requires more 
than a halfmillion gallons of fuel 
weather conditions continue to be unacceptable for fueling 
which would be required for a saturday morning launch attempt 
nasa said 
a mobile launch structure will remain around the shuttle to 
protect it from thunderstorms the space agency said 
despite the threatening weather atlantis commander john o 
creighton a navy captain and the shuttles pilot air force col 
john casper flew a training aircraft friday 
flight surgeons earlier in the day declared creighton fully 
recovered creighton and the four other crew members were found to 
be healthy during a routine medical exam tuesday but the commander 
complained of a sore throat the next day 
his illness along with predicted thunderstorms prompted nasa 
to postpone thursdays launch the agency decided on another 
24hour hold the next day for similar reasons but delayed 
saturdays launch solely due to weather 
each days delay costs 247000 in labor and materials that 
does not include expenses at other nasa centers supporting the 
mission 
the exact time of liftoff has not been announced by nasa because 
of the clandestine nature of the mission although the agency has 
said the shuttle will go up between midnight and 4 am the 
countdown will be kept secret until the final nine minutes before 
the rockets ignite 
sources report liftoff should occur about 1 am 
reports on the progress of the mission will be blacked out 
throughout the flight the silence will be lifted an hour before 
atlantis returns to earth for a landing at edwards air force base 
in california 
the shuttle will be carrying a spy satellite said to be capable 
of taking highresolution reconnaissance photos and of 
eavesdropping on electronic communications around the world 
according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
atlantis will be the 34th space shuttle mission and the sixth 
secret military mission

democratic leaders said friday that congress 
may consider cutting income taxes on uppermiddleclass 
families but raising taxes on the richest americans 
however house speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine acknowledged there is 
little congress can do to make the tax law more equitable unless 
president bush goes along 
theres not going to be a democratic lightcavalry charge on 
that tax issue mitchell told reporters 
foley said he thinks congress will consider ways to remove a 
feature of the 1986 tax law that imposes a lower marginal tax rate 
on the wealthiest people than is paid by those with somewhat less 
income 
the marginal rate is the rate paid on the next dollar earned 
for example under the new law a person with 150000 income would 
pay 330 tax on a 1000 pay raise while a person with 1 million 
income would pay 280 on the same raise 
adjusting the tax system to get rid of that quirk does not 
constitute necessarily a raising of taxes foley said that 
presumably means it would not violate bushs pledge not to raise 
taxes 
within a revenue neutrality that is without affecting the 
federal deficit you could perhaps provide a more equitable balance 
between tax rates paid by what i would call 
uppermiddleclassincome taxpayers and the very highestincome 
taxpayers foley said 
i dont think the top bracket will be raised above 33 
percent he said 
mitchell added for the first time in american history since 
the income tax was introduced the marginal rate at which income is 
taxed declines as income rises above a certain level 
winners in any such tax change would be single people with 
taxable incomes after exemptions and deductions between roughly 
45000 and 93100 and couples between 75000 and 155300 
higher taxes would be paid by singles above 93000 and couples 
above 155000 
foley and mitchell emphasized their irritation that bush and his 
predecessor ronald reagan have convinced the public that they 
will not accept higher taxes 
the best evidence of reagans political skill mitchell said 
was that he proposed supported and signed into law 13 tax 
increases yet convinced everyone in america that he was 
against all of them 
president bush has got the words down right but it remains to 
be seen if he has the political skill to pull off the same 
result mitchell said 
mitchell noted that bush approved a 6 billion net tax increase 
last year and in the budget he sent to congress last month 
proposed tax increases totaling 157 billion though no general 
increase in income taxes 
bush wants new taxes by anybodys definition foley said 
mitchell said that despite a big tax cut in 1981 federal taxes 
are about the same as 10 years ago and the butden has shifted from 
highincome to middleincome people it is that which we believe 
should be corrected he said

thousands of people rioted friday 
following the funeral for kenyas foreign minister attacking 
police with stones and smashing windows in the worst outbreak of 
violence since a 1982 coup attempt 
scores of people were injured and dozens arrested as nairobi 
police dispersed a huge crowd of wailing stonethrowing people 
mourning the mysterious death of robert ouko violence also was 
reported in the western city of kisumu his home where dozens were 
injured including at least three people shot by police 
by nightfall police and paramilitary units had dispersed 
demonstrators in nairobi and kisumu but were bracing for more 
trouble at oukos burial outside kisumu on saturday 
in nairobi cabinet ministers leading politicians and foreign 
envoys were caught up in the melee which erupted moments after 
president daniel arap moi left the church service 
thousands of people had gathered outside the suburban church for 
the funeral service for ouko whose charred body was found shot in 
the head on feb 16 he had been missing from his western kenya 
home for three days 
the crowd was largely quiet until the first mourners inside the 
church began to file out many of them weeping and ululating as 
the crowd outside joined in the moaning and crying police began to 
move it back 
the police action brought a hail of rocks sticks bottles and 
other missiles from the crowd riot police on hand in anticipation 
of trouble charged into the mourners chasing them through a 
nearby park and for nearly a mile to the citys center 
as the disturbance spread into the heart of the capital most of 
the stone throwing and taunting of police seemed to be taken up by 
large gangs of mostly young people many of them apparently 
unemployed day laborers 
cars were stoned and windows smashed throughout the city some 
minor looting was reported 
from nairobi oukos body was flown to kisumu a city on lake 
victoria that he represented in parliament there his casket was 
displayed on a low bier in the middle of a sports stadium on the 
outskirts of town 
thousands of mourners mostly from oukos luo tribe had been 
gathering outside the stadium since early morning when his body 
arrived in the afternoon they filed by the bier single file 
the trouble is that most of them did not get to see the 
body said a ranking police officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity when the first ones came out they incited the 
others 
roads in kisumu were blocked vehicles and buildings were set 
afire shop windows were smashed and cars were stoned 
ouko 58 was the fourth leading political figure to die 
violently since kenya gained independence in 1963 none of the 
three previous murders was solved and in each case the government 
of former president jomo kenyatta was accused of a coverup 
ouko also was the highestranking politician from the luo tribe 
one of four major ethnic groups in kenya that share and jockey for 
power in the singleparty government and engage in rivalries that 
go back centuries the other groups are the kikuyu the luya and 
the kalengen 
university students in nairobi began mostly peaceful 
demonstrations early in the week demanding an impartial 
investigation into oukos death the country was abuzz with rumors 
some linking the slaying to tribal rivalries 
mois government called in three scotland yard detectives and a 
british pathologist to assist the investigation in what was seen as 
an attempt to allay fears of a coverup only sketchy details of the 
inquiry have been released 
ouko appeared to be more popular in death than in life although 
considered one of the most articulate and able members of mois 
cabinet he kept largely out of the domestic political spotlight 
burial was to be near his family farm in koru about 40 miles 
from kisumu

ranchers have been warned that unless 
mountain snowpacks improve significantly the bureau of reclamation 
may issue an order for regulation of north platte river water in 
april 
but state engineer jeff fassett said the call which his 
office would have to approve likely would have little effect on 
north platte irrigators because it probably would last just a month 
fassett also added that his office could authorize irrigators 
this spring and summer to rotate or exchange water allocations in 
order to make the most of it 
officials with the us bureau of reclamation are being 
pressured by downstream irrigators with rights to water from burec 
projects to order the call on the water the engineer said 
theres no doubt the word call on the river has come up 
fassett told a meeting of the upper north platte water users 
association 
last winter fassett and the burec issued another call on the 
water the first time such an order had come in the winter in the 
history of state regulation on the river 
issuing a similar call this april can only be avoided if the 
area receives huge aboveaverage snowpacks that will fill 
downstream reservoirs fassett said at the meeting wednesday 
he noted that this year marks the secondlowest carryover of 
stored water in the north platte drainage in the last 35 years and 
the area is going into its fourth straight dry year with snowpacks 
of just 70 percent to 80 percent 
but fassett said burec officials arent likely to decide whether 
to issue the call until after the march snowpack and streamflow 
predictions are available 
he also noted that the call cannot extend beyond may 1 because 
of stipulations included in the north platte decree a 1945 us 
decision that established provisions for use of north platte flows 
in nebraska wyoming and colorado 
if a call is made this year it will be to regulate other river 
water users in favor of the 1904 water rights tied to pathfinder 
reservoir and the downstream irrigation districts the federal 
project serves 
that would mean all water usually claimed for junior water 
rights those dated after the agreement would first have to go 
to fill the pathfinder right 
looking ahead to the summer fassett said north platte 
irrigators may have to face the prospect of borrowing water but so 
far state officials are not encouraging such loans 
fassett noted that the burec would require extensive 
environmental evaluation before allowing the loans 
last year water loans to irrigation districts generated heated 
controversy over states rights and led to a lawsuit filed against 
the burec by the state of wyoming the goshen irrigation district 
and the casperalcova irrigation district

daffodils are blooming and fruit trees are budding 
as england enjoys the warmest february since the american 
revolution and the fifthwarmest winter on record 
fridays high of 65 degrees fahrenheit tied a record for the 
date and the coldest temperature all winter was 37 degrees on new 
years day 
if you ask me if there is a greenhouse effect it hasnt been 
proved to my satisfaction but if this is what its like then im 
all for it said ken graves secretary of the royal national rose 
society 
outside graves office in the quiet cathedral town of st 
albans 20 miles north of london buds are forming on a gloire de 
dijon rose and a bit of color is already peeking through 
those who believe that global warming has arrived will note that 
last winter was even warmer in england skeptics might note that 
the winter of 1686 was just as warm and that thursdays high 
temperature was matched in 1961 
the average temperature in central england this month has been 
45 degrees 7 degrees warmer than normal and the hottest february 
since 1779 when the average was 46 degrees 
there have been but four warmer winters since england started 
keeping records in 1659 said barry parker of the meteorological 
office this winters average temperature of 43 degrees since dec 
1 has been exceeded only in 1834 1869 1975 and 1989 
i would much prefer a good hard frost for several days 
parker said there will be plagues of things going around my 
garden in the summer warm winters have brought a boom in the 
population of garden pests 
graves knows all about the anxieties of gardeners after a second 
straight winter without ice 
we get no end of correspondence at this time of year and over 
the telephone oh dear oh dear my roses have made all these 
long new shoots what shall i do 
prune as normal and forget the new growth graves advises 
the mild winter has thrown time out of whack daffodils that 
come before the swallow dares and take the winds of march with 
beauty as shakespeare had it in the winters tale are 
already blooming in some gardens 
there are some varieties flowering rather precociously said 
jim pearce president of the daffodil society 
theres a variety named february gold i think it was 
rather optimistically named because this is only the second time 
anyone can remember it flowering in february he said from his 
home in colchester in eastern england 
warm weather may be a problem for some of the hundreds of flower 
shows held around the country usually in april pearce said if 
they are entirely daffodils theyre not on a safety streak are 
they 
the royal horticultural society has an early show april 34 and 
its main daffodil show on april 25 
it certainly looks as though the early show is going to be the 
main even this time subject of course to a debacle in the 
present climatic conditions pearce said

the justice department said today it will ask 
the supreme court to review a federal judges finding that a law 
congress passed last year to ban flag burning is unconstitutional 
chief spokesman david runkel said the justice department would 
file a notice in seattle federal court today of its intention to 
appeal wednesdays ruling by a judge there 
runkel said the government will then have 30 days to file its 
brief in the high court 
the law that forbids desecretion of the flag provides for a 
direct appeal of its constitutionality from federal district court 
to the supreme court 
while the bush administration has in the past supported a 
constitutionalamendment to ban flag burning runkel said the 
justice department now has a duty to defend the law enacted by 
congress 
the law was passed after the supreme court last year struck down 
a texas statute that provided criminal penalties for flag burning 
i believe the supreme court will reaffirm that the principles 
for which the flag stands include the freedom to dissent said 
david cole an attorney who represented defendants in the seattle 
case 
backers of a constitutional ban on flag burning say wednesdays 
ruling shows congress didnt go far enough when it outlawed flag 
desecration 
but opponents of writing the prohibition into the constitution 
said the real test would come when the case goes to the supreme 
court 
i wouldnt get too worked up about a district court ruling 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine its what 
we all expected 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he remained 
convinced the law would be upheld by the supreme court 
whatever the outcome is i do not favor a constitutional 
amendment foley said i believe it would be wrong to amend the 
first amendment 
us district judge barbara rothstein in seattle ruled wednesday 
the new federal law against flag desecration is unconstitutional 
and dismissed flagburning charges against four people she said 
the right to destroy the flag was as protected as the right to wave 
it 
the case involved four people who challenged the flagprotection 
law immediately after it went into effect last october by burning a 
us flag outside a seattle post office 
lawyers for three other flagburners argued before a federal 
judge in washington on thursday that she should follow rothsteins 
lead that case involved defendants who burned a flag in a protest 
on the steps of the us capitol 
attorneys for congress likened the law to the ban on burning 
draft cards which was upheld by courts during the vietnam war 
charles tiefer deputy counsel for the house clerks office said 
flagburning was not mere speech 
democrats in congress used the statutory ban to head off efforts 
by republicans and the bush administration to pass a constitutional 
amendment 
the debate followed last summers ruling by the supreme court 
striking down as unconstitutional a texas law that banned flag 
desecration 
supporters of the constitutional route promised to renew their 
efforts 
this decision vindicates those of us who wanted to fix this 
thing and have the states take up the question of protecting the 
flag properly said rep chuck douglas rnh the way to do it 
is by a constitutional amendment and there is nothing short of 
that 
the chairman of the senate judiciary committee sen joseph r 
biden jr ddel said he still believed the supreme court would 
uphold the 1989 law as constitutional 
the fact remains that the flag protection law is 
constitutional until the supreme court says that it is not biden 
said 
i can assure these seattle flagburners that if they will just 
go and live in tehran iran my kentucky constituents will be glad 
to buy them oneway airline tickets rep carroll hubbard dky 
told a nearly empty house chamber 
he denounced malicious flagburning by those who hate the 
united states but enjoy living here

east germany may be too divided after 
the march elections to agree on a government and could opt for 
immediate union with west germany a cabinet minister said in a 
newspaper report published friday 
die welt of bonn said interior minister wolfgang schaeuble 
expressed his theory to us officials ministry officials 
confirmed the account 
east germanys economic crisis has accelerated in recent weeks 
forcing the government to end food subsidies and prompting 
speculation it is near bankruptcy 
german reunification and the economic and political questions 
it poses are expected to dominate discussions this weekend when 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany meets with president bush at 
camp david md 
according to die welt schaeuble told secretary of state james 
a baker iii and brent scowcroft the national security adviser 
that east germanys first free elections may not produce a 
leadership that could agree on an economic rescue plan 
it is conceivable that there will be no more east german 
government after march 18 he said 
several recent polls however have indicated east germanys 
social democrats will win more than 50 percent of the vote 
communist candidates are expected to fare badly because of the 
onceomnipotent partys role in creating the economic crisis 
premier hans modrow the most trusted communist politician has not 
decided whether to lead the party ticket 
prodemocracy opposition parties are numerous poorly organized 
and inexperienced which has led to a neartakeover by sister 
parties in west germany 
the 400member parliament to be elected march 18 vote is 
supposed to choose a government to succeed modrows transitional 
administration if the seats are spread too broadly among the many 
parties members may be unable to agree on a leadership that could 
work with bonn on an economic recovery plan 
schaeuble said he considered an inconclusive vote the more 
probable outcome of the elections die welt said 
interior ministry spokesman willi hausmann who confirmed the 
account said schaeuble outlined several possible unification plans 
during a visit to washington 
die welt said he met with baker and scowcroft to discuss 
antidrug policies but the us officials were more interested in 
discussing german reunification 
one of the most critical decisions will be the exchange rate of 
east german marks for the west german currency 
kohl has offered to make the deutschmark the official currency 
of both nations in return for capitalist reforms effectively 
creating a single economy 
economic experts are discussing how the west german mark should 
be made legal tender for both but no decision on monetary union 
can be made until after the east german elections 
a 1to1 conversion rate probably would cause rampant inflation 
because of the unusually large savings of east germans who have 
had few goods to buy 
dieter vogel the west german government spokesman discounted a 
newspaper report friday that bonn had decided on 1to1 he said a 
committee studying economic union still was the factfinding 
stage 
the newspaper said schaeuble explained to the us officials 
that article 23 of the west german constitution known as the basic 
law allows the legislature of any german region to decide to merge 
with west germany 
article 23 doesnt envision the involvement of west germany 
in the decision on merging schaeuble said 
no referendum in either german state would be necessary if 
article 23 was used die welt said 
a parliamentary vote soon after the elections to join west 
germany probably would outpace the twoplusfour negotiations 
proposed by the world war ii allies 
the two germanys plus the soviet union the united states 
britain and france agreed last week in ottawa canada to negotiate 
external aspects of german unity soon after the east german 
elections 
schaeuble gave washington what was tantamount to an assurance 
bonn does not seek to regain territory lost to poland and the 
soviet union after world war ii the paper indicated 
it quoted him as saying a transitional legislature would have to 
be created after any decision by east germany to merge and that 
body could recognize the polish border 
recognition of the boundary between with poland has become a 
major issue because kohl has not committed himself to the current 
frontier which follows the oder and neisse rivers 
about onethird of poland was german territory before world war 
ii

the president of arianespace said friday a 
panel of experts will be named to determine why an ariane rocket 
exploded shortly after takeoff and to reassure customers of its 
reliability 
frederic dallest head of the european consortium said he 
hoped the failure thursday of the unmanned ariane 44lor would not 
destroy customer confidence in arianespace which holds more than 
half the worlds commercial satellite business 
while the investigation is under way all ariane launches will 
be suspended dallest told a news conference at the space center 
in kourou french guiana the news conference was also relayed to 
reporters at arianespace headquarters in evry near paris 
twelve to 15 experts will be named to investigate the incident 
and issue a report within two months giving all the details of 
our findings so they clients can be comfortable that we can 
resume flights safely dallest said 
if the cause is clear and precise and the problem corrected 
we should rapidly regain the confidence of our clients he said 
the rocket was carrying two telecommunications satellites for 
the japan broadcasting corp and space communications corp when it 
exploded over the atlantic ocean about 7 miles from the launch pad 
at kourou 
the investigative panel to be appointed early next week must 
determine why one of four strapon boosters that power the rocket 
experienced a sudden drop in pressure just 62 seconds after the 
end of the countdown 
the automatic pilot then ordered two of the other boosters to 
increase power to compensate for the one that failed but at 30 
seconds the pressure plummeted in a motor in the body of the 
rocket adjacent to the booster 
at 90 seconds technicians realized the rocket was out of 
control and 11 seconds later the rocket blew apart 
debris from the vehicle rained over the coast and the iles du 
salut just off shore but no injuries were reported 
winds blowing from the east carried a cloud of the fuel back to 
land forcing the launch staff and the 12000 residents of kourou 
indoors until it passed some residents complained of burning eyes 
and sore throats 
french police and soldiers conducted an air search friday along 
the beach for debris from the rocket 
witnesses who saw the flight on the video monitors at evry said 
the rocket appeared slightly off course from the start and passed 
unexpectedly close above the support scaffolding as it rose with 
flame from one of the boosters burning the structure 
officials said the rocket may have touched the scaffolding but 
there was no indication this caused the explosion 
frances space minister paul quilles said the explosion should 
cast no shadows over the ariane program which he noted had had an 
exceptional run with 17 successful flights in a row 
arianespace competes with the us commercial launch industry 
the united states depended on its space shuttles to launch 
commercial satellites until the challenger exploded on jan 28 
1986 since then three major american aerospace companies martin 
marietta mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics have been 
developing and launching commercial satellites 
but with its earlier start ariane has captured more than 50 
percent of the market and it drew business from the american 
program after the challenger explosion 
the launch was the 36th ariane mission since the first flight in 
the unmanned space program overseen by the european space agency 
was held dec 24 1979 it was the first explosion since the 18th 
ariane flight on may 31 1986 and the first of the 4 series 
after the explosion in 1986 ariane suspended all launches for 
15 months to correct a basic design problem dallest said he had 
confidence that there is no fundamental design problem with the 
rockets engines and he hoped that launches could resume quickly 
since the last failure flights had become almost routine 
successful missions have been held on the rate of about one per 
month with 43 satellites launched since the commercial program got 
under way in 1981 
another 32 are scheduled with a contract value of 236 billion 
the thursday night launch of the two communications satellites 
marked the first time an ariane mission carried an alljapanese 
payload 
one the bs2k was built by us company general electrics 
aerospace division to direct broadcasting for japans national nhk 
television network 
the second built by ford aerospace was owned by mitsubishis 
subsidiary space communications corp to channel telephone 
telegraph and telex messages 
the bs2k satellite was insured for 150 million to 180 million 
arianespace said while the superbird b was insured for about 60 
million 
in tokyo yoshiro nakamura chief technician for nhk said the 
failure was very disappointing but nhk would continue to cooperate 
with arianespace

comedian redd foxx was paid 500000 for his 
role in the movie harlem nights and spent 373000 of it on 
wine women song and gambling the internal revenue service

such expenditures make it unlikely the irs can reach agreement 
with foxx on his tax troubles irs attorney rollin thorley told a 
federal bankruptcy judge thursday 
foxx who gained fame playing a junk dealer on the tv show 
sanford and son and currently performs at a las vegas resort 
filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
bankruptcy law in 1983 he owes the irs more than 900000 in 
taxes penalties and interest 
the earnings on the recent movie were revealed as foxx appeared 
in court to try to block a public auction of more than 400 items of 
personal property seized in an irs raid in november 
the items including his las vegas home several cars and 
jewelry were to be sold last month the sale was delayed while a

on the campaign trail president 
daniel ortega comes across like a combination rock star game show 
host and evangelical politician 
it is a dramatic change in image for a man so serious so 
earnest about his country his revolution and his job that even 
close friends say he can be boring 
but behind the slick new facade still simmer the old class 
resentments the anger and the hunger that carried ortega to the 
pinnacle of nicaraguan power 
ortega the candidate has swapped his trademark olivedrab 
uniforms for flashy sports shirts and his owlish glasses for 
contact lenses 
he dances at campaign rallies with beauty queens and tosses 
baseballs he kisses babies and poses for photos he presses flesh 
and dispenses onthespot patronage with a boldness that could 
shame even a seasoned chicago pol 
this new style reflects in part a man more confident of his 
own hold on power and more comfortable with crowds than the 
scruffy strident young revolutionary who marched in managua more 
than a decade ago 
but it is also the product of slick celebrity packaging 
the sandinista campaign sells ortega 44 the way madison avenue 
pitches the latest youthoriented commodity emphasizing the 
contrast with his main challenger the whitehaired publisher 
violeta barrios de chamorro 60 
his picture adorns tshirts billboards and posters bearing 
slogans such as daniel president of the young or daniel is 
love 
the image is one thing the words are another 
ortegas rhetoric is harsh and his campaign speeches hammer on 
the sandinistas main challenger the united national opposition 
like a power drill 
uno ortega insists is one and the same as the hated and feared 
national guard that defended anastasio somozas dictatorship until 
it fell in the 1979 revolution in which the sandinistas took power 
gnuno he says uniting the spanish acronym for the long 
defunct guard and the coalition is death is treason 
its leaders he says represent the affluent class that put up 
with the somoza family dictatorship for 45 years lining their 
pockets in the process 
he got so wound up in a recent speech that he threatened to 
confiscate mrs chamorros house and turn it into a child center 
and shut down her daily la prensa the only opposition newspaper in 
nicaragua 
at moments like this the tough angry kid who was running 
antimilitary street gangs and marching in antisomoza 
demonstrations when he was in his early teens shows through 
his commonlaw wife of 12 years the flamboyant poet rosario 
murillo told the miami herald recently that ortega has never shed 
his revolutionary asceticism 
hes like a monk said murillo who refuses to discuss 
rumors they will split up after the election 
ortega grew up steeped in antiamerican resentments forged by 
the nearly continuous marine occupation of nicaragua between 1921 
and 1933 and by the us role in installing the somoza family 
dictatorship both parents served time in jail for antisomoza 
activities 
in an interview last year with the associated press ortega said 
his greatest achievement in a decade of power was fending off us 
attempts to topple the sandinista revolution 
the cost of the war with usbacked contra rebels and the 
economic embargo he said had been immense but the reality is 
that the revolution is here 
ortega became a sandinista when he was 18 leaving law school to 
join the tiny clandestine marxist movement in 1963 by 1966 he 
had had six months of guerrilla training in cuba and was 
masterminding bank robberies to raise money for the cause 
by 1967 he was in prison for killing a national guard officer 
lamenting in a nowfamous poem that he never got to see managua 
when miniskirts were in style 
he was freed after seven years when sandinista commandos 
kidnapped a group of prominent citizens the hostages were traded 
for 25 jailed sandinistas who were flown to cuba 
ortega came home from cuba in 1975 and when somoza fell in 1979 
he became head of the ruling junta that took over he became 
president in 1984 elections and rose to a dominant position in the 
sandinista leadership that position is shored up by his brother 
humberto who serves as defense minister 
mrs chamorro the widow of somozas most outspoken critic 
pedro joaquin chamorro served with ortega on the junta but 
resigned after nine months later she said the sandinistas had 
betrayed their promise of a pluralistic democratic nicaragua 
those old promises haunt nicaragua and should ortega lose 
sundays election his word will be put to the test anew 
daniel ortega could become a real historical figure if he were 
to peacefully hand over power to dona violeta he could go down in 
the history of latin american revolutionary movements said 
alfredo cesar mrs chamorros chief strategist 
we have lots of guys in latin america who refuse to hand over 
power if he didnt hed be just one more little dictator but he 
has a chance to make history 
ortega shows no sign he plans to confront defeat 
the people have already voted he tells his audiences 
confidently i speak to you as the presidentelect

in an interview tape recorded just 
hours after the nations worst oil spill tanker captain joseph 
hazelwood denied drinking heavily but said he had a phony beer 
on the ship and a real beer before he sailed 
hazelwoods interview with a state trooper the morning after his 
ship ran aground was played for jurors in a hushed courtroom this 
morning his words were muffled because of the tape quality but 
jurors were given a typed transcript to follow along 
also today the trooper heard on the tape michael fox 
testified that he found more than 100 empty bottles of a brand of a 
verylowalcohol beer on the ship after the grounding 
on the tape hazelwood described how the accident occurred and 
was asked by fox whether he had been consuming alcohol 
well i had one of these phony beers moussy and id been 
ashore i had lunch with captain murphy drank iced tea 
hazelwood replied 
the trooper asked whether hazelwood had anything to drink before 
going back to the ship the skipper said he stopped to pick up 
pizza for other crew members and later had a beer with a piece 
of pizza 
hazelwood of huntington ny is charged with seconddegree 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil 
the exxon valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude oil blackening hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and 
killing countless birds fish and wildlife exxon has spent some 2 
billion trying to clean up the mess 
on the tape hazelwood was asked whether he stopped at any bars 
in valdez during his time ashore and said we went by the 
pipeline to see if anybody off the ship was in there if we knew 
anybody but he said he drank nothing there 
several witnesses have testified that hazelwood drank vodka at 
the pipeline club that afternoon but there is a dispute about how 
much he drank and when 
earlier fox testified he found empty bottles of moussy a brand 
of brew with 05 percent alcohol on the exxon valdez when 
authorities returned to search the tanker about a week after it ran 
aground there were a lot of them over 100 he said 
fox said he went to the ship to look for evidence of hard liquor 
in the captains quarters but didnt find any he told jurors he 
also went through a lot of trash it would fill this room 
a product like moussy with a halfpercent or less of alcohol is 
categorized under the law as nonalcoholic in fact 
manufacturers are not even allowed to call the products beer but 
must describe them as a brew regular beer has between 35 and 
4 percent alcohol by volume 
other witnesses have said that the verylowalcohol beer was 
allowed aboard ships by exxon which forbids any other alcohol 
on thursday fox testified that he boarded the grounded exxon 
valdez expecting to stop a drunken brawl and found instead a dark 
quiet ship where everyone was gazing out the windows 
they said the captain was drunk and they wanted me to take 
care of it fox testified at hazelwoods criminal trial in state 
court but when he met the skipper he said hazelwood didnt seem 
intoxicated 
he said hazelwood 43 was napping when he arrived about four 
hours after the tanker hit a reef they met about an hour later for 
the first time 
i said well what the heck is the problem fox said and 
hazelwood replied with his muchquoted comment youre looking at 
it 
the defense is expected to contend that the smell some witnesses 
detected on hazelwoods breath was the low alcohol beer and that he 
drank it after the accident 
coast guard lt cmdr thomas falkenstein testified thursday that 
he smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath when he met the skipper 
adding it was an obvious smell 
but his testimony was challenged by hazelwood lawyer michael 
chalos who played for jurors a videotape of falkensteins remarks 
on television 
i never talked to him facetoface like were talking he 
told connie chung of cbs during an interview it was sidebyside 
and staring out at the pilot house across the deck we were close 
2 feet and i smelled alcohol in and around the area 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney brent cole asked 
whether anyone else was in the area when falkenstein smelled 
liquor he answered no 
chalos asked whether the captain appeared impaired or 
intoxicated 
that was the first time i had met capt hazelwood said the 
witness i saw no signs of impairment 
jurors also watched a section of the tv show in which 
falkenstein described hazelwoods mood after the disaster 
he was lucid but sullen like a man whod seen his career go 
down the tubes falkenstein said

a cat is avenging her species 
goldie a tiger cat is so tough she has every dog in the 
neighborhood on the run so her owner kenneth mercure posted a 
sign soon after goldie came to stay that warns dogs beware of 
the cat 
i was afraid she would attack a nice dog a valuable one 
and i dont want a lawsuit said mercure 69 
mercure has seen wise dogs cross the street well before reaching 
his house and cross back well after theyve passed it he said 
maybe the dogs can read the sign i dont know he said 
other dogs suffer for their ignorance one hapless canine 
followed a letter carrier into the yard and goldie chased it away 
mercure said 
i guess he didnt get the hint because he came back mercure 
said she went around the side of the house and got him he 
doesnt follow the mailman anymore 
goldie adopted the mercures after her former owners moved out of 
a nearby house and left her behind mercure guessed she was about 4 
years old 
not all dogs attract goldies ire three small dogs live next 
door and are quite friendly with the feline 
they sometimes touch noses through the fence he said 
terrorizing strange dogs however seems almost a mission 
weve had lots of cats but ive never seen a cat like her 
mercure said i dont know why shes like this maybe she was 
abused

young violeta barrios wanted to learn 
to type and be a secretary when she grew up 
instead she married a man who became one of nicaraguas 
revolutionary heroes and as a steel grayhaired widow of 60 she 
finds herself the political symbol at the center of an electoral 
storm 
despite a rocky start a broken knee and political naivete 
violeta barrios de chamorro has run for president with gusto and a 
common touch 
she has managed despite her handicaps to lead the strongest 
challenge to president daniel ortega and his leftist sandinista 
party in their 10 years of rule 
i am nothing dona violeta as she is called even by ortega 
said in an in interview but in this life you can learn 
anything 
an elegant woman with graceful manners mrs chamorros two main 
strengths are her martyred husband and her lack of alignment with 
any one political party 
that was enough to qualify her as a candidate for the disparate 
and fractious united national opposition a coalition of 14 parties 
known as uno 
the memory of pedro joaquin chamorro has been used by all sides 
even by mrs chamorros four children two of whom support ortega 
my fathers enemies are within uno wrote mrs chamorros 
eldest daughter claudia the phrase was used in sandinista 
campaign graffiti throughout nicaragua 
mrs chamorros late husband whose father started what is today 
nicaraguas sole opposition newspaper la prensa was shot down by 
assassins in january 1978 
the slaying believed to have been ordered by dictator anastasio 
somoza ignited the popular revolt that brought the sandinistas to 
power in july 1979 
mrs chamorro who still publishes la prensa became a member of 
the junta that took over from somoza but quit after nine months 
she has bitter memories of what she considers the sandinistas 
betrayal of her husbands democratic goals and her own faith in the 
revolution 
im not praising somozas government it was horrible but the 
threats that ive had from the sandinistas i never thought they 
would repay me in that way she said 
her pain as a widow strong religous convictions and loyalty to 
chamorros memory she pays weekly visits to his grave to leave 
fresh flowers made her a symbol of dissatisfaction with the 
sandinistas but there have been many drawbacks 
even after months of campaigning she stumbled over speeches and 
made baffling blunders last year during a trip to europe she was 
asked about unos government program 
its a secret she replied 
the sandinistas have tried to paint mrs chamorro as an 
emptyheaded figurehead a progovernment newspaper runs a daily 
column where nearly every joke portrays her as slowwitted 
perhaps responding to this mrs chamorro told a rally early in 
the campaign i am not a dummy 
one of her top advisers is her eldest son pedro joaquin 
chamorro who returned from exile in miami where he had been a 
director of the usbacked contra rebels who tried to topple 
ortegas government by force 
the son feared his mother would be manipulated by vice 
presidential candidate virgilio godoy and top aide alfredo cesar 
two strongwilled politicians 
mrs chamorro the eldest daughter of a landowning family was 
sent to us finishing schools to learn english 
i love math i wanted to be a secretary learn to type mrs 
chamorro said 
with her fathers death in 1948 she returned to the family home 
in the southern town of rivas and married chamorro 
her political awakening came after years of being a housewife 
and mother 
on one of the various occasions chamorro was imprisoned by 
somoza mrs chamorro blew up at being kept in the dark 
there had been something political and they threw him in 
jail mrs chamorro said i asked pedro what was going on then 
i told him look lets make a deal from today on youre going 
to tell me all thats happening so i wont be caught unaware 
she has played the role of presidential candidate with gusto 
hampered by a cast on her fractured knee she was at ease being 
before crowds in her wheelchair under a sun tent in back of a 
pickup truck 
beaming smiles at peasants dona violeta was familiar and 
neighborly calling people papito and mamita 
i try to help to do good things for the country mrs 
chamorro said i am what i am

the white house was urged friday to go 
slow on normalizing relations with nicaragua in the event of a 
sandinista victory with two prominent observers citing the 
possibility for fraud in sundays election 
sen richard lugar rind and allen weinstein president of 
the independent monitoring organization the center for democracy 
said nicaragua is using a teletype system to transmit voting 
results that opens opportunities for the sandinistas to engage in 
fraud 
weinstein also complained that the leftist sandinista government 
has blocked delegations from honduras and costa rica that were to 
join the centers observation efforts at the sunday election 
in addition weinstein said the government has barred observers 
from the center from going in and out of precincts to watch the 
vote count has denied visas for additional staff members in the 
centers managua office and has denied visas for two dozen us 
democratic and republican political leaders to join its monitoring 
operation 
the center montored elections in panama and the philippines and 
has been in nicaragua since april at the invitation of both the 
sandinista government and the main political opposition group 
lugar was named by president bush to head a bipartisan 
congressional team of election observers but managua denied them 
entry on the grounds that they represented a government that 
supports the opposition 
lugar said he has no idea whether the election process has 
been free and fair and that he is not confident at all that 
the monitoring process will be adequate to insure that outcome 
the chain of observation has been broken because there will 
not be monitoring of the transfer of voting results to teletype 
centers that will relay them to managua he said 
the presidents got to make some tough decisions on what 
occurs here lugar told reporters after he and weinstein met with 
vice president dan quayle my advice would be to go slow in the 
process were going to have to sift out a good bit of what 
occurs 
us officials have said that if ortega won a free and fair 
election the bush administration would consider normalizing 
relations with managua as long as other conditions are fulfilled 
as well those include cessation of exporting arms to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador and honoring human rights 
secretary of state james a baker iii told a congressional 
committee thursday he would require a sustained period of 
refraining from support for the salvadoran rebels and would impose 
stiff conditions before agreeing to normalized relations 
quayle on friday said the administration will be paying very 
close attention to the fairness of the election he reiterated 
administration criticisms of nicaragua for denying visas to bushs 
observer delegation and other wouldbe observers 
obviously daniel ortega has been very selective on who he has 
allowed into the country quayle told reporters if you have a 
viewpoint perhaps not entirely sympathetic to daniel ortega you are 
denied entry into nicaragua 
but he added we will reserve judgment until all the 
information is in 
besides weinsteins group other observer teams allowed into 
nicaragua include one headed by former president carter and two 
under the auspices of the united nations and the organization of 
american states 
meanwhile the executive committee of the interamerican 
dialogue a panel of prominent hemispheric leaders called for 
normalization of relations if sundays elections are honest 
if there is an undisputed sandinista victory the panel said the 
united states should assist in the repatriation and resettlement of 
the contra rebels lift the us trade embargo against nicaragua 
and join multilateral aid efforts 
the groups codirector former ambassador sol linowitz told a 
news conference that if the election is not free and fair this 
calls for a wholly different approach 
on capitol hill house speaker thomas s foley dwash said 
the administration should find ways to recognize the new 
government as long as if ortega wins he shows commitment to 
maintaining the spirit of a free election and permitting the 
normal accepted political activities to continue in the country

first the good news a creamy concoction that 
lowers the fat in frozen desserts is healthier than ice cream 
loaded with butterfat 
but nutritionists warn that a fat substitute isnt a magic 
elixir it wont let consumers obsessed with diet and 
weightcontrol indulge their sweet tooth free of worry 
dont get carried away thinking you can eat this stuff for 
lunch fatfree ice cream is not a substitute for apples or 
broccoli said bonnie liebman director of nutrition for the 
center for science in the public interest 
i want to make sure that people dont go overboard thinking 
these new foods are nutritious she said friday basically 
were talking about junk food without the fat its less harmful 
than what its replacing but its still junk food 
simplesse made from egg whites and milk was spooned out 
thursday as the first fat substitute to win approval from the food 
and drug administration 
nutrasweet co a subsidiary of monsanto co plans to market it 
in seven flavors of a frozen dessert called simple pleasures a 
4ounce serving has 1 gram of fat and 120 calories compared with 5 
grams of fat and 130 calories in regular ice cream and 15 grams of 
fat and 250 calories in superpremium ice creams such as 
haagendazs 
simplesse means we can now enjoy all the rich creamy taste of 
foods without the fat without the calories without the worry 
and without the guilt said robert shapiro nutrasweets chairman 
and chief executive 
but experts are concerned that imitation ice cream with less fat 
could encourage people to eat more portions or load up on other 
foods high in fat rather than food with vitamins minerals and 
fiber 
it sounds like the perfect answer but its not said marion 
nestle professor of nutrition at new york university and managing 
editor of the surgeon generals recent report on health and 
nutrition 
putting a substance in ice cream doesnt address the 
underlying issue people dont eat enough fruits vegetables and 
grain she said i dont think this is going to reduce 
americas dietary intake of fat this isnt about nutrition its 
about improving the financial health of monsanto 
financial experts predict simplesse could fetch 500 million a 
year for monsanto it cannot be used in frying or baking however 
because it congeals at higher temperatures 
nutritionists say the new product might follow trends of 
artificial sweeteners 
they were touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption but sugar 
intake has increased to 132 pounds from 118 pounds per person per 
year since 1975 and four times as many sugar substitutes were 
consumed in the same time according to the center for science in 
the public interest 
will fat substitutes be a substitute for fat or will people 
just eat more doublescoop ice cream cones said lisa lefferts a 
staff scientist for the public watchdog group 
its one step in the right direction but its only a step 
said dr scott grundy director of the center for human nutrition 
at the university of texas 
fat tops every nutritionists list of things to reduce in the 
diet americans now get an average of 37 percent of their calories 
from fats and most experts recommend lowering that to no more than 
30 percent 
the surgeon generals report said its top priority is lowering 
the intake of saturated fat from such foods as hamburgers steak 
cheese butter pastries and french fries 
too much fat causes obesity increases the risk of heart 
diseases and may increase the risk of breast and colon cancers 
according to reports by the american heart association the 
american cancer society and the national cholesterol education 
program 
fat is the single worst thing about the average americans 
diet said ms liebman for the average person you couldnt 
possibly get too little fat if you tried

the interior ministry said friday it was placing 
onethird more police on duty nationwide to keep order amid 
widespread fears of violence at weekend street protests but 
organizers rejected an appeal to call off their peaceful february 
revolution 
teachers warned children to stay off moscow streets on sunday 
when the rallies are scheduled and doctors who normally have the 
day off were told to report to work capital residents said 
the official news agency tass said meetings were held at moscow 
businesses friday to emphasize the need to prevent destabilization 
rumors of impending violence swept the country in advance of 
sundays planned prodemocracy rallies and counterdemonstrations 
but spokesmen for the interior ministry and kgb security police 
said they had no reason to believe them some groups however 
responded by canceling rallies 
the nationwide demonstrations grew out of the success of a 
protest feb 4 when tens of thousands of people paraded through 
moscow demanding the communist party give up its grip on power 
three days later led by president mikhail s gorbachev the 
party central committee voted to renounce its constitutional 
monopoly on power paving the way for a multiparty democracy 
organizers yuri afanasyev and gavriil popov both 
parliamentarians said in leaflets distributed friday on moscows 
pushkin square that sundays rallies for radical democratic 
changes are in line with public protests that have led to ousters 
of more than a dozen local party chiefs nationwide 
a peaceful february revolution started by a 
halfmillionstrong manifestation feb 4 in moscow is 
continuing the leaflets said 
sunday is the anniversary of the february revolution the 1917 
popular uprising that drove czar nicolas ii from the throne for 
many russian progressives opposed to the communist party it marks 
the shortlived triumph of russian democracy since the bolsheviks 
seized power eight months later 
andrei protsenko of the peoples front in the southern russian 
city of rostovondon said his group had planned a rally sunday but 
authorities outlawed it the group decided to cancel because it 
feared government provocations and being blamed for any violence 
he said 
leningrad peoples front leaders said they would not take part 
in an officially sanctioned rally sunday because they also feared 
provocations either from the government or rightwing groups 
dominated by russian nationalists who favor orthodox communism 
in azerbaijan where a state of emergency was imposed following 
bloody ethnic attacks on armenians and an army assault to dislodge 
nationalists from the capital of baku yusis samed oglu of the 
peoples front said no rallies were planned out of fear that 
soldiers would use force 
the soviet interior ministry which includes riot squads and 
police has canceled days off sunday for many of its workers and 
17000 of them will be on duty in moscow alone said spokesman 
arkady bronin 
he estimated that nationwide onethird more interior ministry 
workers than normal will be on duty he did not have the total 
figure 
the government launched a massive campaign to head off trouble 
staterun media throughout the day repeated a communist party 
appeal for soviets to avoid chaos during the rallies and two 
members of the ruling politburo spoke out 
in a special primetime tv broadcast premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
said the government understood the peoples frustrations because 
they cant live normally but emphasized law and order were 
vital 
we are not only concerned but we are taking and will take 
very strict measures to keep order in the limits of the law 
everyone must answer in accordance with the law ryzhkov said 
the cabinet that ryzhkov heads the council of ministers issued 
an order instructing police and governing bodies to prevent 
extremist and criminal elements from provoking disorder 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev told the government daily 
izvestia that rallies were not the way to press for change 
to elect authority on the streets is not democracy but 
arbitrary rule ignoring the people yakovlev said 
afanasyev told a news conference the sunday rally in moscow was

air force secretary donald rice said in a 
letter released friday that a congressional report contending his 
service had grossly understated the costs of major weapons was 
hypercritical and inflammatory 
the report offers a narrow cpas view of the information 
needed for defense decisionmaking that has limited relationship to 
the real problems of defense management rice said in an angry 
threepage letter to the head of the general accounting office 
charles bowsher 
for his part bowsher told a senate committee friday that the 
air forces accounting system fails to provide accurate cost data 
for almost 80 percent of its weapons inventory and equipment 
we roughly estimate that equipment and missiles are misstated 
by billions of dollars and aircraft and inventories are misstated 
by tens of billions of dollars he told the senate governmental 
affairs committee 
bowsher testified as the gao released its 109page audit of the 
air forces accounting and financial management system the 
associated press and other news organizations had reported the 
gaos findings thursday based on a draft of the report 
testifying at the hearing called after the draft became public 
bowsher said the air force has resources totaling about 275 
billion and receives about 90 billion in annual appropriations 
the gao concluded that the air force had understated the cost of 
the b1 bomber by 71 billion the f15 fighter by 68 billion 
and the f16 fighter by 63 billion 
in addition the air force made billions of dollars in 
adjustments that could not be explained or supported by the service 
officials the gao said 
in one instance the air force tinkered with its accounts when 
the balance for the space systems division differed from other 
records by 24 billion making the change without determining why 
the records did not agree 
sen john glenn dohio and chairman of the panel noted that 
the gao chose to audit the air force because it is the only armed 
service to develop financial statements that are in accord with 
accounting practices elsewhere in the federal government 
if the air force does indeed have the best financial 
management system among the services then the audit results are an 
indictment of the financial management systems of the whole 
department of defense the army the navy as well as the air 
force glenn said 
the ohio democrat also used the hearing to question bowsher 
about rices previously unreleased feb 15 letter to him 
although the defense department in its official response to the 
gao report concurred wholly or in part with all 26 recommendations 
in the audit rice was highly critical of the report 
the air force secretary wrote that the service volunteered to 
work with the gao on the audit and in return the gao writes a 
hypercritical and inflammatory report 
i urge you to send your team back to the drawing board with 
instructions to prepare a report that fairly evaluates the pros and 
cons of gaos approach and which uses air force data only as a test 
case for a new approach rice said 
asked about rices complaint bowsher said his agency audited 
the air force using a financial system for federal agencies agreed 
upon in 1986 by himself former treasury secretary james baker iii 
and former white house budget director james miller 
rice also argued in his letter that even if the type of 
financial information from standard accounting systems were useful 
why do i need it at a pennywise level of accuracy that a cpa 
would judge auditable 
bowsher responded 
were not talking about penny accuracy were talking about 
billions of dollars of errors

one group of occidental petroleum corp 
shareholders has settled a dispute with the company over the use of 
86 million in occidental funds to build chairman armand hammers 
art museum 
but another group will oppose the proposed settlement of a 
classaction lawsuit when it comes up for approval by vice 
chancellor maurice hartnett of the delaware chancery court on april 
4 
the shareholders have opposed occidentals support for the 
armand hammer museum and cultural center which is being built 
beside the companys headquarters in the westwood section of los 
angeles 
hammer 91 decided in 1987 to build the museum after a falling 
out with the los angeles county museum of art over its plans for 
his collection 
the proposed deal allows occidental to spend 86 million to 
build and run the museum 
but it limits other spending on the project puts some limits on 
occidental contributions to hammerrelated charities grants 14 
million in fees to the plaintiffs lawyers and ensures that 
occidentals name as well as hammers will appear on the museum 
we dont think it is fair reasonable or adequate said 
deputy california attorney general susan henrichsen the attorney 
for californias huge public employee pension fund part of the 
shareholders group that plans to object to the deal 
that group filed a separate similar classaction lawsuit last 
year to force occidental to sell the museum

the justice department said friday it will ask 
the supreme court to overrule a federal judges finding that a law 
banning flag burning is unconstitutional 
spokesman david runkel said justice department attorneys would 
file a notice in seattle federal court of the governments plan to 
appeal wednesdays ruling by us district judge barbara rothstein 
the judge dismissed criminal charges against four people arising 
from a flagburning incident saying the law passed last year by 
congress violated constitutional freespeech protections 
congress enacted the law after the high court last year threw 
out a similar texas statute on the same constitutional ground 
president bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban flag 
burning but allowed the bill passed by congress without signing it 
despite the administrations preference for a constitutional 
amendment the justice department has a duty to defend the law 
runkel said 
david cole an attorney for the center for constitutional rights 
who argued the seattle case predicted the high court would not 
overturn rothsteins ruling 
i believe the supreme court will reaffirm that the principles 
for which the flag stands includes the freedom to dissent and will 
therefore uphold judge rothsteins ruling cole said 
the law provides for direct appeal of rulings on its 
constitutionality from federal district court to the supreme court 
the prospect of another supreme court ruling has renewed calls 
in congress for a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
this decision vindicates those of us who wanted to fix this 
thing and have the states take up the question of protecting the 
flag properly said rep chuck douglas rnh the way to do it 
is by a constitutional amendment and there is nothing short of 
that

the justice department said friday that any 
settlement with exxon corp over possible criminal charges from the 
alaskan oil spill wont compromise civil claims by the state or its 
citizens 
spokesman david runkel delivered a statement in response to 
criticism from environmentalists and alaskan officials that the 
department was trying to force the state to go along with what it 
considered an inadequate settlement of the federal case 
there are a number of complicated legal and factual issues 
involved in this matter and we are puzzled by comments which have 
been reported by persons who appear to have little grasp of what is 
actually involved in this case runkel said 
an early draft of a possible settlement called for exxon to pay 
up to 500 million to finance a natural resources restoration 
program over the next seven years according to sources familiar 
with the negotiations 
but us government sources speaking on the condition of 
anonymity stressed that there was no agreement with exxon 
although discussions were continuing with attorneys for the oil 
company 
the department is seeking an agreement under which exxon would 
be assessed for additional cleanup costs if expenses exceed those 
in the original estimate said one source 
a resolution in the discussions which have been going on for 
several months is expected soon according to the 
environmentalists and the state officials 
a federal grand jury is meeting in alaska in connection with the 
investigation by the departments environmental crimes section 
the grand jury could conceivably return an indictment if the 
justice department and exxon do not reach a settlement of the case 
federal criminal laws in oil spill cases provide for fines up to 
double the cost of a cleanup exxon has spent nearly 2 billion to 
clean up the oil spill according to transportation secretary 
samuel skinner 
on thursday alaskas attorney general douglas baily accused 
the justice department of trying to force the state to make a 
hasty endorsement of the draft proposal 
under the proposed agreement the federal government would 
abandon its commitment to alaska to assist with its civil claims 
against exxon baily told reporters we are being asked to 
accept a pig in a poke and that pig smells awfully bad 
similar criticism was voiced by representatives of environmental 
groups who charged that the justice department was prepared to let 
exxon off easy for the massive oil spill when the tanker exxon 
valdez ran aground in prince william sound 
runkel declined to discuss the specifics of the negotiations 
beyond stating there have been discussions with attorneys for 
exxon as to the admissable parameters of appropriate penalties and 
appropriate corrective measures in the even of a guilty plea to any 
criminal charges that might be brought 
no actions taken by the federal government in the enforcement 
of federal criminal laws will compromise the state of alaskas 
ability to pursue violations of its criminal laws or appropriate 
civil remedies runkel said 
he also rebutted criticism that any settlement would impair the 
ability of environemntal groups and alaska residents to pursue 
appropriate civil claims

plo chief yasser arafat said in a letter 
released friday by a jewish group that his organization would 
support peace talks with israel involving palestinians from the 
occupied territories 
it was believed to be the first time arafat has approved of such 
talks in his letter arafat also repeated the plos demand for a 
separate state and for full participation in all peace talks which 
israel rejects 
the plo once more leaned over backward and approved the idea 
of a dialogue between representatives of the israeli government and 
representatives of the palestinian people in the occupied 
territories and the diaspora said the letter which was sent to 
a meeting of jewish activists called the special emergency world 
jewish leadership peace conference 
rita hauser an attorney and the head of the centers american 
branch said the sixpage letter was received through a 
circuitous manner via fax on thursday but that conference 
leaders chose not to publicize it until friday 
avi pazner an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said the 
letter would not influence israel 
we are absolutely not interested in what arafats position 
is he said we want to go forward with the peace process not 
with arafat but without arafat 
pazner accused the palestine liberation organization of trying 
to insert itself through the side door to gain entry to peace 
talks while foreign minister moshe arens was out of the country 
arens whose rightwing likud bloc has ruled out plo 
participation in talks met in washington on friday with secretary 
of state james a baker iii to discuss ways of restarting the 
middle east peace process 
baker has been trying for months to arrange a threeway meeting 
with arens and egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid to 
decide on the composition of a palestinian delegation to 
preliminary peace talks fridays meeting with arens failed to 
accomplish that baker said 
in his letter arafat said peace talks would have to be part of 
a process aimed at a comprehensive and final settlement of the 
palestinian situation and that the agenda could cover all the 
conceptual ingredients of that process 
we remain deeply convinced that the only real security 
guarantee for isael lies in a peaceful settlement based on the 
termination of the israeli occupation of the palestinian and arab 
territories and the acceptance of the twostate principle he 
wrote 
arafat noted that israelis have been fearful of dealing with the 
plo and said palestinians have similar concerns 
watching the convoluted maneuvers the israeli government has 
engaged in and the massive obstacles with which it had littered the 
path to peace the palestinian people are not filled with 
confidence in the good intentions of the israeli leaders arafat 
wrote 
to them the only guarantee of their own security and their 
political future lies in the full participation of the plo in all 
stages of the peace process he said 
the preliminary talks baker has tried to set up would be to 
clear the way for israeliproposed elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip the elections would give limited automony to the 17 
million palestinian residents of the territories 
efforts to get the talks under way have been stalled by israels 
concerns over the makeup of the palestinian delegation and the 
agenda the israeli government wants the agenda limited to the 
election plan 
pressure has been increasing on likud to accept some compromises 
to get the talks started 
the leftleaning labor party demanded the cabinet agree to a 
palestinian delegation that would include some deportees likud 
opposes having deportees in the delegation 
on thursday likud threatened to leave the coalition government 
if the compromise was not accepted 
the letter was dated feb 17 and came from tunis where the plo 
is based there was no explanation for the delay in its 
transmission to jerusalem 
ms hauser met with arafat in stockholm in december 1988 
shortly after that arafat made a series of historic announcements 
in which he recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism 
those statements led to the opening of a dialogue between the 
united states and the plo

caretaker prime minister ingvar 
carlsson said friday he is forming a new government to end swedens 
political crisis and quell the labor strife and inflation that have 
beset the economy 
carlsson said the government would consider opening sweden to 
workers from the soviet baltic republics to alleviate an 
inflationboosting labor shortage and would seek to mediate labor 
disputes 
carlssons cabinet resigned feb 14 when the legislature 
rejected his emergency economic program he was asked to form a new 
government thursday after the centrist opposition parties failed to 
unite on a common policy 
thage g peterson the speaker of parliament informed the 
349member riksdag that he had asked carlsson to lead another 
cabinet 
i hereby propose to parliament to appoint as prime minister 
ingvar carlsson who intends to form a government of members of the 
social democratic party peterson said immediately adjourning 
the session 
a vote on the new carlsson government was set for monday with 
the small communist party expected to support it and the center 
party to abstain the new cabinet would be installed tuesday 
swedish radio said 
the program carlsson outlined shifted the governments attack on 
economic problems from greater regulation to liberalizing the labor 
market 
this is a proposal of measures of how we shall conduct a sound 
economic policy take responsibility for the nation and quickly 
solve the crisis carlsson said 
the platform dropped a controversial proposal for a twoyear 
wage freeze and for compulsory arbitration of labor disputes while 
it maintained a price freeze for an indefinite period 
it included a proposal to appoint a state mediator whose task 
would be to dampen wage demands in a national agreement to be 
negotiated this spring the government also would tighten rules to 
prevent wildcat strikes 
the political crisis began in january with a series of labor 
conflicts that closed all banks for three weeks and threatened to 
paralyze public services and transport in major cities the 
government said the labor strife was symptomatic of pressures that 
had caused a wagecost spiral 
some economists have blamed swedens full employment policy 
which has limited unemployment to about 1 percent for fueling 
inflation approaching 9 percent or twice that of most of its 
trading partners 
to offset the labor shortage carlsson said the government will 
investigate whether young workers from the soviet baltic republics 
will be given the opportunity to work in sweden 
it also would give swedes the choice of working two years beyond 
the retirement age at 65 and working through two of the sixweeks 
vacation to which each swedish worker will entitled by law as of 
next year

hundreds of friends attended a birthday bash for 
japans crown prince naruhito who turned 30 on friday but one 
guest was prominently absent a royal bride 
according to the prince there might not be one by his side for 
some time to come 
i may have met my ideal woman and i may not have he coyly 
told reporters thats all i have to say 
four years ago naruhito the eldest son of emperor akihito and 
first in line to the chrysanthemum throne said he hoped to marry 
by the age of 30 
the comment has haunted him since and has created intense 
competition in japans media to be the first to name the bride 
the 30 deadline also put pressure on palace officials who have 
said they would like to see the prince wed as soon as possible but 
who are having trouble helping him find a suitable mate 
even so in a prebirthday news conference earlier this week 
the prince said he doesnt feel rushed 
i know how to operate a washing machine without getting 
covered in bubbles and i know how to handle an iron said 
naruhito who is preparing to set up his own residence at the 
akasaka palace in downtown tokyo aside from two years at oxford 
the prince has lived most of his life with his parents 
i will be going about it at my own pace without hurry he 
said adding i dont feel guilty about being single 
excerpts of the conference were broadcast friday on major tv 
networks and carried in most newspapers foreign reporters were not 
invited 
speculation about naruhito intensified when it was announced in 
august that his younger brother prince aya had already proposed 
to kiko kawashima a 23yearold graduate student with no royal 
background 
many palace conservatives resisted the idea of aya 24 marrying 
before his brother and palace watchers wondered if naruhito was 
not going to surprise them with an announcement of his own 
but with ayas wedding scheduled for late june and a series of 
coronation celebrations planned for november it is now believed 
that naruhito wont be able to marry until sometime next year 
during the news conference naruhito stressed he wants to choose 
his own spouse although his wedding wont be an entirely private 
matter 
under japanese law male members of the royal family must 
receive government approval before getting married and palace 
officials generally make up a list of princess candidates 
noble descent was a must until naruhitos father wed empress 
michiko the daughter of a wealthy businessman 
it is not a question of what her position is but rather what 
kind of person she is naruhito said when asked if he too would 
consider a commoner her ability to adapt to the palace does not 
depend on her background 
naruhito said his position has made the search difficult as he 
is not able to pick and choose freely the demands of life in 
japans often secluded traditionconscious palace are also enough 
to scare many women away 
the prince said he has not lost hope i want to decide for 
myself i am not at all pessimistic

the red carpet is out for sympathetic 
celebrities invited to observe the general election but on friday 
observers from the most conservative group still were waiting for 
visas from the leftist sandinista government 
the washingtonbased center for democracy which acted for the 
us senate in observing the 1986 philippines elections and the 
1989 panamanian elections says it has become an outsider in the 
monitoring process 
insiders include people like actor ed asner a longtime critic 
of us policy in central america and british singer billy bragg 
whose latest album is workers paradise 
it would be our job if we were satisfied with the results and 
the procedure to go back and do our best to counteract the 
negative media that continually occurs visavis the sandinistas in 
the united states asner said as he trotted toward a bus in the 
sweltering afternoon heat 
asner a former president of the screen actors guild bragg 
singer jackson browne and actor robert foxworth had just finished 
an hourlong meeting with vice president sergio ramirez and were 
late for a meeting with the interior minister 
but allen weinstein president of the center for democracy 
could only gaze out his window across the street to the foreign 
ministry which hasnt issued visas for 25 americans on the 
centers team 
the center learned thursday that visas for three costa rican 
congressmen in its delegation had been denied 
there they are right across the street but they wont answer 
our calls they wont answer our letters weinstein said 
foreign ministry spokeswoman mercedes borge said the ministry 
didnt know anything about the visas and referred inquiries to the 
supreme electoral council the council spokesman was not available 
for comment a secretary said by telephone 
weinstein has issued a statement saying the integrity of the 
entire international observer process has been jeopardized by the 
visa problems and electoral council refusal to let his observers 
watch the votes being counted 
he had been hoping to field 100 observers but will end up with 
fewer than 30 
sundays election will still be one of the most closely watched 
in history with one observer for about every 850 voters 
every morning hordes of observers spill out of the doors of the 
intercontinental hotel a pyramidshaped managua landmark they 
clog restaurants and roam the aisles of the dollar store virtually 
the only place in nicaragua for supermarketstyle provisions 
raybans and reeboks 
the sandinistas expect a favorable verdict from voters and count 
on the observers to give the election a credibility the bush 
administration cannot ignore 
president daniel ortega whose main challenger is publisher 
violeta barrios de chamorro says he will propose a political truce 
with the opposition and the united states which has financed the 
contra rebels and kept an economic embargo on nicaragua 
the government has worked closely with the three main observer 
missions the united nations the organization of american states 
and former president jimmy carters council of freely elected heads 
of government the three will deploy more than 700 people in all 
and they will issue the definitive verdicts on the election 
all three groups have said they believe conditions exist for a 
free and fair election 
the center for democracy was one of the first groups invited 
here and has been monitoring the campaign since last fall as have 
the three major observer groups 
but things went sour when it blamed the sandinistas for a riot 
after an opposition rally in masatepe in december in which one 
person died and scores were injured the center issued a critical 
report then held a news conference during a central american 
summit in costa rica 
weinstein flew back to washington and told reporters there 
friday the white house should go slow on normalizing relations with 
nicaragua in the event of a sandinista victory among his charges 
that nicaragua is using a teletype system to transmit voting 
results that opens opportunities for sandinista fraud 
the vast majority of the smaller observer groups are either 
critical of us policy in central america sympathetic to the 
sandinistas or both 
the usbased veterans for peace for example will have 59 
observers more than carters group accredited observers also are 
here from prosandinista solidarity groups leftist parties labor 
groups and pacifist organizations 
other observers include those from national election tribunals 
in central and south america universities embassies parliaments 
and religious organizations 
the supreme electoral council has accredited 2000 observers for 
the elections 175 million people are registered to vote

a prochoice resolution approved by the american 
bar associations governing body is dividing the lawyers group and 
testing its members capacity for professional detachment 
despite opposition from the abas president presidentelect 
secretary and treasurer its governing body last week approved a 
resolution endorsing a womans right to an abortion 
some of the very best people in the aba are in agony over this 
resolution and im sorry for that said sandy dalemberte a 
supporter of the measure who probably will become aba president 
next year 
among the best people he referred to are 
treasurer joseph nolan who resigned from the chicagobased 
aba saying he could not reconcile his roman catholic beliefs with 
a resolution that advocates abortion on demand 
secretary tony palermo who said he will seek the resolutions 
repeal at the aba convention in august on the grounds that abortion 
is a personal and political issue not a legal one if he fails he 
may quit 
presidentelect john curtin who says he will not sign his 
name to aba friendofthecourt briefs in abortion cases 
texas bar association president darrell jordan who hints that 
his and other state groups might pull back from the aba 
pennsylvania bar association presidentelect john carpenter 
who said friday he had resigned from the national groups governing 
body the aba house of delegates 
the resolution also was criticized by attorney general dick 
thornburgh who contended that it raises questions about the abas 
ability to honestly render advisory opinions on the professional 
competence of judicial nominees 
the resolution says the aba opposes legislation or other 
government action that interferes with the confidential 
relationship between a pregnant woman and her physician or with the 
decision to terminate the pregnancy at any time before the fetus is 
capable of independent life 
as a result of the resolutions passage aba groups will be able 
to file briefs in abortion cases and work against proposed state 
laws that would restrict abortion rights but richard collins an 
aba spokesman said abortion has not yet been added to the 
associations list of legislative priorities 
so far the resolutions greatest impact has been on the aba 
itself 
even lawyers dont like contentiousness among themselves 
said estelle rogers who helped engineer the resolutions passage 
at least 40 members of the 365000member organization have 
resigned and this week palermo predicted a massive withdrawal 
of lawyers if the resolution is not repealed 
many aba members have written the national office to ask what 
the resolution says and what it means when they find out nolan 
predicted many will demand change or follow him out the door it 
looks like a snowball he said 
this week law professors at the university of notre dame in 
south bend ind voted to end the schools payment of their 1900 
aba dues to protest the resolution 
law dean david link said the decision among professors at the 
roman catholic university was primarily based on a professional 
not a religious objection 
were not saying they should have taken the opposite 
position link said they just shouldnt be in this when you 
think of the division that still exists among members of the bar 
association and in the courts

israel has increased security for jewish 
immigrants en route from the soviet union because of warnings that 
arab guerrillas may be planning attacks newspapers reported friday 
president chaim herzog suggested that israel censor reports 
about immigration and the travel routes of those arriving 
during all the years of great immigrations governments of 
israel imposed censorship in agreement with the media on all 
related to reports on immigration numbers countries of origin and 
travel routes he said on israel radio 
imposing total censorship would be difficult but previous 
governments found the golden path between the need to explain the 
issue to the jewish people and the necessity to avoid providing 
ammunition to our enemies herzog said 
fridays jerusalem post said a reliable source confirmed 
that security was tightened after warnings were received that 
unspecified guerrilla groups planned to attack immigrants from the 
soviet union 
security officials would not confirm or deny the reports 
concern over the safety of immigrants grew after arab protests 
about the arrival of thousands of soviet jews in the past few 
months 
palestinian groups fear israel will encourage the new arrivals 
to settle in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip the 
government has denied any such plan and only about 200 of last 
years 12000 soviet immigrants settled in the territories 
bassam abu sharif political adviser to chairman yasser arafat 
of the palestine liberation organization told reporters wednesday 
in tunis 
we consider the settlement of soviet jews in the west bank is 
an act of war against the palestinian people and the arab nation 
such an act can only cause similar action on our part that is to 
say acts of war 
zeev schiff a respected israeli military commentator wrote in 
the daily haaretz that such palestinian statements create the 
background for acts of terror against immigrants en route to israel 
or in israel itself 
such attacks may be expected in order to terrify to make 
immigration harder and to ignite the international community for 
using pressure against israel he said 
schiff said palestinian guerrillas may interpret western 
condemnations of the settling of immigrants in the occupied lands 
as justifying violent acts against the immigrants and the 
israelis accompanying them 
israels security mechanisms will now have to invest thought 
and resources in protecting the movement of immigrants to israel 
coming from various directions he wrote 
one palestinian attack on jews leaving the soviet union has been 
reported in september 1973 two guerrillas of the saiqa group 
based in syria attacked a train carrying 37 soviet jews near the 
austrian border taking three emigrants and an austrian hostage 
austria negotiated the hostages release but closed the 
schoenau center near vienna then the main transit point for soviet 
jewish emigrants 
soviet jews were immigrating to israel at a rate of more than 
2500 a month at the time arab states protested that moscow was 
providing the jewish state with manpower 
most soviet jews now go to hungary or romania and are flown to 
israel 
the number of soviet jews arriving in israel has increased 
rapidly because of eased soviet emigration policies in 1988 about 
2000 soviet jews came to israel but the number grew to 12000 in 
1989 and more than 8000 have arrived so far this year

a former executive of a united technologies 
corp division pleaded guilty friday to conspiring to illegally 
obtain inside information about a pentagon competition for a 
lucrative navy contract 
roger k engel 49 a former vice president of the companys 
norden systems division in norwalk conn pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to defraud the government 
engel who agreed to cooperate with the justice departments 
investigation of pentagon procurement fraud called operation ill 
wind could receive a fiveyear sentence and fined up to 250000 
us district judge claude m hilton in alexandria va 
scheduled engels sentencing for may 11 
engel is the third former norden systems executive to plead 
guilty to participating in the conspiracy to obtain inside bid 
information abou a 150 million contract to build a battlefield air 
trafficcontrol system for the marine corps 
a former senior vice president of norden james e rapinec 54 
and cj jack richardson a former marketing executive pleaded 
guilty in december and are also cooperating with prosecutors 
the three men have all admitted they arranged in 1988 for norden 
to pay defense consultant thomas e muldoon 49500 to get 
information about the navys contract competition from his contacts 
in the defense department 
muldoon was paid 27500 before the ill wind investigation 
was publicly disclosed in june 1988 when fbi agents searched the 
offices of a number of defense contractors including norden 
systems 
norden then withdrew from the pentagons competition for the 
radar command and groundcontrol system known as atacc 
muldoon who was sentenced last week to 27 months in prison for 
participating in an unrelated scheme to bribe a pentagon 
procurement official obtained the information with the help of 
another defense consultant mark saunders 
saunders obtained information about nordens ranking in the 
competition from george stone then a senior navy procurement 
official 
neither saunders nor stone has been charged 
according to court papers muldoon told richardson that his 
contact in the government was responsible for norden being kept 
in the competition 
nordens president edwin decker approved the consulting 
arrangement with muldoon according to court papers 
but norden spokesman scott brinckerhoff said it was standard 
practice for decker who has since retired to approve consulting 
contracts 
he certainly did not approve illegally obtaining any kind of 
information brinckerhoff said

after a weeklong standoff with the 
state a sheriff with an overcrowded jail won permission to keep a 
makeshift prison at a national guard armory for at least two more 
weeks 
a superior court judge endorsed a temporary settlement between 
the state which owns the armory and hampden county sheriff 
michael ashe who seized part of the building feb 16 
ashe whose action sparked a war of words with the state and 
drew support from many citizens said he had just decided to go 
out and do what i have to do 
the sheriff was under a federal court order forbidding him from 
holding more than 500 prisoners in the 102yearold hampden county 
jail which is designed to house 279 
on friday 19 inmates were held at the temporary lockup at the 
armory in a large room with a concrete floor and a volleyball net 
stretched between the walls 
this is a victory for the people ashe said after the 
hearing in which lawyers for county and state agreed to let him 
keep using the armory until march 12 on that day both sides are 
supposed to report back with a permanent solution or a hearing 
will be held on the sheriffs request for an injunction allowing 
him to keep using the armory 
under the settlement approved by judge george keady ashe agreed 
to allow the national guard to keep operating out of the building 
i think what we wanted to do is keep it on the front burner 
but turn down the heat said lawrence fletcherhill assistant 
state attorney general 
the sheriff shocked state officials when he moved on the armory 
telling guardsmen that he was seizing the property under a 17th 
century statute ordering him to keep the peace the sheriff said 
his only other choice was to turn prisoners out onto the streets 
state officials at first reacted angrily secretary of public 
safety charles v barry who has jurisdiction over the armories 
issued a statement saying he would press criminal trespass charges 
against the sheriff 
the state had argued that the sheriff as a county official 
doesnt have any right to take state property 
but early in the week the sheriff won a temporary restraining 
order allowing him to stay at the armory that along with 
widespread support from residents local officials and even 
prisoners turned the focus to working out a compromise spot for 
the prisoners 
were putting the issue of the sheriffs actions to the 
side fletcherhill said at a news conference after fridays 
hearing its more important that we find a solution 
officials declined to specify what locations they are 
considering for overflow prisoners a new jail is scheduled to be 
built in nearby ludlow but that is at least two years away 
money for the temporary solution will come from funds set aside 
for overcrowding problems state prison officials said

britain lifted restrictions friday on investing 
and promoting tourism in south africa acting alone after the rest 
of the european community refused to ease any sanctions 
it is now entirely for the private sector to decide on new 
investment but we do feel very strongly that president de klerk 
has done more and more quickly and with greater courage than any 
other south african president prime minister margaret thatcher 
said 
she has argued that international sanctions should be lifted to 
reward de klerk and his white government for political reforms and 
the release of black leader nelson mandela on feb 11 
britains action announced in statements to the house of 
commons by trade secretary nicholas ridley and employment secretary 
michael howard means the government will no longer discourage 
investment or tour promotion officials said 
the organization that represents major british companies 
operating in south africa said it believed ending the nonbinding 
investment restrictions would make no immediate difference 
overseas capital is going to be very sensitive to political 
developments there said tim bird spokesman for the british 
industry committee on south africa for longterm investment you 
need longterm confidence 
the committee represets about 30 british companies with big 
south african interests including ici shell and british petroleum 
it is unclear whether lifting the tourism restrictions will make 
a marked difference brochures for south african vacations are not 
prominently displayed in most travel agencies 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock opening the 
headquarters of the wales antiapartheid movement in cardiff said 
the government move was pathetically premature 
the general secretary of the south african council of churches 
the rev frank chikane who arrived friday on a visit also said 
mrs thatcher had moved too fast 
when we have reached the stage where the dismantling of 
apartheid is irreversible we will blow the whistle he said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate residential districts schools and health services 
asked about her isolation on south africa mrs thatcher said 
it is a pretty cozy isolation pretty crowded judging by the 
numbers of foreign statesmen who are talking to us 
she was speaking at a news conference with italian prime 
minister giulio andreotti who paid a oneday visit to discuss 
german unification 
andreotti said de klerk has taken some extraordinary steps 
and should be supported but italy like the rest of the 
12nation european community refused a british appeal to lift the 
nonbinding investment and tourism restrictions 
they were among measures imposed in 1986 by the european 
community including binding bans on import of iron steel and gold 
coins that remain in effect 
british investment has dropped from nearly 46 billion in 1984 
to 3 billion in 1987 the latest government figure available but 
britain remains the single largest foreign investor in south africa 
south africas biggest trading partners are west germany italy 
france britain united states and japan 
mainly because of pressure from antiapartheid groups several 
big british corporations like hundreds of us companies have 
withdrawn from south africa in recent years and sold out to local 
companies 
it is also unclear if lifting the tourism restrictions will make 
a marked difference brochures for south african vacations are not 
prominently displayed in most travel agencies but they are 
available and south african airways advertises in british 
newspapers

hostages said friday the 18 western captives in lebanon should be 
freed 
we have to think of finding realistic and humanitarian means 
to free the foreign hostages sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said in a sermon at friday prayers in bir elabed a district in 
the shiite moslem slums of south beirut 
this problem has been widely exploited by western forces to 
distort the image of islam and moslems he said 
hezbollah or party of god is allied with iran the 
englishlanguage tehran times which is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani said thursday the hostages should be freed because they 
had become a propaganda tool of irans enemies 
the editorial was the first known statement by an iranian 
newspaper in support of freeing the hostages 
shiite kidnappers are believed to hold most of the hostages who 
include eight americans four britons two west germans two swiss 
an italian and an irishman 
held longest is terry a anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
in his first comment on the hostages of 1990 fadlallah said 
there should be a new study of this problem in order to to be 
able to bring about a political and humanitarian solution that 
guarantees the freedom of the captives and the rights of moslems 
we want to approach this issue which is used by the 
international media and as a means of pressure on a new basis to 
reach a solution that will close this case altogether and enable 
the islamic struggle to pick up new momentum fadlallah visits 
iran frequently and was in tehran earlier this week for talks with 
iranian leaders 
on thursday in damascus syrian foreign minister farouk 
alsharaa told andersons sister peggy say that the tehran times 
editorial was a good sign and he would be going to iran soon to 
persue the hostage issue 
alsharaa said he would work intensly with the top iranian 
leaders and i hope we will be able to arrive at good results 
he said syria had told irans leaders it is their interest to 
work with us in gaining the release of the hostages 
syria has good relations with iran it was the only major arab 
country to support iran in the eightyear war with iraq that ended 
in august 1988 
mrs say said of fadlallahs statement this is another 
encouraging sign in a complicated situation it seems most of 
the parties are working toward a resoluton 
she is on a tour with an associated press delegation to seek the 
release of anderson and the others she has met with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar pope john paul ii and

the government has issued bayonets and 
dogs to security forces and is moving additional police to 
bucharest to control demonstrations interior minister mihai chitac 
said friday 
the announcement came at a session of the ruling provisional 
council of national unity which was discussing a decree that would 
limit demonstrations 
also friday more than 500 people knelt and prayed at an 
openair romanian orthodox mass in downtown bucharest the first 
such celebration in decades 
the new security measures followed actions last sunday by 
hundreds of antigovernment demonstrators who assaulted and 
briefly occupied government headquarters at victory square 
the interim government had been reluctant to use force against 
demonstrators following the bloody uprising by protesters and army 
troops that ended the 24year reign of communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
chitac told the council bucharest lacked officers and additional 
police would be brought to the capital from other areas 
he said about 4500 new positions for police would be 
established in the ministry 
soldiers stood aside last sunday when demonstrators shattered 
windows at government headquarters and occupied the building for 
three hours the troops said they had no orders to fire 
at the provisional councils meeting friday seveal opposition 
leaders accused the interim government of having secretly staged 
the violent demonstration itself so it could justify limiting 
political demonstrations 
staterun television on friday showed thousands of people 
demonstrating against the government the previous evening in 
timisoara the western city where the uprising against ceausescu 
began last december 
demonstrators condemned communism and the leadership of interim 
president ion iliescu 
in downtown bucharest on a sunny friday people crowded 
university square some clutching candles for the mass celebrated 
by a priest who was jailed and exiled for his opposition to the 
ceausescu regime 
may god allow us to raise churches on our land in order to 
have jesus born again here said the rev gheorghe calciu who 
returned this week from the united states 
the crowd knelt silently to remember the revolutions victims 
then followed calciu in a procession through the square to 
flowerbedecked memorials 
about a dozen police in long blue coats patrolled the square but 
did not interfere 
calciu 64 a human rights activist was imprisoned by the 
communist regime for 21 years expelled from romania in 1985 he 
has been serving at holy cross church in alexandria va and has 
been spiritual leader of the romanian world congress exile 
organization 
religious practice was discouraged under ceausescu and the 
romanian orthodox church to which most of the population belongs 
was kept on a tight rein masses took place only in religious 
buildings and believers were often persecuted 
in oradea in northwest romania unidentified assailants smashed 
windows and broke down the doors of a synagogue on the night of 
feb 1516 said teodor blumenfeld general secretary of the 
federation of romanian jewish communities 
they tore apart the building apparently looking for gold and 
silver objects he said they did not find any but destroyed 
prayer books shawls and kits blumenfeld said he estimated damage 
at nearly 1500 
no one was arrested he said 
romanias chief rabbi moses rosen said last week he feared a 
surge of antisemitism in the more open climate following the 
december revolution 
he said groups like the iron guard romanias former fascist 
movement allied with the nazis could be reborn 
blumenfeld said security guards and alarm systems were being 
provided for synagogues around the country but he called the 
oradea attack an isolated incident 
an announcement appeared wednesday in the bacau newspaper 
desteptarea announcing establishment of an extremist rightwing 
organization the anticommunist armyarchangel michael legion 
national newspapers said friday 
it declared that the group would not give up until all 
communists socialists and other left wing elements are 
liquidated

the senate ethics committee questioned a 
former top thrift regulator friday in an investigation of five 
senators who intervened with banking officials on behalf of lincoln 
savings and loan 
edwin j gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board said he met with the committee for four hours behind closed 
doors and they might choose to invite me back 
the exregulator declined to discuss his testimony because 
the committee asked me to hold confidential any discussions of 
sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz john 
mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich and john glenn 
dohio 
all five have denied wrongdoing the committees investigation 
is still in its preliminary stage 
sources familiar with the overall investigation said the 
committee appears to be exploring all possible relationships 
between the senators and phoenix millionaire charles h keating 
jr the former head of lincoln based in irvine calif 
these sources speaking only on condition of anonymity said the 
committee is ranging beyond a 1987 meeting between four senators 
and gray and a session a week later between all five senators and 
san franciscobased regulators the senators asked for the meetings 
at the request of keating who complained that he was treated 
unfairly 
keating his family members and associates contributed some 13 
million to the campaigns and causes of the five senators the 
government ousted keating and took control of the failing lincoln 
on april 14 1989 and the cost of protecting depositors at the 
thrift may exceed 2 billion believed to be the biggest of the 
many losses in the nations sampl debacle 
gray testified last november that four of the senators asked 
him in a private meeting on april 2 1987 to drop a proposed 
regulation that would have curtailed risky investments by lincoln 
in return he told the house banking committee the four would get 
their friend keating to make more home loans 
gray identified the four as deconcini glenn cranston and 
mccain and described the offer as a quid pro quo 
those senators and riegle met a week later to discuss the case 
with the san francisco examiners who were investigating lincoln 
and recommending its seizure by the government 
one source said it appears the committee is going to go 
beyond the meetings into a full recounting of the relationship 
between keating and the senators

nelson mandela met friday with 
liberal white and mixedrace members of parliament who have been 
shunned by some black militants because they take part in a 
legislative body that excludes blacks 
aides to mandela meanwhile said the african national congress 
leader will leave next week on an 18day fournation trip his 
first abroad since his release feb 11 after 27 years in prison 
he plans to fly tuesday to lusaka zambia to meet leaders of 
african countries and confer with the exiled leadership of the anc 
he then will spend three days in zimbabwe and six days in 
tanzania aides said on march 12 he will fly to sweden to visit 
anc president oliver tambo who is recovering from a stroke in a 
stockholm clinic 
mandela said friday in an interview with british broadcasting 
corp television that the anc was willing to compromise with the 
government and that democratic elections must precede negotiations 
on the future of the country 
he was interviewed at his home in soweto and the program was 
broadcast in britain 
mandela said nationalization of industry was a basic anc policy 
but he added if we decide to negotiate then we must be open to 
compromise if you are not prepared to compromise then you dont 
negotiate once we commit ourselves to negotiation then we admit 
the possibility of compromise 
he said the only way of determining who will be involved in the 
talks on south africas future is through democratic elections 
he also said the anc did not claim to be the only voice of black 
south africans but we are confident that we can lead the 
struggle for change in the country he said 
mandela met at his home friday with the three coleaders of the 
democratic party which represents antiapartheid whites in 
parliament 
the party has tried to build alliances with black groups in 
recent years with some success but some militants have refused to 
deal with the democrats because they remain in parliament which 
has houses for whites asians and people of mixedrace but 
excludes blacks 
democratic coleader denis worrall said his delegation agreed 
with mandela on the need for universal voting rights but differed 
over the ancs support for guerrilla violence economic sanctions 
and nationalization 
mandela has reaffirmed his support for anc economic policies 
which call for the nationalization of mines banks and monopoly 
industries 
he and other anc officials have sought to reassure white 
business people however saying economic issues should be subject 
to negotiation and compromise 
mandela also met the rev allan hendrickse leader of 
parliaments mixedrace chamber 
the anc has urged boycotts of elections for the mixedrace and 
asian chambers of parliament but hendrickse said after meeting 
mandela that the anc and the labor party which controls the 
mixedrace chamber would be able to work together 
mandelas aides said the black leader plans to meet monday with 
gavin relly chairman of the anglo american corp the worlds no 
1 gold producer 
relly has spoken out frequently against apartheid and his 
corporation espouses relatively liberal employment policies

leaders walter sisulu met with church leaders in natal province 
to discuss ways of resolving a 4yearold black factional struggle 
that has claimed about 3000 lives mandela is to join the

incriminating videotaped and written statements 
from five teens accused in the gang rape and nearfatal beating of 
a jogger in central park are admissible as evidence at their trial 
a judge ruled friday 
six teens are accused of being part of a band of roving youths 
who attacked an investment banker as she jogged through the park 
the night of april 19 
admission of the statements was critical to the prosecutions 
case because the victim has no memory of the attack and cannot 
testify against her alleged assailants and because there is no 
physical evidence that conclusively links the suspects to the 
attack 
the woman now 29 was raped beaten and left for dead but has 
since made a recovery doctors call remarkable and returned to work 
of six teenagers charged with attacking the woman five gave 
statements to the police that were videotaped 
one of them antron mccray 16 said we took turns getting on 
top of her he said he punched and kicked the jogger and another 
defendant yusef salaam 15 hit her with a pipe mccray according 
to a third defendant kevin richardson 15 had sex with her 
the six are charged with with rape sodomy assault and 
attempted murder four other youths are charged in attacks on male 
joggers that night 
attorney jesse berman who is defending one of the youths 
complained after the ruling that judge thomas galligan suppressed 
next to nothing 
the only exception to the ruling was a comment made by one of 
the teens to a police officer at a precinct stationhouse 
after the officer told the teenagers you should be out with 
your girlfriends instead of being out beating people the youth 
replied i got mine the policeman has testified galligan gave 
no reason for the exception 
another defense attorney referring to the judges ruling to 
suppress suspects statements in another murder case in which the 
victim was black and his alleged attacker white suggested that 
racism tainted galligans decision 
there is a double standard said attorney colin moore we 
came in expecting nothing and thats what we came away with 
the teenagers charged in the case are black

if it seems like some days will never end it 
may not be your imagination a government scientist confirms that 
the day got longer recently 
the earths rotation slowed slightly during a 10day period in 
january causing the length of a day to increase by 
fivetenthousandths of a second reports dr dennis mccarthy of 
the us naval observatory 
the change occurred starting jan 24 and has been associated 
with a series of westerly bursts of wind blowing out of asia across 
the pacific ocean mccarthy reported 
minute changes in the earths rotation are most often associated 
with such weather he explained because of the force of the winds 
acting on the planets surface 
the last time the planet slowed significantly was during the 
19821983 el nino event when it decreased by twotenthousandths 
of a second 
while climatologists reports that there are signs of a new el 
nino developing in the pacific mccarthy said in a telephone 
interview that it is too soon for that to affect the planet 
the rotational speed lost in the 19821983 event was gradually 
regained but it remains to the seen if the january loss will be 
made up he said 
an el nino is a series of changes in ocean water temperature and 
air pressure that has been known to alter weather conditions 
worldwide the 198283 occurrence was considered the most severe of 
its type in at least a century 
changes in the earths speed of rotation are calculated by 
precise observations of the apparent movement of stars and planets 
in the sky 
the january and 19821983 slowdowns are not connected with the 
much more gradual retardation of the earths rotation caused by the 
moon to compensate from time to time leap seconds are added 
to the calendar such as the 61st second that came at the end of 
the last minute of 1989

a brother of carol stuart said friday his family 
remains angry about her killing but letters of support and 
contributions to a scholarship fund set up in her name have 
restored their faith in people 
there are times when the whole situation angers me carl 
dimaiti said that so many lives can be so disrupted and 
shattered in such a short period of time for no real reason or no 
reason that i can see or reason that i can understand 
it was dimaitis first formal interview since his 
brotherinlaw charles stuart apparently committed suicide jan 4 
after investigators learned he made up a story about he and his 
wife being shot by a black gunman 
dimaiti spoke the day after the fbi began a preliminary inquiry 
into the boston police departments investigation of the case the 
inquiry is focused on allegations that police intimidated and 
coerced several people into implicating william bennett who is 
black in carol stuarts slaying last oct 23 
the suffolk county grand jury met friday for the fourth time 
since charles stuart apparently jumped off a bridge into the boston 
harbor three of his siblings neysa porter shelley yandoli and 
michael stuart reportedly appeared before the grand jury 
charles stuart originally told investigators that he and his 
pregnant wife were shot by a mugger while leaving a childbirth 
class mrs stuart 30 died of her wounds and the couples son 
delivered prematurely by caesarean section died 17 days later 
stuarts story about the black gunman touched off a massive 
manhunt during which minority residents allege their civil rights 
were violated 
dimaiti 37 a former high school teacher who now runs the 
family pizza dough business said his family has found new hope in 
the carol dimaiti stuart foundation formed last month 
the foundation was established to award scholarships to 
residents of the mission hill neighborhood where charles stuart 
originally told police the bogus holdup occurred 
contributions to the fund totaling 253000 have poured in from 
around the country the latest a check for 512240 from new 
england baptist hospital letters of support have poured in many 
are addressed simply to dimaiti family medford mass dimaiti 
said and many letters are from people who also experienced the 
loss of a loved one he said 
they said the pain will ease dimaiti said they say its 
something you never get over but it does get better 
dimaiti described his mother as still devastated by her 
daughters death but said the letters and contributions from as 
far away as california and overseas have helped restore her faith 
in people 
dimaiti would not comment on the fbis inquiry into the manner 
in which boston police handled the case 
the investigation undertaken at the request of us attorney 
wayne budd will examine allegations that individuals were 
coerced or intimidated into making statements implicating willie 
bennett said a statement issued thursday by fbi special agent 
thomas hughes 
bennett who is black was named by police as a suspect after 
carol stuarts shooting but he was cleared after charles stuarts

a flotilla of salvage tugs worked friday 
to prevent a flareup of fires that could touch off another blast 
aboard a usflagged kuwaiti tanker crippled by an explosion 
us navy warships warned other vessels to keep at least four 
miles away from the fireravaged surf city the usflagged tanker 
was en route to italy loaded with naphtha and diesel fuel when a 
blast ripped through it thursday in the persian gulf 20 miles off 
the united arab emirates coast 
us military officials identified the two people killed in the 
explosion as the ships master derrick f linardich 38 of 
norfolk va and the first mate steven p mchugh 34 of east 
bridgewater mass 
the other 23 crew members scrambled to lifeboats as flames raced 
across half of the 700foot ship the crewmen including four with 
minor injuries were rescued by the american missile frigate uss 
simpson 
spokesmen at us central command in tampa fla the 
headquarters responsible for us operations in the gulf said they 
were told that the surf citys chief engineer was 
britishcanadian but others said all 25 crewmen were american 
one survivor 27yearold wayne cohen of boston said the 
captain and first mate were in an area where work was being done on 
a cargo tank when the whole ship blew up 
the 81283ton tanker is one of five kuwaiti tankers still 
sailing under protection of the us flag 19 months after the end 
of the iraniraq war 
c miles sheldon head of chesapeake shipping inc told a dubai 
news conference that the bodies of the captain and first mate were 
recovered and would be sent home from dubai chesapeake shipping is 
the subsidiary set up by the kuwait oil tanker co to operate the 
usflagged ships 
sheldon said that although the fires had been contained and the 
tanker was no longer in immediate danger of sinking its condition 
remained unpredictable 
he said the ship and cargo together were worth more than 30 
million 
in kuwait the chairman of kuwait oil tanker co abdulfattah 
albader said the blast most likely had been caused by a short 
circuit he agreed with us military officials who had discounted 
the possibility of iranian sabotage or a drifting mine 
the surf city was described by witnesses as sharply down by its 
bow and listing as a result of water pouring through a huge hole 
in its side smoke still billowed from the ship friday leaving a 
streak in the sky visible from shore 
gulfbased shipping sources said about eight tugboats were on 
the scene some dousing the tanker with water and firesmothering 
foam to reduce chances of another explosion in its volatile cargo 
the accommodation quarters are still smoldering and the heat 
could blow up the cargo which would be a major disaster said 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity 
albader said there would be no pollution problem even if the 
tanker should sink because the oil would evaporate 
eleven kuwaitowned tankers reflagged by the united states in 
mid1987 to afford them naval escorts as protection from attacks by 
iran which was targeting the shipping of countries supporting iraq 
six of the tankers reverted to kuwaiti registry a year ago 
while the other five have continued to sail under the us flag 
they are manned by american crews

federal regulators on friday seized the 
savings and loan industrys second largest holder of junk bonds a 
california institution that worked closely with indicted financier 
michael milken 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision turned 
imperial savings association san diego over to the resolution 
trust corp a federal agency created in august to dispose of 
insolvent sampls 
at the end of the year imperial had 97 billion in assets the 
thrift office said highyield highrisk bonds represented more 
than 10 percent of its portfolio the institution was 601 million 
in the red regulators said 
also seized on friday was mercury savings and loan association 
huntington beach calif it had 216 billion in assets and was 33 
million in the red the thrift office said 
mercury operated more traditionally than imperial but had 
invested in several large hotel projects that went sour 
like several other large institutions before it imperial ran 
afoul of provisions in last summers savings and loan bill 
requiring it to value its securities at market value rather than 
the purchase price 
it was forced to recognize 200 million in junk bond losses in 
the last quarter of last year and had indicated it expected to take 
a writedown of at least 50 million more in the current quarter 
at the end of september imperial was the 16th largest sampl in 
the nation and had the second biggest junk bond portfolio behind 
only columbia savings and loan association of beverly hills 
calif according to sheshunoff information services 
of the top four junk bond holders in the sampl business only 
columbia with 41 billion of the bonds remains out of the 
governments control analysts speculate however that it may be 
one of the next takeovers its debt has been downgraded by moodys 
investors service and regulators have restricted its activities 
since november 
i think that columbia has to be real close to the margin 
said bert ely an alexandria va financial institutions analyst 
i wouldnt be surprised to see columbia popped into the rtc 
fairly soon 
centrust bank of miami no 3 in junk bonds was seized earlier 
this month and city federal savings bank of bedminster nj no 
4 toppled in december 
the seizures make the government through the rtc the largest 
owner of junk bonds 
imperial the chief subsidiary of imperial corp of america had 
80 branch offices in california which will remain open during 
normal business hours it had 76 billion in deposits in 387000 
accounts the rtc said all accounts up to the 100000 federal 
insurance limit are guaranteed 
founded in 1950 imperial grew as it helped finance the 
postworld war ii housing boom in california however under former 
chief executive kenneth j thygerson and investor victor goulet it 
took advantage of californias liberal regulations to venture into 
risky investments it became a major customer of milken who was 
head of drexel burnham lambert incs junk bond operation in 
beverly hills calif 
junk bonds have declined 15 percent to 20 percent on average 
since the summer earlier this month drexel burnhams parent 
company sought protection under federal bankrupcty laws 
thygerson who had joined the thrift in 1985 resigned last 
july his successors were trying to save the institution by 
shrinking it to half of its peak size of 12 billion and returning 
it to more traditional practices 
but the thrift office said in a statement there was no 
possibility of replenishing capital without federal assistance 
in addition to junk bonds imperial had purchased a troubled 
portfolio of car loans from grand wilshire finance corp a 
nowbankrupt los angelesarea firm it was also suffering from 
problem loans it made to a nowbankrupt new jersey firm that sold 
yugo automobile dealerships in the united states 
spokesmen for imperial did not immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment 
all told regulators seized 12 sampls on friday including first 
atlantic savings and loan association of plainfield nj with 
13 billion in assets 
the rtc has more than 330 sampls under its control with about 180 
billion in assets 
though 12 sampls were seized by friday night the names of only 
seven had been released

the general assembly approved a plan 
friday to combat worldwide drug abuse and the illicit narcotics 
trade but a un official said more money is needed to win the 
battle 
the measures put together during the world bodys fourday 
special session on narcotics focused more on eliminating demand 
through reduced consumption than previous un antidrug plans 
the plan also emphasized promoting economic development and the 
importance of increased foreign trade to aid countries under siege 
by powerful drug producers and traffickers 
it urges tighter controls of chemicals and equipment used to 
manufacture illegal drugs and recommends steps to prevent the 
international banking system and other financial institutions from 
being used for laundering profits from the illicit drug trade 
the plan calls for increased efforts to develop alternative 
incomes such as crop substitution for drugproducing countries 
it also urges increased law enforcement cooperation and stresses 
the importance of treatment and rehabilitation for drug users 
the plan says countries can receive help in eliminating demand 
through several un bodies such as the un educational 
scientific and cultural organization the un childrens fund and 
the world health organization 
the coordinator of un drug programs margaret anstee said 
im afraid that if were not ready to put all the resources in 
then i think we might lose the war against drugs 
she told a news conference that if the financially strapped 
united nations does not receive more resources to strengthen its 
antidrug campaign there may be increased calls for legalization 
of narcotics 
im not in favor of legalization but we might end up in a 
situation where legalization would take place simply because we 
have not even barely fought the first battle on this matter she 
said 
un officials have estimated that the united nations needs an 
additional 3335 million during the next two years for drug 
programs already in place the new programs recommended by the 
plan adopted by consensus would require even more money but the 
level of funding necessary has not been determined mrs anstee 
said 
some countries including the united states have said the 
enhanced drug programs can be funded by diverting resources from 
other areas within the united nations 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar stressed in his 
opening speech before the session that the antidrug fight is an 
exceptional situation requiring budget increases

former president jose napoleon 
duarte whose quest for democracy in a society ruled by the 
privileged few was thwarted by a disastrous civil war died friday 
of cancer he was 64 
duarte died at his home in the capitals fashionable san benito 
neighborhood said dr jose luis saca 
doctors at walter reed army medical center in washington 
diagnosed the cancer in may 1988 and removed 60 percent of duartes 
stomach but the disease had spread to his liver they gave him 
from six to 18 months to live 
duarte was president from 1984 to june 1989 when he was 
succeeded by alfredo cristiani of the rightist arena party who was 
supported by the oligarchy duarte so long had fought 
nearly a generation ago duarte was arrested beaten and exiled 
for his fidelity to democracy he called his inauguration in 1984 
a light in the long night of horror and likened himself to 
moses delivering his people 
his role in replacing an authoritarian semifeudal system with 
the beginnings of democracy was critical but he finished his term 
and his life burdened by failure compromise frustration and 
dashed hopes 
the war with the leftist farabundo marti liberation front is 10 
years old poverty remains endemic in this small central american 
nation of 5 million people whose economy depends on us aid 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater issued a 
statement saying president duarte was the father of salvadoran 
democracy a dedicated servant to the people of el salvador and a 
firm friend of the united states 
the white house said vice president dan quayle will fly to el 
salvador to lead the us delegation at duartes funeral sunday 
secretary of state james a baker iii said there could be no 
more fitting tribute to his memory than for his countrymen to 
follow his lead and to ensure that human rights and democratic 
institutions grow and strengthen in the country he loved so deeply 
and to which he gave so much 
a highranking us diplomat who served in el salvador during 
most of duartes term said of him he didnt work miracles but 
he must be credited with instituting the democratic system itself 
his great legacy is the transition the rest pales by comparison 
opponents criticized duartes bombast and messianic attitude 
supporters praised his idealism and fighting spirit both agree his 
role in el salvador was historic 
one must acknowledge president duartes democratic vocation 
cristiani said just before taking office june 1 he has with his 
aptitude and positions promoted the advance of democracy 
duarte was born in san salvador nov 23 1925 the second of 
three sons his father was a tailor and his mother a dressmaker 
later his father started a candymaking business that became 
prosperous enough to put all three boys through college 
jose napoleon became a boy scout and remained active in the 
organization throughout his life 
he was graduated from the university of notre dame in 1948 with 
a degree in civil engineering married childhood friend ines duran 
and worked in her familys construction business they had six 
children 
the barrelchested engineer joined half a dozen other roman 
catholic professionals in 1960 to found the christian democratic 
party most were young liberals hoping to put the churchs social 
doctrine into practice through government 
after three terms as mayor of san salvador duarte ran for 
president in february 1972 he was winning handily when the army 
stopped the count and declared its candidate the winner 
a few weeks later he supported a coup by a dissident military 
faction it failed duarte was arrested beaten and told he would 
be shot 
he was allowed to leave the country instead and spent more than 
seven years in venezuela 
reformminded military officers seized power in 1979 and duarte 
returned he joined the junta in 1980 and became its president 
civil war began and the army and police embarked on a brutal 
repression in which tens of thousands of people were killed many 
by death squads officially sanctioned or tolerated duarte was 
criticized for presiding over terror but he said things would be 
worse were it not for his presence 
in an effort to deprive the guerrillas of an issue the junta 
began what was envisioned as a radical land reform to break up 
large farms and turn them into cooperatives 
the reform was a partial political success but eventually 
bogged down because of organizational and production problems 
when he was popularly elected in 1984 duarte promised to bring 
peace and prosperity in three attempts at negotiations with the 
leftist rebels however he did not budge from the demand that they 
lay down their arms and join the political process 
the guerrillas refused but now are considering it in talks with 
the cristiani government 
mainly because of the war the economy crumbled the decline was 
hastened by droughts and an earthquake in 1986 that killed an 
estimated 1500 people 
us economic and military aid reached nearly 2 million a day 
opponents decried what they called the presidents subservience to 
the united states 
even his supporters cringed when duarte kissed the us flag at 
a white house ceremony 
in a speech in june 1988 duarte gave this assessment of his 
presidential term 
the will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day 
more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents the 
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route 
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims

its the second longestrunning 
musical in broadway history but if city officials get their way 
oh calcutta wont have even one performance in chattanooga 
the city filed suit thursday in hamilton county chancery court 
to block the showing of oh calcutta at the tivoli theater on 
grounds it violates the states obscenity law 
the 10page suit also claims the musical violates state and 
local laws against indecent exposure and a local ordinance against 
lewd and indecent conduct 
a new jersey promoter wants to stage the play may 2 or may 6 at 
the tivoli but the theater is run by the citys memorial 
auditorium board which last week voted against bringing in the 
production 
the auditorium board just wants to do what it feels is best 
for the community and have shows that are in tune with community 
tastes said city attorney randy nelson 
the city is seeking judicial support for its action because the 
tivoli is publicly owned and can only deny use if an event violates 
local laws or business criteria 
with 5959 performances the revival of oh calcutta was 
the longestrunning musical on broadway when it closed sept 24 
although it has since been passed by a chorus line 
the musical is now on a sixmonth tour of more than 90 cities 
including nashville 
al stewart a press agent for the musicals promoter singer 
entertainment consultants ltd inc of port murray nj said the 
play is art not obscenity 
something that has been around for 21 years and has played in 
15 countries before 60 million people i wouldnt go that far 
to say it is obscene said stewart it is done in art its 
theater 
no member of the memorial auditorium board has seen the play 
said tivoli manager david johnson but they have read the script 
the board felt the play violated local and state ordinances on 
nudity and obscenity johnson said 
the lawsuit contends the plays depiction of complete nudity and 
simulated intercourse and other sexual acts would be obscene under 
the state definition regarding community standards and offensive 
sexual conduct 
the lawsuit also says the nudity would violate state and local 
laws against indecent exposure and the simulated sexual acts would 
violate a city law against lewdness 
in 1975 chattanooga tried to stop production of the nude 
musical hair but the us supreme court struck down the ban 
saying the procedure by which the performance was halted fell short 
of constitutional standards

a federal jury thursday rejected a 25 
million claim that pop star stevie wonders oscarwinning 1984 song 
i just called to say i love you was stolen from another 
songwriter 
the plaintiff lloyd chiate claimed wonders song part of the 
movie soundtrack for woman in red was stolen from a song he 
cowrote titled i just called to say 
i knew the truth in my heart all along said wonder who 
attended the twoweek trial and testified on his own behalf im 
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in 
this courtroom but i do appreciate and respect justice 
wonder offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing a 
song with chiate and lee garrett coauthor of i just called to 
say and donate the proceeds to charity 
then we all really win wonder said it is far easier to 
love than to hate 
chiate 40 sued wonder in 1985 under the superstars real name 
steveland morris for copyright infringement claiming that wonder 
pilfered i just called to say cowritten by lee garrett after 
wonder heard the song in 1977 
wonder 39 denied stealing the song which won an academy award 
in 1984 he said he wrote i just called to say i love you long 
before hearing the chiategarrett composition and without any 
influence from the song 
chiate wasnt present when the jury announced its verdict his 
attorney said his client was wronged by a starstruck jury and a 
biased judge who had originally dismissed the lawsuit but was 
overruled by an appeals court 
i dont think that mr chiate ever got a fair trial said 
lawyer herbert dodell the result was inevitable a terrible 
miscarriage of justice 
jury foreman robert apfelzweig 39 a research scientist from 
pasadena said the jury didnt find any evidence that wonder had 
access to the chiategarrett song and the two songs were quite 
dissimilar 
mr chiates case started weak and got weaker said 
apfelzweig 
chiate contended that wonder first had access to chiate and 
garretts music during the summer of 1977 when garrett played 
wonder a tape recording of his music after the latter had talked 
garrett out of committing suicide one night 
garrett and wonder are boyhood friends garrett originally was 
named as a plaintiff in the suit but he dropped out and testified 
for wonder 
wonder testified in the courtroom of us district judge david 
w williams that he wrote much of i just called to say i love 
you on july 16 1976 while being driven from his mothers san 
fernando valley home 
it was at least a year perhaps two before he heard the song 
chiate and garrett wrote he said 
wonder said that he later polished and recorded i just called 
to say i love you which became a big hit and also won a grammy

60 feet away he said we bolted to the boat to see who could 
be in it 
they grabbed life vests a firstaid kit and a strobe light 
before heading for the surface

british petroleum officials on thursday 
presented the coast guard with a plan for finishing cleanup of 12 
miles of southern california beach tarred by a spill of crude oil 
from a tanker 
company spokesman jim marino refused to provide details of the 
plan which he said sets a preliminary timetable for reopening 
beaches closed by the feb 7 spill of 400000 gallons of oil from 
the tanker american trader 
city state and federal authorities must approve the plan before 
it is put into effect marino said 
even as oil was being cleaned from the beaches state attorneys 
planned legal strategy for recovering damages from the tankers 
owner and operator 
an official with the state attorney generals office said both 
british petroleum which chartered the american trader and 
american trading and transportation co which owns the vessel 
could be held liable for damages caused by the spill off huntington 
beach south of los angeles 
weve yet to decide who to sue but under state law both the 
transporter and the owner of the oil are liable for damages said 
deputy attorney general sylvia cano hale 
hale said she expected local officials to provide their damage 
assessments by april how much money will be sought from the 
companies had yet to be determined she said 
investigators believe the tanker was punctured by its own anchor 
as it maneuvered in shallow water two miles offshore to discharge 
its cargo into a submerged pipeline that leads to a refinery on 
shore 
british petroleum demonstrated two sand cleanup technologies 
intended to eliminate residual oil that may have penetrated beaches 
above the hightide line along six miles of coast 
one device dubbed a beach sanitizer resembles a zamboni 
icerink grooming machine except that it lifts and sifts sand 
marino said the other employs a drag line that unearths sand 
beneath the surface so workers can remove buried oil residue 
cleanup crews continued to use pressurized warm water to clean 
rock faces at bolsa chica state beach and the newport bay jetties 
in all 370 workers continued cleanup along 14 miles of coast 
british petroleum said 
the 811foot american trader arrived in san francisco thursday 
where it will undergo repairs to the damaged hull said coast guard

state treasurer ann richards on thursday 
accused democratic gubernatorial opponent jim mattox of planting an 
article in a hispanicoriented newspaper that alleged she used an 
ethnically derogatory term 
tiempo a wacobased weekly published an article thursday 
alleging that ms richards referred to illegal aliens as 
wetbacks in a speech text written during her successful 
campaign for travis county commissioner in 1976 
ms richards whose noholdsbarred oratory drew wide attention 
at the democratic national convention in 1988 denied using the 
term 
mattox has always got other people to do his dirty work when 
he could ms richards told the associated press 
mattox press secretary kelly fero denied that the campaign 
had any connection with the article 
we did not plant this story with anybody we know nothing 
about this story and thats all we have to say about it fero 
said 
recent polls have shown ms richards leading the democratic 
primary field and mattox running third behind former gov mark 
white in the race to the march 13 primary election mattox and ms 
richards however have run a particularly heated campaign against 
each other 
republican gov bill clements isnt seeking a another term 
ernesto fraga publisher and author of the article said he 
personally supports mattox but that had nothing to do with the 
story 
if any other candidate had written something like this i 
would have printed it fraga said 
fraga made available to the ap a facsimile copy of the twopage 
handwritten speech text on which he based his article but declined 
to say how he had obtained it above the text is what appears to be 
ms richards letterhead 
a sentence in the text said if it takes a man to hire 
nonunion labor cross picket lines and work wetbacks then i say 
thank god for a woman or anyone else who is willing to take over 
shown a copy of the tiempo story and the papers reproduction of 
two sentences from the handwritten text ms richards said that the 
opening sentence of the text was her handwriting but the sentence 
containing the word wetbacks wasnt 
i cant tell you any more than what you can see here that 
there are obviously two handwritings and that jim mattoxs 
supporters put that out ms richards said 
ms richards came under similar criticism after a debate in 
houston earlier this month when she was heard by some to say no 
legislator no judge and no bureaucrat has any business in 
determining whether a white woman has an abortion or not 
ms richards has insisted she was misunderstood that she said 
why a woman rather than white woman

cambodian prime minister hun sen said 
thursday his talks with guerrilla leader prince norodom sihanouk 
may have produced a basis for a peace settlement soon 
the two leaders met in bangkok wednesday for talks sponsored by 
thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
we can regard this meeting as a success hun sen told 
reporters before leaving for home because of the existence of 
such a basis we will have some light of hope for peace in the near 
future 
hun sens remarks were translated into english by an aide he 
did not elaborate or take questions from reporters 
his government installed by vietnam after a late 1978 invasion 
of cambodia is fighting a coalition of three guerrilla groups led 
by sihanouk former ruler of the country 
a joint communique issued wednesday hinted at some progress in 
the talks but was vaguely worded and did not appear to contain any 
new concessions 
on thursday the khmer rouge guerrilla group cited what it said 
were three recent battlefield operations it launched in 
cooperation with sihanouk guerrillas 
sihanouk criticized for his ties with the fanatical group has 
denied any such cooperation existed the khmer rouge killed 
hundreds of thousands of people in agrarian revolution when it 
ruled cambodia before vietnam invaded and installed another 
government 
the khmer rouge army radio monitored in bangkok said the two 
forces cooperated in attacking government positions in northwestern 
siem reap province in one operation on feb 14 and two operations 
on feb 15 
it did not specify the nature of the cooperation in the strikes 
but said 15 government soldiers were killed war materiel was 
seized or destroyed and villages were liberated 
the hun sensihanouk communique said a un presence at 
appropriate levels in cambodia is essential and should be 
encouraged it did not say how far they accepted an australian 
proposal for the united nations to administer the country pending a 
national election 
it also said they wanted a supreme national body that would 
symbolize national unity but gave no details 
both leaders dodged the question of whether the body would 
include the khmer rouge the largest guerrilla group whose future 
role has been the major stumbling block in negotiations 
hun sen and sihanouk agreed to meet again in coming months and 
expressed hope that wider peace talks next week in indonesia will 
make enough progress to allow resumption of the international 
conference on cambodia in paris that conference has been suspended 
since last august 
sihanouk will not go to jakarta instead he will cross into 
northwestern cambodia on friday to end a decade of exile and live a 
guerrillacontrolled zone in the northwest until a political 
settlement his spokesman said 
the khmer peoples national liberation front which is allied 
with sihanouks forces has reported a largescale government 
counteroffensive since monday against positions taken by guerrillas 
in recent weeks 
fighting was fierce as government forces on wednesday attacked a 
liberation front base in the northwestern district of sisophon the 
guerrilla radio said 
resistance officials and thai military officers said government 
forces also struck monday and tuesday near svay chek a gateway to 
sisophon 
ok serei sopheak a spokesman for the liberation front high 
command said the 1300 attacking soldiers were backed by rocket 
launchers heavy artillery and at least six sovietmade t54 tanks 
he said the guerrillas held onto svay chek killed 49 soldiers 
and wounded 20

havel was elected president dec 29 by the czechoslovak 
parliament a few weeks after a peaceful revolution that led to the 
ouster of a hardline communist government elections are scheduled 
for june

actor ron silver help us overcome our cynicism and let us bask 
in the glory and joy of an artist leading us 
in receiving the honorary degree havel recalled giving a speech 
at columbia in 1968 when the vietnam protest movement was in full 
swing in this country though the students were on strike they 
attended the speech havel said adding that experiencing the 
america of the late 1960s was part of his political education 
the atmosphere of that time very much inspired me influenced 
me havel said 
at a preconcert reception havel marveled at meeting actor paul 
newman president of the actors studio which last year performed

britains prince charles told leading american 
architects thursday night that much of the commercial building of 
today bears as much relations to architecture as advertising 
slogans bear to literature 
the 41yearold heir to the british throne urged planners 
developers and designers to remember that buildings exist primarily 
for human beings 
the time has surely now arrived when we must learn to work 
with rather than against nature when we can once again make places 
in which to live and work which are more than machines he said 
charles laid down his challenge at a blacktie 250aplate 
awards dinner of the american institute of architects where he was 
the star attraction a soldout audience of 1200 architects 
members of congress diplomats and hollywood celebrities heard him 
warn that the worlds cities are becoming the epitome of the 
throwaway society 
if that comes about then i shall be proud to be considered 
old fashioned reactionary antediluvian anachronistic he 
continued 
the architects came to the glittering national building museum 
anticipating some sharp barbs from charles about the state of 
modern architecture 
he did not disappoint them noting that their welcome might be a 
sign that an epidemic of masochism is sweeping the ranks of the 
aia 
earlier after lunching with president bush the prince attended 
an architectual exhibit where he was hailed as our knight in 
shining armor because of is support for traditional architecture 
emerging from his limousine on the steps of the historic octagon 
house the prince of wales was obviously delighted to be met by a 
cluster of placards whose slogans included hurrah prince 
charles and humane architecture happy people 
he saw the sign shining knight in armor and he said gee 
whiz said thomas j eyerman a member of the board of regents of 
the american architectural foundation one of the sponsors of the 
event 
he was absolutely shocked that in america that people would 
have signs talking about architecture calling him a shining knight 
in armor eyerman said 
the proprince demonstrators told reporters they represented 
organizations that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful fight 
to save washingtons historic rhodes tavern from demolition 
the princes objective at octagon house used as a temporary 
executive mansion by president james madison after the british army 
burned the white house in 1814 was to view an exhibit 
commemorating the design of londons st pauls cathedral by the 
leading british architect of the 17th century sir christopher wren 
octagon house built in 1800 is now a museum of the american 
institute of architects charles married his wife diana in st 
pauls in 1981 
the prince reacted to the layout of architectural renderings and 
models with animation looking at each exhibit closely pointing 
out details and asking questions of one of his guides eric evans 
dean of st pauls 
the works on display have never before been assembled as a unit 
and the prince was quoted by architects with whom he spoke as 
hoping they also could be shown in london 
as the prince was inspecting the exhibit americas leading 
architects gathered at a glittering blacktie gala for a royal 
critique of their work 
on a chill drizzly day the 41yearold heir to the british 
throne dined in the white house family quarters with bush and vice 
president dan quayle 
the other luncheon guests included secretary of state james a 
baker iii white house chief of staff john sununu national 
security adviser brent scowcroft british ambassador sir antony 
acland and henry catto us ambassador to london 
bush escorted charles down a red carpet to his rollsroyce 
limousine after lunch and shook hands with the prince who wore a 
dark gray doublebreasted pinstripe suit 
the busy schedule for charles oneday washington visit also 
included an embassy reception for alumni of the marshall scholars 
program under which the british government pays all costs for 
exceptional american students to spend two or three years at 
british universities 
later charles was the star attraction at a soldout awards 
banquet for 1200 architects members of congress diplomats 
supreme court justices and hollywood celebrities at the national 
building museum 
the princes dinner speech gave him another opportunity to 
criticize the worst examples of modern architecture and appeal to 
his audience to design more attractive comfortable buildings that 
are scaled to human needs and respect the surrounding landscape 
back home charles has angered some architects but won the 
applause of much of the british public with his contention that the 
london skyline has suffered more damage from architects city 
planners and developers than from german bombers in world war ii 
in a vision of britain a book he published last year 
charles accused some modern architects of creating frankenstein 
monsters devoid of character alien and largely unloved he says 
some new buildings in london remind him of word processors or 
nuclear power plants 
honored at the banquet was architect fay jones of fayetteville 
ark a former pupil of frank lloyd wright who won the aias 
prestigious gold medal bush presented the award to jones at a 
white house ceremony after the lunch for charles 
the prince will end a weeklong us tour on friday when he 
meets with american environmental experts at the british embassy 
before he returns to london 
charles began his visit last weekend by playing in two benefit 
polo matches at vero beach fla he met wednesday with 100 
corporate executives in charleston sc to promote private 
investment in poor urban neighborhoods and plead for business 
cooperation in protecting the environment

after two months of official silence the 
episcopal churchs presiding bishop said a newark colleague was 
wrong to ordain a practicing homosexual who later made embarrassing 
remarks about jesus christ and mother teresa 
the rev edmond l browning who has refrained from comment on 
the ordination of j robert williams released a statement to 
church officials critical of the ordination handled by newark 
bishop john s spong 
in the statement made public this week browning the top 
episcopal official in the united states said he and his council of 
advice disassociate themselves from the ordination but not 
from the many members of our church who are gay and lesbian 
williams raised controversy five weeks after his dec 16 
ordination by belittling church teachings on celibacy and monogamy 
in a speech 
he has told reporters he believed christ had a gay lover and has 
implied that mother teresa would be better off if she had sex 
williams 34 told a detroit church panel in january that 
monogamy and celibacy are unnatural and made the remark about 
mother teresa a roman catholic nun who has received a nobel prize 
for her work with the poor in response to questions from a church 
official 
the remark about christ was made to a church group in texas 
conservative church critics have demanded spongs resignation 
saying he violated a church resolution against admitting practicing 
homosexuals to the clergy 
until williams controversial remarks spong had defended the 
ordination as a way to make the church more inclusive but after 
the remarks were publicized spong asked williams to keep silent 
and refrain from functioning as a priest while the diocese 
investigates whether williams misrepresented his views during the 
lengthy ordination process 
national church spokesman jim solheim said the bishops objected 
to the way spong heralded his intention to ordain an openly gay 
priest thus polarizing the church community as a result 
practicing gays have been ordained before but very quietly 
the objection to spong is to his style its to the way he did 
it solheim said 
spong who is on sabbatical until march 1 was unavailable for 
comment

legal challenges to the states urban 
pesticide spraying program cropped up like pesky medflies on 
thursday as officials in los angeles burbank glendale and 
pasadena moved to stop the rain of malathion 
under orders from the los angeles city council city attorney 
james hahn filed a superior court lawsuit seeking an immediate halt 
to the helicopter missions to eradicate the mediterranean fruit fly 
the lawsuit filed jointly with the cities of burbank and 
glendale seeks a court order halting the spraying missions it 
names gov george deukmejian the state department of food and 
agriculture department director henry voss and the county board of 
supervisors as defendants 
it alleges the malathion missions violate residents civil 
rights because the public has a right to be free of toxic chemical 
risks to their health 
agriculture officials maintain the pesticide is safe and warn 
that the medfly if established could produce annual losses of 
200 million to the states agricultural industry 
the lawsuit also contends that the agriculture department has 
violated pest eradication statutes requiring that nonpesticide 
alternatives be used before officials resort to spraying in 
addition the chopper sorties violate public nuisance regulations 
by creating excessive noise and damaging property the suit alleges 
the city of pasadena planned to file an amicus brief supporting 
the lawsuit 
deukmejian met in pasadena on thursday with pasadena and 
glendale city officials but the discussion yielded no agreements 
on the pesticide program or on a provocative new pasadena ordinance 
prohibiting lowlevel helicopter flights at night 
the republican governor said he was confident the cities suits 
would fail addingthe courts have consistently supported the 
position taken by the state 
meanwhile the private natural resources defense council and a 
host of state legislators filed a second superior court action 
challenging deukmejians state of emergency decree enabling 
officials to spray the medflykilling pesticide over 400 square 
miles of los angeles and orange counties 
helicopters were to take to the skies again thursday night to 
blanket a 30squaremile area of the verdugo hills in burbank and 
glendale as part of the states 30 million medfly eradication 
campaign 
in pasadena city attorney victor kaleta said he was awaiting a 
police report that could enable him to file criminal misdemeanor 
complaints against six helicopter pilots who conducted a spraying 
mission over the city early thursday 
the private pesticide sortie entered city air space at 1255 
am thursday it was tracked flying at 500 feet violating a new 
city ordinance that bans helicopterr flights below 700 feet 
a police helicopter pilot contacted the formation informed its 
pilots they were violating the ordinance and ordered them to cease 
and desist the pilots acknowledged they were in violation but 
continued spraying 
the police pilot flew to the helicopter base at el monte and 
informed the pilots that police would seek the complaints said lt 
gregg henderson 
with sufficient evidence katela said his office could file 
complaints possibly next week the maximum penalty for violating 
the ordinance is a 1000 fine and a year in jail 
but the federal aviation administration has said that only it 
can enforce laws regarding civil air traffic and attorneys from 
the agency have met with katela said faa spokeswoman elly brekke 
we told him it was our interpretation that their ordinance was 
preempted by federal law said brekke citing the supremacy 
clause of the us constitution 
she said that under rules regarding crop dusting aircraft and 
aircraft for hire there is no minimum altitude at which they 
must fly the rules say the pilot must fly the helicopter in such a 
way that if there were an emergency aboard the aircraft the pilot 
would be able to land the aircraft safely said brekke 
the bottom line is that the altitude is at the pilots 
discretion she said 
in addition to the los angeles lawsuit the orange county cities 
of garden grove huntington beach and westminster have sued in 
superior court 
a judge refused their request to stop spraying immediately but 
ordered the state to provide more information on malathion 
the legal aid society of orange county filed suit in federal 
court arguing the spraying violates the civil rights of homeless 
people who are unable to take health precautions if they are doused 
with pesticide 
the medfly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits 
vegetables and nuts grown in california the crops are destroyed 
when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat their way out

the 1980s ended with the lowest annual traffic 
death rate ever capping a decade in which many americans declared 
war on drunken driving and began using longneglected safety belts 
federal officials say 
the 1989 fatality rate was 22 deaths per 100 million miles 
traveled down from 23 the previous year and onethird lower than 
the 1980 rate of 33 the national highway traffic safety 
administration reported 
fatalities in 1989 are estimated at 45500 compared with 47093 
in 1988 final numbers for last year are still being tallied but 
are unlikely to change significantly officials said 
the reduction in traffic deaths during the 1980s reflects our 
national resolve against drunk driving increased safety belt use 
and a generally heightened awareness of highway safety

a record medical malpractice award is 
causing some west virginia obstetricians to turn away new patients 
and consider leaving the state where their ranks already have been 
halved in five years 
some will probably leave if they get a chance i would 
leave dr ujjal sandhu said thursday i dont want to worry 
about losing my shirt the patients will have to go out of state 
just like the doctors are leaving 
a county jury in charleston last week awarded a couple 1525 
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a 
caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their newborn it was 
the states highest malpractice award against an obstetrician 
mark and julie robinson of cabin creek about 15 miles east of 
charleston said dr kanoj k biswas a charleston obstetrician 
should have performed the caesarean section on july 31 1987 after

up the street a barker holds open the door 
for a peek at the nude dancer grinding away on a table top another 
show is advertised as the french orgy and the sign at the female 
impersonators club says boys will be girls 
music blasts from the bars and the tshirt shops tourists dance 
in the street drinks in hand 
bourbon street is in full swing and so is the gospel and blues 
tent where sherman washington and the zion harmonizers are raising 
their voices in tight harmony while the crowd raises theirs in 
approval 
its wonderful the people really get into it they shout and 
carry on its a real joy said washington 
after years in churches and concert halls gospel has found a 
new home in a cabaret setting on bourbon street the same people 
who pay to hear dixieland and cajun pay to hear the traditional 
black religious music 
its sure not church but i think everyone has a good time 
listening to us washington said 
accompanied by a guitar and drums and sometimes keyboards 
tambourine and base the zion harmonizers sing the same songs you 
can hear in black churches and tents across the united states 
the handclapping music an integral part of new orleans 
musical heritage includes many of the standards such as closer 
walk but other numbers are less well known 
we have our own way of singing our own style of harmonizing 
you cant listen to it long without clapping your hands its what 
you would call an upbeat sound washington said 
the introduction of gospel to rowdy bourbon street was made this 
winter by ian hardcastle a white canadian who doesnt sing it and 
didnt even know about it a decade ago 
id never seen a gospel group then in 1972 i visited the jazz 
fest and heard it for the first time that alone made me want to 
move to new orleans hardcastle said 
a real estate developer who restored historic buildings in 
canada hardcastle moved south to live parttime in 1987 he now 
divides his time between the french quarter and toronto 
hardcastles love of gospel produced the blues and gospel tent 
on the site of the old pete fountain club 
for a 3 cover fans can listen to gospel from 8 pm to 10 
pm and to the blues from 10 pm to midnight the tent which is 
actually a large enclosed courtyard serves mixed drinks but no 
food although a sunday gospel brunch is being added 
it might seem a little funny to some people to have us singing 
gospel in a place like bourbon street but who knows maybe it 
gets a different kind of spirit into folks the lord works in 
mysterious ways and i dont think he minds us making music 
whereever we are said washington 
although washington 63 developed his music in church and the 
zion harmonizers were started by a baptist minister their 
performances and those of the other groups that play at the tent 
are strictly that performances 
washington knew the potential he is one of the organizers of 
the gospel tent the always crowded arena at the annual new orleans 
jazz and heritage festival three new orleans gospel choirs rotate 
at the club 
its not religious i dont have a pulpit up front i dont 
think people come here for religion i think they come for the 
music but what they get out of it is up to them hardcastle said 
after 10 pm such groups as the zion harmonizers give way to 
singers such as irma thomas and marva wright and the blues 
its an easy transition hardcastle said i think both are 
sort of the roots of american music 
and if tourists feel more comfortable with the blues when they 
start out gospel seems to be gaining ground with them 
i see them being sort of stiff when we start out but before 
you know it everybody is moving and tapping their feet with us 
their bodies just start in doing it before they know whats going 
on said washington

bit by bit putting it together bit by bit 
only way to make a work of art 
these lyrics from stephen sondheims sunday in the park with 
george have a special resonance in london these days as the 
royal national theater puts together the british bow of one of the 
most haunting and innovative musicals of the 1980s 
sunday in the park dared to dramatize the artists 
imagination in a show that couldnt be more removed from mainstream 
broadway fare it won the 1985 pulitzer prize for drama a rare 
accolade for a musical 
sondheim promised that the british version will be very 
different the composerlyricist was recently in britain where he 
talked about the new production with students at oxford university 
the new york show starred mandy patinkin as georges seurat the 
french pointillist master whose 188486 painting a sunday 
afternoon on the island of la grande jatte is the musicals 
centerpiece 
australian performer philip quast inherits the part in london 
opposite maria friedman as seurats mistress dot a role 
originated by bernadette peters on broadway 
its broadway director librettist james lapine has turned to 
movies so the show which opens march 15 at the nationals 
lyttelton auditorium is being staged by steven pimlott a 
cambridge graduate best known for directing opera and the classics 
in an interview before starting rehearsals pimlott said his 
task was to embrace on the one hand seurats painting and on the 
other the traditions of the broadway musical 
he and designer tom cairns flew to the united states in october 
to see the canvas at the art institute of chicago 
he did it for the creative stimulus id have felt very odd 
doing this piece not having seen the painting pimlott said 
its a fabulous picture a fun picture not least because the 
chicago art institute makes so much of it i think seurats 
bathers at asnieres is at least as good a painting but we dont 
make quite as much of a fuss at the national gallery 
the first act of the musical takes place over a series of 
sundays from 1884 to 1886 as seurat works on his painting using 
his distinctive style of dabbing dots of color onto the canvas so 
that when viewed from a distance they will form a picture 
it ends with a memorable theatrical flourish as the actors 
position themselves like the figures on the canvas 
the second act set in presentday new york invents a 
greatgrandson for seurat an artist also named george suffering 
the double burden of an imposing ancestry and creative blockage 
trying to emulate his greatgrandfathers genius with color and 
light george invents a chromolume a bizarre contraption that 
ricochets laserbeams around the theater 
this second act was problematic the infamous second act 
jokes pimlott because some broadway audiences werent sure 
whether this experiment in hightech pointillism was a serious 
artistic statement or a joke so pimlott has turned his george into 
a performance artist working with humans not machines 
he has hired martin duncan a wellknown actordirector in 
british fringe theater to stage a brief performance piece 
involving four actors 
it is the third musical produced at the 26yearold national 
one of britains two flagship statesubsidized theaters the first 
guys and dolls was a hit that went on to the commercial west 
end 
but the second marvin hamlischs jean seberg directed by 
peter hall was a critical and financial flop 
sunday in the park will run for 16 weeks playing a full 
eight performances a week this is unusual for a repertory theater 
its top ticket price of 20 pounds about 33 is a record high for 
the threetheater complex 
it is the second of three sondheim shows to be seen in london 
this year a commercial revival of a little night music closed 
feb 17 on the west end into the woods his most recent 
broadway show opens sept 25 and will star julia mckenzie

financial news network 
his forum fnns focus series but the topics wont be the 
state of rock his 25 years of innovation and playful experiments 
in music or any kind of music at all they are however in the 
zappa tradition eclectic 
tonights show concerns four opportunities for us business in 
the soviet union he taped the segments during a trip five weeks 
ago to moscow paris and czechoslovakia where he met the countrys 
new president vaclav havel 
one segment he says details how tass the official soviet news

now a comentator on national public radio about news as a business 
zappa who once described himself as a 
composerslashbusinessman despite his rock roots and such gonzo 
classics as weasels ripped my flesh concedes some may think it 
weird hes appearing on fnn 
i think part of the reason people think its so odd is the 
name of the venue he says of fnn which says it is seen in 33 
million homes and offices financial news network sounds pretty 
gray and corporate 
he cheerfully admits high finance is not his bag all i know 
of the stock market is that its all voodoo and that the best 
thing thats happened in this part of the 20th century is that 
drexel burnham selfdestructed 
but fnn he says is starting to offer programming in the 
evening hours that aims at a broader audience than tunes in for its 
daytime reports on wall street and world finance 
he cites focuswhose host bob berkowitz is off on a book 
tour as such a broaderaudience program he says he first appeared 
on it two months ago talking about doing business with the soviet 
union 
despite his recent nonmusical expeditions zappa 49 is still 
busy with his music and says hes working on two new albums he 
also has overseen the transfer of his 50 other albums to compact 
discs for release this year 
and he has written his first television score for outrage at 
valdez a cousteau society special on the exxon valdez oil spill 
ted turners tbs cable network will show the program march 25 
after wednesday zappa plans to return home to north hollywood 
cal and finish editing the tape he shot in czechoslovakia where 
he has a cult following during that nations joyous process of 
liberalization 
the footage he says will be made into a onehour show that 
great britains itn network has bought for showing on londons 
channel four in june just before czechoslovakias presidential 
elections 
his show will be part of a sixhour extravaganza called an 
evening of revolutionary entertainment he says 
like his music videos zappas prague program eventually will 
wind up for sale distributed by a chicago company called mpi inc 
his tv marketing company has a somewhat more interesting name 
its called honker home video he says solemnly explaining 
its named after my nose 
 
elsewhere in television 
havel feted vaclav havel the czech 
playwrightturnedpresident will be saluted by new yorks leading 
artistic figures in a pbs special airing thursday night the

ignatius balistrieri a city sanitation worker 
for 31 years remembers the days when milwaukees snowcovered 
streets were plowed using horses and buggies 
the men would stand in back and fan the sand mixture onto the 
road he says 
but while snow falls the way it always has the methods for 
removing it have evolved into a hightech multimilliondollar 
enterprise stretching across the northern united states 
cities in the midwest northeast and midatlantic each winter 
spend millions of dollars keeping streets and walkways clean 
advancing technology has made the job easier improved snowplows 
have reduced the number of workers needed to clear roads 
hydraulicpowered plows on road salt trucks can be operated by one 
person for example while the older plows required at least two 
workers to maneuver 
and road trucks sanding slippery roads now use saltsand 
mixtures and chemicals like liquid calcium chloride which speed up 
the melting process in place of traditional sand 
but the new technology also has made the task more expensive 
milwaukee spent 4 million to plow and salt 1400 miles of road 
in 1988 compared with 2 million in 1984 even though the city 
received 13 more inches of snow in 1984 than 1988 balistrieri said 
milwaukee averages about 49 inches of snowfall each winter and 
city officials always are prepared to clear at least that much 
but erratic winters in washington dc which budgets about 
25 million annually for snow removal have made it hard to 
forecast whats needed said tara hamilton of the public works 
department 
after the 1987 winter when we got 20 inches of snow in four 
days we pretty much made up our minds that we were going to be a 
snow city and invest in the resources needed for that she said 
but since november less than 13 inches has fallen according to 
the national weather service 
its hard to have a typical winter in washington ms 
hamilton said officials in buffalo ny which averages 92 inches 
a year already have exceeded their budget for road salts this 
year but not because the city has gotten too much snow said 
street commissioner james makowski 
its the minor snowfalls that kill us makowski said we 
get a quarterinch and go out and salt then get another 
quarterinch dropping a couple of hours later and have to go salt 
again 
buffalo which budgets about 35 million a year for snow 
removal used 9500 tons of salt from thanksgiving to dec 19 in 
1988 and 23800 tons for the same period in 1989 he said 
minneapolis spent about 4 million plowing 1057 miles of 
streets last winter and has experimented this winter with new 
equipment that can plow more area at a time said street 
maintenance engineer bob otto minnesotas average snowfall is 49 
inches a year 
although homeowners dont spend millions on snow removal they 
too are looking for easier ways to clear their front doors 
driveways and sidewalks 
walkbehind or riding snowthrowers with a price range of 350 to 
1700 are becoming household items manufacturers say 
retailers ordered 543000 snowthrowers in 1988 compared with 
348000 in 1984 said john liskey of the outdoor power equipment 
institute near washington dc 
snowthrowers arent seen as a luxury item anymore said chad 
kelly marketing manager for the toro co in bloomington minn 
were seeing more planned purchases 
when toro first manufactured snow removal equipment about 30 
years ago it sold only a gaspowered walkbehind snowplow kelly 
said 
weve come a long way he said noting consumers can now 
choose from dozens of models and sizes of snowthrowers that can 
toss snow more than 35 feet there also are rotating electrical 
brooms and power shovels 
women and older people who might find conventional snow 
shoveling too strenuous are being targeted as potential customers 
its a very competitive business and very volatile kelly 
said when it snows people come out in droves to buy the product 
and it can be very profitable but when it doesnt snow theyre 
hard to sell 
most parts of the nation experienced a mild winter last year 
leaving retailers with large leftover inventories that should cut 
demand for products this year by 10 percent liskey said 
kelly said he doesnt foresee any inventions in the near future 
that will radically change snow removal although improvements are 
likely for many of the current products 
i think products will continue to be made lighter and easier 
to use he said 
but he said i dont see any laser technology that blasts the 
snow off your driveway in three seconds

john lurie keeps popping up in the strangest 
places like right before that ad for the clapper or right 
after the one for zamfir master of the pan flute 
hello im john lurie he begins softly and i want you to 
know now you can listen to the very strange and very beautiful 
music of the lounge lizards here in america just like people in 
other lands 
and you can by dialing 180044chunk the lounge lizards 
whose sound was once likened to a holiday inn band on acid are 
now available by dialing the same operators in omaha neb who 
take orders for the latest from slim whitman boxcar willie and 
richard clayderman 
so how does lurie a hipster 
saxophonistactorsongwriterscreenwriter and bandleader wind up 
sharing latenight tv space with the vegomatic 
i had to do it i had no other choice he explained recently 
in his cluttered manhattan apartment what else am i going to do 
with my life what else i could buy a condo or i could put my 
record out 
the record voice of chunk is available now 1199 for 
cassette 1499 for compact disc the ads began airing this month 
in selected markets and nationally on vh1 in one lurie appears 
as a tall thin twisted version of the pitchman who once asked if 
you remembered the polovtsian dance theme number two 
if youre like me you like to receive things through the 
mail maybe its because it makes me feel less lonely lurie says 
in another of the 30second spots listen thats the new lounge 
lizards record voice of chunk and now you can receive it 
through the mail 
the ads approach but dont quite reach parody which is what 
lurie had in mind when he decided last year to produce and market 
the record himself fears that some people wouldnt get it were 
heightened in the first days after the feb 1 air debut the lounge 
lizard said 
there was a week 10 days of absolute terror it was running 
on tv and it looked bad and it wasnt selling said lurie 
holding a cigarette in one hand while rattling dice in the other 
i was losing my mind 
orders are now coming in every day and lurie is finding the 
experience far more pleasurable than dealing with record company 
weasels the saxophonist who formed the lizards in 1979 has 
nothing good to say about major labels obviously the music im 
doing is better than what theyre putting out its just not as 
saleable 
so hes selling it himself which he has found provides a 
certain instant gratification 
you go down to the mailbox and theres all these orders 
there its not like the record company telling you well yes 
you sold 60 records today you go downstairs and theres 50 60 
checks in the mail he said its like the good old days when 
the band used to get paid in cash 
while the ads are showing up in strange places its not unusual 
for lurie to do the same thing his band was in brazil last year to 
headline a jazz festival he was in morocco to play st james in 
the last temptation of christ hes starred in a pair of 
lowbudget critically hailed jim jarmusch films hes planning a 
japanese tour with the lizards this spring 
the eightpiece band while a relative nonentity in the united 
states is a sensation in europe japan and south america it once 
bothered lurie but he now accepts his limited american audience as 
a function of the us music business 
in france or in germany were really the new geniuses of jazz 
though i still dont know if its jazz or not he said were 
hailed and we play to 10000 people in japan its a whole 
different deal 
and then you come back to america and its like the air is 
taken out of your sails the success of music in the united 
states is really inversely proportional to its quality im really 
beginning to believe that 
lurie risked a large chunk of change on the lizards fifth 
album and hes considered the possibilities either way if the 
album sells or if the album stiffs 
if it really works ill make so much money i mean i heard 
zamfir is a millionaire he said i read it in the wall street 
journal so it must be true 
and if it doesnt 
im really ruined im going to be so broke youre going to 
be seeing me on a lot of tv shows

the recycling industry which quietly went 
about its business for decades suddenly has been thrust into the 
spotlight as everyone scrambles to become recycle friendly 
one industry report estimates more than 2 billion will be spent 
across the nation for recycling equipment over the next five years 
to keep up with the enormous interest 
two years ago the national solid wastes management association 
featured only two recycling waste trucks at its annual convention 
at the most recent convention there were 27 models 
supermarkets are collecting plastic grocery sacks for recycling 
procter amp gamble co a leading maker of consumer products has 
started introducing plastic and paper containers taking advantage 
of recycled materials 
walmart stores inc a leading retailer has begun tagging 
shelves to inform shoppers about recycled materials and other 
environmentally conscious products 
i have been in this business a long time and i have never 
seen anything like whats going on today said john veidt a 
20year veteran of the recycling business who runs the reclamation 
division of clayton mobased jefferson smurfit corp 
for a century the recycling industry has pretty much operated 
on its own chugging along on a supplymeetsdemand basis with 
about 2000 member companies of the national association of 
recycling industries 
but the 1980s brought big changes most notably the involvement 
of government which created unprecedented expansion opportunities 
generally i think industry is recognizing that recycling is 
just good business said richard keller a spokesman for the 
national recycling coalition and chairman of the groups 
subcommittee on market development 
the government at every level has become a major player in 
supplying raw materials that need to be recycled mandating the use 
of recycled products and buying the products 
in the fall of 1986 13 states had legislation favoring the use 
of recycled products today that number has grown to 34 with laws 
affecting 17 out of every 20 americans the coalition says 
one measure of the markets growth is the official recycled 
products guide 
the first edition published by robert boulanger in april 1989 
listed 177 products made with recycled materials mostly paper 
products in nine months the number of listings has climbed to 
1500 now the new yorkbased guide includes building 
construction landscaping rubber and plastic products 
keller remembers the days in the early 80s when he could do his 
seminars on developing markets for recycled items in a phone 
booth and have room left over 
today everybody is interested he said 
that interest has been good and bad the paper side of the 
business is oversupplied the glass side is undersupplied 
the dilemma we have ourselves in is that we have the 
collection process geared up and hot but its going to be three 
years before we are ready to start using the material said 
veidt of jefferson smurfit the nations largest collector of waste 
paper 
veidt said jefferson smurfit which also makes paper cardboard 
and plastic containers is among those papermakers looking to 
expand the company wants to build a new plant devoted completely 
to recycling newsprint he said 
jefferson smurfit also recently announced a joint venture with 
waste management of north america to collect waste paper that will 
boost the companys collection to more than 4 million tons a year 
more than three times its nearest competitor 
many other large paper companies in the united states and canada 
plan to build mills closer to cities or urban forests to 
exploit the abundance of waste paper 
the supply glut has dropped prices for a ton of used newspapers 
to alltime lows and tons of the stuff are sitting in warehouses 
in some parts of the country people have to pay to drop off their 
newspapers veidt said 
the glass industry faces the opposite problem glass makers 
would like to increase the percentage of waste glass used in the 
manufacture of new containers but supplies are tight 
interest in waste glass recently was heightened by the success 
of an anchor glass plant in connellsville pa which ran on 
nothing but used glass for seven weeks said chas miller a 
spokesman for the glass packaging institute in washington 
i loved to be able to run all our plants using 60 percent of 
cullet used glass but we cant get the supply said austin 
fiore regional manager of recycling and public affairs for 
owensbrockway glass containers inc a division of owensillinois 
inc 
fiore who is based in philadephia said the companys 24 plants 
around the country are capable of using 85 percent used glass but 
can find only enough clear glass to use between 22 percent and 45 
percent 
experts differ on how profitable the recycling business will be

offyear elections usually are lean years for 
the party that holds the white house but republicans think they 
can break the pattern in 1990 and gain enough senate strength to 
bid for renewed control in 1992 
to do it theyll have to add at least one or two to their 
current 45seat minority reversing the odds that confront a 
presidents party with the liklihood of losses in the congressional 
elections between presidential campaigns 
that and house redistricting make the nov 6 elections crucial 
in shaping congressional politics for the rest of the century the 
36 governors and the legislatures being chosen this year will 
control the redrawing of congressional districts based on the 1990 
cenus the political jackpot is going to be who gets to draw the 
lines come 1991 vice president dan quayle says 
it all comes together in 1992 when president bush presumably 
will be seeking a second term the new house districts will be in 
effect for the first time and senate control could be within the 
reach of republican challengers 
the house is too democratic and incumbents too strong for 
there to be any nearterm prospect of a change in the control the 
democrats have held for 34 years they now have 85 seats more than 
the republicans and the presidents party has not gained house 
seats in a midterm election since 1934 
if 1992 is a good year for republicans and we do well in 1990 
then we stand to gain immeasurably in political terms quayle 
said in a recent interview so this is a year to really establish 
the foundation 
that wont be done easily republicans have 18 senate seats at 
risk this year democrats 16 only three incumbents have announced 
they are retiring and all are republicans but the gop is almost 
certain to hold one of those seats in new hampshire and is in 
good position to recapture the others in idaho and colorado 
overall quayle says the republicans have a better crop of 
challengers this time on a comparative basis than weve ever 
had that includes a halfdozen house members risking those seats 
to run against democratic senators the democrats on the other 
hand have seen some of their most promising challengers step aside 
for 1990 
in two states where republican senators would have been heavy 
favorites anyhow they may not have a thing to worry about 
virginia democrats have not found a candidate to oppose sen 
john w warner who says he would accept that decision with 
humility and campaign anyhow 
nor is there significant opposition so far to republican sen 
strom thurmond of south carolina 87 and seeking a seventh term in 
the senate he entered as a democrat he switched parties in 1964 
democratic sen david pryor of arkansas has no announced 
opponents either in his bid for a virtually certain third term 
campaigns like those are typical with incumbents strong and 
challengers facing long odds some will tighten toward upsets most 
will run to form 
the 1990 senate battlegrounds will include iowa illinois 
michigan and rhode island with democratic incumbents and kentucky 
and south dakota where republican senators seek new terms sen 
dan coats of indiana appointed to succeed quayle is running in 
his first statewide election challenged by a democratic state 
representative thats a long shot for the democrats but it will 
be a target they would delight in capturing the vice presidents 
old senate seat as they won the seat he and coats once held in the 
house 
the battle for the senate itself likely will wait at least two 
years with the democrats up 55 to 45 it would take republicans an 
improbable fiveseat offyear gain to get to the tie the vice 
presidents vote would make into a gop majority but the erosion of 
republican senate strength over the past three elections is 
ironically one basis for gop optimism this time offyear swings 
against the white house party usually occur because of the 
vulnerability of firstterm members elected on the coattails of the 
winning presidential candidate the major impact is in the house 
with twoyear terms rather than the senate with six 
but democrats have not sustained a net loss of senate seats in 
any election since 1980 when the republicans gained a dozen and 
captured the control they held for the next six years 
twenty seats now held by democratic senators will be up for 
election in 1992 while republicans will have to defend 14 bushs 
name atop the ticket should help gop senate candidates although he 
showed no coattail strength in the 1988 elections 
then again the voters may prefer the lineup of power the way it 
stands now an nbc newswall street journal poll conducted last 
month found 63 percent of those surveyed think it is better to have 
different parties controlling congress and the white house and 
only 24 percent want both branches in the same political hands

as alice said in wonderland it gets curiouser 
and curiouser in another context future shock is already here

im having trouble absorbing the news these days 
history now seems to march in exclamation marks irony abounds 
the time machine looks warped credulity is stretched and you cant 
tell the players with a score card 
the cold war ends in a strange admixture reviving both the 
fears of world war ii about a triumphant germany and the hopes of 
world war i about a world made safe for democracy 
now a wildly cheering congress greets the president of the new 
and independent czechoslovakia who was in prison four months ago 
it was an american president woodrow wilson who created 
czechoslovakia in the first place before it was swallowed by 
hitler and shackled by stalin 
and here is vaclav havel out from the soviet shadow telling 
the government of the united states that the best way it could help 
his country and the world was to help the soviet union on the 
immensely complicated road to democracy 
in this way says the man from a recent slave state the cold 
war can be replaced by an era in which all of us large and 
small former slaves and former masters will be able to create 
what your great president lincoln called the family of man 
this is but the latest in a racing river of change 
in the first joyous rush west after the berlin wall came down 
it seemed unseemly to recall that the last time there was a unified 
germany it tore the world apart in the 45 years since hitler was 
smashed western and eastern europe mostly worried about each 
other now both seem to be on tiptoe looking for a polite way to 
get a guarantee of peace from the merging germanys 
said an east german official our friendly neighbors should 
understand the desire of germans for reunification said foreign 
minister roland dumas of france germans should also understand 
the worries of their friendly neighbors 
for most of the cold war years the vocabulary of the kremlin 
seemed to be limited to one word nyet now suddenly we find the 
moscow leadership agreeing on a thursday to what it positively 
opposed on wednesday there are days when dour bolsheviks sound 
like friendly rotarians 
the two superpowers whose mutual enmity kept the world nervous 
for four decades now seem like one and a half superpowers maybe 
less the soviets appear to be shrinking in a sea of troubles and 
after panama uncle sam looks less than a giant astride the planet 
germany appears to dominate the thoughts of the old world drugs 
command the attention of the new 
in washington the mayor of the capital of the united states is 
indicted for possessing cocaine and lying about his drug 
connections on the same day in colombia the president of the 
united states seeks ways to stop cocaine smuggling from south 
america 
in miami a sullen little man with an utterly resistible 
personality awaits trial on charges of cocaine trafficking getting 
him to trial took 12000 us soldiers scores of planes and ships 
and the lives of 23 americans and several hundred panamanians the 
world was also treated to the picture of american fighting men 
trying to flush out their quarry with thunderous rock music 
in colombia four presidents agree on the need to find other 
crops for andean farmers to grow instead of coca from which 
cocaine derives president bush promises to try to expand us 
markets for coffee and cut flowers 
will the next marshall plan be designed to stop coca not 
communism dope peddlers not agents of karl marx or will the next 
cold war be fought with midget mercenaries dropped from the air in 
an accelerated secret program the us department of agriculture 
was reported studying the killing power of malumbia an inchlong 
white moth which in its caterpillar stage adores dining on the 
green leaves of coca plants 
the cocaine summit was guarded by warships frogmen highspeed 
patrol boats swarms of helicopters at least one submarine and 
5000 security agents on land all were there to protect the 
commander in chief of the united states and his confreres against 
the gangsters of colombia who we are told now hone their public 
image with the aid of public relations consultants 
in other areas rife with strife nelson mandela of south africa 
said that toward the end of his 27 years in prison his jailers let 
him see old don ameche movies a new york judge ruled that to deny 
a beggar the chance to beg is to deny him his right of free speech

the roof is back on charlie 
wills gas station pat rice is back in his house and it takes a 
second look to see the scars that an ira bomb left on mariann 
coopers face 
the scars on the town though are still raw a hole next to the 
police barracks on charlotte st where a hardware store and mrs 
coopers home once stood the for sale signs on two boardedup 
houses the flowers outside the police station for joanne reilly 
killed in her 20th year 
warrenpoint about 40 miles south of belfast and just across the 
border from the irish republic has been through this before but 
it has become a microcosm of the personal tragedy faced by people 
and towns in northern irelands 20 years of fighting between the 
forces loyal to britain and the partisans of irish unity 
the news reports and broadcasts tell of the death and 
destruction time passes and then the people are alone in their 
mourning and loss 
more than 2700 people had been killed before joanne reilly was 
killed in warrenpoint last april 12 while warrenpoint has tried to 
rebuild 47 more have died in northern ireland 
the british government last year paid out 116 million pounds 
the equivalent of 197 million at current exchange rates in 
compensation for personal injuries caused by the conflict and 206 
million pounds 35 million for property damage according to the 
northern ireland office 
mariann cooper had been about 50 feet away from a bomb big 
enough to damage houses a mile away she is now deaf in her left 
ear has only partial sight in her left eye and faces more plastic 
surgery on her face 
that explosion at 10 minutes to 10 on a wednesday morning is 
like a videotape running and rerunning in her head 
thats the only way i can explain it she said 
she keeps a big folder of newspaper clippings about the 
disaster and insists she wants to forget 
having said forget id like people to remember it happened 
why it happened it happened for no reason 
mrs cooper is a roman catholic her husband stuart is a 
protestant living through a conflict that has pitted catholic 
against protestant 
it doesnt make a difference in warrenpoint cooper said 
the bomb that disrupted their lives was packed into a stolen 
toyota van that was driven into a yard behind the heatley and 
morgan hardware store next to the police barracks 
miss reilly working in the back of the store was killed 
instantly at least two dozen people were injured badly enough to 
require hospital treatment and 32 families were put out of their 
homes the daisy hill hospital was already receiving the wounded 
when the irish republican army gave its first telephone warning 
the ira later said the bomb exploded prematurely and offered 
sincerest apologies to the bereaved and the injured 
even if we had two hours notice and cleared the entire town 
of warrenpoint you still would have had 364 premises damaged 
said jim mccart a member of the county council 
thats one of every six homes in warrenpoint a town of 5600 
people 85 percent of whom including the dead woman are 
catholics its a stronghold of support for the social democratic 
and labor party which rejects violence but shares the iras goal 
of a united ireland 
the bomb did little damage to the police barracks which is 
surrounded by high walls and barbed wire and is protected from 
mortars and missiles by a steel roof 
charlotte st was a happy enough street everybody got along 
with everybody said rice who had spent a decade renovating his 
house across the street from the police station 
warrenpoint had been hit before the crown hotel was bombed and 
is just a vacant lot the ulster bar and the post office were 
rebuilt after bombings the seven steps hotel along the shore 
of carlingford lough is still charred and gaping 
an ira bomb outside town near the ruins of narrow water castle 
killed 18 british soldiers aug 27 1979 the same day another ira 
bomb killed earl mountbatten of burma a cousin of queen elizabeth 
ii 
after the latest attack people supported each other a lot 
said richard black of the social services office in nearby newry 
there was a great groundswell of opinion in warrenpoint that 
they were quite determined to get on with life and live as 
normally as possible and that did gel a lot of the families 
together 
the flip side of determination though is resignation

weve learned to live with it black said i think people 
have become very weary as well there seems to be no light at the 
end of the tunnel 
among the flowers that still cover joanne reillys hilltop grave 
in st peters cemetery are two small potted pines one with a tiny 
santa claus and a big display saying happy birthday sis 
before her 21st birthday sept 24 relatives and friends filled 
three columns of the newry reporter newspaper with memorials 
beneath a picture of a lively smiling darkhaired young woman 
were poems from her parents ann and paul her brothers paul and 
martin her pal michelle her boyfriend sean her aunts and uncles 
and cousins paul reillys message said my heart still aches i 
whisper low god bless you sis i love you so 
the hardware store and the coopers house will not be rebuilt 
one other house may be demolished joanne reillys grandmother is 
among those who have not moved back to charlotte st 
just after the bombing geraldine mcshane advertised a bomb 
damage sale at the pick n mix shop on charlotte st in the 
summer she had a going out of business sale 
well i would say the bomb was 50 percent responsible she 
said no one was coming down that side at all after the bomb 
the government compensated her for the soft toys that couldnt 
be sold because they were full of splintered glass 
the bomb blew the roof off wills gas station and caused him 
two months of anxiety for himself and his three employees three 
important jobs in a town where unemployment is estimated to 
approach 25 percent 
its just like it was maybe better it is indeed he said 
we just renovated the place while were at it its not like i 
wanted but well get there 
aunty chris caulfield is still selling cigarettes and candy 
in her chilly shop across the street but complained business is 
terrible 
charlie burns had insisted that no bomb would dislodge him from 
his barber shop where he was born 85 years ago but then a long 
illness changed his mind 
oh i hated to sell it i loved being on the square because 
no one could build in front of you said burns 
his father and his grandfather had worked in the shop which had 
one parlor for businessmen and another for grimy longshoremen and 
other laborers a basin and cabinets from burns shop are now part 
of the remodeled decor at bennetts pub where burns is a valued 
regular 
stuart cooper said his family salvaged one sweater and the cat 
from the ruins of their 118yearold house moving increased their 
mortgage from 40000 pounds about 68000 to 65000 pounds about 
110000 
no one close to mariann cooper had ever been hurt in the 
troubles but she wasnt surprised when her turn came 
i always felt that it had gone on for so long something was 
bound to happen she said it cant pass by your door for 20 
years

constantin surescu a 70yearold 
farmer stood in the wreckage of the house fingering pieces of 
brick and the yellow balustrade that nicolae ceausescus police had 
ordered him to destroy 
what he couldnt destroy himself a bulldozer finished off all 
but a single room but even then surescu wouldnt leave for 
months he his wife and others huddled in the candlelit room 
that had been spared surviving the freezing winter with only a 
small charcoal stove 
ceausescu had destroyed their lives and their village as part of 
his plan to move romanias rural population into big concentrated 
towns 
when ceausescu was overthrown dec 22 and executed with his 
wife three days later surescus family laughed and cried for joy 
but the nightmare for surescu and dozens of neighbors in the 
village of cornetu 13 miles west of bucharest didnt end 
it would have been better if god had taken me surescu said 
clutching a color photograph of the large wellkept beige house 
with relief designs he moved into in 1961 
i dont believe it will ever be the same 
he continues to live in the room that remains 
he said he had developed heart disease because of the trauma 
the once leafy outskirts of cornetu with neat houses 
welltended gardens and grapevines climbing the walls exist no 
more 
not even if we had a war would it look like this said a 
neighbor gheorghe cristea a 63yearold bewhiskered farmer 
shaking his head in disbelief 
both sides of the muddy road heading west out of cornetu are 
lined with the skeletons of a war ceausescu tried to hide one 
against the rural population many homes are just shells some are 
missing roofs others have holes in walls very few escaped 
relatively unscathed 
surescu and his 65 neighbors on the outskirts of town were 
luckier than the 350 families living in the center of cornetu whose 
homes were destroyed first 
romanias revolution saved the homes on the periphery from final 
destruction the debris was to have been buried in huge pits 
already dug in gardens where flowers and vegetables once grew 
the center of cornetu gives no hint that 350 houses once stood 
there the houses were buried and their grave is now covered with 
rows of fourstory apartment buildings ceausescus response to the 
possibility of too much rural independence 
some of the buildings destroyed were hovels and the tenements 
are improvements even though they are shoddily built structures 
that do not take into account rural lifestyles 
but the perception is widespread that ceausescu had motives 
other than improving the quality of life for peasants 
virgil ioanid vice president of the national commission for 
urban and regional planning said ceausescu was apparently afraid 
he could not control small villages 
in the small villages he added local police were on good terms 
with the people which angered ceausescu who felt he couldnt keep 
tabs on what was happening 
with larger towns of 5000 people or more ceausescu could bring 
in his fiercely loyal and hated securitate secret police and 
control was easier he added 
ceausescu wanted to concentrate 10 million rural residents in 
2500 to 3000 agroindustrial centers said commission president 
serban popescucriveanu 
ceauescu intended to destroy 8000 to 8500 of romanias 11000 
rural villages popescucriveanu said 
fortunately he didnt have time to carry out his entire plan 
but about 2000 small houses were destroyed near bucharest 
about 30 villages were affected and eight were razed he said 
popescucriveanu added that one of the new governments first 
commitments was to replace the destroyed homes as quickly as 
possible he said about 500 families didnt want to return but the 
homes of the other 1500 would be rebuilt 
constantin surescu recalled the day last may when the bulldozer 
the police and town officials arrived 
they ordered us to destroy our own houses he said 
many people said i dont want to do this if you said no 
they came in the night and got you and beat you up 
first electric power was disrupted and that frightened some 
residents enough to start dismantling their homes with whatever 
implements they had at hand sorescu said 
but others like surescu and his neighbor cristea resisted 
arguing with officials at town hall and scurrying into the fields 
when authorities came to their homes 
cristea said they had heard on western radio broadcasts that 
political change was sweeping eastern europe and they expected 
something to happen in romania so they tried to delay the 
bulldozers as long as possible 
all residents whose homes were destroyed were given apartments 
in prefabricated concrete buildings but in cornetus outskirts 
more than half the residents refused to leave their homes begging 
the wreckers to leave one room intact 
even when they were destroying what i couldnt destroy i 
didnt want to leave surescu said 
they gave me an apartment but i didnt want to stay i 
felt like i was in a hospital it was cold there was water on the 
walls it was like being in a grave 
now he was picking at the pieces of brick gently fingering what 
was left of the home he had loved 
im not leaving from here he said

tycoon donald trump who usually delights in 
media attention says he hates the splashy publicity about his 
breakup with wife ivana but believes it has a silver lining its 
good for business 
in an interview thursday trump said the screaming tabloid 
headlines and talkshow jokes about his marital travails actually 
have benefitted his multibilliondollar casino hotel and airline 
empire 
the business has never been better he said but because 
its a private company most people dont know about it 
unfortunately for all the wrong reasons the last two weeks its 
been even better yet 
trump said business has been up at his two hotelcasinos in 
atlantic city nj the plaza hotel and the trump shuttle which 
links new york with washington and boston since the breakup first 
hit the headlines two weeks ago 
still he said having his name splashed over the media has taken 
a toll 
its horrible i hate it i hate the publicity trump said 
in his glitzy 26thfloor office commanding a view of central park 
and the plaza hotel one of his properties 
its been on a personal basis difficult because i happen to 
like ivana but its something you have to go through and in 
many cases a lot of people have to go through it people grow 
apart 
wearing a bright redandblue striped tie and navy blue suit 
trump looked tired as he dealt with the normal everyday hassles of 
a billionaire mogul his associates bustled in and out of his 
office throughout the interview 
he said the potential loss of ivana his business partner and 
the manager of the opulent plaza in manhattan wouldnt create a 
void in his organization or have a negative impact over the long 
term 
thats one of the reasons you sign a prenuptial agreement 
trump said if something should happen you know what you have to 
pay out and thats one of the reasons that when youre in business 
its very important to have a prenuptial agreement signed 
under an agreement ivana is contesting she would receive 25 
million and the couples home in connecticut as well as custody of 
their children trumps holdings are estimated to be worth up to 4 
billion 
although trump insisted the publicity was a business plus some 
marketing analysts said the headlines could hurt an empire built 
the developers name 
hes becoming a joke said jack trout president of trout amp 
ries a marketing consulting firm in greenwich conn for a 
serious brand that can be a big problem he said suggesting 
that the publicity could have a negative impact on the trump 
trademark 
mrs trump declined through spokesman john scanlon to comment on 
her husbands remarks 
all mrs trump wants is a fair and equitable share of the 
fortune that they accumulated together while they were married 
scanlon said were disappointed that mr trump is prepared to 
offer his wife and children less than 1 percent of his accumulated 
wealth we really expected better of him 
in his bestselling book the art of the deal trump called 
ivana incredibly good at anything shes ever done a natural 
manager and credited her for the strong performance of his trump 
castle hotelcasino in atlantic city which she used to manage 
al glasgow publisher of the monthly newsletter atlantic city 
action said revenues have been up strongly in recent months at 
both trump plaza and trump castle the two leading casinos in the 
gaming town followed by holiday corps harrahs 
but the growth in the trump casinos has been due to their new 
managers and their quality of service glasgow said rather than 
any publicity about the trumps personal vicissitudes 
i dont think its had any impact at all he said in a 
telephone interview donalds marriage breakup is making 
headlines now but theyll soon be forgotten in april when the taj

greyhound bus drivers say theyll walk off the job 
when their contract expires march 1 but the company already has 
begun hiring replacements and says it will operate a full schedule 
by the end of next month 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions which 
represents 6300 drivers and 3075 office and maintenance workers 
notified the company thursday of its decision to go on strike at 
1201 am march 2 greyhound lines inc spokesman george gravley 
said 
no talks in the dispute are scheduled gravley said union 
officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
the two sides met together in phoenix last friday and monday and 
then held separate meetings with a federal mediator tuesday but no 
agreement could be reached gravley said 
the company and union remain far apart with greyhound offering 
a threeyear deal worth about 63 million gravely said the union 
initially had sought a pact valued at 561 million but reduced 
that to 475 million 
union membership previously had approved a strike and greyhound 
responded by advertising for permanent replacements we have 600 
people in school and are still taking applications gravley 
said 
we will operate as many schedules as possible on march 2 
based on the number of employees who stay on the job and the number 
of replacements available to us greyhound chairman fred g 
currey said we will build back the service as additional workers 
become available and as routes are subcontracted 
we expect to be serving all points on our system before the 
end of march 
greyhound says its drivers earn top pay in the industry 
except for one or two small ones in the northeast it said its 
offer would boost the average of its 1500 highest paid drivers 
from 33218 last year to 40725 by 1990 
overall greyhound says its drivers made an average salary of 
24643 last year 
it is an excellent offer from a company that lost 20 million 
over the last three years and it is all this company can afford 
currey said 
the union has not disputed the fact that we cannot afford to 
pay more than we have offered he said instead union leaders 
have told us repeatedly that an employers ability to pay is 
irrelevant 
greyhound said it rejected union suggestions that fares be 
raised 10 percent to cover the increased cost of their proposal 
currey led the investment group that paid phoenixbased 
greyhound corp 350 million for its bus system in march 1987 and 
then bought dallasbased trailways lines inc the nations largest 
trailways system four months later for 80 million 
the company lost 26 million in 1987 and 174 million in 1988 
and expects to report a small profit for 1989 of about 730000 on 
revenues of approximately 1 billion 
greyhound says its 3949 buses serve 9500 locations and are 
the only public transportation available in about 9000 of those 
areas

ual chairman stephen wolf is still encouraging 
united airlines employees to develop a buyout proposal even though 
the workers may not retain him as head of the parent company 
the entire board stands ready to receive a fair and financed 
offer from the employee groups and will give any such offer prompt 
consideration wolf said thursday in a brief statement after a 
ual board meeting 
nevertheless the carrier cautioned in a statement that there 
can be no assurance that any acquisition proposal will be made by 
the employee groups or any other party or that if made the board 
will determine that such proposal is in the best interest of ual 
shareholders 
ual stock dropped sharply apparently indicating investor fears 
that hopes for a buyout are receding the stock fell 575 in new 
york stock exchange trading thursday closing at 12650 
at the meeting ual directors authorized the release of 
confidential financial information to the three united airlines 
labor unions that are leading the drive for employee control of the 
nations secondlargest airline 
it was revealed last week that the union group representing 
uniteds pilots machinists and flight attendants has been 
looking for a possible replacement for wolf who initially gave 
strong support to an employee buyout proposa 
the wall street journal reported on thursday that wolf had 
turned against the buyout plan and threatened to take other top 
managers with him if he is forced out as chairman the newspaper 
cited unidentified sources familiar with the company 
airline analysts have said that dumping wolf who has taken a 
hard line in labor negotiations would weaken uniteds ability to 
win back market share from industry leader american airlines 
uniteds unions last month proposed an employee purchase of 75 
percent of uals stock in a rare show of unity the workers 
offered to negotiate as a group on a fiveyear labor package 
including wage concessions to anchor the buyout 
at a jan 26 meeting uals board encouraged the unions to 
develop a formal buyout proposal including a plan for financing 
the stock purchase 
investors and analysts have been skeptical about the workers 
ability to borrow enough money for a buyout though 
in october an attempted 300ashare buyout led by wolf and the 
pilots flopped after the machinists opposed the plan causing 
lenders to balk the collapse of the proposed 675 billion deal 
helped trigger a 190point collapse in the dow jones industrial 
average 
conditions for leveraged buyouts have deteriorated since then 
with the collapse of the junk bond market a key source of takeover 
financing 
ual is under pressure from its largest shareholder coniston 
partners to take action to increase the value of its shares which 
have tumbled from 294 in september to a recent low of 121

its cold wet and creamy and sweet on the 
tongue its thicker than top superpremium ice cream brands and 
just a little bit harder to scrape with your spoon 
it doesnt taste exactly like haagendasz or ben amp jerrys but 
what do you expect for a product with half the calories and 
onefifteenth the fat 
nutrasweet co the maker of nutrasweet lowcal sweetener is 
hoping for a mouthful with simple pleasures a superpremium ice 
cream substitute with no fat and low cholesterol 
its secret lies in simplesse a product made from egg whites and 
milk protein that has no cholesterol and no fat simplesse 
eventually may be used as a substitute for other dairy products 
like yogurt sour cream butter margarine and cheese 
simple pleasures was unveiled for reporters thursday after 
becoming the first fatsubstitute product to win approval from the 
food and drug administration 
the real taste test will come this summer when it shows up in 
seven flavors in supermarkets across the country distribution in 
europe is expected by the end of the year said simplesse general 
manager david l morley 
its potentially very significant this is the first nonfat 
fat so to speak to be approved on the market said harvey 
stober a chemical analyst for dean witter reynolds inc who said 
sales could grow to 500 million or 1 billion a year in several 
years 
monsanto stock jumped higher following the fda approval 
finishing 437 higher at 11225 on the new york stock exchange 
simplesse is aimed at customers who want to cut the amount of 
fat and cholesterol in their diet while satisfying their taste 
buds it will be launched in an age of dieting and health 
consciousness when customers have lined their shelves with 
products such as oat bran and spring water 
simplesse cannot be used in frying or baking however because 
it congeals at higher temperatures and the company has yet to come 
up with a vanilla flavor simple pleasures that meets its 
expectations 
potentially it could help somebody lower their fat intake but 
if youre not careful it might have undesirable effects on the 
diet said lisa lefferts a staff scientist at the center for 
science in the public interest a washington watchdog group 
we dont know whether theyll substitute it for fat or people 
will just eat more doublescoop ice cream cones 
but robert shapiro nutrasweets chairman and chief executive 
said simple pleasures could resolve the conflict between eating 
healthy foods and indulging in what tastes good americans reduced 
the fat in their diets by 3 percent from 1982 to 1988 but still ate 
an average 5 gallons of ice cream last year according to 
nutrasweet 
simplesse is in our view nothing less than a historical 
breakthrough in food technology in the neverending conflict 
between health and indulgence shapiro said simplesse means we 
can now enjoy all the rich creamy taste of foods without the 
fat without the calories without the worry and without the 
guilt 
a 4ounce serving of strawberry flavor has 120 calories and less 
than 1 gram of fat compared to 250 calories and 15 grams for 
superpremium ice cream morley said simple pleasures uses sugar 
not nutrasweet although the sugar and fat substitutes could be 
used together 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit in washington said nutrasweet would 
have to seek separate federal approval for other products 
containing simplesse such as mayonnaise salad dressing sour 
cream or frozen yogurt 
nevertheless nutrasweet already has agreed to supply simplesse 
to kraftgeneral foods inc for its mayonnaise and miracle whip 
salad dressing 
just as diet soda and other lowcalorie products bear the 
nutrasweet logo simple pleasures and other simplessecontaining 
products will bear a special logo a red and white circle and 
rectangle imprinted with a blue simplesse 
all new products will be made and marketed by simplesse co a 
new division of nutrasweet 
two other companies have petitions pending for fat substitutes 
cincinnatibased procter amp gamble is seeking permission for 
olestra a synthetic product make of sugar and oils that would be 
used in shortenings oils and snacks like potato chips said 
spokesman don tassone the petition submitted in april 1987 
remains pending 
kraft of glenview ill is seeking permission to use a fat 
substitute in frozen esserts kraft spokeswoman kathy knuth said 
the petition is pending and could be approved later this year

bank of new england corp which went from profits 
to steep losses late last year is reviewing whether it should have 
made bigger provisions against bad loans earlier in 1989 
i really feel that as we went through 1989 we werent dealing 
with a full deck said james moynihan senior vice president at 
advest inc in boston 
bank of new england reported thursday its 1989 losses were worse 
than expected at 111 billion the company also said it was 
reviewing how its quarterly loanloss provisions were allocated 
indicating the possibility that it should have taken bigger 
provisions earlier in the year when the bank was still reporting 
profits 
i dont think that we could have a loss like that and not say 
there were mistakes and misjudgments said marcia ryan a bank 
spokeswoman 
analysts said the review of loanloss provisions indicates the 
bank might have misstated its financial condition in previous 
quarters which could open the bank to more lawsuits the bank 
already faces several lawsuits from shareholders who claim they 
were misled by the bank 
bank of new england which has had to boost its reserves against 
bad real estate loans estimated earlier this year its l989 losses 
would be 105 billion because it was boosting its reserves against 
credit losses to 165 billion 
other banks also have suffered financial ills because of the 
regions slumping real estate market but analysts say bank of new 
england has received some of the deepest wounds because it was an 
aggressive lender during a construction boom in the mid1980s 
yet bank of new englands serious troubles did not become 
apparent until late last year for the first three quarters of 
1989 the bank said it had earned more than 120 million 
in its statement thursday the company said it was not reporting 
its fourth quarter results yet because it was in the process of 
reviewing the provision for loan losses to determine how it should 
be allocated among the 1989 quarters 
ryan said the bank possibly could increase provisions in the 
previous quarters but no decision has been made the statement 
indicated that overall provisions for 1989 would not change 
analysts said the banks statement indicated the company and its 
auditors were trying to determine whether the first three quarters 
should have contained larger provisions against bad loans 
they are going to put 1989 back together again the way it 
should have been moynihan said 
gerard cassidy an analyst with tucker anthony inc said bank 
of new england had plenty of signs earlier in the year that its 
loan portfolio could sour the economy had already started its 
downturn and bank of boston corp the regions largest bank 
reported a record 125 million loss in the third quarter 
it tells you someone was asleep at the switch cassidy said 
needless to say in this type of situation there will be 
lawsuits from shareholders he said 
the 111 billion loss for the year which translated to 1611 
a share compared with earnings of 2817 million or 406 a 
share in 1988 
as of dec 31 1988 the bank had 322 billion in assets but 
that number shrunk to 261 billion by feb 15 with much of the 
decline coming since jan 1 the bank said 
the bank has been trying to sell 6 billion in assets to raise 
cash and its primary capital ratio improved to 86 percent on feb 
15 compared with 71 percent at years end 
the numbers we reported today were in line with our january 
estimate h ridgely bullock the banks interim chairman said 
in a statement in the near term we are proceeding in an orderly 
fashion to reduce overhead as a part of our downsizing program 
we are presently developing a longer term strategic plan to 
improve operations and lead the company on a road to 
profitability he said 
the bank said last week it expected to lay off about 2000 
employees although the specific details were not yet determined 
the bank also said earlier this year that it planned to enter a 
consent order with the federal government to detail what steps it 
would take to improve its financial condition but that order has 
not yet been disclosed

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp received a bankruptcy courts openended approval for 
more time to consider whether to continue leases at their 260 store 
locations nationwide 
but us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr said thursday he 
might reconsider and set a fixed deadline if his court sees a flood 
of challenges from developers or mall operators who demand earlier 
decisions because of their own financial deadlines 
aug gave permission for federated and allied to postpone making 
the lease decisions until a reorganization plan is in place which 
company officials say could occur in may aug agreed in court 
thursday not to set a deadline said david heiman a 
federatedallied lawyer 
federated and allied lawyers cleared the way for augs decision 
by negotiating a proposed agreement during a court recess thursday 
that would require the companies to operate the stores until a 
lease was canceled the proposal would require that lease 
rejections be subject to hearings in the bankruptcy court so that 
objectors could make their arguments 
we expect only a handful of rejections ultimately heiman 
said 
he declined to say how much advance notice the retailers might 
provide im sure that as soon as we make a decision we will 
contact the landlord heiman said 
the cincinnatibased retailers have refused to say which leases 
might be canceled saying only that some unprofitable stores are at 
stake federated and allied both filed chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization petitions jan 15 to obtain protection from 
creditors during their reorganizations the companies listed 77 
billion in debts amassed when the torontobased campeau corp 
bought allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 
operators of shopping malls and stores from iami beach fla to 
pocatello idaho are concerned that federated and allied give 
notice as soon as possible about whether they intend to continue 
leases 
stanley talesnick lawyer for melvin simon amp associates an 
indianapolisbased mall operator said he expects responses from 
federated and allied within a few weeks or months about lease 
decisions 
melvin simon controls 66 million square feet of retail space in 
200 shopping centers the company also is concerned because it 
plans to build the 625 million mall of america in bloomington 
minn uncertainty about a bloomingdales store planned for the mall 
is delaying a 600 million loan needed to start construction 
lawyers for developers jmb realty corp and melvin simon say 
long delays in those decisions could hurt tenants of shopping malls 
that are anchored by such federated and allied stores as lazarus or 
bloomingdales 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a company filing 
for protection from creditors has 60 days to decide whether to end 
lease agreements for federated and allied the deadline is march 
14

foreign minister taro nakayama today called for 
urgent cabinetlevel trade talks saying us demands at 
lowerlevel discussions on the usjapanese trade imbalance were 
stronger than expected 
american officials criticized japanese negotiators in the talks 
saying they would not go far enough in efforts to reduce japans 
49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
we must say we find ourselves frustrated and concerned at this 
point deputy us trade representative linn williams told 
reporters after the twoday negotiating session ended today 
we expected this meeting to be a substantial step forward but 
what we heard is not enough to be effective lasting or credible 
he said it was mainly a defense of the status quo with prospects 
of only minimal further action 
nakayama told reporters the us demands were much severer 
than japanese officials had expected 
he called for an urgent meeting of top government officials 
after prime minister toshiki kaifu names a new cabinet next week 
to clear up disagreements aired in talks at the bilateral 
subcabinet level 
the japanese side today was given a chance to critique us 
plans for structural trade reform 
this round of trade talks known as the structural impediments 
initiative was delayed from early january until after national 
parliamentary elections sunday that kept the conservative liberal 
democratic party in power 
since the structural trade talks were launched in may us 
officials have pressed japan for evidence of willingness to carry 
out wideranging reform to help reduce japans trade surplus with 
the united states 
today it was the united states turn to explain what it is 
doing to change american practices that contribute to the 
imbalance us officials said they would outline washingtons 
plans to increase the low us savings and investment rates and to 
bolster the competitiveness of american firms 
the us timetable for these changes was unclear 
japan says us problems contributing to the trade imbalance 
include inadequate savings and investment the shortterm nature of 
us corporate strategies ineffective labor training and education 
and insufficient export promotion 
japanese officials contend many of the us demands for change 
in their economy cannot be carried out as quickly as washington 
hopes 
us officials say japans high savings and investment rates 
its land policies exclusionary business practices inefficient 
retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all indirectly 
restrain trade 
in response to those complaints the japanese side on thursday 
explained measures in a draft budget before parliament to improve 
enforcement of antimonopoly laws to increase spending on public 
infrastructure such as roads and sewers and to reform the retail 
distribution system 
they also explained revisions of japans land use law aimed at 
curbing real estate speculation and increasing the supply of 
available land in urban areas 
members of the us delegation said the plans represented new 
actions and some progress but its clear to us they havent gone 
as far as we hoped with bold new thinking 
japanese officials said the us side had asked japanese 
spending on public works be increased to 10 percent of the nations 
gross national product from the current 5 percent or 257 billion 
a demand they refused 
they said they also could not agree to a demand to scrap a law 
that requires firms wanting to open department stores or 
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing smaller shops that are 
generally reluctant to face new competition 
the us side says the law tends to restrict imports by driving 
up prices and by limiting the number of foreignowned stores and 
the opening of large japanese stores more likely to sell imported 
products

japanese traders unnerved by the wild swings that 
have roiled their stock market are blaming a culprit new to them 
but familiar to their american counterparts computerized program 
trading 
program trading strategies which involve moving huge blocks of 
stocks with the flick of a computer key long been a standard 
procedure on us markets one of the best known practices is index 
arbitrage which involves buying or selling stocks with opposite 
offsetting trades in stock index futures 
but such practices in which us firms appear to be major 
players in the tokyo market are new and exasperating to the 
japanese 
we never thought share prices on the tokyo market would ever 
go wild as they did this week michio katsumata of nomura 
securities co japans largest brokerage said today 
since foreign traders brought in the method of arbitrage 
trading by computer into the tokyo market share prices here began 
strange fluctuations we have never seen before he said 
even the government appeared confounded by the trading 
strategies the finance ministry today directed securities 
companies to report on their arbitrage practices a government 
official speaking on condition of anonymity said the ministry is 
not yet quite sure what to do to solve the problem 
the 225issue nikkei index the main indicator of the worlds 
biggest stock market has dropped 256935 points or nearly 7 
percent this week alone and is off more than 10 percent since the 
beginning of the year 
today only two days after the benchmark index suffered its 
thirdlargest decline the nikkei index lost another 261 percent 
to close the week at 3489097 
it was the first time the index fell below the 35000point mark 
since oct 17 1989 
of primary concern to japanese dealers investors and finance 
ministry officials was the unusually wide range of price 
fluctuations recently 
on thursday for example the nikkei opened more than 400 points 
higher as investors took advantage of the previous days steep 
price plunge to buy stocks but it fell more than 1000 points in 
less than an hour at days end however the index rebounded to 
close with a slight gain 
traders attributed the bearishness to anxiety about a possible 
interest rate hike expected shortly coupled with unstable 
currency rates 
but they believe such fluctuations must come from arbitrage 
program trading said ichitaro watanabe of nikko securities co 
traders noted that the market is particularly vulnerable to 
computerized selling because of the extremely thin volume of shares 
being traded 
program trading has received its share of criticism in the 
united states where the practice was blamed for contributing to 
wall streets stock market crash in october 1987 because of public 
outcry over index arbitrages role in the stock markets 
rollercoaster performance several major wall street investment 
houses have suspended the practice and the new york stock exchange 
agreed to limit computerized program trading in times of sharp 
market declines 
the japanese market has not yet developed an effective immune 
system against such new methods of computeraided trading 
watanabe said as a result most market players are only watching 
recent unstable movements of share prices and the index from the 
sidelines with their mouths open 
he noted that computers can buy and sell stocks beyond the 
speed of human judgment unless we familiarize ourselves with 
program trading we are virtually defenseless against steep ups and 
downs in share prices 
dealers said the usbased firms salomon brothers inc and 
morgan stanley amp co inc are the two major users of arbitrage 
trading in japan 
a dealer with a major japanese securities house commenting 
anonymously said i knew something like this would happen when 
the finance ministry decided to allow foreign companies into the 
tokyo exchange

and retailing giant confirmed friday that it was negotiating with 
elders ixl ltd of australia over the sale of its brewing 
operations

negotiating with another potential buyer whom he refused to 
identify 
the confirmation follows a statement made earlier friday by 
elders in which it disclosed discussions with grand met about a 
major transaction which both parties expect will be brought to a 
conclusion in the near future 
analysts said they believe the deal would call for grand met to 
swap its breweries for some of elders 5000 pubs in britain 
grand met owns 4900 pubs and four breweries which brew its own 
brands and other brands under license such as budweiser fosters 
and carlsberg

elders which is planning a corporate restructuring 
grand met declined to elaborate on the discussions bullard 
would only repeat that the company hopes to make a decision about 
its brewing interests sometime in the second quarter

a new reorganization agreement between eastern 
airlines and its unsecured creditors would require sister carrier 
continental airlines to step in and make some payments to the 
creditors 
the unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million by eastern 
would receive about 490 million in cash and notes under the plan 
announced thursday 
the agreement capped several days of intense negotiations 
between officials of miamibased eastern and a committee 
representing the unsecured creditors in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings which eastern entered last march 
if the bankruptcy court approves the plan eastern says it could 
fly out of chapter 11 this summer 
a plan proposed several weeks ago by eastern would have paid the 
unsecured creditors only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the 
airline emerges from bankruptcy protection and 70 percent more 
over the following 10 years without interest 
the unsecured creditors are mainly equipment suppliers such as 
aircraft and engine makers who have no collateral backing up what 
they are owed 
under the new agreement the creditors would receive repayment 
of 50 cents on each dollar owed 
eastern would pay them 300 million in cash when the plan was 
approved by the court also the creditors would receive another 
190 million in eightyear 15 percent notes half issued by 
eastern and half by houstonbased continental which would 
guarantee both sets of notes 
principal on the notes would begin to be repaid after the first 
two years 
eastern said the new plan would allow the airline to emerge from 
bankruptcy protection by midyear with substantial cash resources 
and a significant debt reduction 
eastern and continental are both subsidiaries of houstonbased 
texas air corp the nations largest airline company easterns 
previous reorganization proposals including a plan to offer the 
unsecured creditors 40 percent of easterns equity hadnt involved 
the assistance of continental or texas air 
in a separate development texas air chairman frank lorenzo said 
thursday that merging continental with eastern makes sense but is 
not planned in the foreseeable future 
we have no nearterm plans for a merger lorenzo said in a 
speech to around 1500 continental employees at stapleton 
international airport in denver however he added today a 
merger makes much more sense than it did two years ago 
in addition to requiring bankruptcy court approval the new 
agreement also is subject to completion of easterns proposed sale 
of its lucrative south american routes to american airlines and to 
a resolution of easterns labor dispute with the unions 
representing pilots and flight attendants 
those two unions called off their sympathy walkouts last 
november but the airline had replaced the strikers mainly with 
nonunion workers as it rebuilt from the strike that started last 
march 4 the machinists union is still on strike against eastern 
the air line pilots association which is represented on the 
creditors committee called the agreement woefully inadequate in 
terms of the amounts and types of payments to be made to the 
various creditors the union is one of the unsecured creditors 
because of outstanding wage claims and pension obligations 
eastern still hasnt reached agreement with holders of its 
preferred shares who are owed about 1 billion the preferred 
holders objected to easterns earlier plan which would have paid 
them only 10 cents on the dollar and called for the liquidation or 
sale of the airline 
the airlines exclusive right to file a reorganization plan 
expired on tuesday but the creditors and preferred holders have 
been negotiating with eastern to try to agree on a consensual plan

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed this morning on the chicago board of trade as traders looked 
for new direction after thursdays late rally in the wheat and corn 
markets 
analysts said corn futures appear to be attracting more 
speculative interest after posting moderate gains in each of the 
last three trading sessions but the recent runup has made some 
observers wary of the potential for a downward correction 
the number of newly established positions in the corn market 
rose by 4000 thursday a huge increase according to john 
frazier an executive vice president of balfour maclaine corp who 
works on the exchange floor 
frankly he said when you see that people tend to think 
the speculators are too much on one side of the boat 
one bearish factor this morning was a report in the journal of 
commerce quoting a top soviet grain buyer as saying the soviet 
union will buy significantly less us grain this year than last 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 388 a bushel corn 
futures were cent lower to cent higher with march at 245 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with march at 137 a 
bushel soybeans were cent lower to cent higher with march at 
568 a bushel

higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange

investment bankers looking to inject life into a 
moribund market are pushing one of wall streets more novel 
repackaging ideas turning junk bonds into investmentgrade 
securities 
the collateralized bond obligation or cbo has grown from 
scratch into multibilliondollar market in two years 
some bankers think the markets size could double this year 
alone and in the process bring some fresh demand into a junkbond 
market sorely in need of buyers 
i think it has some potential to grow because what it does is 
put bonds in the hands of longterm holders says timothy p 
norman a vice president at duff amp phelps investment management 
which manages more than 25 billion from its chicago offices 
norman manages one of the biggest cbos done to date a 301 
million deal completed last november 
the concept he says is sound even if the idea of turning junk 
into gradea investment material seems like financial alchemy 
the cbo pools bonds issued by a number of different companies to 
minimize the risk of defaults then it apportions interest and 
principal payments flowing from the junk pool to several tiers of 
investors 
the top tier or tiers has first priority to payments only after 
they receive their interest and principal does money trickle down 
to investors at the bottom tiers where the risk as well as the 
potential returns are much greater 
youre able to take a pool of junk bonds and basically carve 
the risk up and sell it to a buyer who wants a part of it says 
andrew kimball an associate director who helps issue ratings for 
cbo deals at moodys investors service 
in normans case duff amp phelps bought just over 300 million of 
junk bonds repackaged them under the name of dampp cbo corp and 
then sold off stakes of the pool to four classes of institutional 
buyers 
the top tier totaling 240 million got a solid singlea rating 
from standard amp poors corp 
investors buying into that tier mainly insurance companies 
were promised a return of 1005 percent over an average life of 
seven years that was a little more than 1 percentage point above 
the yield on conventional singlearated corporate bonds at the 
time the deal was done norman said 
the next level having a subordinated claim on payments from the 
pool totaled 45 million and was priced to yield about 13 
percent norman said the risk at this level didnt merit an 
investmentgrade rating 
the third tier of 16 million was packaged as a bond paying 
about 15 percent the remainder of 7 million was an equity rump 
entitling the holders to any money left after the top three classes 
of investors are paid off 
the two bottom tiers were bought by a limited partnership that 
includes duff amp phelps itself and a handful of other institutions 
willing to accept high risk 
as manager norman monitors the underlying credit standing of 
the junk bonds held in the pool as long as they continue to pay 
interest he doesnt have to worry if the price of the bonds falls 
in the open market its a cashflow exercise he says 
ann thoke a first boston corp director who helped put together 
a 200 million cbo for a group led by equitable capital management 
corp earlier this month says the instrument is winning 
acceptances from institutional investors after some initial 
skepticism 
the equitable deal included two senior tiers of 75 million 
each which won strong ratings of aa1 and aa2 from moodys the 
package is designed to protect investors even if half the 
underlying junk bonds default 
that might sound hard to achieve but equitable did it by buying 
junk bonds yielding perhaps 13 percent to 14 percent and then 
paying closer to 10 percent interest on the investmentgrade 
portion of the cbo the difference goes into a reserve that 
provides coverage in case of any junk defaults if there are few or 
no defaults the bottomtier investors share the reserve 
the depression in the junk bond market makes it a little easier 
to put cbo packages together simply because bonds can be bought so 
cheaply thoke says the state of the junk market is so bad 
however that some potential investors are leery of buying 
repackaged bonds she adds 
still kimball of moodys forecasts that banks will repackage 
39 billion of junk this year up from 28 billion last year and 
900 million in 1988 
thoke is even more ambitious she says there are 1 billion 
worth of deals already in the pipeline and predicts there could be 
twice as much paper repackaged this year as in the past two years 
combined

talks between the united states and japan on 
reducing the 49 billion trade imbalance between the two countries 
ended here friday with few signs of progress and ample evidence of 
mutual frustration 
we must say we find ourselves frustrated and concerned at this 
point deputy us trade representative linn williams told 
reporters after the talks 
japans foreign minister taro nakayama meanwhile called for 
urgent cabinetlevel meetings saying us demands were much 
severer than japan had expected 
williams said us officials had expected to make substantial 
progress in the negotiations aimed at addressing the underlying 
causes of japans persistent huge annual trade imbalance with the 
united states 
but what we heard is not enough to be effective lasting or 
credible it was mainly a defense of the status quo with prospects 
of only minimal further action williams said 
japanese officials during the two days of meetings defended 
their plans to beef up enforcement of antimonopoly laws improve 
customs and patent systems reform land use policies increase 
public works spending and ease restrictions on new store openings 
in response to us complaints 
theres a clear message and already actions have been taken to 
change the status quo countered a foreign ministry official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
us officials said they expected bolder proposals for change 
after this round of trade talks called the structural impediments 
initiative was postponed for more than a month for japans national 
parliamentary election the election held sunday returned the 
ruling liberal democratic party to power 
we understand the election is just over and a new cabinet is 
yet to be formed williams said but it is clearly time to get 
ourselves focused 
both sides described the atmosphere of the talks as good 
nakayama called for an urgent meeting of top officials from both 
governments after prime minister toshiki kaifu names a new cabinet 
next week to determine which problems should be dealt with and 
when 
since the structural trade talks were launched last may us 
officials have pressed japan for evidence of willingness to carry 
out wideranging reforms to help reduce japans 49 billion trade 
surplus with the united states 
the united states claims japans high savings and investment 
rates its land use policies exclusionary business practices 
inefficient retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms 
among other issues indirectly restrain trade 
japan in turn has singled out inadequate savings and 
investment shortterm management strategies and insufficient 
education and worker training as major factors behind the united 
states 10858 billion total trade deficit 
on friday us officials outlined plans to increase savings and 
investment and to improve the competitiveness of american firms and 
worker training 
in response japanese officials said they suggested tax 
incentives to encourage more applied research and development and 
urged an easing of antitrust regulations to encourage industrial 
cooperation on new technologies 
officials on both sides declined to comment on specific areas of 
disagreement particularly with regard to us plans for structural 
reforms 
japanese officials contend that many of the us demands for 
change in their economy cannot be carried out as quickly as 
washington hopes the foreign ministry official said he thought the 
us frustration stemmed from the long and complicated japanese 
decisionmaking process 
williams however blamed lack of sufficient political 
guidance for the slow progress he also criticized japanese plans 
for mounting studies rather than taking legislative action in a 
number of areas nonetheless he said the us side was open to 
wait and see what develops from here 
but charles dallara assistant secretary of the treasury warned 
that trade negotiators could lose control of the negotiations if 
progress isnt made soon 
others in the legislature who may have different solutions in 
mind could have a great deal of influence over the outcome said 
dallara alluding to the possibility of more protectionist 
legislation from an impatient us congress 
president george bush has stressed the importance of the talks 
and us secretary of defense dick cheney emphasized the importance 
of the structural trade talks in a policy address here friday 
the growing friction between our countries on trade issues and 
continued trade imbalances may if unchecked spill over into other 
areas of mutual interest and concern cheney said 
both delegations have said they expected to produce an interim 
report on progress in the talks by early april after an additional 
meeting in march a final report is expected by summer

the interstate commerce commission today 
extended an order allowing three regional railroads to continue 
operating for another month on the delaware amp hudson railway tracks 
the commission has extended it until 1159 pm on march 23 
dennis watson icc spokesman said today i guess everything is 
basically the same 
the icc ruled last week that the new york susquehanna amp western 
corp lackawanna valley railroad corp and north shore railroad 
co could run on damph tracks until 1159 pm est today while a 
courtappointed bankruptcy trustee put together a temporary 
operating plan 
the damph the nations oldest continually operated railroad runs 
from montreal to washington and from albany to buffalo ny 
trustee francis p dicello has been putting together a plan 
under which he would temporarily run the failing damph using 
subsidies provided by new york pennsylvania and the railroads and 
shippers that use the line dicello must notify the icc at least 48 
hours before he is prepared to take over but his plan has not yet 
been approved by the bankruptcy judge who is handling the damphs 
reorganization 
on thursday dicello canceled a hearing in us bankruptcy court 
in wilmington del but charles h white jr counsel to the 
trustee said he would probably present the plan early next week 
under the plan dicello would run the 1600mile railroad for at 
least one month using subsidies totaling approximately 500000 
according to white 
those who would provide subsidies include three railroads 
canadian pacific ltd canadian national railways and norfolk 
southern corp and at least two shippers general electric co 
and international paper co 
david murray a spokesman for the new york state department of 
transporation said new york and pennsylvania would each put up 
about 200000 a month the two shippers would contribute 25000 
apiece the canadian railroads some 50000 each and norfolk about 
60000 
the trustee is hoping that the subsidies would keep the railroad 
running until he can sell it or negotiate another permanent 
solution 
meanwhile sen alfonse damato rny has threatened to 
legislate consolidated rail corp to the bargaining table in an 
attempt to save the damph 
he said he rep norman lent rny and pennsylvanias two 
senators were drafting legislation to force conrail to deal with a 
request to sell the damph trackage rights between harrisburg pa 
and hagerstown md 
an offer by canadian pacific ltd to buy the damph for 35 million 
was withdrawn earlier this month because conrail would not discuss 
a proposal to allow cp to operate on that 90mile stretch of tracks 
its not in the best interest of conrail simply to force the 
damph out of business because if they do it will lead senators 
like myself and the senators from pennsylvania to sponsor 
legislation which will reregulate those railroads who become 
monopolistic damato said on the senate floor 
i hope the conrail people begin to listen to the message i am 
attempting to send them 
but conrail spokesman david neurohr said thursday that his 
companys position remained unchanged 
conrail has not been offered anything of value in exchange for 
the trackage rights nor has it been offered anything to offset the 
harm that would be caused to conrails employees neurohr said 
reading from a prepared statement in effect theyre 
seeking a subsidy from conrail 
damato said thursday that conrail was seeking some 90 million 
for the rights which neurohr would neither confirm nor deny 
the damph filed in june 1988 or protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy laws the railway has debts 
of about 100 million

saatchi amp saatchi co plc said friday its 1990 
profits were unlikely to achieve market expectations and 
disclosed that an american investment company has increased its 
stake in the troubled british advertising agency 
saatchi the worlds largest advertising holding company said 
that southeastern asset management inc of memphis tenn has 
bought another 2 percent of the companys stock raising its stake 
in saatchi to 132 percent 
in a telephone call lee blanchard an administrative assistant 
said southeastern said it had no comment on saatchis disclosure 
saatchi shares plunged 44 pence or 75 cents a share to 138 
pence or 236 a share on londons stock exchange friday 
saatchi also confirmed that it was being sued in the united 
states by a shareholder but intends to vigorously defend its 
case 
a saatchi official who was not identified in accordance with 
british practice confirmed that an american shareholder filed a 
suit in california two weeks ago alleging that saatchi failed to 
disclose difficulties stemming from the companys aggressive 
acquisition policy beginning in 1985 the suit also claims that 
saatchi made a series of false or misleading optimistic financial 
statements at that time 
warning about its 1990 profits the company said the rate of 
growth in the advertising industry was slowing and that against 
this background the company was cautious about the shortterm 
saatchi posted a loss of 585 million pounds or 100 million 
for its fiscal year ended sept 30 
the company also said that it was in negotiations over the 
disposal of all or part of its interests in each of its consulting 
activities but that it was not in a position yet to make a more 
detailed statement the company previously announced its intention 
to sell the businesses

lawyers who filed suit here on behalf of bb vahlsing of 
wynnewood pa hope it will be declared a classaction lawsuit 
permitting them to represent customers of perrier throughout the 
country 
these are people who have been ripped off said richard 
bieder whose law firm koskoff koskoff amp bieder filed the suit 
in us district court in bridgeport on tuesday 
they are paying a premium price and they were paying the 
premium because they believed it was pure when it came from a 
spring bieder said 
perrier officials began a worldwide recall of their bottled 
water last week admitting that its spring waters naturally contain 
benzene but saying it is usually filtered out 
the vahlsing lawsuit was filed in connecticut because perriers 
us headquarters is in greenwich 
c oliver burt iii vahlsings lawyer in haverford pa said 
six to eight similar suits have been filed in us district court 
in philadelphia he said the pennsylvania suits filed feb 16 
also seek damages against perrier and ask the judge to declare a 
class action 
perrier spokeswoman jane lazgin said attorneys hired by her 
company had not yet had time to review the complaints thoroughly 
without really having seen the material it really isnt 
proper for us to comment but it does seem groundless to us she 
said adding the company felt it had taken the proper steps to deal 
with the problem 
the contamination question first arose on feb 9 when health 
officials in north carolina found benzene in several bottles of 
perrier the company recalled 72 million bottles sold in north 
america 
the lawsuit charges that even though perrier officials knew 
differently they first insisted that the contamination was limited 
to a few bottles and that the problem was caused by a lone perrier 
worker who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by 
cleaning it with benzene 
on feb 15 the company admitted that benzene naturally 
contaminates its spring in france and that contaminated bottles 
occurred in part because workers failed to replace filters 
designed to remove benzene from the water source 
the company expanded its recall to 160 million bottles worth 
70 million around the world 
the 15page lawsuit alleges perrier violated consumer protection 
laws in several states by advertising its product improperly 
bieder said 
the suit also charges the company with violating the racketeer 
influenced corrupt organizations act and breaking common law of 
fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
the suit asks unspecified damages based on perrier sales 
figures mainly for emotional distress caused in finding out the 
bubbly water contained benzene bieder said 
the suit names source perrier sa perrier group and perrier 
group of america inc as defendants

swedens car maker volvo and 
renault the french stateowned automotive concern announced today 
they were acquiring major equity stakes in each others car and 
truck production operations in a bid to become more competitive 
the companies said they also intended to enter into an 
extensive cooperation agreement under which they would 
coordinate product development programs purchasing operations and 
investment plans 
but they said each company would maintain its trademarks and 
distribution organizations and would continue assembling and 
marketing its own cars trucks and buses 
the announcement in the dutch capital capped monthslong rounds 
of negotiations between the two companies whose sales have been 
under pressure in an increasingly competitive world market 
under the agreement ab volvo and renault will swap 45 percent of 
the shares in their truck and bus operations according to raymond 
levy renaults chief executive officer at the same time renault 
agreed to acquire 25 percent of volvos car operations while volvo 
would acquire 20 percent of renault and an option to acquire 
another 5 percent at a later date 
pehr gyllenhammar president of volvo said the agreement meant 
both companies will maintain their integrity and will give 
them the size breadth and depth well above the critical mass 
necessary to survive in this fiercely competitive industry 
the stock swap covers an auto conglomerate which would account 
for production of about 2 million units a year or about 20 percent 
of the european market analysts said 
the combination would produce more than 140000 trucks beating 
the current leader in that field daimler benz of west germany by 
a margin of some 25000 units 
in 1988 the latest year for which figures were available 
renault which produced 16 million cars and 80250 trucks last 
year more than doubled its net profit to 8913 billion francs or 
159 billion from 3689 billion francs or 658 million the year 
before 
volvos latest accounts showed an operating profit of 406 
billion swedish crowns or 676 million for the first nine months 
of 1989 down 14 percent from the corresponding period a year 
earlier however this figure excluded 750 million crowns or 125 
million in nonrecurring gains 
in 1988 the swedish companys car sales were down by 4 percent 
totaling 414000 cars in the same year truck sales were up 25 
percent to 60200 units 
prior to todays announcement trade in volvo stock was 
suspended at both the paris and the stockholm bourses renault as

wheat and corn futures prices rose modestly 
friday on the chicago board of trade while soybean futures slipped 
continuing a pattern established in the previous session 
perceptions that the soviet union is preparing to buy more us 
corn supported corn futures as did bullish comments made by 
analysts at the national corn growers association meeting in 
phoenix ariz 
several analysts told the corn growers that corn prices could 
rise as much as 20 cents a bushel due to relatively low stockpiles 
and strong demand for feed grains in the united states and abroad 
the contract for march delivery of wheat surged more than 4 
cents a bushel after gaining 5 cents on thursday amid indications 
of tight supplies for delivery against the march contract which 
enters its delivery phase on wednesday 
soybean futures slumped on signs of continued slack demand for 
soybean meal the upcoming south american soybean harvest which 
will bring new supplies to market is also beginning to weigh on 
the futures market analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 4 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 393 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents higher with march at 245 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent higher with march at 137 a bushel soybeans

stacks of firewood that used to be apple 
trees are grim reminders of a year that began with a 60 minutes 
report on the chemical alar and ended with orchards bearing 
kindling instead of fruit 
alar which farmers used to slow the ripening and improve the 
crispness of their apples entered the american consciousness last 
feb 26 with an immediate and devastating impact 
a symbol of health suddenly became a symbol of something else 
not since the garden of eden have apples had such a bad image 
many of washington states 4500 apple growers were looking 
forward to a comeback year when cbs broadcast the 60 minutes 
segment based on studies done by the natural resources defense 
council a private consumer group 
the nrdc report on pesticides in childrens food called 
intolerable risk concluded that eating apples and apple 
products from trees treated with the growth regulator alar 
increased cancer risk in children 
the report said the adult tolerances for alar used by the 
federal government did not apply to children because they eat more 
apples and apple juice than adults 
the apple industry responded by vigorously protecting the use of 
chemicals and denouncing the nrdc for scare tactics and a thinly 
veiled attempt to remove all chemicals from food production 
the industry also attacked the report as unscientific and said 
the federal government was the proper agent for determining which 
chemicals were safe 
the nrdc which featured actress meryl streep consumer activist 
ralph nader and other celebrities on a carefully planned antialar 
campaign countered that federal regulation of chemicals was too 
slow alar was unnecessary and its health dangers had been known 
for years 
the truth quickly became lost amid the duels on the donahue talk 
show the squabbles on a second 60 minutes and the flipflop 
of federal regulators who first announced that apples were safe to 
eat then pronounced alar a probable carcinogen 
that confused consumers and produced spectacles like school 
districts banning apples from cafeterias one mother sending law 
officers to confiscate an apple from her childs lunch and grocers 
hastily erecting signs that their apples were alarfree 
growers of the nations 1 billion apple crop suffered revenue 
losses from lower sales and prices estimated at more than 100 
million 
it stayed in the press a long time said grower fred 
valentine we thought it would be shorter than what it was 
shortly after voluntarily removing alar from the market last 
june uniroyal chemical co asked epa to cancel the chemicals 
registration which in effect made the chemical illegal to use 
after nov 17 1989 said lisa engstrom the epas special review 
manager for alar 
apple growers are still faced with prices below the cost of 
production they say the problem now is oversupply not consumer 
fear 
but the downward slide started by the alar scare has growers 
across central washington ripping out unprofitable red apple 
orchards and replacing them with pears or peaches 
this is a disaster said terry kelson a field man for 
inland fruit and produce co of wapato and owner of a small 
orchard i can never remember poorer returns 
he estimated that washington growers who produce 60 percent of 
the nations apples might voluntarily rip out 10 percent of their 
red delicious apple trees in the next year 
the chemical that spawned the scare is technically known as 
daminozide and for two decades was sprayed on trees to keep apples 
on the branch longer making them redder and crisper and extending 
the shelf life and harvest time 
janet hathaway an nrdc lawyer in washington dc and 
coauthor of the report said the furor that caused uniroyal to 
remove alar from the market has made farmers more aware they must 
reduce chemical use 
the most significant result by far is the improved awareness 
among both growers and consumers that residues in food can be a 
health issue ms hathaway said 
while the nrdc contends its real target was government 
regulators most hurt by the report were the nations 20000 apple 
growers many of whom did not use alar 
my greatest regret is that growers were caught in the 
crossfire ms hathaway said people who are legally using 
pesticides are very inadvertent targets of these types of 
campaigns 
in washington state growers were hoping the high quality 1988 
crop would help them rebound from a disastrous weatherdamaged 
crop the year before for six months they were right 
but the alar scare cut wholesale prices in half and apple sales 
slumped for several months as stockpiles built up wholesale 
prices fell beneath the cost of production 
a 95 million federal buyout late last summer the first in the 
history of the apple industry failed to strengthen prices 
when the record 1989 crop was harvested last fall warehouses 
were still holding 1988 apples 
youve got holdover junk from the 1988 crop and the taint of 
alar and that started to lower prices said bill gammie of 
yakimas jack frost fruit co the alar thing is hurting us 
a state survey found that no washington growers used alar on the 
present bumper crop 
while prices are down 31 percent from last year demand is 
improving as of jan 31 366 million boxes had been shipped vs 
346 million in the comparable yearearlier period 
but wholesale prices for fresh apples hovered in the 8 per 
42pound box range most of the season about 1 beneath the cost of 
production 
the value of orchards is also decreasing the yakima county 
assessors office recently estimated that the value of apple 
orchards dropped an average of 1700 per acre in the past year to 
about 3700 
many in the industry insist that the public is fast forgetting 
alar 
this issue became such a joke the way it was amplified it was 
much ado about nothing said tom hale president of the 
washington apple commission an industry marketing group even 
last april twothirds of the people thought it was overblown

swedens car maker volvo and 
renault the french stateowned automotive concern said friday 
they intend to make sizeable investments in each other in hopes of 
making both companies more competitive 
the announcement made during a news conference in the dutch 
capital capped a year of negotiations between the two companies 
whose sales have been under pressure in an increasingly competitive 
world market 
volvo has been suffering from the slump in european auto sales 
on the previously profitable us market while renault is rapidly 
losing ground to the japanese at the top end of the market 
in addition to the equity investments the companies said they 
intended to enter into an extensive cooperation agreement under 
which they would coordinate elements of product development 
purchasing and investment plans 
but they said each company would maintain its independent 
identity trademarks and distribution organizations and would 
continue assembling and marketing its own cars trucks and buses 
under the agreement the companies would exchange a 45 percent 
interest in their respective truck and bus divisions 
the plan calls for renault to become a limited company in which 
ab volvo would acquire through a special issue 20 percent of the 
shares and an option to obtain another 5 percent 
renault at the same time would acquire a 25 percent share of 
the volvo car operation moreover renault intends to buy a 10 
percent interest in ab volvo the parent company of the swedish 
industrial giant 
the value of the transactions was estimated at about 48 
billion 
the deal is subject to french government approval but raymond 
levy renaults chief executive officer said that i wouldnt be 
here if i hadnt been sure about the position of my government 
volvo president pehr gyllenhammar told reporters that the move 
will give the companies the size breadth and depth well above 
the critical mass necessary to survive in this fiercely competitive 
industry 
describing the cooperation structure as an alliance not a 
merger or an acquisition gyllenhammar said the two companies 
would work together on product development purchasing raw 
materials and parts as well as production 
the agreement does not infringe on the integrity of the names 
and makes of volvos and renaults product lines gyllenhammar 
said adding that worldwide dealer networks and marketing 
operations would remain separated 
he added that volvo and renault will maintain their headquarters 
in goteborg sweden and paris respectively 
but he did not rule out the eventual development of a joint new 
model 
the swedishfrench agreement was expected to have farreaching 
consequences for the auto market in the european economic 
community also known as the eec 
in brussels the eec commission the communitys executive body 
said it would review the proposed deal to assess its impact on 
competition in the european community motor vehicle market 
a commission spokesman said the it had been told informally 
several months ago that talks were underway between renault and 
volvo 
under a new law that takes effect sept 21 major mergers in the 
12nation community must be submitted to the commission for prior 
approval 
analysts estimated the volvo and renault companies would produce 
about 2 million vehicles a year or about 20 percent of the 
european market 
the companies would produce more than 140000 trucks beating 
the current leader in that field daimler benz of west germany by 
about 25000 units 
in 1988 the latest year for which complete figures were 
available renault more than doubled its net profit to 8913 
billion francs or 159 billion from 3689 billion or 658 
million the previous year 
last year the french company manufactured more than 16 million 
passenger cars and 80250 trucks 
volvo had an operating profit of 406 billion swedish crowns or 
676 million for the first nine months of 1989 down 14 percent 
from the corresponding period a year earlier however this figure 
excluded 750 million crowns or 125 million in nonrecurring 
gains 
in 1988 the swedish companys car sales were down by 4 percent 
totaling 414000 cars in the same year truck sales were up 25 
percent to 60200 units 
prior to fridays announcement trade in volvo stock was 
suspended at both the paris and the stockholm exchanges renault 
as a french government agency has no publicly traded shares

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan urged athletes and sports associations to turn aside the 
blood money of tobacco company sponsorships friday 
having cigarette companies sponsor sporting events implies that 
smoking is healthful and lures young people to take it up said 
sullivan the nations top health official who has repeatedly 
denounced smoking and cigarette makers in recent weeks 
an athlete or sports figure should not allow his or her good 
name hardearned image or integrity to be exploited by the tobacco 
industry to push a product that when used as intended causes 
death he said 
this blood money should not be used to foster a misleading 
impression that smoking is compatible with good health 
sullivan called on universities and other institutions to refuse 
to host events sponsored by tobacco companies and he urged 
advertisers to shun the temptation of this tainted money stained 
by addiction disease and death 
sullivan spoke at a news conference called by a coalition of 
health groups to protest sponsorship of womens tennis events by 
virginia slims cigarettes 
virginia slims has sponsored such events for two decades it is 
sponsoring 14 events on the womens professional tour this year 
including a tournament at george washington university in 
washington this week 
steve weiss a spokesman for philip morris cos inc 
manufacturer of virginia slims rejected the criticism and said 
we intend to be a sponsor of womens tennis for a long time into 
the future 
we dont ask the players to smoke or to endorse smoking but 
we do ask them to get out on the court and play some great tennis 
and thats what they do he said were promoting 
entertainment for people around the country 
players on the tour also defend the company zina garrison one 
of the topranked women players said philip morris has always 
been a classy organization real good to us theyve done a lot 
for womens tennis and as they say womens tennis has come a long 
way and theyve been the reason 
sullivan has become the federal governments most outspoken 
opponent of smoking since he took on the rj reynolds tobacco co 
last month condemning its plan to testmarket a cigarette brand 
aimed primarily at blacks 
the next day reynolds canceled the plan 
now the company intends to testmarket a cigarette called 
dakota reynolds said that late last year it discarded a plan to 
target the new cigarette to women and decided instead to aim for 
all smokers of rival marlboro with the new product 
sullivan said cigarette advertising that is designed to lure 
young people women minorities or bluecollar workers is 
dishonest irresponsible and unconscionable 
earlier this week sullivan attacked tobacco company advertising 
practices and called on television stations to donate free air time 
to help educate viewers about the dangers of smoking 
he also said he is asking hospital administrators across the 
country to declare hospitals smokefree zones and he has told

stock prices stumbled friday on wall street but the decline 
appeared mild compared with an overnight plunge in tokyo where 
stocks took their fifthbiggest drop ever 
the decline in japan reverberated in key foreign markets which 
not only declined on the day but also posted big losses for the 
week 
based on the tokyo markets poor showing analysts predicted the 
dow jones industrial average would open as much as 40 points lower 
when trading shifted to new york 
the dow did dip initially but the key barometer moved into plus 
territory within an hour after seesawing throughout the session 
the dow finished down 1058 to 256419 at the closing bell 
broader market indicators also dropped with about two stocks 
falling in price for every one that rose on the new york stock 
exchange 
the us markets modest response to the turmoil in tokyo which 
this past week suffered two of its five biggest drops ever and 
other potentially negative factors heartened some analysts 
the resilience of the us market is impressive said marc 
chandler an analyst at mms international in chicago not only 
has it shrugged off the collapse of the japanese and other foreign 
markets but it was practically unaffected by the collapse of 
drexel he said referring to the downfall and ongoing 
liquidation of junkbond pioneer drexel burnham lambert inc the 
largest wall street firm to fail 
still analysts arent proclaiming a new bull market eugene 
peroni a technical analyst with janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia said trading friday was fidgety the market just 
doesnt seem to have much upside motivation 
earlier friday in tokyo the nikkei index of 225 selected issues 
fell 93587 points or 261 percent in light trading to end the 
week at 3489097 it was the first time the nikkei has fallen 
below the 35000point level since last october 
the fall came just two days after the tokyo markets 
thirdlargest decline and put the nikkei down nearly 7 percent for 
the week 
japanese dealers have begun blaming program trading strategies 
involving huge blocks of stock and the us firms that generally 
employ them on the tokyo exchange for the recent wild and 
unnerving price swings in their market 
since foreign traders brought in the method of arbitrage 
trading share prices here began strange fluctuations we have 
never seen before said michio katsumata of nomura securities co 
in tokyo 
but others argue that the japanese market which until recently 
seemed to know no direction other than up was ripe for a fall 
it is quite possible to rationalize that japan is a market 
that has gone too high said charles larkum an equity analyst at 
james capel and co in london its a matter of coming down to a 
more reasonable level 
while a decline in tokyo was expected the speed with which the 
market has lost ground surprised many fridays tailspin rattled 
european markets as well as wall street 
at the close in london the financial timesstock exchange 
100share index was off 325 points or 14 percent at 22367 
the index skidded nearly 37 percent for the week 
in frankfurt stock prices closed sharply lower both on the day 
and for the week the dax one of west germanys key stock gauges 
fell 3051 points or nearly 2 percent to 178964 its lowest 
level in a month the index lost 55 percent for the week 
but european traders were not solely focused on tokyo concern 
has replaced euphoria over the eventual reunification of east and 
west germany and traders are wary of the inflationary consequences 
of unity 
analysts noted that interest rates are subtly driving the 
worlds stock markets 
weakness in the japanese and german markets reflect where they 
are in their business cycle mms internationals chandler said 
rates are trending higher in these markets as their governments 
attempt to stem inflationary pressures while rates in the united 
states have been retreating to prevent a recession

for the third time in the last year a medical 
products company recalled one of its catheters friday after federal 
authorities seized the devices and warned they could cause serious 
harm 
william bopp vice president of cr bard inc in murray hill 
nj said his company instituted the recall friday and was working 
with the federal government to retrieve the product 
us marshals on thursday seized 2000 boxes of catheters 
manufactured by bards usci division in billerica 
gail costello spokeswoman for the food and drug administration 
in boston said bard had received complaints about the catheters 
which are used to unclog arteries but failed to fully investigate 
the trouble 
in addition according to a justice department statement the 
company received complaints of malfunctions of the device 
indicating that death or serious injury could result if the 
malfunction were to recur and yet failed to report the complaints 
to the fda as required by fda regulations 
about 2000 catheters were affected by the recall bopp said 
and the company was sending out letters to customers to inform them 
of the action 
i assume they are in use costello said of course there 
is concern 
last year bard recalled two other catheters one because it had 
a problem with tips breaking and the other because changes were 
made without following fda rules costello said the two catheters 
also came from the usci division 
on the third catheter the problems related to a balloon device 
that inflates and presses against deposits blocking arteries bopp 
said in some cases he said the balloon would not deflate 
properly making it difficult to remove the catheter 
in one case a malfunctioning catheter was used with a patient 
who died but bopp said it has not been determined whether the 
device caused the death 
bard started receiving complaints about the third catheter 
shortly after it was introduced in late 1987 bopp said 
regarding the reporting of complaints bopp said we have a 
corporate guideline that we believe complies with all the 
requirements 
costello declined to say how long the fda has been aware of the 
trouble saying the case remains under investigation

fridays gain in the corn market was attributed largely to

corns slow steady advance from about 237 a bushel at the 
beginning of february

inc 
he predicted the may contract which settled at 253 friday

vehicle sales by the major automakers fell 121 
percent in midfebruary compared with last year as januarys 
minivan buying frenzy appeared to take some steam out of this 
months sales the companies said friday 
the eight companies with north american plants reported selling 
cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 32258 during the feb 
1120 period this year compared with a rate of 36687 during the 
same time last year 
car sales were down 15 percent and truck sales which include 
minivans slumped 13 percent truck sales in midjanuary when 
chrysler corp offered incentives on its popular minivan models 
were up 94 percent over the same period the previous year 
the minivan rebates the first chrysler ever offered on the 
popular vehicles began dec 15 and ended jan 31 
combined sales of chryslers minivans the dodge caravan 
plymouth voyager and chrysler town amp country exceed combined 
sales of minivans made by general motors corp ford motor co 
toyota motor corp mitsubishi motors corp and mazda motor corp 
its slow this month said alan helfman general manager of 
river oaks chryslerplymouth in houston he said he sold about 100 
minivans last month and ill be lucky to get 30 in february 
in january car and truck sales by the big three which 
accounted for about 90 percent of the sales of north americanbuilt 
vehicles were up 41 percent compared with january last year a 
21percent decrease in car sales was offset by a 139percent 
increase in truck sales spurred by the chrysler minivan rebates 
midfebruary truck sales ran 47 percent behind truck sales 
during the same period the month before thats an indication that 
some people who had planned to buy minivans in february may have 
bought in january instead to take advantage of the incentives 
they bought everything for the next six months because of 
that helfman said of the rebates 
so far this year car sales for the eight companies were running 
13 percent ahead of last years pace and truck sales were up 59 
percent that works out to a combined car and truck sales pace 3 
percent ahead of last years rate 
it tapered off a little bit at the first part of the month 
said patrick callabretto sales manager at crowley 
chryslerplymouth in bristol conn with the rebates they 
minivans sold very well they were tough to come by

the stabbing murder of an israel 
diamond exchange dealer has sent shudders through an industry known 
for such trust that deals for millions of dollars in precious 
stones are sealed with a handshake 
israels tightknit diamond community has thrived on secrecy 
protected by an elaborate security system once reputed to be the 
best in israel outside military installations 
so it was unusual that diamond exchange president moshe 
schnitzer made a public statement earlier this month warning that 
the killing had frightened buyers away from the worlds largest 
market for gemstones 
today any buyer who comes asks is it true there was a 
murder here is this building secure said schnitzer who has 
run the exchange for more than two decades we have to let the 
world know that this is an isolated case that happened once in 50 
years 
thieves last month evaded the exchange buildings security 
system stabbed israeli broker uri shlibovsky to death in an 
upperfloor office and purloined about 4 million in jewels 
newspaper reports have said a shutdown of video cameras during 
the murder suggested an inside job and some dealers expressed 
fears that their private world of trust and security had been 
breached 
the setback in confidence couldnt have come at a worse time for 
israels diamond industry already beset by a squeeze in profits 
and several other disquieting incidents 
last year the industry was caught between slumping world sales 
and a sharp rise in the cost of rough stones controlled by the 
south african de beers marketing cartel in london a half a dozen 
diamond brokerages went bankrupt and more than 2000 cutters and 
polishers were laid off 
the diamond fraternity also was shaken last summer when a 
financially troubled israeli dealer fled the country leaving 
behind millions of dollars in debt there also have been reports 
repeatedly denied that israeli and us diamond markets are 
laundering points for south american drug money 
in israel the diamond exchange is the heart of three modern 
highrise buildings that make up the diamond center in this 
northern tel aviv suburb 
about 2500 brokers dealers and manufacturers are members and 
many spend their days seated at rows of simple black wooden tables 
buying and selling gems on the exchange floor 
to the dealers diamonds are known simply as goods passed 
around in small bits of folded white paper that belie their real 
worth 
the industry was born during world war ii in what is now israel 
when the historical diamond centers in holland and belgium were put 
out of operation by the nazi invasion israels first dealers were 
jewish refugees from europe who traded gems over coffee at tel aviv 
cafes 
their sons and grandsons often ultraorthodox jews 
distinguishable by their black homburgs remain at the center of a 
business that can operate on trust because of long friendships and 
kinships 
there are no contracts no lawyers no deposits notes 
diamond dealer joseph nadel who has spent five decades in the 
business you make business with a mazel 
the word is hebrew for luck uttered when a deal has been 
struck be it for a sack of rough stones or a single brilliant 
solitaire 
nobody knows for sure how much business is transacted daily on 
the exchange floor or in the dozens of private offices on upper 
levels of the diamond center admits moshe persky deputy managing 
director of the bourse 
but each year nearly half the worlds gemquality rough 
diamonds pass through israel for cutting and polishing in the 
factories that line the alleyways around the exchange he says 
last year more than 7 million carats in rough diamonds were 
imported into israel and 38 million carats in polished diamonds 
valued at 274 billion were exported a carat the main measure 
for diamonds is onefifth of a gram 
the diamond center is protected by double gates hidden video 
cameras metal detectors and an undisclosed number of guards that 
scrutinize the 12000 daily visitors but evidently that now is 
considered insufficient 
since the murder a canadian company named technologia systems 
ltd has disclosed its been retained by the exchange to embellish 
the security with voiceidentification checkpoints and a digitally 
operated telephone system that records all calls 
inside the exchange there are jaillike vaults for overnight 
diamond storage banks to arrange credit armored trucks for 
transport specialized insurance agents even courts to arbitrate 
disputes 
in the midst of this private selfpolicing world police are 
seeking a murder suspect a 250000 reward has been offered for 
information leading to the killers capture 
one broker insisting on anonymity said the most disturbing 
question in the slaying was how the thieves carried it off they 
somehow managed to turn off the buildings video cameras and get 
away its very worrying

two congressional panels plan to look into the 
circumstances surrounding the collapse of onetime wall street 
powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc it was disclosed friday 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee 
scheduled a hearing next friday into the downfall of drexel whose 
parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection last week in 
new york 
among the scheduled witnesses are securities and exchange 
commission chairman richard c breeden in what would be his first 
public comment on the matter since drexel burnham lambert group 
inc filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
meanwhile rep john d dingell chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee has asked the sec to supply all the 
information it has on bonuses drexel paid to employees in the 
months preceding its feb 13 bankruptcy filing 
drexels parent company was forced to seek protection from some 
2000 creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code after 
it defaulted on 100 million in loans and lenders refused to grant 
new financing 
drexel said friday it had paid 260 million in cash and stock 
bonuses to top executives in december and january but claimed the 
decision to make the payments came long before its financial woes 
became apparent earlier reports had indicated the bonus payments 
had been as high as 350 million in the weeks preceding the 
companys collapse 
dingell dmich asked the sec to report on whether the bonus 
payments impaired the capital of the firm or have constituted 
fraudulent transfers under the bankruptcy laws the request was 
in a feb 21 letter to the sec made public on friday 
dingell in his capacity as chairman of the oversight and 
investigations subcommittee asked the sec to provide the 
subcommittee with the commissions analysis of these payments in 
relation to violations of both the letter and spirit of the 
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws 
the subcommittee also asked the sec to deliver by march 16 a 
copy of drexels bankruptcy contingency plan and copies of any 
minutes transcripts or other memorializations of any board of 
directors meetings where any such plan was discussed or approved

bolar pharmaceutical co the beleaguered 
generic drug manufacturer that is undergoing a food and drug 
administration audit and facing fraud charges brought by the 
securities and exchange commission said thursday its president and 
executive vice president had resigned 
the company also said it might face criminal charges as a result 
of the fda investigation which involves the application and 
manufacturing processes for the firms drugs 
bolar said in a statement it currently is not selling products 
that account for nearly all of its sales and warned that earnings 
are likely to suffer as a result 
bolar said its president robert shulman was replaced by the 
companys chief financial officer larry raisfeld jack rivers the 
firms executive vice president also stepped down but both he and 
shulman were remaining on bolars board 
the firm also said its director of scientific affairs seymour 
inkles was named acting head of research and development 
the sec filed civil fraud charges against bolar in federal court 
in washington earlier this month accusing the company of making 
misleading and inadequate disclosure to the public about its 
agreement with the fda to temporarily suspend shipment of some of 
its drugs 
bolar halted distribution pending the fda audit of its 
application and manufacturing procedures the company also withdrew 
its version of the highbloodpressure drug dyazide recently 
because it appeared false documents had been used to support its 
claims for the product 
the company said thursday it has resumed shipping some of its 
drug lines but many remain under audit and some are being 
recalled for the purposes of an audit 
the fda has not indicated that these products are unsafe or 
ineffective and the company intends to reintroduce some or all of 
the recalled drugs after its own review and approval by the fda 
bolar said 
bolar said the drugs being recalled were in addition to earlier 
recalls of its versions of dyazide and two other widelyused drugs 
macrodantin and dilantin there have been no recalls or questions 
raised by the fda about those drugs which are manufactured by 
other companies 
the firm said it did not know how long of the government audits 
might take and there can be no assurance that fda approvals will 
be forthcoming 
bolar said it was not selling products that accounted for 94 
percent of its 1989 sales such cessation of sales will have 
a material adverse effect on the companys financial position it 
said 
bolar said it believed some of the fda audits might give rise 
to criminal liability including possible criminal liability with 
respect to the company it did not elaborate 
the sec action the second against bolar in as many months also 
named shulman the nowdeparted president in january the sec 
suspended trading in bolars securities for 10 days after 
allegations that the company falsified safety claims about its 
highbloodpressure drug 
that suspension came after a house subcommittee disclosed a 
letter from bolars attorneys that indicated the company apparently 
falsified documents about safety tests for dyazide

poland signed world bank loan agreements 
for 360 million thursday delivered with the promise that up to 
25 billion will be available if poland sticks to its dramatic 
economic reform plan 
world bank president barber conable also pledged that the total 
of 5 billion his agency plans to lend in eastern europe in the 
next three years wont come at the expense of aid to impoverished 
nations elsewhere which have traditionally borrowed from the 
international development bank 
we are expanding our role in eastern europe precisely because 
of our worldwide responsibilities and experience and because 
eastern europes agenda of change growth and expanded human 
opportunity make a compelling claim on our resources conable 
told government officials 
but he said assistance to eastern europe should be additional 
so as not to come at the expense of the poorer parts of the third 
world 
us deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger chosen by 
president bush to coordinate aid to poland was in warsaw thursday 
for a twoday working visit with polish officials mapping the 
nations economic reform efforts 
he met with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki finance minister 
leszek balcerowicz and other economic leaders 
conable said no eastern european country is poor enough to 
qualify for the world bank loans provided by its international 
development agency and that the world banks strong capital 
position and access to funds will allow it to expand other lending 
without crowding out other regions 
the entry of the newly democratic nations of the east bloc and 
their shattered economies into the competition for aid has left 
nations in africa latin america and elsewhere worried that 
resources will dry up 
even in poland there has been concern in some quarters that the 
other east bloc countries following warsaws course toward reform 
some of which have lessdamaged industrial bases will draw away 
needed western assistance 
poland withdrew from the washingtonbased world bank in 1954 and 
returned in 1986 the other east bloc members are hungary and 
romania czechoslovakia which also withdrew in 1954 applied in 
january to rejoin the bank owned by the governments of 152 
countries 
the loan agreements signed by conable balcerowicz and polish 
national bank president wladyslaw baka with mazowiecki looking on 
are the first for poland since it rejoined the world bank 
a 260 million loan will support industrial export while the 
second 100 million loan will finance agricultural development 
both 17year loans are intended for enterprises that will break 
bottlenecks impeding production in polands outmoded industries 
and undermechanized farming said janel loos the world banks 
expert on poland 
the loans will go to the polish national bank which will extend 
credit to commercial banks for lending to industries that meet the 
world banks criteria for viability and repayment potential 
the world bank expects to lend up to 25 billion to poland in 
the next three years and baka said poland expects to receive about 
1 billion in the next year 
but the national bank president said polands infrastructure is 
not yet sufficient to handle additional lending and that the 
expansion of commercial banking and other changes are required 
the world bank will extend further credit as long as poland 
continues its unprecedented effort to convert its staggering 
centrally controlled economy into a marketdriven system conable 
said 
the international community can and will be of assistance 
but ultimately the peoples and their governments must shoulder the 
burden of economic modernization he told polish officials 
choice already exists in the political sphere and it must be 
dramatically extended in the economic sector conable said 
among the required steps he listed an overhaul of the monopoly 
state enterprise system an opening of the polish economy to the 
west creation of a capital market and revisions of business 
regulations and labor laws 
he said protection must be provided for those displaced by the 
economic reform expected to create substantial unemployment as 
unprofitable state enterprises close 
the alarming decline in health standards in eastern europe 
must be halted education modernized and the housing shortage 
abated he said 
and he said because eastern europe includes some of the 
worlds most polluted regions action on the environmental front 
cannot be postponed until some future date with the economic crisis 
has been overcome 
to advise on these efforts conable said the world bank will 
within three months establish a mission in warsaw with a highlevel 
director one of only three such offices worldwide 
conable and baka said further funding also depends on 
farreaching restructuring or reduction of polands 40 billion 
debt to the west 
the first encouraging step was taken last week conable 
said when the paris club an informal grouping of 17 countries 
holding 27 billion of the debt agreed to a oneyear moratorium on 
payments and a 14year restructuring covering 10 billion

media general inc reported a sharply narrower 
fourth quarter loss and said earnings more than doubled in 1989 
largely reflecting the impact of a major writeoff in 1988 
the company reported a loss of 12 million or 4 cents a share 
in the three months ended dec 31 compared with a loss of 296 
million or 103 a share in the same period a year earlier 
revenues fell to 165 million from 191 million

fell 198 percent to 606 million from 756 million 
the companys results for the year and the fourth quarter of 
1988 were depressed by a 415 million writeoff largely stemming 
from the sale of its broadcast services operation 
the latest quarters results included a 99 million gain from 
the sale of a newspaper by garden state newspapers of which media 
general owns 40 percent 
that gain was largely offset by a 65 million loss representing 
unrecovered costs and expenses relating to the companys lawsuit

lawsuit stemming from its acquisition of tanner a broadcasting

drexel burnham lambert inc said friday it paid 
1989 bonuses of 196 million in cash and 64 million in company 
stock less than reports that pointed to large payments prior to 
the firms collapse 
drexel released details about the payments after harsh reaction 
from bankruptcy court creditors who criticized the firm for 
reportedly paying up to 350 million in bonuses shortly before its 
parent filed for chapter 11 protection 
drexel said 44 percent or 113 million of the total bonuses 
was guaranteed to executives and top professionals early in 1989 in 
an effort to keep them at the firm after it agreed to plead guilty 
to securities crimes and pay 650 million in penalties 
with the firms demise the value of bonuses taken in stock in 
drexels parent became potentially worthless 
what it says is these bonuses were part of the ongoing 
business activities drexel spokesman steven anreder said 
there was nothing extraordinary and in fact they were prudently 
pared back in light of the changed business conditions 
but william schopf general counsel for first city bancorp of 
texas one of the largest creditors said the disclosure does not 
resolve questions about drexels financial state at the time of the 
payments and why the firm made guarantees despite its uncertain 
condition 
its still a lot of money to go out the door schopf said 
drexel said the bonuses of which 150 million were paid in 
december and 110 million in january were 60 percent below the 
amount paid in the same two months a year earlier when drexel said 
it paid 505 million 
the disclosure came as questions about drexels demise grew and 
anger over the bonuses intensified two congressional panels 
scheduled inquiries into the collapse and creditors asked a 
bankruptcy court judge to appoint an examiner to oversee the 
companys management 
in papers filed in us bankruptcy court a leading creditor 
accused the parent company and its brokerage subsidiary of 
dissipating billions of dollars in assets without prior knowledge 
or court supervision 
drexel said its 22 senior management members received 142 
million in bonuses including 75 million that had been guaranteed 
earlier of the remainder executives invested a sizable share 
in preferred stock chief executive frederick joseph reportedly 
took his entire bonus in stock 
anreder said the guarantees were made because of the firms 
uncertain status after it agreed to enter the guilty plea which 
followed a lengthy government investigation 
in order to show a sense of comfort that their compensation 
would be on a par or close to what they had received previously 
the guarantees were necessary he said 
meanwhile former employees met about attempting to recover the 
value of their stock holdings in the collapsed firm the workers 
54 percent ownership of the parent was wiped out by the bankruptcy 
filing 
most of us have written it down to zero said geoffrey 
snyder who was promoted to corporate vice president a few weeks 
before drexels demise a lot of us didnt have a say in what 
went on in terms of the reasons its gone down to zero we want to 
see if we have any rights 
snyder said shareholders planned to form a committee to join a 
general meeting of creditors set for next tuesday in manhattan 
many employees had most or all of their wealth locked in drexel 
shares shareholders generally are last to receive payments in a 
bankruptcy case behind other creditors 
drexels parent company filed for chapter 11 protection from 
creditors on feb 13 
the motion seeking an examiner was filed by first city which is 
owed 25 million and has emerged as the most active creditor the 
matter will be considered at a hearing next thursday before us 
bankruptcy judge howard buschman iii 
first city said it wants more information about the liquidation 
of billions of dollars in assets by the brokerage subsidiary 
including drexels payment of as much as 350 million in bonuses in 
the weeks before its collapse some executives reportedly received 
up to 20 million 
an examiner can zero in directly on the two questions were 
interested in right now the massive and rapid disposal of assets 
that seems to be going on and the bonus payments said james e 
day a first city senior vice president 
in court papers first city said it has been unable to obtain 
information about drexels assets and operations despite a meeting 
with a drexel employee on thursday 
the creditor also said an order by buschman granting drexel a 
90day extension to file financial data disclosure which first 
city has challenged also has slowed the process 
under federal bankruptcy law a judge can order a debtor to 
return assets sold before a bankruptcy filing if the judge finds 
that creditors were defrauded asset transfers to another creditor 
such as a corporate insider also may qualify for an order 
but creditors may have trouble recovering assets already sold 
because the brokerage subsidiary has not filed for bankruptcy 
protection drexel earlier this week said it had sold nearly 38 
billion in securities holdings and was liquidating remaining assets

dealers attributed the nikkeis recent decline mainly to 
speculation of an increase in the bank of japans discount rate 
the key rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks 
higher interest rates tend to discourage stock investment 
the discount rate stands at 425 percent following three 
increases in the last year central bank officials have said only 
that they are watching economic conditions but a rise in inflation 
in recent months along with fast growth in the economy and the 
money supply have led many analysts to predict a further increase 
widespread bearish sentiment caused by the recent volatility of 
the exchange also contributed to fridays decline dealers said 
so far this week the nikkei index has dropped 164515 points 
or 44 percent not counting friday mornings losses on thursday 
the index swung more than 800 points during the day before ending 
with a modest gain 
computeraided arbitrage selling amid the extremely thin trading 
was another factor in fridays drop dealers said 
as a result of the falling stock futures index institutional 
investors primarily foreign trust funds sold a large volume of 
shares on the stock market 
the market is extremely vulnerable right now to such selling 
because of the low volume of stocks being traded and small number 
of investors taking part said michio katsumata of nomura 
securities co 
most major players remain on the sidelines because of 
uncertain prospect of the markets directions 
he said securities and trust fund companies hesitate to increase 
their holdings for fear of reporting losses at the end of the 
fiscal year which ends march 31 
most japanese companies close their annual accounts at the end 
of march and securities companies often cash in some of their 
holdings at the end of the fiscal year to offset earlier losses 
speculation about the emergence of another stock scandal also 
discouraged many investors from entering the alreadybearish 
market dealers said one rumor suggested a major rulingparty 
politician may be arrested for illegal stock dealings there was no 
news to back up the rumors 
i dont know how serious the rumors are this time but they 
surely make investors think twice about buying new stocks said a 
dealer with tachibana securities co speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
in tokyos foreign exchange market the dollar started trading 
at 14620 yen up a sharp 097 yen from thursdays close it moved 
in a range of 1459514632 yen in moderate trading 
the us currency opened higher following its overnight surge 
against the yen which also lost ground against other major 
currencies including the west german mark said toru kanai a 
foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities co 
in new york the dollar closed at 14653 yen up from 14550 yen 
on wednesday 
currently market players are not sure which direction the 
dollar may go kanai said about half of traders say the dollar 
will go lower and others predict it will rise further 
dealers said market participants are frustrated with the bank of 
japans failure to raise interest rates as a result the yen is 
likely to remain weak they predicted 
traders said the central bank was selling dollars intermittently 
throughout the morning in an attempt to buck up the yen the bank 
does not comment on its monetary actions

perrier the spring water giant already 
reeling from a worldwide recall is being sued by a number of angry 
consumers who claim the company knowingly sold water tainted with 
the toxic chemical benzene 
several lawsuits filed in the last week in us district courts 
in bridgeport and philadelphia charge the company with misleading 
the public by portraying its water as pure natural and superior to 
other brands 
in fact perrier water was not better than the other leading 
brands the opposite was true said a lawsuit filed tuesday in 
federal court in bridgeport on behalf of bb vahlsing a longtime 
perrier drinker from wynnewood pa 
richard bieder whose law firm of koskoff koskoff amp bieder is 
representing vahlsing said friday that his client has purchased 
perrier for a substantial period of time relying on the fact she 
thought it was pure as anybody who watches their ads would think 
when they stick that straw into the mountain and suck water out 
the suit was filed in connecticut because perrier group of 
america inc is based in greenwich bieder said 
at least six other lawsuits were filed feb 16 in philadelphia 
because the plaintiffs live in pennsylvania and perrier was sold 
there said c oliver burt iii of greenfield amp chimicles a 
haverford pa law firm that represents some plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for anguish they 
say they suffered when they found out that the water bottled in 
vergeze france was tainted with tiny amounts of benzene a toxic 
chemical and industrial solvent 
the lawsuits name as defendants source perrier sa perrier group 
and perrier group of america 
all the lawsuits ask the courts to declare a class action which 
would allow perrier drinkers across the country to join 
perrier spokeswoman jane lazgin said attorneys hired by her 
company had not yet read the complaints in detail and had no 
comment 
but it does seem groundless to us she said we feel weve 
taken the necessary measures and have acted rightly 
perrier recalled 72 million bottles in north america on feb 9 
after a few bottles in north carolina were found to contain traces 
of benzene a substance linked to cancer in animals when fed in 
high doses 
the company initially said the problem was caused by a worker 
who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by cleaning it 
with benzene 
but the recall was expanded to 160 million bottles around the 
world the next week after more contamination was discovered 
overseas perrier acknowledged benzene is found naturally in its 
spring in france and contamination occurred because workers failed 
to replace filters designed to remove the benzene 
lazgin said she could not comment on whether perrier knew about 
the benzene in the spring before the recall the chemical is made 
from petroleum but also occurs naturally in drinking water and 
groundwater at low concentrations 
perrier sparkling water was the third bestselling bottled water 
in the united states in 1988 capturing about 57 percent of the 
22 billion in industrywide sales for the year according to 
beverage marketing corp an industry research consultant 
the suits filed in connecticut and pennsylvania are the only 
known legal actions by perrier drinkers said andrew j ogilvie a 
san francisco attorney who specializes in consumer fraud cases and 
is also involved in the suits 
the lawsuits allege perrier violated consumer protection laws in 
several states and committed fraud and misrepresentation through 
improper advertising bieder and burt said
