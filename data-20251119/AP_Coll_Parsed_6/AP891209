a woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of 
two landmark us supreme court decisions legalizing abortion said 
friday she will be reunited with the last of the children taken 
from her 20 years ago 
sandra cano who was identified as mary doe in doe vs bolton 
said her 22yearold daughter april will fly to atlanta from 
seattle on saturday it will be their first meeting in more than 17 
years 
the supreme courts decision in doe vs bolton which struck 
down georgias abortion law was issued jan 22 1973 the same day 
the court struck down texas abortion law in the more famous case 
labeled roe vs wade 
earlier this year sandra cano was reunited with the daughter 
involved in that case mrs cano said she gave that child melissa 
up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not to go through with the 
abortion 
mrs cano of suburban atlanta noted that two older children a 
son joel and a daughter april had been taken from her a year 
before that she said she lost custody of the children after a 
dispute with a sitter and because of me being young and naive 
mrs cano whose name was sandra bensing at the time said she 
tried to regain custody of the children from the family they had 
been placed with and finally got the boy 12 years ago when he was 
11 she has not seen the girl however since 1972 
child welfare officials thought it best that the family not be 
reunited family and children services just kept telling me she 
was happily adopted and to let her alone mrs cano said in a 
telephone interview 
she said she managed to track the adoptive parents to columbus 
and then denver but hit a dead end eight years ago in november a 
week after thanksgiving april called 
mrs cano said her daughter told her she had been trying to find 
her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed 
in a mental hospital at age 14 
she said her adoptive father who refused to have anything to do 
with her was the one who finally told her to contact georgia 
social services leading her to her birth mother 
now that she has her family back mrs cano said she plans to 
increase her involvement in the prolife movement because of her 
connection to the court case and her present stand against 
abortion she has been invited to represent the antiabortion 
position on talk shows and at meetings 
after she identified herself as the cases mary doe in february 
she said her car was shot at two trucks were stolen and graffiti 
was scrawled on another vehicle 
she and her husband moved out of atlanta to a suburb she said 
declining to identify their hometown 
im going to start coming out start speaking out and being 
more active now because weve got the children back she said 
not many people get that second chance

federal regulators are reining in floridas 
largest savings and loan centrust bank of miami which lavished 
millions of dollars on expensive art yachts corporate jets and 
limousines 
centrust called the action unnecessary saying the thrift was in 
its best financial condition in five years 
in a legal order issued friday the office of thrift supervision 
told the institution to sell whats left of its 29 million art 
collection some of which had been kept at the home of centrust 
chairman david l paul 
it forbid centrust from increasing its executives salaries or 
paying dividends to stockholders told it to sell its limousines 
jet and a 233000 sailboat known as bodacious within 90 days 
the institution must stop paying the crew and other expenses for 
the yacht owned by paul grand cru 
the thrift office said in a statement that it issued the order 
to curb serious dissipation of the institutions assets after 
determining that centrust had engaged in regulatory violations 
and unsafe or unsound practices 
paul in a statement issued in miami criticized the ots action 
the ots is clearly trying to use centrust as a test case to 
impose its views on the thrift industry after it failed to get its 
views adopted by the accounting profession paul said our 
financial statements have been reviewed by a leading accounting 
firm and found to be in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles 
we intend to vigorously contest this unilateral and misguided 
ots action 
sampl bailout legislation enacted in august gave us the 
enforcement power to move quickly and we are taking full advantage 
of this authority said thrift office director m danny wall 
however a private analyst said centrust will almost certainly 
fail and that the cease and desist order came too late to save 
taxpayers much money 
centrust is a gone institution i think the order in and of 
itself isnt going to do anything the damage has been done said 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
at the end of june centrust was reporting assets of 97 
billion making it the nations 22nd largest sampl and floridas 
biggest it was 433 million in the red as measured by tangible 
capital having slipped over the previous year from being in the 
black by 1289 million 
the sampl and its 71 branch offices remain open during normal 
business hours with all deposit accounts federally insured to 
100000 centrust has been seeking federal approval to sell 63 of 
its branches and deposit accounts assigned to those offices to 
great western bank of beverly hills calif the nations 
secondlargest sampl 
ely speculated that the thrift offices order was issued to buy 
time until the branch sales can go through 
one provision of the order forbids centrust from further sale of 
its uninsured debt to its retail customers such sales have drawn 
the close scrutiny of congress since the spring when 22000 
customers lost an estimated 250 million by purchasing the debt of 
lincoln savings and loan association irvine calif 
rep charles schumer dny a house banking committee member 
who is sponsoring legislation banning sampls from selling debt 
through their branch offices said centrusts debt also was 
potentially worthless 
earlier it received permission from the thrift office to sell 
50 million in debt in minimum denominations of 2000 
schumer said thrift office records show that shaky sampls are more 
likely to issue their debt in small denominations which attracts 
unsophisticated investors who can be misled into thinking they are 
buying insured certificates of deposit 
centrust under orders from state regulators has already sold 
much of its 22painting collection bought for 29 million 
including portrait of a man as mars by flemish master peter 
paul rubens 
according to the thrift office centrust also spent 329000 on 
four sculptures 208000 for four oriental rugs and 84000 for 
crystal stemware maintenance and hangar fees for its corporate jet 
exceeded 1 million a year it spent 26000 a year to lease a 
mercedes benz limousine in miami and 40000 to buy a lincoln 
limousine maintained in new york 
despite centrusts deteriorating condition its chairmans 
compensation increased from 550000 a year in 1988 to 950000 a 
year currently over the period he also received bonuses stock 
dividends and insurance benefits worth nearly 4 million 
additionally the thrift paid 308000 from january 1987 through 
july 1989 for guard services at his home and spent 45000 in 1988 
to put the chairman up for 35 nights at the stanhope hotel in new 
york city 
as part of the order centrust was required to make its books 
and records immediately available to federal regulators who began 
examining the institution may 31 and complained that they were 
denied access to records 
centrusts books are so incomplete that examiners cannot 
determine its true financial condition the thrift office said 
centrust stock which had been selling on the american stock 
exchange for as much as 687 within the past year on friday fell 
from 137 to 1 at the close of trading

the bush administration in the wake of the 
malta summit and the dramatic changes occurring in the communist 
bloc is reviewing whether to relax the ban on sale of 
hightechnology exports to communist countries 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said in an interview friday 
that he expected the administration would reach a decision by 
april predicting that poland and hungary could be early 
beneficiaries of a more liberalized policy 
the dispute involves a 40yearold prohibition intended to keep 
high technology products with military applications from falling 
into communist hands 
the administration is under growing pressure to ease the 
controls as a way of boosting the economic and political reforms 
sweeping through eastern europe 
western allies argue that with cold war frictions easing it is 
important for the west to supply the technology needed for 
communist countries to boost living standards 
controls on hightechnology exports are administered by the 
coordinating committee on multinational export controls known as 
cocom it consists of the 15 nato nations along with japan and 
australia 
mosbacher said the administration hoped to reach a decision on 
easing controls in time to present the proposals at the next 
meeting of cocom scheduled for early april in paris 
mosbacher said that hungary and poland are already discussing 
with us officials how to prevent the transfer of militarily 
strategic items to neighboring communist bloc countries he said 
that such assurances would allow the united states to look 
favorably on giving those two countries access to more 
sophisticated technology 
everybody is discussing what we should be doing about eastern 
europe whether it is politically economically or 
technologically mosbacher said in an interview with the 
associated press 
the united states is considering a shortening of the list of 
restricted items to those things which are truly important and 
essential mosbacher said in a separate interview taped for 
public televisions american interests program 
the shortening will be substantial that would be our 
recommendation he said 
the administration has been split between hardliners such as 
defense secretary dick cheney who oppose the easing for national 
security reasons and others such as mosbacher who argue that 
liberalization is needed in light of the changes 
mosbacher was the third administration official in recent days 
to discuss the possibility of lowering export controls similar 
comments about possible changes have also been made by treasury 
undersecretary david mulford and deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
eagleburger said the united states planned to eliminate the 
casebycase approval required to export dual use 
hightechnology items to other cocom members 
dual use refers to technology that has both commercial and 
military applications the united states has repeatedly clashed 
with its allies especially west germany italy and japan over 
what it argues are violations of cocom rules regarding dual use 
technology 
in the latest such case the administration accused the italian 
computer manufacturer olivetti of selling the soviet union 
computerized machine tools that the soviets used to make jet 
fighter engines 
in a speech last week eagleburger said the requirement for 
individual licenses will be lifted within six months 
referring to the question of easing restrictions on exports to 
eastern europe eagleburger said the nature of the military 
threat faced by the west is changing and the west needed to 
signal our clear willingness to respond constructively to the 
democratization under way in eastern europe

the governments top highway safety official 
says devices inside cars to capture gas vapors when a tank is being 
filled would pose safety risks 
it appears to be an idea whose time has not come jerry r 
curry said friday in his first speech since being sworn in last 
week as administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
curry said the agency will join safety groups in opposing 
legislation that would require the units on all new cars a bill 
supported by environmental groups and the oil industry is pending 
in the house 
curry said his agencys first priority in dealing with auto and 
truck issues would continue to be highway safety followed by 
better gas mileage and clean air 
the former army major general said nhtsas technical evaluations 
show that some important safety concerns remain with the systems to 
capture gas vapor and return it to a cars engine through a special 
holding unit containing charcoal 
curry said there have been problems even with some of the simple 
systems cars have had since 1971 for returning some vapor to the 
gas tank which have resulted in fires injuries and vehicle 
recalls 
several areas of the country require gasoline stations to equip 
their hoses with units that suck vapors back into the stations 
tank the requirements often are part of state and city efforts to 
meet environmental protection agency air quality standards 
curry said nhtsa supports the idea of a vapor recovery system 
and will continue to work with the epa to test proposals for 
effectiveness and safety 
on other issues curry said he 
supported laws requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets saying 
he would wage a campaign of letters and support legislation to 
require them 
would base future recommendations for auto mileage standards 
or corporate average fuel economy cafe standards on facts not 
on theology environmentalists are pushing for tighter standards 
but auto manufacturers say that would prevent them from building 
many larger cars and could decrease overall auto safety

this christmas season is bittersweet for 
striking coal miners whove been living off meager union payments 
for eight months but enjoying a groundswell of support from workers 
around the country and the world 
other unions are shipping tons of donated food clothing and 
toys to the virginia coal fields where the united mine workers and 
pittston coal group inc are locked in a strike that began just 
after easter 
members of the united food and commercial workers womens 
network in pennsylvania and new jersey today are bringing toys 
treats and clothes to the russell county fairgrounds where theyll 
sing christmas carols for miners families 
during thanksgiving week the united auto workers had a 15 to 
20pound turkey delivered to each striking miners family 
this is going to be a terrific christmas for the strikers 
kids because of the support that weve got from other unions around 
the world said joel phillips a striker who supports a wife and 
two daughters this may be one of the best christmases theyve 
ever had 
the strike has become a symbolic line in the sand for members of 
the us labor movement who want to stop the erosion of collective 
bargaining 
they portray pittston as the prime example of a unionbusting 
company pittston officials say they are offering a fair contract 
and are being unfairly targeted by the unions national leadership 
the strike started after pittston bolted from a contract between 
the umw and the bituminous coal operators association saying 
health benefits offered by the owners group were too generous 
labor solidarity with the miners was bolstered in october when 
umw president richard trumka brought the union which had been 
independent for 40 years back into the aflcio 
strikers say labor secretary elizabeth doles interest in 
resolving the strike only increased after an official of polands 
solidarity movement visited the coal fields in november and 
criticized treatment of the miners in a meeting with mrs dole 
about 300000 has been donated to a christmas fund set up for 
the miners on nov 10 the money will be distributed next week to 
families of the 2100 striking and laidoff miners in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky 
weve had people calling from all around the contry wanting to 
send money or donate food or clothing said fred wallace a 
striking miner and the christmas fund trustee it seems like 
people are getting into the christmas feeling that giving is better 
than receiving 
they see the hardships were going through said phillips 
35 
thomas smith 42 an electrician said he would use his share of 
the christmas fund to buy winter coats for his two children but 
what his family really needs he said is for him to get back to 
work 
it wont be the happiest christmas smith said with all 
this support its not going to be all that grim but we still dont 
know what tomorrow is going to bring 
union and company negotiators are planning to meet monday in 
northern virginia for another round of contract talks mediated by 
former labor secretary william usery 
usery is optimistic that the negotiations will lead to a 
settlement but striking miners are skeptical 
nobody thinks it will be settled by christmas smith said 
the miners are preparing for the strike to last through winter 
and on thursday opened an indoor rally site camp solidarity ii 
near logan wva to demonstrate their resolve 
the miners used to earning as much as 635 a week have been 
receiving 225 a week in strike wages and that pays only for 
necessities wallace said in many cases wives who did not work 
before the strike have taken jobs 
things have gotten tight wallace said you just hold off 
on the luxuries of life when youre on strike and not working

stormy weather forced martin 
marietta to delay the first commercial launch of its titan 3 rocket 
carrying british and japanese communications satellites 
the attempt was called off friday about two hours before the 
planned liftoff when a storm dumped heavy rain on the launch area 
the delay will last at least until next week because a delta 
rocket scheduled for sunday carries a military navigation satellite 
for the defense department and has priority 
officials said the titan could be delayed until later in 
december because it also has lower priority than both the titan ii 
missile launch scheduled next week and the flight of the space 
shuttle columbia planned for dec 18 
the flight was to have marked martin mariettas entry into the 
highly competitive commercial launch business liftoff had been 
postponed on thursday night by a computer software problem

pentagon officials say the battleship new 
jersey has entered the persian gulf the first time such a us 
warship has sailed the sensitive waterway in modern times 
pentagon spokesman army col keith schneider said friday that 
the 58000ton vessel entered the gulf thursday night on a 
routine operation to demonstrate a continuing us commitment to 
the region 
the oilrich gulf was the scene for much of the decade of 
hostilities between iran and iraq marked by fighting that sank or 
damaged more than 500 commercial ships and killed 300 people 
the united states sharply expanded its naval force in the region 
in 1987 using it to protect merchant ships flying us flags 
after the august 1988 truce between the two nations the united 
states reduced its naval presence 
one pentagon official commenting on condition he not be 
identified by name said port calls in bahrain and the united arab 
emirates are scheduled for the warship but that a us offer to 
have the ship visit a port in saudi arabia was turned down 
schneider said he could not disclose the ships schedule nor the 
ports it planned to visit he did say the battleship was not being 
accompanied by a battle group of support vessels 
while us battleships have entered the straits of hormuz which 
links the persian gulf to the northern arabian sea none has ever 
sailed deep into the waterway that divides iran from the saudi 
arabian peninsula other sources said 
navy spokesman craig quigley who said he could not confirm the 
movement of the battleship said the service doesnt have a 
record that indicates a battleship has been in the persian gulf in 
modern times

while most european communist 
nations surge toward democracy yugoslavia once a socialist 
showcase is sinking ever deeper into its apparently unending 
political crisis 
faced with ethnic and social tensions rapidly growing inflation 
and labor unrest the country is now split into what looks like an 
unbridgeable rift between two of its six republics slovenia and 
serbia 
some lawmakers newspapers and organizations even raise the 
issue of civil war 
in an unprecedented move serbia on nov 29 severed all 
political and business ties with the northern region of slovenia 
after authorities there banned a rally planned by serbs seeking to 
topple slovenias liberal leadership 
except for a desperate warning that the countrys unity is 
seriously threatened by the clash yugoslavias divided 
leadership has done nothing to ease tensions 
yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its 
oneparty system with a relatively free press and no travel 
restrictions 
but its political economic and social problems have mushroomed 
since the death in 1980 of president josip broz tito whose 
charisma was seen as a major force in keeping yugoslavia together 
and submerging regional tensions 
the man in the center of yugoslavias current turmoil is 
serbias president slobodan milosevic described in slovenia and 
some other republics as a stalinist dogmatist and totalitarian 
leader 
in his speech to the serbian parliament tuesday milosevic 
denounced the slovenian leadership for not allowing an 
antislovenian rally by serbs planned in the slovenian city of 
ljubljana 
milosevic vowed that serbia will not reestablish ties with 
slovenia until the conservative aggressive and brutal 
slovenian leaders step down 
commenting on milosevics speech the croatian vjesnik daily 
said thursday that the serbian leaders stubborn ultimatum is 
aimed at imposing his hardline brand of communist orthodoxy on the 
rest of the country 
the newspaper described as grotesque milosevics accusations 
against slovenia and appealed to the countrys leadership to stop 
the serbian president and prevent him from leading the country to 
civil war 
similarly radio zagreb last week said yugoslavia is on the 
verge of war with itself 
milosevic has purged thousands of opponents in serbia and 
several independent political and human rights groups which are 
growing elswhere in the country have been banned in the southern 
republic 
on thursday a prominent serbian journalist appeared in court to 
answer charges of leading an unofficial gathering that described 
milosevics recent reelection as serbias president as 
undemocratic 
in slovenia its liberalminded leadership advocates regional 
autonomy and has already legalized several opposition parties that 
are to contest the firstever free multiparty elections in postwar 
yugoslavia scheduled in slovenia for march 
serbias move against slovenia represents an attack by a 
totalitarian concept of communist party monopoly against all who 
strive for democratic reforms and whose oppinions differ from those 
of serbian political leaders said a statement released by 
slovenian central committee 
slovenian leaders believe milosevic wants to provoke a showdown 
with their republic in order to turn public attention away from his 
economic and political failures 
an announced 1 billion public loan described as a centerpiece 
of milosevics economic policies in serbia has all but collapsed 
when government officials were able to secure only about 3 percent 
of the planned sum 
despite milosevics promises to halt ethnic albanian unrest in 
the southern serbian province of kosovo disturbances there have 
continued unabated 
yugoslavias parliament is to meet next week for an urgent 
session to discuss the countrys crisis 
comrades our country is falling appart said a 
parliamentary deputy thursday 
western diplomats in belgrade point out that the split within 
yugoslavia could not have come at a worse time for the reformist 
government of premier ante markovic which is currently negotiating 
with the international monetary fund on obtaining crucial new loans 
designed to repay the countrys 17 billion foreign debt 
the diplomats say milosevics irrational moves could 
collapse the delicate negotiations that began thursday thereby 
threatening radical marketoriented reforms markovic is trying to 
implement in yugoslavia

said 
the two men posed for photographs after lunch at elaines and 
specter said he was unworried about any fallout mason created 
problems for gop mayoral hopeful rudolph giuliani earlier in the 
year with a perceived slur against blacks

vice president dan quayle says the soviets may 
find they like star wars after all 
i have a hunch over a longer period of time the more the 
soviet union thinks about the sdi there may be a change of heart 
because this is defending against ballistic missiles not just a 
threat from the us but a threat from other countries quayle 
said in an interview published friday in the soviet daily newspaper 
izvestia 
the strategic defense initiative makes sense for both sides 
quayle said in the interview conducted thursday in washington 
sdi calls for a spacebased high technology network that would 
shoot down incoming enemy missiles ussoviet disagreement over 
the plan long a bone of contention between the two superpowers 
wrecked the 1986 summit in reykjavik iceland 
as we look at this world in the future becoming less 
dependent on offensive weapons for deterrence reducing but not 
eliminating offensive strategic weapons well see other countries 
gaining ballistic missile technology the vice president said 
instead of having only the ability of going in and attacking 
after an attack you might want the soviet union to have a more 
effective defense than it has today against third world threats 
the soviet union has always thought in terms of defense 
strategic and conventional so sdi which was a sticking point in 
the past perhaps will not be in the future 
quayle said he regarded the malta summit between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev as very positive meeting 
that could lead to conclusion of an agreement on strategic nuclear 
arms by the next summit next summer 
neither side is going to do anything to jeopardize its 
security by rushing he said but wed like to meet that 
timetable by making that statement were making a significant 
step forward 
so were very hopeful for improved relationship for new 
opportunities for reduction of tensions but as we are hopeful we 
must also maintain our preparedness and that we will do 
as you see those reforms take place in the soviet union there 
will continue to be improvement and perhaps you can say then that 
indeed the cold war is over but it depends on whether the 
democratic values that president gorbachev talks about can actually 
be implemented 
regarding central america quayle said that the soviet people 
need to ask the question why are we spending 7 billion on cuba 
when we could be spending it on meat and food and assistance back 
home

president bush is back in the snowy capital 
today after spending two days on the campaign trail in a 
threestate swing to drum up support for republican senate 
candidates and reverse gop political fortunes 
bush stumped friday for rep tom tauke in des moines the last 
stop in two days of appearances that included fundraising events 
for senate candidates hank brown in colorado and phil gramm in 
texas 
iowa republicans hoped bushs appearance would give tauke an 
early boost in his underdog bid to unseat firstterm democratic 
sen thomas harkin 
bush canceled plans to spend the weekend at the camp david 
presidential retreat in the maryland countryside when a snowstorm 
swept the region friday he opted to stay at the white house 
instead 
the president arrived in iowa on a day when the des moines 
register published a poll showing his approval rating at 74 percent 
statewide but republicans acknowledged a tough road ahead for 
tauke 
rep jim lightfoot said friday night that the party faces one 
of the toughest most difficult years that any of us have gone 
through before the november 1990 election 
bush helped raise 250000 for tauke in what tauke aides said 
was the biggest single political fundraiser in the states history 
his values reflect the greatness of iowa bush said 
praising taukes washington record 
earlier friday bush was in colorado at a luncheon for rep hank 
brown the republican congressman who hopes to succeed retiring 
republican sen william armstrong 
republicans have pinned their hopes on brown to retain the seat 
for the gop and would consider it a crushing blow to lose the seat 
one top bush adviser said 
the night before bush helped gramm raise 24 million in a 
houston astrodome dinner 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater who 
accompanied bush on the twoday trip said that was the most 
lucrative single political event in the nations history 
however gramm a onetime democrat who enjoys solid backing in 
texas is not considered to be in any danger for reelection 
speculation persists that he has presidential ambitions 
sending bush on the political trail is part of the gop strategy 
as the party tries to reverse its dismal 1989 election record that 
followed bushs resounding victory in the 1988 presidential race 
in november the gop lost gubernatorial races in new jersey and 
virginia and the mayors race in new york all campaigns in which 
bush personally campaigned 
last week a republican stronghold district in san diego 
calif elected democrat lucy killea to the state senate the 
election followed a campaign rocked by a catholic bishops public 
censure of killea for her prochoice position on abortion 
atwater acknowledging the partys losses remarked to reporters 
that he had a far happier year in 1988 but insisted the partys 
fortunes will turn around in 1990 
the gop hopes to get a solid footing early by sending the 
president to bigticket fundraising events 
in iowa tauke spokesman allen finch said the party wanted bush 
in the state early to raise money because harkin will be able to 
collect a sizable war chest 
iowas gop hierarchy turned out for the dinner gov terry 
branstad sen charles grassley and the states three other 
republican house members jim leach lightfoot and fred grandy 
before the dinner at the des moines convention center bush 
joined tauke on a callin radio show for 15 minutes at station who 
in colorado bush talked about the environment holding down 
taxes farm policy and international relations as he plugged 
browns candidacy 
hank brown is what you need and is what this administration 
needs a senator to make colorado strong to make this nation 
proud and a leader in the senate that i can work with as president 
of the united states 
also friday bush with drug policy director william bennett at 
his side delivered an antidrug speech to an enthusiastic 
auditorium of students at john f kennedy high school in denver 
bush told the young people that if they have ideas on how to 
solve the drug problem they should let their schools and their 
government know about them

when denver symphony musicians dumped their board 
of directors and rechristened themselves the colorado symphony in 
partnership with a local rock impressario skeptics predicted 
disaster it hasnt happened 
while things are far from rosy for the 53 musicians they have 
arranged a concert season with guest conductors and soloists and 
launched a catchy advertising campaign that seems to be attracting 
larger audiences 
the money isnt great but who joins an orchestra to get rich 
and whats most important said violinist gary goble we are 
still a very good orchestra 
i think we know we still have hurdles sure its still going 
to be lean for the orchestra said violist lee yeingst a member 
of the new musicianrun orchestras board but we really now 
have got our feet under us 
the colorado symphony orchestra arose from the ashes of the 
denver symphony orchestra which had accumulated debts of 25 
million and owed 700000 in unpaid rent to the city of denver 
the denver symphonys troubles are far from unique orchestras 
in oakland and san diego calif new orleans nashville tenn 
detroit and newark nj to name a few have suffered financial 
worries recently 
in the last two years the denver musicians pay was cut the 
concert season scaled back but this fall when the board proposed 
a 19891990 season of just 11 weeks paying 530 a week down from 
670 a week for 41 weeks the year before musicians decided to 
begin their own orchestra 
its unique said yeingst you dont find an orchestra 
where the musicians accept the responsibility not only for the 
musicmaking but the actual operation 
yeingst said the cso is paying musicians a base salary of 
22000 for a 26week season if the gate is larger theyll make 
more if its smaller theyll make less he said nothing is 
guaranteed just like real life 
rock promoter barry fey who is helping to produce and bankroll 
the new orchestra is more accustomed to booking acts such as the 
rolling stones he admitted in september that he had never attended 
a symphony 
fey wants the orchestra off the society pages and onto 
entertainment pages 
there will be some highs and some lows along the road but at 
the end of the year well be fine fey said 
but michael maxwell an administrator for the denver symphony 
which is going through bankruptcy reorganization said he sees many 
empty seats when he attends cso concerts 
naturally we are concerned and disturbed by the very low 
level of community support for those concerts he said 
patronage has been very low it cannot be economical for the 
musicians 
yeingst said musicians did not expect soldout houses and 
improved paychecks right away but we have been more than meeting 
expenses and with any successful fundraising any kind of 
support well be fine he said 
community support however is a problem yeingst said patrons 
have grown resentful over the years with having to support an 
organization in perpetual financial crisis 
people now are simply not willing to write a check and let it 
go at that those who are coming forward are interested to know 
exactly where the money is going he said they want to know 
about costs budget 
the symphonys new fundraising drive is aimed at the general 
population from whom it is soliciting donations of 1812 after 
tchaikovskys 1812 overture 
the season opened in november with a symphony sampler 
concert in mcnichols sports arena that attracted nearly 12000 
people but a few days later when the classical series began at 
boettcher concert hall only a few hundred showed up 
but after finishing our fourth week things look a lot 
better yeingst said were getting decent houses and they 
will improve and weve had very favorable talks with the governor 
and the mayor about support for the new orchestra

there was little surprise when federal 
regulators took over new jerseys largest savings and loan 
removing its chief executive officer and directors 
city federal savings bank in bedminster nj had been 
recording increasingly large losses from real estate ventures in 
new jersey florida and texas 
its third quarter results showed bad loans outweighing equity by 
about nine times 
furthermore the savings bank said last month that it would be 
unable to meet new capital requirements that became effective 
thursday under the thrift bailout law signed last summer 
its not surprising william mccrystal an analyst with 
ryan beck and co in west orange nj who has been following the 
institutions faltering performance said friday they had an 
extremely large amount of nonperforming assets in excess of their 
equity 
as of sept 30 city federal had 747 million in nonperforming 
assets pastdue loans and loans that dont pay interest and 
only 89 million in equity compared with 3262 million at the end 
of 1988 
under normal conditions nonperforming assets are no more 
than 25 percent of equity mccrystal said with 89 million in 
equity their losses probably would have wiped out equity had the 
feds not stepped in 
the thrifts dire straits prompted the office of thrift 
supervision in washington to transfer control to the resolution 
trust corp a federal agency created in august to dispose of 
failed sampls 
city federal was below all its capital requirements it 
doesnt look to us like they could recapitalize this institution 
without federal assistance said bob albanese senior deputy 
director of the office of thrift supervision in new york 
and the institution is continuing to experience operations 
losses and loan losses albanese said 
bad commercial real estate and construction loans lie at the 
heart of the thrifts troubles only recently city federal sold a 
mortgage banking operation in ohio mccrystal said 
city federal was the lead lender in port liberte a 750 million 
luxury project planned for jersey city nj mccrystal said 
they got very aggressive in the real estate market but it 
began to soften he said 
the thrift also was hurt by new rules that phase out by 1995 an 
accounting break known as goodwill 
city federal was among several institutions in the early and 
mid1980s that bought ailing thrifts when regulators had no money 
to deal with savings banks and were able to persuade institutions 
such as city federal to take over the thrifts in exchange for 
goodwill according to mccrystal city federal had 213 million in 
goodwill on its books as of sept 30 
albanese said representatives of the office of thrift 
supervision resolution trust corp and the federal deposit 
insurance corp gathered at the savings banks new jersey offices 
friday 
they replaced chief executive officer john atherton other top 
city federal officers and the thrifts board of directors with a 
governmentselected managing agent and oversight team but retained 
some employees albanese said 
city federal savings bank officials did not return repeated 
phone calls 
according to rtc which has taken control of 280 thrifts and 
disposed of more than 30 nationwide city federal savings bank had 
98 billion in assets and 73 billion in 858348 deposit accounts 
rtc will help find a buyer for the institution which maintained 
105 retail branches in new jersey and florida that are considered a 
valuable network it also could decide to liquidate the thrift 
for right now its business as usual albanese said 
rtc will oversee a newly created federal mutual association 
known as city savings bank which will continue handling 
depositors funds during normal business hours as a permanent 
solution is negotiated 
mccrystal said the corporations stock had become worthless 
trading at just oneeighth friday but noted the significant loss 
has been over the last year or two this isnt going to wipe out 
anybody 
four other new jersey thrifts already have been taken over by 
federal regulators 
mccrystal said the federal action was an indicator of things to 
come now that congress has clamped down on the floundering savings 
industry 
this says the government is going to follow through on the 
legislation passed to do something about these large troubled 
thrifts

strident tone as captain of the queen mary 
the walt disney co which owns the leaseholds on the 
permanently docked ocean liner and the adjacent spruce goose 
exhibit in long beach harbor told all hands this week to conform 
to disneys 35yearold dress code 
the code deepsixes beards mustaches and long hair on men and 
lowers the boom on bright eyeshadow red fingernails or 
inappropriate makeup on women the rules apply to 30000 
employees in disney parks and resorts 
james magness first officer on the queen mary would sooner 
ship out than shave off the mustache he grew 42 years ago and wore 
in the navy during the korean war aboard ships worldwide and 
skippering motor yachts off mexico 
no magness said of removing the mustache even if that 
means he has to give up the ship on which he has worked for 7 
years 
they said a mustache doesnt give a clean fresh wholesome 
look he said 
although walt disney himself sported a mustache disney co 
apparently thinks hairy lips could sink its ship 
the grooming standards were designed to fit into the entire 
guest experience we dont want to do anything that tends to 
detract in any way from that experience said queen mary 
spokesman rich kerlin 
the company bought the rights to the tourist attractions nearly 
two years ago but only decided to put the code into effect in

washington state has an elwha river an elwha 
ridge and now thanks to the ferry elwha an elwha rock 
the washington board on geographic names on friday officially 
named the reef in the san juan islands for the ferry which rammed 
it oct 2 1983 
ferry capt billy fittro unwittingly romanced the stone when he 
made an unauthorized detour into grindstone harbor on orcas island 
while giving a local resident a waterside view of her home from the 
elwhas pilothouse 
the ferry was damaged to the tune of 250000 and local wits 
came up with a tune of their own elwha on the rocks tshirts 
also carried elwha slogans and an island bar named a rum drink 
after the incident fittro resigned and his boss capt nick tracy 
was fired after he tried to run cover for fittro 
islanders have for years called the reef elwha rock and 
seattlite greg lange proposed to the board that it be named for the 
boat that struck it thats the way many rocks have gotten their 
names he said 
land commissioner brian boyle who heads the board spoke in 
favor of the name 
there is a sense of whimsy attached to the name but it will 
serve as a significant warning to other people who travel in these 
waters a stark reminder of what happened boyle said 
the vote was 5 to 1 with dissenter emmett oliver grousing i 
dont understand how people could suggest to name something after 
an incident that endangered peoples lives

the battle for the presidency 
between a socialist labor leader and a conservative reformer has 
widened divisions in a country already threatened with social and 
economic chaos 
former gov fernando collor de mello and socialist luis inacio 
lula da silva are in the dec 17 runoff to become brazils first 
directly elected president in 29 years neither won a majority in 
the 21candiate election on nov 15 when about 82 million 
brazilian cast their ballots 
president jose sarney barred by law from seeking reelection 
won a 1985 electoral college vote controlled by the military that 
ruled brazil from 19641985 four economic plans introduced by 
sarneys government failed to halt inflation which is at an annual 
rate of 1460 percent 
political anaylysts have expressed fear that the runoff election 
will be a showdown between rich and poor they say civilian rule 
reeling under an economic slump the social impact of rapid 
urbanization and a 110 billion foreign debt may not be ready for 
such a harsh test 
this radical polarization is dangerous for brazil which now 
must choose between two extremes that do not represent all 
political options said rep fabio feldman of the centerleft 
social democracy party 
industrialists say a da silva victory would accelerate the 
flight of capital from the country 
labor leaders counter that if collor de mello leaves social 
reforms to freemarket forces the unrest could boil over 
the prospect of a socialist victory disturbs brazils rightwing 
military chiefs 
we are now facing the dilemma of choosing between one mans 
savior and another mans devil said jair meneguelli president 
of the central workers union a labor umbrella group 
collor de mello 40 a former governor of alagoas state founded 
his national reconstruction party last february on a platform of 
moral cleanup 
he vowed to root out corruption and cronyism and blamed sarney 
so sharply for brazils economic ills the president ordered the 
justice ministry to file suit for slander 
collor de mello has publicly refused the support of ultraright 
groups but they back him 
da silva a 44yearold former lathe operator calls for a 
redistribution of land and wealth increased worker control of 
state monopolies and a moratorium on foreign debt payments 
he is the leader of the workers party and is backed by marxist 
groups labor unionists and the liberal wing of brazils roman 
catholic church da silva built his power base in the industrial 
belt around sao paulo and has broad support in the droughtridden 
northeast 
polls taken in early december gave collor de mello a 10point 
lead 
both candidates are trying to soften their images as they 
campaign to win centrist support 
the main targets are the centrist brazilian democratic movement 
party which has the largest number of legislators in both houses 
of congress and the social democracy party 
both candidates must form alliances together their parties have 
less than 6 percent of the seats in congress and the winner will 
have to put together a broad congressional coalition to govern 
da silva has been more successful than collor de mello in wooing 
support he has won limited endorsements from the social democracy 
party and from leonel brizola of the leftist democratic labor party 
who came in a close third behind da silva in the november balloting 
rigidity in the workers party could jeopardize a broader 
leftist front accoarding to some analysts 
the workers party is a oneclass party it will have to open 
up more and become multiclass wrote political scientist helio 
jaguaribe

the hispanic community rallied around a 
colombianborn policeman convicted of killing two black men but in 
black neighborhoods where riots have followed racially tinged 
trials in the past all was calm 
two radio stations that cater to colombians have scheduled 
rallies today for miami officer william lozano convicted thursday 
on two counts of manslaughter in the january deaths of clement 
lloyd and allan blanchard 
lozano who remains suspended from the force with full pay 
pending a police department hearing echoed feelings among miamis 
hispanics that he was convicted in order to avoid further rioting 
by miamis blacks 
i dont think it was fair said lozano 31 you have to 
realize there have been a lot of problems in the community in the 
past i was just being used as a scapegoat for this 
lozano also said he knew the verdict would be guilty as soon as 
the sixmember jury entered the courtroom thursday 
because when the jurors came out everyone every single 
person from the jurors they were looking down he said they 
were sad and you can read in their eyes that nobody wanted it and 
i knew right there and then 
three days of racial disturbances ensued in the liberty city and 
overtown neighborhoods after the shooting of lloyd 23 blanchard 
24 suffered fatal injuries in the crash of the motorcycle that 
lloyd was driving the two were fleeing another group of police 
rioting also followed trials in the past where white officers 
were acquitted in the slayings of blacks but all was quiet friday 
in the black neighborhoods 
leaders of the black community praised lozanos guilty verdict 
as a victory for justice but many hispanics including the 
200000strong colombian community have said the officer was 
shortchanged by racial politics 
we are deeply hurt hernando torres executive secretary of 
the colombian american political action committee said friday 
we are convinced that officer lozano was doing his duty defending 
the community 
the two radio stations organizing the rally wocnam and 
wkatam said they would seek money for lozanos expected appeal 
and signatures for a petition asking dade circuit judge joseph 
farina to show leniency in lozanos jan 24 sentencing 
on friday jewish protestant and lay religious leaders held a 
joint news conference and declared a weekend of prayer for the 
shooting victimss families and for lozanos family 
our prayers should be directed at preserving the unity of our 
community within which the opinions are as diverse as our 
population said rabbi solomon schiff chairman of dade countys 
community relations board i think the worst thing we can do as a 
community is to sit back smugly and say we came through this time 
without fires and riots 
lozanos family issued radio appeals earlier in the day for more 
legal funds 
we need money urgently lozanos brother jairo a miami 
police officer told listeners on wkat i couldnt sleep all 
night worrying about it

a deer hunter who shot to death a woman 
last year in the woods behind her home has been indicted in a case 
that has aroused strong feelings pitting hunters against 
nonhunters 
a penobscot county grand jury returned the indictment friday 
against donald rogerson it was almost exactly a year after another 
grand jury refused to indict rogerson finding neither criminal 
negligence nor criminal recklessness in the nov 15 1988 death of 
karen wood 37 
mrs woods husband kevin who has moved to iowa with the 
couples twin daughters who were a year old at the time of the 
death said he felt the grand jury had reached the only decision 
logic and reason would allow 
wood said the case should be viewed the same as any other 
criminal proceeding not as one that inflamed debate about hunting 
rogerson a supermarket produce manager and an experienced 
hunter has said he believed he was firing at a deer the case has 
stirred strong emotions among hunters and nonhunters alike in this 
rural state where deer season draws thousands into the woods each 
autumn 
in local newspaper opinion pages and elsewhere discussion has 
centered on how far from the wood house rogerson was when he shot 
mrs wood and why mrs wood was not wearing orangecolored 
clothing recommended for the woods during hunting season 
no arraignment date has been set for rogerson who faces up to 
20 years imprisonment if convicted said assistant attorney 
general jeffrey hjelm 
chief deputy attorney general james t kilbreth said news 
stories which raised questions about the fairness of the first 
grand jurys decision prompted the state to present the case a 
second time 
a nephew of rogersons attorney lewis v vafiades served on 
the first grand jury and kilbreth said that was the most 
important aspect of the decision to reopen the case however he 
stressed there was only the appearance of a conflict and an 
investigation by his office turned up no evidence of wrongdoing 
wood settled a wrongful death lawsuit against rogerson in may 
for 122000 
vafiades described rogerson as disappointed obviously at 
fridays grand jury action

culture for the rest of the world 
though he has left us we all stand immeasurably enriched by 
his brief time among us dinkins said

heart thats what alvin was all about that spark of spirit 
nat orr who danced with ailey for five years praised his 
ability to pull peoples spirit out getting people to

wild sense of humor and he could be a pain in the neck he had 
visions that when youre young you didnt see but now we realize 
it 
babette coffeyfisch a former dancer said aileys art wasnt 
just for black dancers it was for anyone who had a soul anyone 
who could express their spirit through movement

us servicemen at clark air base 
are roaming nearby streets and bars after their superiors lifted an 
order confining them to their quarters during an attempted coup by 
mutinous philippine soldiers 
everybody is still real friendly toward the gis a senior 
airman from coeur dalene idaho said today at the front gate of 
the sprawling base 50 miles north of manila 
f4 phantom jets from clark flew air cover dec 1 for loyalist 
forces at the request of president corazon aquino helping to 
thwart the revolt the jets did not fire on the rebels but 
prevented them from continuing air strikes on the presidential 
palace and military camps in manila 
clark servicemen said they were restricted to the base or their 
offbase residences from dec 1 until thursday and security was 
tightened troops also were told not to talk to reporters 
a sergeant from wisconsin who refused to identify himself 
further said the general feeling on the base after the flights 
was oh oh now for the first time were actually involved 
whats going to happen what retribution is going to happen 
concern was not restricted to what the mutinous soldiers might 
do in response to the us action soldiers said there also was 
concern about the communist rebels active in the region who are 
believed responsible for at least five slayings of american gis in 
recent years 
but when travel off the base was resumed the airmen rushed for 
the gates to the streets of angeles a city of dank honkytonk bars 
and restaurants that cater largely to the us community of 10000 
active servicemen and about 16000 dependants the main strip 
features mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken pizza hut and shakeys 
restaurants 
when i heard at 20 minutes after 3 oclock i could go off 
base i was downtown by 4 said the sergeant 
it was nice just to get out of the room again said the 
idaho airman who also refused to give his name 
several soldiers in shorts and tshirts strolled off the base 
this morning shooing away vendors selling sunglasses or catching 
rides into town one gi hurrying from the base was dressed in full 
baseball uniform with glove tucked under his arm 
angeles had been a ghost town during the days airmen were 
restricted to quarters with many businesses shut down completely 
an australian bar owner said his business was down at least 60 
percent 
i would say it had a very big effect on the working girls in 
the bars said mick obrien owner of moon doggies across the 
street from the base he said prostitutes were particularly hard 
hit because the christmas season traditionally is when they need 
money to send to their families in the provinces 
in october 1987 the economy of this city in central luzon was 
devastated after troops were confined to barracks following the 
killings of three americans by communist rebels 
josie navarro mamasan or madam at the bombay court down 
the street also complained that business was so bad since dec 
1 we had no gi customers 
but friday night the bar was again filled with us servicemen 
drinking san miguel beer and shooting pool on the bombays two 
faded billiard tables 
we still like americans the mamasan said leaning across 
the bar for emphasis we dont want the business to go away

nissan motor corp which has been sued by 
a family claiming the company spied on them said it was only 
practicing the american way of product research 
maritza and stephen french claim fraud invasion of privacy 
trespassing and unfair business practices by nissan and takashi 
morimoto a japanese nissan employee who rented a room in their 
costa mesa home last summer 
they feel violated they really do said the frenches 
attorney nancy kaufman they just wonder what he was writing 
down what about their private lives is in a nissan file 
somewhere 
nissan denied the couples claims in a statement friday from its 
us headquarters in carson 
nissan is in the business of building cars the company 
said we try to build cars that meet the needs of americans by 
studying the way americans drive and buy their automobiles 
that the media the courts and our legal system are being tied 
up because mr morimoto did research on how we buy and use cars is 
a truly regrettable situation 
nissan said morimoto 29 was frank about the fact that he was a 
nissan employee and that he was in the us to better understand 
us lifestyles and attitudes about cars 
nissan said that not only was morimoto not secretive he was 
plainly seen in the neighborhood photographing various cars homes 
and garages 
ms kaufman said the family was aware that morimoto worked for 
nissan but thought he had been temporarily assigned to the 
companys us headquarters in carson 
the companys statement said the saddest element of the 
litigation was that our judicial system would even allow the 
lawsuit to be filed 
the lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed thursday in 
orange county superior court in santa ana it seeks a court order 
barring nissan from placing alleged corporate emissaries into homes 
of other unsuspecting families 
morimoto stayed with the frenches from june 16 to july 31 after 
the family answered an ad asking american families to sponsor 
japanese exchange students the placement services said no students 
were available when the frenches inquired and the services 
suggested morimoto 
while the family says it learned of morimotos role from an oct 
2 los angeles times article on car culture nissan said the article 
was actually sent to the french family by nissan because we 
thought they would enjoy it

two suspended investigators of a county 
prosecutors office were on the verge of pleading guilty to a 
single extortion charge nine weeks ago with the promise of 
probation for their sentence 
today they face more than 50 years in prison 
us district judge maryanne trump barry refused to accept the 
plea saying it would violate her conscience in light of the 
charges seriousness and the case went to trial a federal jury 
friday convicted thomas gilsenan and ralph cicalese of conspiracy 
racketeering extortion and drug charges 
the government said the essex county investigators protected a 
drug dealer in exchange for cocaine cash and valuables 
the jury largely accepted the word of the man the investigators 
protected convicted drugdealer and admitted murderer robert 
vidal vidal was the bulwark of the governments case 
us attorney samuel a alito jr said the case was difficult 
and authorities felt they had less than a 50 percent chance of 
victory at the trials outset 
its always difficult to convict law enforcement officers of 
corruption he said 
alito added that the verdict opened new avenues for 
investigation and the probe into law enforcement corruption in 
newark would continue he would not elaborate 
the defendants showed no reaction when the verdict was 
announced from the section where family and friends were sitting 
sharp gasps could be heard 
the word disappointment doesnt do justice to this said 
gilsenans attorney david ruhnke he and michael critchley 
cicaleses lawyer promised appeals 
gilsenan 42 of verona was a detective in the essex county 
prosecutors office since 1971 cicalese 36 of west orange is a 
former newark police officer and worked in the investigators 
office since 1984 both were suspended after the indictment 
barry set sentencing for feb 14 they face more than 50 years 
in prison terms 
gilsenan and cicalese were each found guilty of racketeering 
conspiracy racketeering and drug and extortion conspiracy 
gilsenan was also convicted of nine individual extortion drug 
and obstruction of justice counts and acquitted of 11 other counts 
cicalese was found guilty of 11 individual extortion and drug 
counts and was acquitted of six others the crimes were committed 
between 1984 and 1986 
mccarthy said that the two investigators tipped off vidal about 
a police informer in his organization told him of wiretaps and 
protected him from arrest in exchange he said cicalese received 
mainly cocaine and gilsenan got cash appliances a car suits and 
jewelry

saving the earth is not such a difficult thing 
for instance if americans recycled all their sunday newspapers 
it would save more than 500000 trees a week 
and with the junk mail americans get each day 44 percent of 
which is never opened they could produce enough energy to heat 
250000 homes 
just pumping up tires to the right pressure would save about 2 
billion gallons of gasoline a year 
these and other practical points are listed in a book offered at 
the earth expo and earth action conference which opened friday at 
the georgia world congress center and is aimed at offering tips to 
individuals on conserving earthly resources 
it is the first of a series of fairs planned for seven cities 
most people believe that the problem is so overwhelming that 
no one person can do anything said john javna of earth works 
press in berkeley calif thats simply not true 
his book 50 simple things you can do to save the earth 
appeared nov 1 and already has sold more than 100000 copies 
javna and his book are crammed with pop facts some of them 
downright scary for instance javna says there are more 
artificial chemicals in the average american home today than there 
were in the average chemical laboratory 100 years ago 
there are suggestions too mothballs are made from 100 percent 
paradichlorobenzene harmful to the liver and kidneys 
alternatives cedar chips or cedar oil work just fine 
another fair participant pharmacist stanley meyerson of 
syracuse ny has developed the national ecological and 
environmental delivery system specializing in products for people 
sensitive to the increasing number of chemicals in the home and 
elsewhere 
this is the first generation to be exposed so totally to 
chemical products chemicals dyes preservatives contaminants in 
the water he said 
his company markets waterbased paints and dyes water and air 
filters and biodegradable products such as soaps adhesives and 
cleaners 
show coordinator zenia richler who researched the applicants 
and pared the list to about 68 based on credibility said many of 
the new products such as biodegradable cellulose bags that 
resemble plastic but are made from plant fiber still are more 
expensive than their synthetic counterparts because they arent yet 
massproduced 
the biodegradable plastics also raise environmental concerns 
for one the material breaks down into plastic particles that may 
contain toxic metals such as cadmium and lead for another 
recycling centers are refusing degradable plastics because they are 
not as strong as plastics dont degrade thus contaminating the 
recyclable mix 
the fair also includes displays for reusable diapers that have 
the convenience of disposables herbal skin creams insulation that 
does not use fiberglass and an attractive bench made completely of 
recycled plastics 
for a fee watercheck of cleveland ohio will check your tap 
water for over 90 contaminants and send you a printout of the 
results if your water flunks watercheck recommends seeing a 
qualified water treatment specialist 
entrepreneurs say the problem of impure water is getting worse 
as more and more dangerous chemicals go into landfill dumps and 
find their way back into the water system 
the water systems cant keep up with the chemicals that are 
going into them ms richler said

the man who killed 14 women at the university of 
montreal engineering school was a crack shot who used to shoot 
pigeons as they flew said a childhood friend 
marc lepine whose rampage wednesday at the universitys 
engineering school ended when he shot himself was an electronics 
buff who dreamed of being an engineer said friend jean belanger 
but he really exceled in hunting said belanger 24 recalling 
how they used to hunt pigeons together as teenagers with bb guns 
he was good at it better than me he saw a pigeon flying and 
he used to be able to shoot it while it was flying not every 
time but most of the time belanger said friday 
lepine likely learned to shoot from an uncle who had trained 
with the us green berets and had been a canadian forces 
paratrooper a source close to the family said friday 
apparently the way he used the rifle there wasnt one lost 
shot the source said adding that lepine often visited the uncle 
on his sheep farm after his parents broke up

in 1973 a woman known in court papers as mary 
doe won the right to an abortion in a landmark us supreme court 
ruling released the same day as the more famous roe vs wade case 
by then the woman had decided against the abortion and given the 
baby girl up for adoption she had also lost custody of two earlier 
children 
today mary doe whose real name is sandra cano is ending her 
separation with the last of the three children closing a process 
of reunification that parallels the turnaround in her stance to an 
antiabortion position 
mrs canos first daughter april 22 was flying to atlanta 
from seattle today for their first meeting in 17 years mrs cano 
said 
earlier this year mrs cano was reunited with her daughter 
melissa whom she gave up for adoption in 1970 after deciding not 
to go ahead with an abortion she was reunited with her son joel 
12 years ago 
her desire for the abortion had thrust mrs cano into the 
history books as the anonymous plaintiff mary doe in the doe vs 
bolton case the courts decision which struck down georgias 
restrictive antiabortion law was issued jan 22 1973 the same 
day the court struck down texas abortion law in roe vs wade 
the two older children joel and april were taken from the 
woman a year before that she said she lost custody of the children 
after a dispute with a baby sitter and because of me being young 
and naive 
she launched a battle to regain custody of joel and april from 
the family they had been placed with and attained partial success 
when she got the boy 12 years ago when he was 11 
child welfare officials thought it best that april not rejoin 
the family mrs cano said she had managed to track the adoptive 
parents to columbus and then denver but hit a dead end eight years 
ago 
in november a week after thanksgiving april called 
mrs cano said her daughter told her she had been trying to find 
her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive family and placed 
in a mental hospital at age 14 she said her adoptive father who 
refused to have anything to do with her was the one who finally 
told her to contact georgia social services leading her to her 
birth mother 
mrs cano said april told her stories of abuse confirming the 
fears that had fueled her long search for the girl 
after she identified herself publicly as the cases mary doe in 
february mrs cano said her car was shot at two trucks were 
stolen and graffiti was scrawled on another vehicle 
ironically mrs cano no longer holds a prochoice stand 
in fact she said now that her family is back together she 
plans to increase her involvement in the antiabortion movement 
which has invited her to represent her position on talk shows and 
at meetings 
im going to start coming out start speaking out and being 
more active now because weve got the children back mrs cano 
said not many people get that second chance

prime minister vp singh assured sri 
lankan officials that he wants improved ties with their government 
but sri lanka says india is illegally arming a paramilitary force 
in the island nation 
after singh met with sri lankan foreign minister ranjan 
wijeratne on friday the two sides issued a statement saying the 
whole spirit should be one of trust and of a joint endeavor 
although singh and wijeratne stressed india would soon end its 
2year military deployment in sri lanka wijeratne said a major 
sticking point remained indias alleged arming of a new tamil 
militia whose existence has been outlawed by sri lankas 
government 
speaking to reporters after his meeting with singh wijeratne 
said i made a complaint that the socalled tamil national army 
numbering about 4000 had been trained and armed by the ipkf 
indian peacekeeping force without the authorization and knowledge 
of the sri lankan government 
the joint communique said singh had taken note of the concerns 
and that a response would be conveyed after a full examination of 
all issues 
the sri lankan government as well as local residents have 
accused the departing indian troops of providing automatic rifles 
mortars and rockets to the tamil national army 
the tamil national army has attacked moslems in areas already 
vacated by indians and has clashed with a rival tamil militia in 
other regions still patrolled by indians according to witnesses 
and sri lankan officials 
both singh and wijeratne said they expected the indian pullout 
to be completed as previously agreed by the end of december 
wijeratne estimated about 25000 indian soldiers were still in 
sri lanka although other estimates place the number as high as 
36000 
singh who took office saturday told reporters earlier 
having good relations with sri lanka is the first priority of the 
present government 
instead of playing its envisioned role as peacemaker and 
supervising a docile surrender of arms by tamil separatists the 
indian troops bogged down in the jungle war since they entered sri 
lanka following an indiansri lankan pact to end the tamil 
insurgency in 1987 
at least 1100 indian soldiers were among the 17000 people 
killed in sri lankas tangle of ethnic and political struggles 
since 1983 
about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people are tamils 
most of whom are hindus sinhalese are mostly buddhists and 
comprise 75 percent of the population tamils complain they are 
discriminated against in jobs and education

senior communist party officials met today amid 
speculation about a leadership shakeup and growing calls for the 
party to give up its domination of soviet life 
rumors of leadership changes always precede meetings of the 
partys policymaking central committee because it is the only body 
empowered to make changes in the ruling politburo 
but the rumors were bolstered by communist leaders increasingly 
embattled position as they struggle to keep the oncemonolithic 
party from losing its clout and breaking into factions 
challenges to the partys dominance came from independentminded 
communists in outlying republics and prominent lawmakers who have 
called for a brief strike monday to force the issue 
lithuania on thursday became the first republic in the soviet 
union to drop a constitutional guarantee of communist supremacy and 
substitute a multiparty system 
human rights activist andrei sakharov and several other members 
of the soviet parliament have urged a brief general strike monday 
to call on lawmakers to drop the constitutions article 6 which 
guarantees the party the leading and guiding role in society 
czechoslovakia and east germany scrambling to enact democratic 
reforms to staunch huge antigovernment rallies have cut out 
similar provisions from their constitutions 
in leningrad an estimated 40000 rankandfile communists 
rallied this week to support president mikhail s gorbachev against 
what they said was a bid by conservatives to oust him 
officially todays communist party meeting was to address only 
questions on economic reform and party organization to prepare for 
a meeting of the full soviet parliament three days later 
a meeting of the moscow city party on friday indicated that if 
the party also raised the issue of article 6 it might show new 
willingness to consider giving it up 
almost all the moscow party leaders quoted in todays newspapers 
said they were ready to see the article either canceled or altered 
even moscow party chief yuri a prokofiev agreed we are for 
replacing this article of the ussr constitution but he also 
condemned extremist forces for pushing the question in order to 
hurt the party moskovskaya pravda reported 
prokovfiev called gorbachevs article last month on new ideas 
about communism and perestroika was so very necessary to the 
party and society and was clearly late he also criticized the 
antialcohol campaign gorbachev launched soon after coming to power 
in 1985 
communist demonstrators at a rally in leningrad aimed their own 
shots at gorbachev and the politburo furthering the impression of 
a growing schism in the party the nov 22 partyorganized rally 
where some speakers and slogans accused gorbachev of abandoning the 
party and communist ideology elicited a counterrally by 
progressives wednesday 
prior to the wednesday protest activists handed out leaflets 
warning that gorbachev and his closest allies in the politburo 
alexander yakovlev and foreign minister eduard shevardnadze could 
lose their party jobs at todays central commmittee meeting said 
activist gennady bogomolov 
the central committees approximately 350 full and nonvoting 
members could remove gorbachev from his post as party chief 
however gorbachev enjoys a measure of security since he has 
strengthened the power of the government and has been elected to a 
fiveyear term as president

a draft agreement that for the first time assigns 
responsibilities for the cleanup of the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant has been signed by two governmental agencies overseeing the 
contaminated complex 
a third agency the department of energy put off signing the 
document until next week because of a minor financial snag 
the environmental protection agency and the colorado department 
of health on friday signed the document a blueprint for carrying 
out cleanup priorities agreed upon in principle by gov roy romer 
and doe secretary james watkins in june 
cleanup of contamination is estimated to cost 500 million to 1 
billion and to take more than a decade officials said 
we can feel very comfortable that what were signing here has 
been agreed upon as an interagency agreement and just needs that 
final ok which we will assume will come early next week epa 
regional administrator james j scherer said at a news conference 
dave simonson of the does rocky flats office said he expected 
to sign the agreement early next week 
i think its a good agreement for all of us it sets out what 
will be done it sets out the regulatory framework for 
environmental work at rocky flats simonson said 
the agreement in draft form until it is finalized after a 
60day public comment period coordinates state and federal 
environmental laws to ensure the cleanup of waste at the plant 16 
miles northwest of denver it also establishes for the first time 
schedules for the study and cleanup of contaminated sites 
what we have here is a step forward in this interagency 
agreement that allows us to put a very strict group of schedules 
and work plans together so that actual cleanup action can begin 
almost immediately scherer said 
tom looby assistant state health department director said the 
agreement resolved a number of issues that have snagged the cleanup 
of other federal facilities by integrating the responsibilities 
under the federal superfund act and the resource conservation and 
recovery act 
in addition the agreement requires doe to comply with state 
hazardous waste laws he said 
i think that by virtue of this cooperative approach of 
recognizing the states environmental laws we are in the position 
of making sure we get the cleanup thats necessary he said 
the doe plant manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons in 
june the fbi raided the plant looking for evidence of alleged 
illegal hazardous waste handling a federal grand jury is weighing 
the case but has not issued indictments 
this fall doe replaced rockwell international corp with egampg 
inc as contractor at the plant egampg is scheduled to take over in 
january 
under the agreement doe will investigate the extent of 
contamination at 178 sites on and off the plant site to evaluate 
and prioritize cleanup activities 
a 60day comment period will begin dec 22 to give the public 
time to offer opinions on the agreement

the immigration service has refused to grant 
residency to a salvadoran who has been living in the united states 
for eight years and is currently on a hunger strike to protest us 
military aid to el salvador 
the immigration and naturalization service said rene hurtado was 
involved in terrorism while in the salvadoran military and should 
not have received the temporary residency status granted him in 
1987 
the notification was mailed to hurtado this week by james m 
bailey of the inss regional office in lincoln neb baileys 
letter said the ins reconsidered hurtados case last spring when he 
applied to upgrade his residency status from temporary to permanent 
hurtado was informed that he was ineligible for temporary or 
permanent residency because you participated in killing rape and 
torture 
the ins cited newspaper accounts of hurtados interviews and 
speeches as evidence of his past involvement in terrorism as a 
member of the treasury police one of the salvadoran police 
agencies now being supported by the us government 
hurtado fled to the united states in 1981 after being discharged 
from the salvadoran military he claims to have undergone a 
spiritual conversion that led him to confess his actions and speak 
out against abuses by the salvadoran military he has been under 
the protection of a local church since 1982 
hurtado has never denied that he was involved in acts of 
brutality but claims he never killed anyone hurtado is an assumed 
name used by the man to avoid reprisals against relatives still 
living in el salvador 
hurtado and others are in their third week of a hunger strike at 
the st paul cathedral he was resting friday and unavailable for 
an interview church officials said 
we find it more than coincidental that the ins is taking this 
action at this time said nancy berneking a member of st lukes 
presbyterian church in suburban wayzata which shelters hurtado 
she said a letterwriting campaign had been started to protect him 
ron rosenbaum one of hurtados attorneys agreed he said the 
ins had spent six months investigating hurtados background before 
he was granted temporary residency status on dec 16 1987 
and now they do this two years after granting residency 
status and at a time when el salvador and rene are back in the 
news rosenbaum said 
thomas schiltgen acting director of the ins office in the twin 
cities said it was our position all along that hurtado wasnt 
eligible

boeing plans to build a new widebody jetliner 
called the 777 even though it has no orders from airlines 
the 350passenger twinengine jet seating 10 people across 
will be designed to compete with mcdonnell douglas corps md11 
and the airbus industries a330 it would be larger than the boeing 
767 but smaller than the 747 jumbo jet 
boeing officials on friday estimated a 100 billion market for 
the new plane which initially would be marketed to replace aging 
transcontinental carriers 
it is the first boeing jet totally designed by computer it may 
be built in partnership with three japanese aerospace companies 
boeing commercial airplanes president dean thornton said he was 
creating a new division to develop and market the plane boeing now 
calls the 767x if the plane enters production it will be called 
the 777 
boeing hopes to offer the new plane by 1995 if enough airline 
interest is shown thornton said the last new model number boeing 
introduced was the 757 which entered service in 1983 although the 
longrange 747400 which began deliveries early this year is 
essentially a new aircraft 
thornton said boeing is far from committed to actually building 
the aircraf but he said seven or eight carriers had expressed 
strong interest and another dozen were interested to a lesser 
degree 
boeing the worlds largest commercial jet builder had record 
profits in its most recent quarter and has a backlog of more than 
1700 firm jet orders with deliveries stretching into the next 
century

leaders of the european community 
today said they supported german reunification after receiving 
assurances that west germany will not seek claim to territories the 
german states held before world war ii 
we seek the establishment of a state of peace in europe in 
which the german people will regain its unity through free 
selfdetermination said a draft of the 12nation summits 
political declaration 
the draft was completed after a tense dinner conversation friday 
in which west german chancellor helmut kohl said his nation would 
not seek claim to germanspeaking areas outside the german 
countries 
many europeans fear the emergence of a united more powerful 
germany west germanys mighty economy already dominates the 
continent 
reunification now seems possible because of the dramatic changes 
taking place in east germany the nation has loosened travel 
restrictions opened the berlin wall thrown out hardline 
communist leaders and stripped the communist party of its 
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power 
french president francois mitterrand said at the twoday 
summits closing news conference today that reunification was 
acceptable 
i am not afraid of reunification he said i consider it 
to be legitimate 
but he also said that countries must adhere to international 
treaties and other obligations unless they are prepared to create 
dangerous and unnecessary tensions 
on friday the european leaders agreed to negotiations for a 
system of central banks and eventually a single european currency 
they approved a social charter on the rights of labor unions wages 
and welfare both were approved over strong opposition from britain 
french foreign minister roland dumas said france and several 
other delegations initially rejected west german phrasing on 
reunification 
the crucial moment came at friday nights dinner when dutch 
prime minister ruud lubbers and italian prime minister giulio 
andreotti pressed kohl for his definition of reunification 
belgian and dutch sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said kohl made clear that in his view reunification applied only 
to the two existing german nations and not to germanspeaking areas 
in neighboring countries 
belgian prime minister wilfried martens described the 
confrontation as the most tense moment of the summit 
mitterrand accepted kohls definition and french diplomats went 
to work on redrafting the declaration on germany 
the draft declaration says reunification should take place 
democratically and peacefully and on the basis of all the 
principles defined by the helsinki final act in a context of 
dialogue and eastwest cooperation the 1975 helsinki accords on 
european cooperation and security fix postwar borders 
the leaders also said they must draw closer in this crucial 
period for europe 
it is in the interest of all european states that the 
community should become stronger and accelerate its progress toward 
union the draft declaration said 
no formal votes were taken friday and only prime minister 
margaret thatcher of britain objected during the closeddoor 
discussions on the monetary conference and the social charter 
the decision to move toward economic and monetary union means 
the ec will convene a special conference in december 1990 to start 
negotiations for the adoption of a single currency and a system of 
central banks 
france and west germany overrode objections by mrs thatcher 
that radical monetary integration will rob member countries of 
sovereign rights to decide national economic policy 
britain will attend the conference in what thatcher aides 
described as a spirit of constructive argument mrs thatcher 
said the nonbinding social charter for the rights of labor 
unions would increase unemployment raise costs and make ec goods 
less competitive

a long way yet to go to end apartheid delegates at an 
antiapartheid conference were told today 
we know he has limits beyond which he will not go walter 
sisulu of the african national congress said referring to 
president fw de klerk it is our historic purpose to take him 
there or to go on without him

conference for a democratic future the largest such conference 
ever held in south africa the black white indian and mixedrace 
delegates represented roughly 2100 organizations some of them 
ideological rivals in past years

is to confirm the crucial importance of unity and to plan a 
program of mass action that will challenge the apartheid 
state

announced sunday 
last year the government prohibited a similar conference 
shortly before it was to take place but allowed this convention 
even though many participants belong to groups which are banned 
sisulu 77 and six other anc leaders were freed unconditionally 
in october by de klerk after long prison terms but sisulu had no 
praise for the president or the whitecontrolled governments offer 
to negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short 
of majority rule 
mr de klerk your back is to the wall sisulu said come 
stand on the floor of a conference like this submit to the 
processes of democracy 
observers from 19 foreign countries attended the conference 
including norways deputy foreign minister knut wollenback and a 
soviet professor irina filatova it was the first time in at least 
40 years that a soviet appeared at an opposition meeting in south 
africa 
we reiterate our commitment to one person one vote in a 
united south africa as the nonnegotiable principle on which a 
future south africa will be built sisulu said 
the regime has done its utmost to break us whipping our 
people declaring the states of emergency assassinating and 
detaining our leaders sisulu said and it has failed we 
gather here in greater numbers than ever before 
jerry mosala of black consciousness movement of azania took a 
more militant line in his speech to the conference 
a message must go out from this conference that the struggle 
is not about to be abandoned in favor of negotiations he said 
the aim of the struggle is not to negotiate it is to eradicate 
apartheid and capitalism

rebellious inmates surrendered to 
authorities today at two of four prisons where riots occurred after 
parliament refused to extend a nationwide amnesty to hardcore 
criminals 
at leave five prisoners have died during the uprisings 
about 1500 prisoners at the czarne prison on the baltic coast 
and 1000 inmates at goleniow prison in northwest poland gave up 
after police and prison guards prepared assaults at the facilities 
the state pap news service said 
on friday the government authorized the use of force to end the 
disturbances which began at the prisons thursday the agency said 
four inmates were reported killed in the worst uprising at 
czarne prison near the city of slupsk and pap said the stabbed 
and beaten victims had been lynched by fellow prisoners during the 
riots 
authorities who reentered goleniow prison near the city of 
szczecin also found the charred body of a prisoner in one of the 
two pavilions of the prison that were set on fire by inmates pap 
said 
fire also destroyed the prison hospital and library 
besides czarne and goleniow about 1000 inmates rioted at 
kaminsk in northcentral poland and 850 inmates rioted at 
nowogard also near szczecin tv said the four prisons are for 
hardcore or habitual criminals the uprisings at kaminsk and 
nowogard continued today 
the revolts began after the sejm or lower house of parliament 
turned down a senate proposal to extend the new solidarityled 
governments farreaching amnesty program to habitual criminals 
at czarne prisoners learned of the decision on the tv news and 
immediately started destroying equipment set warehouse 
facilities on fire and attacked prison guards who tried to get the 
situation under control pap said 
on friday state television broadcast scenes of inmates wrapped 
in blankets gathered on the firedamaged prison roof with flames 
visible through the windows of the brick building 
why are we doing it because we dont agree with the verdicts 
that were handed out in the 1980s one prisoner with bandages 
over his eyes told a tv interviewer 
the amnesty was proposed by the solidarity members of parliament 
to give prisoners a second chance under polands new 
noncommunistled government 
we cannot allow prisoners to take the law into their own 
hands the decision on the amnesty is final justice minister 
aleksander bentkowski said on the national tv news friday 
he noted that the amnesty was an act of mercy by the sejm 
that will benefit 17000 inmates nationwide but that the sejm 
concluded it could not include prisoners who have four or more 
convictions 
the polish senate had urged broadening the amnesty so that it 
would no longer exclude multiple offenders committers of major 
thefts and those convicted of vehicular manslaughter under 
influence of alcohol 
the senate proposal aroused widespread debate among poles who 
feared it would lead to a wholesale release of criminals at a time 
when crime rates are already increasing

people are happily using words 
like freedom and democracy these days but their joy is 
tempered by worry about the future 
the rush to undo 40 years of repression is a plunge into the 
unknown by a politically divided people not given to recklessness 
on the streets thundering crowds appear to have smashed the 
elaborate apparatus that had left them powerless to criticize the 
state beyond a guarded whisper or swift slash of wit 
up close and alone however czechoslovaks like east germans 
poles and hungarians still face the painful process of learning to 
shape the politics that govern them 
a lightning revolution fired spirits but decades of dashed 
hopes and broken promises have left their mark 
we are confused said jitka nyvltova a young artisan we 
are speaking with emotion saying what is in our hearts this is 
very dangerous we must act with great calm 
she fears the communist party will exploit divisions among the 
opposition retaining its control and perhaps exacting revenge on 
the more daring 
she knows the old apparatus is protected not only by a 
privileged class but also by workers farmers and pensioners who 
have made peace with the devil they know 
communisms monopoly was excised from the constitution 
noncommunist ministers entered the government but elections 
though promised are not yet scheduled nor have they been won 
even in prague but especially in smaller towns and farm 
villages many are still testing the wind few expect communists to 
dominate free elections but there are all those shades of gray 
in pragues old town a childrens book writer chatted about 
freedom relishing on his tongue the feel of terms like communist 
thugs suddenly he stopped and frowned 
read back to me anything you quote me on he told the 
american reporter taking notes the secret police you know 
specialists see critical and deepseated obstacles to defining 
freedom and restoring democracy 
this is a morally sick society and it will take longer to 
cure than it will to reform the economy said dr miroslav 
borecky a prague psychiatrist 
czechoslovakias death rate from stress was alarming among men 
in their 40s he said it is not comparable to stress in the west 
where you win or lose here you dont exist 
before people only spoke out among friends but they were sure 
of a job and most likely a car and vacation cottage no one 
worried about the next meal hard work was optional and seldom 
rewarding 
now in the heat of their first political campaign in half a 
century czechoslovaks must find a way to fit western freedoms in 
with socialisms traditional freedoms from choice 
some czechoslovaks think liberty will prove to be a miracle drug 
our young people were supposed to be so dispirited rotten 
but look at them said historian desider galsky 68 their 
elders are so proud of them it is touching 
the revolutions rejection of violence like revulsion to the 
police brutality that triggered it formed a basis for a new social 
model he said 
they did it without breaking a window or smashing a car he 
said never in history was there such a revolution so elegant 
so sophisticated it was so czech 
but galsky agreed that hard times lie ahead and no one knows 
the extent of the bill to be paid 
czechoslovakia cannot alter its course without inflation 
layoffs and chaotic disruptions economists say sacrifices can be 
demanded only by a strong popular consensus government 
and consensus will not be easy under marxism everything but 
politics was political people took no part in government but 
daily life required alliances compromises and wardheeling 
czechoslovak politics are minimalist 
at wenceslas square for example three youths in gas masks 
burst from the metro and swept the street with exaggerated motions 
they were ecologists pushing one of the countless parties forming 
weekly 
even immediate victories mean glitches in the system for 
example an end to censorship gave czechoslovaks new access to 
generations of literature but only so many manuscripts at a time 
can be edited printed and distributed 
so much banned work is backed up for example that writers 
eager to say something new and their editors may have to wait 
years for the logjam to clear 
at least 500000 books are waiting in warehouses and the 
government has promised to put them in shops said leo pavlat a 
publishing house editor this is a tough time to be a new 
writer 
but jokes roman rehak there are new opportunities a student 
who climbs mountains he was enlisted to scramble up rooftops to 
remove communist red stars and outmoded banners 
rehak admits to fear but he is grateful for what has been won 
so far for one thing he said good jobs and privileges are no 
longer the preserve of the party faithful 
we will have to distinguish people who are creeps and now we 
have the right and power to remove those creeps he said 
optimists say the rush of events is only a taste of what will 
come they are counting on the czechoslovak industriousness 
flexibility and flair that made this nation of 15 million a 
prosperous democracy between world wars 
at the very least long submission did not dim czechoslovak wit 
and peoples ability to jab fun at themselves 
on its latest cover the satirical weekly dikobraz porcupine 
remarked on the job revolutionaries face in translating freedom and 
democracy for czechoslovak tongues 
it showed an averageguy character flinging open his superman 
cape to uncover the word forward a close look reveals he is a 
tree trunk with a mass of roots snaking deep into the ground

political jealousy military 
factionalism and president corazon aquinos failure to deliver on 
promises of her people power revolution account for the cycle 
of coup attempts that has rocked this nation 
about 400 rebels surrendered saturday in cebu ending the sixth 
and bloodiest attempt to topple mrs aquino 
the political and economic damage has been devastating the 
violence shattered the illusion of stability carefully crafted by 
mrs aquinos advisers 
it also exposed the disarray in a government that all too often 
blames its own shortcomings on the legacy of former president 
ferdinand marcos 
shes been hurt theres no question about it a senior bush 
administration official told reporters in washington the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said mrs aquinos ability to 
survive depends on how well she learns from the coup attempt 
it is far from certain any lessons will be learned 
mrs aquino reorganized her cabinet after coup attempts in 
november 1986 and august 1987 and promised a new beginning 
which proved largely rhetorical 
this coup happened because of her administrations wishywashy 
approach to national problems columnist pedro chanco wrote in 
the newspaper malaya my fear with mrs aquinos tough posture 
during the coup attempt is the likelihood that she will forget 
all about it when the crisis is over 
despite talk of national reconciliation mrs aquino has never 
mastered the art of dealing with political rivals essential to 
building a consensus in this fragmented society 
behind the public image of the frail vulnerable widow stands an 
ironwilled woman whom associates describe as stubborn to a fault 
she tends to dismiss criticism as the carping of jealous rivals 
but mrs aquino faces a military deeply politicized after years 
of martial law which marcos imposed from 1972 until 1981 each 
coup attempt has enhanced the influence of the military at the 
expense of civilian authority 
although mrs aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels 
military commanders opened talks and persuaded most of them to 
surrender military chief of staff gen renato de villa told mrs 
aquino of the talks after they began 
mutineers will be tried by military courts which have been 
reluctant to impose harsh sentences after previous coup attempts 
ironically the people power revolution itself encouraged 
the notion that the military should play a role in politics the 
revolt began in february 1986 as a coup attempt against marcos 
organized by some of the same officers who have since tried to 
overthrow mrs aquino 
it succeeded after cardinal jaime l sin and secular groups sent 
hundreds of thousands of followers into the streets to protect 
the mutineers from marcos troops 
young officers of the reform the armed forces movement or ram 
who led the 1986 uprising assumed they would share power with the 
president they helped put in office 
instead mrs aquino filled her cabinet with many longtime 
supporters bitter at the military for martial law 
she also made peace overtures to communist and moslem rebels 
while others in her government threatened to prosecute soldiers for 
human rights abuses under marcos 
that deepened suspicion and resentment in the ranks and prompted 
the reform movement to begin plotting the movement organized in 
1985 to fight corruption in the ranks is believed to have led at 
least three coup attempts including the latest 
its members include lt col gregorio gringo honasan leader 
of the august 1987 coup attempt honasan is believed to have played 
a key role in the recent attempt 
apart from political jealousy movement members were motivated 
by a belief that their goals were not realized corruption persists 
in both the military and civilian government 
although most filipinos remain suspicious of a military 
government a growing number are dissatisfied with mrs aquino 
because of rising prices decaying infrastructure and a lack of 
decisive leadership 
in 1986 many filipinos assumed mrs aquino would introduce 
sweeping social political and economic reforms to transform the 
nations feudalistic society 
instead she simply restored traditional democratic 
institutions including a bicameral congress and left the job of 
reform to them 
a bicameral legislature patterned after the us system has 
proven unwieldy here and incapable of speeding controversial 
legislation 
mrs aquino has ruled out a second term in 1992 as a lame 
duck she finds it difficult to bring to heel errant legislators 
whose terms run concurrently with her own 
since parties are weak and based on temporary personal 
alliances congressional leaders also have trouble delivering the 
vote on controversial legislation 
leaders of the recent coup attempt called for a 
civilianmilitary junta to initiate reforms and organize a 
referendum to decide what form of government to establish 
sen juan ponce enrile fired as defense minister after the 
november 1986 coup attempt believes a unicameral parliamentary 
system with a figurehead president and prime minister would be 
better 
it provides a safety valve that will release political steam 
and enable the people to make a vote of no confidence to dislodge 
the government without resorting to arms enrile said this is 
the way to end all these recurring coups 
the latest attempt occurred as millions were facing growing 
economic hardships due to rising prices electricity shortages a 
decline in the peso and transportation problems 
for months many supporters were warning mrs aquino that 
discontent was mounting 
intead of taking action mrs aquino asked for patience and 
blamed the problem on marcos she went to west germany and france 
in august and to canada and the united states last month seeking 
investments she took her 18yearold daughter kris to north 
america to shop for christmas presents 
in all humility i can whisper now perhaps i told you so 
said jose luis alcuaz fired as telecommunications chief after 
publicly warning a coup was imminent the fedup factor has 
reached alarming proportions

central american presidents reconvene on 
sunday in costa rica in an attempt to reverse what has been a 
steady deterioration of the peace process they began three years 
ago 
the twoday summit will be attended by the presidents of costa 
rica el salvador nicaragua honduras and guatemala for whom 
almost nothing has gone right since they met in august in honduras 
the peace process urgently needs to be put back on track as 
one us official put it last week 
nicaraguas leftist government is bitterly disappointed that the 
dec 5 deadline for demobilizing the contra rebels agreed to last 
august has passed with the insurgents still intact and still 
receiving nonlethal us assistance 
coupled with that was nicaraguas decision six weeks ago to 
suspend a ceasefire with the contras that had been in effect for 
19 months negotiations to restore the ceasefire broke down last 
month 
there have been setbacks to the peace process on the salvadoran 
front as well 
the crash last month of a plane from nicaragua carrying 
surfacetoair missiles to the fmln rebels in el salvador led it to 
suspend relations with managua the murder earlier in november of 
six jesuit priests presumably by rightist death squads 
underscored how far el salvador is from national reconciliation 
the massacre occurred just five days after the start of the most 
sustained rebel offensive since the conflict began 10 years ago 
the central america issue was one of the main points of 
contention at last weeks summit meeting between president bush and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
bush wants the soviets to do more to prevent crossborder 
deliveries of weaponry of soviet bloc equipment to the salvadoran 
rebels 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega said last week that he will 
ask his central american colleagues to set dec 31 as the new 
deadline for demobilizing the contras 
he said nicaragua will not agree to a deadline beyond that date 
but has not said what he will do if the contras are still in 
existence afterward 
the rebels backed by the bush administration want to stay 
together until after national elections set for feb 25 if the 
elections are free and fair the contras say that is the best 
guarantee that their return to their homeland will be safe 
mistrust between the sandinistas and the bush administration 
continues to run high us officials are worried that the 
sandinistas may be laying the groundwork either to call off the 
elections or to steal them 
nicaraguan authorities meanwhile have promised a free and fair 
process and say the elections will go ahead war or no war

us national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said today that washington and beijing should set aside differences 
over chinas crackdown on the prodemocracy movement and strengthen 
their relationship 
scowcrofts visit ended a us ban on highlevel meetings with 
china he and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
arrived earlier in the day as special envoys to brief chinese 
leaders on the ussoviet summit in malta 
we believe it is important that we not exhaust ourselves in 
placing blame for problems that exist scowcroft said at a dinner 
held by foreign minister qian qichen 
scowcroft said he had come to bring new impetus and vigor into 
our bilateral relationship and seek new areas of agreement we 
come to reduce the negative influence of irritants in the 
relationship 
the chinese who have blamed washington for current friction 
showed their desire to improve ties by arranging meetings with 
chinas top leaders sunday 
scowcroft and eagleburger are to meet with premier li peng 
communist party general secretary jiang zemin and senior leader 
deng xiaoping before leaving in the afternoon for japan they are 
to return to washington on monday 
deng 85 retired from his last party post in november he also 
has cut down his public apppearances and his meeting with the 
americans is a clear sign that china hopes to end the feuding 
foreign minister qian in his banquet toast said the special 
envoys visit shows the importance president bush attaches to 
uschinese relations for which we would like to express our 
appreciation 
important as our differences are qian said they cannot 
obliterate the major common interests between us 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement that while bush deplores the tragedy of tiananmen 
square last june china nevertheless remains part of the world 
around us the president views china as an important country in 
world affairs 
relations between beijing and washington hit a low after the 
chinese crushed the studentled prodemocracy movement the united 
states criticized the violence and repression and beijing accused 
washington of interfering in chinas internal affairs 
the chinese government says 300 people mostly soldiers died 
during the violent suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing on june 34 witnesses and western sources say hundreds or 
even thousands died most of the victims unarmed civilians 
in the past three weeks the foreign ministry has lodged three 
official protests with the united states over congressional actions 
to expand economic sanctions against china and to allow chinese 
students to extend their stays in the united states 
but chinese leaders in recent meetings with former president 
richard nixon and former secretary of state henry kissinger also 
have expressed hope that relations could be improved 
there was speculation in beijing that the two sides may discuss 
how to resolve the situation of astrophysicist fang lizhi the 
prodemocracy dissident who has been hiding in the us embassy 
with his wife li shuxian since the crackdown the chinese have 
branded the couple counterrevolutionaries and issued warrants for 
their arrest 
an embassy official declined comment on whether the americans 
discussed fang in their talks with qian today

old habits die hard in the intelligence 
community where a us government task force says it still has its 
hands full countering soviet disinformation linking the united 
states to babybuying aids and assassinations 
neither the slow thaw in the cold war nor last years superpower 
decision to set up a ussoviet panel for clarifying and 
correcting alleged errors in information disseminated by the other 
side has stopped the active measures working group from meeting 
every two weeks and gathering material for its annual report 
the soviets say the reports do not provide the spirit of 
friendly relations further they say the united states is 
equally at fault for spreading disinformation although they offer 
few examples 
the active measures working group is chaired by the state 
department and has representatives from state the cia defense 
intelligence agency the arms control and disarmament agency the 
us information agency and the defense and justice departments 
the term active measures is a literal translation from the 
russian and means covert or deceptive operations 
the groups annual report was ordered by congress in 1985 this 
years slickcovered 64page issue was presented to congress in 
october and says its purpose is to reveal and describe soviet 
influence activities that are deceptive and illegitimate 
the report covers news reports forgeries and antiamerican 
propaganda that appeared worldwide from june 1987 to november 1988 
it says soviet active measures campaigns are integrated 
operations carried out with the approval of the politburo or 
central committee secretariat 
reports starting in 1987 said that south american children were 
being bought up and taken to the united states to be sacrificed for 
their organs such stories circulated worldwide showing up in 
portugal sweden turkey britain east germany india and 
australia the united states responds by sending us embassies 
statements to deny the allegations as they appear 
there was a rash of it only a few weeks ago said a state 
department official who followed department guidelines by speaking 
only on condition he not be identified once these things get 
going they are very hard to stop 
he displayed recent clippings from soviet writers about other 
issues one an interview with a staterun novosti writer quoted a 
soviet doctor as saying the aids virus began in 1952 when the 
united states set off a nuclear bomb on bikini atoll 
last year the united states and the soviet union agreed to deal 
with disinformation issues directly the latest active measures 
report mentioning the joint ussoviet group says despite 
this apparent breakthrough active measures have continued 
igor bulay press counselor for the soviet embassy objects 
there is no intentional policy on the part of the soviet union 
to distort facts which concern the united states bulay said 
it was never a policy he added saying some of the reports 
could have been the work of journalists angry at the united states 
for being labeled as coming from the evil empire 
the state department official said the antiamerican propaganda 
has been reduced in the era of glasnost but it has not been 
eliminated the practices of decades are apparently difficult to 
forsake the official said 
as a sign of better times he noted we dont see broadcasts 
to south america deliberately telling people about the poor little 
children who are being fattened up for their organs 
the active measures report says meetings of the joint 
ussoviet group on disinformation were held this year in january 
and april with results described as encouraging 
bulay at the soviet embassy said the joint group was designed 
to deal with these issues and he suggested that the state 
department cease its annual reports 
there are a number of cases we are raising to the united 
states he said saying one of them was the portrayal of the 
soviet army during us military maneuvers earlier this year im 
not mentioning specific cases because we had semiconfidential 
talks with the united states 
the soviet diplomat said the state department group is 
selfserving 
it certainly could be reciprocated he said theres 
enough material for such a report but theres a feeling it wont 
promote better relations

the new communist premier today 
opened talks aimed at putting the final touches to a coalition 
government in which communists are likely to be in the minority for 
the first time in 41 years 
hardline communist president gustav husak planned to speak on 
national television tonight in an address expected to deal with 
opposition demands that he resign by sunday 
and tens of thousands of czechoslovaks streamed into austria to 
shop or sightsee today their first nonworking day since their 
government lifted restrictions on free travel to the west 
premier marian calfa on the job for only his third day 
received the head of the socialist party at his offices and planned 
to meet representatives of the communist party the opposition and 
other smaller political groups the state news agency ctk said 
calfa on friday said on national state tv that roughly 
onehalf of the new government could be composed of experts with no 
political affiliation calfa assumed his position after premier 
ladislav adamec resigned thursday 
the other half of the cabinet seats would go to the communists 
and members of the four other political parties permitted in 
czechoslovakia according to government spokesman marcel jansen 
a woman at the government press office who refused to identify 
herself on the telephone said it was expected the makeup of the 
new cabinet would be made public by sunday afternoon 
calfas announcement was a huge concession to opposition leaders 
who have set a sunday deadline for the leadership to name a new 
government that satisfies their demands for democratic reforms 
they have staged mass demonstrations and threatened to call a 
general strike monday 
communists relinquished their majority on friday in the regional 
government in slovakia one of the two republics that comprise the 
nation 
slovakias communist premier pavel hrivnak and his entire 
cabinet were ousted the state news agency ctk said former justice 
minister milan cic was asked to form a new cabinet 
under an agreement with the opposition independents would have 
nine seats in the 17member regional cabinet the rest of the 
government would include six communists and one representative each 
from two smaller legal parties 
the move follows a similiar agreement wednesday in the czech 
republic which made communists a minority in that regional 
government although they retained the leadership and key 
ministerial posts 
the composition of both regional governments are precursors to 
what is expected to be approval of new national government that 
makes the communists a minority for the first time since they took 
over complete rule in 1948 
a statement issued early today by the main opposition group 
civic forum said fridays talks brought together representatives 
of all the decisive political forces and that they parted 
united in the hope they could help calfa form a government to 
be sworn in sunday 
this should be a government of national understanding the 
statement said 
the changes come as equally sweeping developments in east 
germany where the communists today named opposition lawyer gregor 
gysi as party leader 
officials and opposition leaders in prague held two sets of 
talks on friday afterward a visibly pleased vaclav havel a top 
opposition leader said the results will be public soon but 
declined to divulge details 
vasil mohorita a member of the ruling politburo told reporters 
a coalition government representing all parts of the political 
spectrum would be named by sunday he did not elaborate adding 
only that there would be fewer communists 
another dissident at the talks slovak activist jan carnogursky 
said certain gains have been won and it has been agreed that all 
the political interests will be represented 
he said it was possible that he would become a deputy prime 
minister 
ctk took the highly unusual step of interviewing carnogursky and 
fellow slovak activist miroslav kusy another government candidate 
on friday night 
carnogurksy said he thinks free elections could be held in march 
husaks fate was expected to be decided before sunday husak 
76 one of the last remaining members of the old guard leadership 
supported the sovietled invasion that crushed the prague 
spring reforms enacted by communist liberals in 1968 
mohorita said that husak should remain in office to swear in the 
new government otherwise we would have a constitutional crisis 
in the past three weeks mass prodemocracy demonstrations 
headed up by the civic forum opposition and its slovak counterpart 
public against violence have forced the communists to relinquish 
their 41year monopoly on political power 
but a government named last sunday by adamec included only five 
noncommunists in a 21member cabinet and left communists in 
control of all key ministries 
initially adamec scheduled to announce the new government on 
friday but his resignation on thursday and growing demands for 
genuine powersharing forced a new talks

a surgeon who performed the nations second liver 
transplant from a living donor taking part of a fathers liver and 
implanting it in his 15monthold daughter said the operation 
proved very difficult 
the daughter sarina underwent 7 hours of surgery at the 
university of chicago medical center on friday leaving the 
operating room just after 1030 pm hospital spokesman john 
easton said 
she and her father 20yearold robert jones were listed in 
critical but stable condition today in the intensive care unit as 
is customary in such cases easton said 
it was a very difficult operation but i expect her to be 
fairly stable afterward said dr christoph broelsch the 
transplant surgeon 
this morning doctors described the girls progress so far as 
outstanding said hospital spokeswoman mary fetsch and jones 
could be moved out of intensive care by the end of the day she 
said 
in the operation jones a drywall installer and contractor 
from millington tenn near memphis had the left lobe of his 
liver removed and the partial organ implanted into sarina 
broelsch said that during the operation he spotted lingering 
signs of a bacterial infection that she came down with two weeks 
ago which had postponed the operation they were able to clear 
out the remnants of the infection easton said 
jones is awake and talking to his wife hes uncomfortable 
as you might expect but he is wide awake and doing very well 
broelsch said 
dr peter whitington director of pediatric transplant services 
at the hospital said the operation was not expected to be the most 
difficult hurdle for sarina to overcome 
her difficulty is going to be recovery convalescing 
regaining nutritional status overcoming any infections he said 
sarinas mother 21yearold michelle jones said the roughest 
part of the ordeal had been the waiting but the family had no 
reservations about the surgery 
im excited that its finally come true she said at an 
afternoon news conference weve been waiting for a long time 
and its finally here 
sarina has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder 
called biliary atresia 
the congenital disorder also afflicted 21monthold alyssa 
smith who last week received part of her mothers liver at the 
hospital in the first livingdonor liver transplant in the united 
states 
alyssa of schertz texas near san antonio was doing well 
friday with her liver function rapidly improving toward normal 
and no signs of her body rejecting the transplant whitington said 
her mother teresa smith a 29yearold schoolteacher was 
released from the hospital thursday 
whitington said sarina was not nearly as strong as alyssa going 
into her transplant but we thought it was her best chance for 
survival and the best graft available under the circumstances 
a team led by broelsch began removing part of the liver of 
sarinas father at about 730 am and began surgery on sarina at 3 
pm 
whitington said the fathers only misgiving about the operation 
was a fear that his daughter might die before he woke up from the 
surgery

in dazzling leaps or small steps republican 
and democratic candidates are moving away from antiabortion 
positions as they prepare for 1990 campaigns that promise to 
spotlight the divisive issue 
theyre changing so fast its hard to keep up with them all 
says kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league 
her abortionrights lobby has been swamped with news of converts 
in the weeks since antiabortion candidates were defeated in 
virginia and new jersey governors races and as an impression grows 
that electoral majorities favor maintaining legal abortions 
the most startling reversal came last week by ohio attorney 
general anthony celebrezze the leading contender for the 
democratic nomination for governor 
after more than a decade as an outspoken opponent of abortion 
celebrezze declared that if elected he would veto any legislation 
banning abortion and would support public funding of the procedure 
for poor women 
his move was regarded as an attempt to head off the potential 
democratic candidacy of an abortionrights supporter joel hyatt 
celebrezze stunned and infuriated national antiabortion 
leaders who distributed copies of a statement he signed three 
years ago pledging support for legislation to prohibit abortion 
except to prevent the death of the mother and to oppose the use of 
tax money for abortions 
a total flipflop for what he perceives as personal political 
gain said an outraged david osteen executive director of the 
national right to life committee 
celebrezze however is only the latest and most clearcut 
example of 1990 candidates trying to stake out the most 
advantageous position for their respective races 
democratic gubernatorial candidates rep bill nelson in florida 
neil hartigan in illinois tom miller in iowa and frank belotti in 
massachusetts have all taken steps or made comments that have been 
seen as moderating past opposition to abortion or siding outright 
with abortionrights forces 
sharp divisions among republican have emerged two gop 
candidates for governor of texas tom luce and jack rains have 
begun airing television commercials declaring their support for 
legal abortions they have drawn battle lines against antiabortion 
primary candidates including former rep kent hance 
in rains case the move came just a few weeks after he appeared 
at a dallas fundraiser for a texas antiabortion group and said 
i stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this cause 
driving the political turnabouts is the supreme courts ruling 
last summer that gave states more leeway to regulate abortions 
that thrust the issue back in the hands of state politicians 
its going to be a very major factor in gubernatorial races 
said kevin phillips publisher of the american political report 
its a defining issue said alice travis director of 
programs for the democratic national committee its like civil 
rights was in some ways like the vietnam war was it tells you who 
a person is and what he or she believes 
in senate races the reelection battle of democrat tom harkin 
of iowa an abortionrights supporter against republican rep tom 
tauke an abortion opponent is already one of the most closely 
watched 1990 contests 
while democrats were the beneficiaries of the new political 
focus on abortion in 1989 races the party has a number of 
incumbents on the other side of the issue 
in pennsylvania democratic gov robert casey is an opponent of 
abortion and could face a republican who supports abortion rights 
republican barbara hafer the state auditor has the pennsylvania 
gops endorsement 
another key race is in florida where republican gov bob 
martinez made abortion the issue when he called a special 
legislative session to enact abortion restrictions he failed to 
win passage of his proposals and he now faces a republican primary 
against a state senator marlene woodsonhoward who supports 
abortion rights bracing for a tough battle and on narals national 
hit list martinez has amassed a 4 million campaign war chest 
in the democratic race to oppose martinez nelson and george 
stuart a state senator are both running as supporters of abortion 
rights 
nelson in the past has opposed abortion however and the 
national abortionrights lobby remains skeptical of him he was 
among some twodozen house members who switched positions last 
october from a similar vote a year earlier to support 
liberalized federal funding of abortions for poor women 
he says hes been prochoice when he has not been 
michelman said 
until celebrezzes switch illinois attorney general hartigan 
had been the primary object of antiabortion leaders wrath he is 
running for governor against republican jim edgar the secretary of 
state who supports abortion rights 
hartigan had been counted as opposing abortion until he agreed 
to an outofcourt settlement last month of a key court case that 
was pending before the supreme court the case had been viewed by 
both sides as a potential vehicle for a majority on the court to 
reverse its 16yearold roe vs wade decision upholding the right 
to an abortion 
he obviously betrayed the prolife people who had supported 
him said darla st martin associate executive director of the 
national right to life committee 
another key race is for governor of iowa a state long 
considered conservative on the abortion issue and where the senate 
race already assures a focus on abortion 
miller the state attorney general has been running as an 
antiabortion candidate and leads a field of opponents who support 
abortionrights but in recent weeks he has said he would not seek 
any restrictions on abortion except to support a law requiring 
notification of the parent of a minor seeking an abortion 
miller is still counted as an abortion opponent michelman said 
his actions are little signals that he may be changing 
tom miller is feeling the heat she said 
the winner of the primary will face republican gov terry 
branstad who is an abortion opponent 
other battles over abortion are shaping up including potential 
gubernatorial primaries in both parties in connecticut in 
republican primaries for governor in massachusetts and minnesota 
and in the republican senate primary in new hampshire

pantex the countrys only final assembly 
plant for nuclear bombs and missile warheads could not respond 
effectively to emergency releases of radioactive material 
according to experts who inspected the texas weapons factory 
appointed by energy secretary james d watkins a tiger team 
of government and outside experts found significant health safety 
and environmental deficiencies at the world war iiera plant 
outside amarillo 
in a memo accompanying the teams draft report watkins said the 
findings indicate workers lack adequate protection from emergency 
and routine exposures to radioactive releases he said the 
situation must be corrected immediately 
while the team said it found no conditions that appeared to 
pose a clear and present danger to safety and health it was 
clear the radiation safety department would be unable to respond 
effectively to emergencies involving a release of radioactive 
material 
pantex spokesman tom walton said some problems already had been 
corrected and others were being addressed by plant officials 
in its report released wednesday the team said the radiation 
protection program was generally inadequate as evidenced by 
extensive noncompliance with energy department regulations 
the plants contractor and doe offices in amarillo and 
albuquerque nm have been aware of the situation for several 
years but little has been achieved to correct it the report 
said 
although watkins said the plant has a strong safety culture 
little evidence exists that a comparable environmental culture 
is evolving this must be corrected 
the report said pantex is not adequately monitoring its impact 
on the underlying ogallala aquifer practically the only source of 
useable water for texas largest irrigated farming region 
as of august 11 of the plants 29 underground storage tank 
systems had been leaktested and five were either leaking or had 
leaking pipes those systems have been replaced and testing 
continues on the remaining systems 
if the failure rate continues to be as high as in the first 11 
tank systems tested there could be substantive ongoing releases 
to the subsurface environment the report said 
the plants procedures for assessing possible contamination of 
the air soil and ground water also do not meet industry standards 
and the plant does not have an environmental monitoring plan said 
the team which was at pantex from oct 231 
pantex also has failed to ask the environmental protection 
agency whether it needs a permit for discharges of contaminated and 
potentially contaminated waste water runoff into several playas 
ephemeral desert lakes on the grounds of the 16000acre plant 
samples collected in ditches leading to three of those playas 
and in two playas show heavy metal and organic contamination in 
water and sediments the report said 
occupational safety and health administration investigators sent 
to the plant found more than 300 violations dozens of them serious 
in one health violation records were not maintained on an 
employees exposure to radioactive material during a weapon 
teardown operation or for employees involved in the cleanup 
watkins has ordered doe officials and the plants contractor 
mason amp hangersilas mason co to address all deficiencies in a 
final plan due in february a formal osha report is expected by 
midjanuary 
the plant assembles maintains and repairs nuclear weapons and 
manufactures high explosive components

the new us voice that japan has been hearing for 
six months is getting away so far with saying things the 
japanese dont want to be told 
us ambassador michael h armacost hit tokyo running when he 
arrived in may and hasnt cut back on an energetic schedule of 
speeches and meetings in which he offers what he calls friendly 
advice to officials the media and business leaders 
his advice delivered in a voice unexpectedly soft coming from a 
6foot4inch man is couched in careful reason but amounts to a 
call for the japanese to change change what they say what they 
write in their newspapers the way they do business their barriers 
to us imports and investment 
his speeches make news and sometimes invite comparison with his 
predecessor mike mansfield 86 who retired after 11 years as 
ambassador slowed by illness that required heart surgery in early 
1988 mansfield was far less active in his last years in tokyo than 
armacost 34 years his junior has been 
armacost dislikes comparing his performance with mansfields 
i have great admiration for him and thought he was a 
tremendous ambassador he said in an interview in his ninthfloor 
embassy office 
he clearly has helped me because he lent such stature to the 
job so anybody who followed him was bound to be taken more 
seriously at least for a while because he raised the whole level 
of the job 
mansfield sometimes was criticized for not stressing trade 
issues enough while armacost on arrival declared he was going to 
be the embassys top commercial officer one of his main goals is 
reduction of the 50 billion us annual trade deficit with japan 
its not a matter so much of personal interest of the 
ambassador but a matter of the times armacost said i came 
into the job at a time when people back home were experiencing 
intense frustration because of the fact that four years of major 
adjustments on macroeconomic policy had not produced the result 
that was expected in our bilateral trade 
so he calls on the japanese to make even more changes to the 
delight of local americans and even many japanese who admired 
mansfield for his relentless insistence that the usjapan 
relationship was the most important bilateral tie washington has 
tadashi yamamoto president of the japan center for 
international exchange said mansfield did a good job but 
armacost is younger hes active and can touch more bases 
yamamoto praised the career diplomat for including the widows of 
past japanese ambassadors to washington in a recent farewell party 
for the new japanese ambassador the widows were touched by the 
gesture yamamoto said 
armacost can say things which japanese dont necessarily want 
to hear but also he appears to be very reasonable in many things 
he says yamamoto said 
armacost often says that japan and the united states both will 
win by resolving their trade problem 
trade is not a zerosum game he says using a term perhaps 
borrowed from his years of teaching government before he went into 
the state department 
a native of cleveland ohio armacost taught at pomona college 
in california at international christian university in tokyo and 
at georgetown university and johns hopkins university in the early 
1970s he was special assistant to edwin o reischauer then the 
us ambassador in tokyo 
armacost was ambassador to the philippines from 1982 to 1984 
and then was undersecretary of state for political affairs before 
president bush named him to replace mansfield 
he says he has been dealing with japan for 21 years and when he 
declares that japan and the united states are becoming increasingly 
interdependent he speaks from a family viewpoint as well as an 
official one 
one of his three sons is married to a japanese and another 
attended a university here 
let me offer some friendly advice armacost said in a 
recent speech to a business conference on japanese investment in 
the united states shortly after us concern accelerated with 
sonys buyout of columbia pictures 
if japanese investors want to keep a receptive atmosphere in the 
united states armacost said they must promote american managers 
hire women and minorities follow usstyle corporate philanthropy 
and use local suppliers 
most important japan must open itself to foreign investment he 
said 
in almost every area he said japans performance is lagging 
and to japanese commentators who find racism behind americans 
wariness about japanese investment he said that view is 
misinformed and i believe dangerous because it deflects 
attention from the real sources of concern 
he has chided japanese media and american media as well 
about peppering their trade stories with emotive words like war 
and invasion and he disputes a common japanese complaint that 
us exports to japan lag because us companies dont try hard 
its not just a matter of not trying hard he told the 
associated press most companies ive run into are trying very 
hard and are doing it rather intelligently 
but the fact remains that 20 to 25 percent of the banking 
industry in california is owned by the japanese i cant think of a 
single instance in which an american bank has been able to purchase 
a japanese bank 
he said however that trade friction isnt the whole sum and 
substance of the relationship theres a lot in the 
relationship thats working well and its worth emphasizing from 
time to time because it tends to get taken for granted or 
forgotten 
as examples he cited japans pledge of 150 million in aid to 
poland helping mexico and the philippines deal with massive debts 
growing foreign development aid heavy financial support for us 
military forces in japan and cooperation with washington on many 
regional problems

chronic water shortages may appear during the 
1990s from northern china to the western united states said a 
global report on irrigation released saturday 
the report water for agriculture facing the limits said 
changes in world temperature almost inevitably will change the 
patterns of rain and water supply for several decades 
that would make it harder for farmers to grow enough food for 
the worlds rising population said the author sandra postel at a 
briefing thursday on the report 
postel is vicepresident of worldwatch institute a study group 
supported by private foundations and united nations agencies 
many areas could enter a period of chronic shortages during 
the nineties including northern china virtually all of northern 
africa pockets of india mexico much of the middle east and 
parts of the western united states she wrote 
where scarcities loom cities and farms are beginning to 
compete for available water when water supplies tighten farmers 
typically lose out she wrote 
she quoted one study as showing that global warming in the west 
could change the flow of melting snow from the rocky mountains 
taking 11 million acres of irrigation 
other reasons for shortages include overpumping of water from 
supplies under the surface poor management of reservoirs and 
most important the rapid growth of population the third world 
she said 
her expectation of changes due to global warming was challenged 
as speculative by mark rosegrant an irrigation expert at the 
international food policy research institute he suggested that her 
predictions may be too pessimstic 
in an interview he suggested that the right policy by 
governments including higher prices for water could improve water 
supplies 
but he agreed with her that irrigation will not increase much in 
the 1990s he had supplied figures to postel showing that money 
lent to the third world for irrigation dropped from 12 billion in 
1975 to about 600 million in 1987 
postel cited egypt heavily dependent on aid from the united 
states and on water from the nile as a prime candidate for a 
disastrous water shortage that could reduce the already low living 
standards of its 55 million people the eqyptian population is 
increasing at the rate of 1 million every eight months she added 
she said a third of the worlds food comes from irrigated land 
but that environmental damage as well as reduced spending had 
slowed the growth of irrigation poor management has brought an 
accumulation of salt that has damaged roughtly one acre in every 
four of irrigated land she estimated 
she pointed to the aral sea in the soviet union once the 
worlds fourth biggest body of inland water saying it had lost 
twothirds of its water and tripled its level of salt 
exterminating all the native fish 
recent photographs have shown abandoned fishing boats high on 
white salt beaches

cuban president fidel castro says his country 
will not become an appendix of the yankee empire even though 
the demise of communist rule in eastern europe opens the way to 
global us domination 
reaffirming his hardline stance against changes on the other 
side of the atlantic castro said cuba may be assigned the role of 
being among the last defenders of socialism 
castro delivered the speech thursday at a ceremony honoring more 
than 2000 cubans who have died carrying out revolutionary tasks 
overseas a text was made available in the united states 
reform of socialist countries is understandable he said but he 
expressed regret that the changes under way in eastern europe 
have a capitalist direction 
capitalism castro said implies prostitution drugs 
gambling begging unemployment abysmal inequality between 
citizens and other ills 
with the united states and other capitalist powers showing more 
interest in investing in eastern europe what resources could the 
third world where thousands of millions of people live under 
inhuman conditions expect from such a development of events 
castro asked 
comparing the united states with nazi germany castro said in 
a world in which the yankee empire was able to make a reality of 
hitlers dream of dominating the world we would know how to defend 
this bastion until the last drop of blood 
with the demise of likeminded governments in czechoslovakia 
east germany bulgaria and elsewhere in eastern europe cuba is 
among just a handful of states adhering to orthodox communist rule 
if capitalism returned to cuba some day castro said the 
countrys independence and sovereignty would disappear forever 
we would be an extension of miami a simple appendix of the 
yankee empire fulfilling the disgusting prophesy of 19th 
century us leaders he said 
castro said much of the wealth of the developed countries comes 
from unequal trade with the third world and now the united states 
wants east european countries to join in this colossal looting 
if events follow their present course the bipolarized 
world we knew in the postwar era will inevitably become a 
unipolarized world under us hegemony he said 
there is even some sentiment in the soviet union castro said 
for altering a trade pattern under which cuba receives abovemarket 
prices for its exports and a discount on some imports 
he said he banned two soviet publications this past summer for 
recommending that the soviets sell to cuba at higher prices and buy 
from it at lower ones 
this is exactly the same thing that the united states does 
with third world countries he said adding that these same 
countries face a discouraging future if existing trends are not 
reversed

change its hardline bureaucratic image 
we are no longer going to be just an administrative party 
gysi said we are going to be a party of conviction 
gysi 41 became the youngest leader of a communist party in 
eastern europe and said he had learned something from western 
politics 
he declined to make any pessimistic predictions about the 
communists chances in next years planned free elections 
we learned from western politicians that you dont do that 
said gysi who has the smooth relaxed speaking style and ready 
smile of a western politician you always have to act very 
optimistic 
gysi said the party would fight to win in next years elections 
but also would be willing to work in coalition with other parties 
we must naturally make ourselves so trustworthy that for the 
others we are seen as having the ability to work in coalition he 
said 
gysi won with support from 953 percent of the 2714 voting 
delegates who took part in the balloting he was the only candidate 
his father klaus now in his late 70s served until last year 
as the state secretary for religious affairs in east germany 
hes a very outspoken person like his father maybe thats 
why they replaced him as state secretary last year said irene 
runge spokeswoman for east berlins jewish community

party leader had been very supportive of the citys jewish 
community 
after completing high school gysi studied law at east berlins

as a legal assistant 
in 1971 he began practicing as a defense lawyer dealing 
primarily in civil labor and business cases he has been chief of

when the opposition group was seeking official recognition in 
october authorities at the time declared new forum illegal and 
called members enemies of the state

to register as a legal organization violated east german statutes

following the mass resignation of the communists ruling 10man 
politburo and 163man central committee last week gysi was named a 
member of a special committee to restructure the shattered party

portable heaters and other supplemental 
appliances that are intended to make it cheaper to keep warm can be 
very dangerous if improperly used or installed government experts 
say 
the greatest danger is fire the consumer product safety 
commission says 
supplemental home heating appliances are estimated to be 
associated with 105800 residential fires killing an estimated 600 
people in 1987 the commission said in a recent statement 
comparatively cooking equipment gas and electric stoves and 
other items accounted for 102900 home fires and 330 deaths 
according to elizabeth johnson a spokeswoman for the commission 
additionally thousands of injuries from contact burns and about 
100 deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning from home heating 
appliance emissions occur annually the commission said 
kerosene gas and electric heaters accounted for more than half 
the residential fire deaths due to home heating appliances in 1987 
lowincome families seem to be common victims of electric heater 
fires because theyre using them as a basic heating system 
said one cpsc staffer 
the next greatest threat is from kerosene heaters which people 
turn to if their power is turned off the staffer said 
flareup or uncontrolled flaming which can happen when improper 
or contaminated fuels are used is cited as a prime factor in 
kerosenerelated accidents 
people should never use gasoline or other fuels in kerosene 
heaters 
both kerosene and gas heaters emit air pollutants that can build 
up to dangerous levels in enclosed rooms areas where they are used 
should be well ventilated 
incorrect setting of the wick in kerosene heaters also can 
contribute to escaping pollutants the cpsc says people should 
follow the manufacturers suggestion on wick settings 
the agency also says people with older unvented gasfired space 
heaters should replace them with models manufactured after december 
1981 that is when they were required to be equipped with sensors 
that automatically shut off the heaters if the oxygen levels in the 
surrounding area fall too low 
fireplaces and wood and coalburning stove also are associated 
with numerous deaths and thousands of home fires which begin in the 
chimney and are often caused by a buildup of creosote a tarlike 
residue 
regular service from a qualified chimney sweep can prevent the 
buildup the sweep can also check the structural integrity of both 
the fireplace and chimney 
experts offer these further tips on heating your home safely 
follow manufacturers instructions for installation operation 
and maintenance of heating appliances 
keep children and pets away from heating appliances 
dont use supplemental heating appliances as a substitute for 
a central heating system 
never use a space heater overnight in a room where you are 
sleeping 
check and maintain proper ventilation in rooms where a gas or 
kerosene heater is used 
place heaters on the floor at least three feet away from 
combustible items such as bedding furniture and draperies 
dont use heaters in wet or moist places such as bathrooms 
unless they are specifically designed and tested for those 
locations 
dont use extension cords with electric heaters unless 
absolutely necessary and keep all cords on top of rugs or carpets 
to prevent overheating 
use only 1k kerosene in kerosene heaters 
have chimneys checked by a qualified chimney sweep before and 
during the heating season 
hownowners and mobile home residents who use electric heat 
tapes or pipe heating cables to protect exposed water lines from 
freezing over the winter should inspect them for cracks char marks 
or baring and replace them if necessary 
keep a properly functioning smoke detector on each level of 
your home preferably close to sleeping areas 
check smoke detector batteries frequently and replace as 
needed

rebel soldiers saturday surrendered 
their last stronghold and ended their eightday revolt the sixth 
and bloodiest attempt to oust president corazon aquino 
the military said three brigadier generals and at least 12 
middlegrade officers would be relieved of their duties for joining 
the coup attempt which left at least 83 dead and more than 580 
wounded 
in the capital an assailant hurled a grenade into the main post 
office saturday killing two people and wounding 18 it was unclear 
if the attack was related to the coup attempt 
about 400 troops had held the mactan air base at cebu city 350 
miles south of manila since the coup attempt began dec 1 
mactan airport in cebu is now back to normal operations after 
the rebel group surrendered to government troops this 
morning mrs aquino said in a statement 
this is good news for our people who have overwhelmingly 
demonstrated their abhorrence for the violence espoused by the 
mutineers she said referring to fridays demonstration in 
manila in support of her government 
most of the rebel soldiers who had held the base began leaving 
for mindanao island where they came from the rest marched back to 
their barracks inside the base witnesses said loyal forces began 
clearing the base of booby traps planted by mutineers 
brig gen renato palma government regional military chief 
refused to give details of surrender terms but said he will 
recommend no charges be brought against the rebel soldiers 
here in mactan not a single shot was fired so they have not 
caused anything that will call for serious repercussion he 
said i think that is a very good mitigating circumstance in 
other words we did not fight 
participants in past coups received little or no punishment and 
in one instance mutineers were let off with 30 pushups 
mrs aquino was swept into office during the february 1986 
people power revolution that forced ferdinand marcos into exile 
after 20 years in power 
on friday more than 100000 people gathered in manila in a show 
of support for mrs aquino during the rally she hit back at her 
chief critic vice president salvador laurel and said he cannot 
wait to be president i will never give up that position to him 
mrs aquino spoke on the site where hundreds of thousands of 
filipinos filled the streets in 1986 to prevent tanks from 
attacking dissident officers who had mutinied against marcos 
the president did not mention complaints by the rebels and other 
critics that she has failed to deliver on promises of social 
justice and reform 
the reported settlement showed just how far both sides softened 
to end the revolt 
on dec 2 mrs aquino ruled out negotiations and warned the 
mutineers to surrender or die but she stepped aside to allow 
loyal military commanders to resolve the crisis peacefully 
before the surrender the rebel commander brig gen jose 
commendador refused to abandon control of the air base saying his 
troops have opted to die 
the surrender of the mactan holdouts brought to at least 1900 
the number of rebels in government hands the military estimates 
about 3000 soldiers joined the coup attempt and the whereabouts 
of many rebels remained unclear 
military officials said lowerranking officers and enlisted men 
would be reassigned to other units as has generally been the case 
after previous coup attempts 
the coup attempt began when rebel forces bombed the presidential 
palace and seized several military garrisons near manila on dec1 
government forces backed by us f4 phantom fighter jets 
flying cover retook the garrisons another rebel group holding out 
in manilas financial district surrendered thursday

iran began a week of naval maneuvers in 
the persian gulf on saturday and one senior iranian official said 
the war games were the most extensive since the islamic revolution 
10 years ago 
irans staterun radio monitored in nicosia said the air force 
and army also would take part in the maneuvers over a wide area 
of the gulf the gulf of oman and the strategic hormuz strait 
it said navy destroyers missile ships troop carriers 
hovercraft air force fighter jets minedetecting helicopters and 
special revolutionary guards naval units were participating 
a senior iranian official identified only as izadi said these 
naval maneuvers are the biggest since the victory of the islamic 
revolution in 1979 the radio reported 
the report said izadi was speaking from a warship participating 
in the exercises 
the maneuvers are codenamed zulfiqar5 after the legendary 
doubleedged sword of ali soninlaw of the prophet mohammed ali 
is revered by shiite moslems as a spiritual leader 
zulfiqar5 is aimed at coordinating the forces of the iranian 
navy and the revolutionary guards and at upgrading the expert 
defense capabilities of the forces in iranian and international 
waters the radio said 
president hashemi rafsanjani said last month the navy had 
acquired vital equipment that would improve its capability 
he did not elaborate but western military analysts believe he 
may have been indicating that chinesemade silkworm antiship 
missiles have been deployed on iranian warships for the first time 
the analysts said the iranian navy has been seeking a new 
seaborne missile system 
the iranians are believed to have testfired a shipborne 
silkworm missile in the persian gulf three months ago 
the maneuvers are the second major naval exercise since last 
years ceasefire in irans eightyear war with iraq they are the 
first since ayatollah ali khamenei irans spiritual leader and 
chief of the armed forces dropped rear adm mohammadhussein 
malekzadegan as naval commander last month 
malekzadegan had commanded the navy since 1982 khamenei 
replaced him with ali shamkhani who had been minister of the 
revolutionary guards 
since 1979 the revolutionary guards have become the biggest 
military group in the armed forces with an estimated 350000 men 
and their own air and naval operations 
some iranian leaders including rafsanjani have sought to merge 
the often unruly revolutionary guards with the more disciplined 
regular armed forces 
but such a move has been opposed by khamenei revolutionary 
hardliners guards members and the regular forces themselves 
poor coordination and often open hostility between the guards 
members and the regular army severely hampered irans military 
operations during the war with iraq 
shamkhanis appointment the first involving the transfer of a 
revolutionary guards commander into the regular forces was seen as 
a move to improve ties between the branches and defuse criticism of 
military policy by the guards 
rafsanjani said last month that shamkhani who was promoted to 
rear admiral is expected to come up with an efficient naval 
combination in the gulf and improve coordination between naval 
and guards forces

hans hartung a germanborn artist who 
was one of the founders of abstract painting has died at his home 
in the south of france a friend said he was 85 
hartung died friday with several friends gathered at his 
bedside the friend who disclosed the death spoke on condition of 
anonymity and did not give the cause of death 
hartung was a pioneer of action painting the form of abstract 
expressionism born when artists splattered or dripped paint to 
create fluid and seemingly impulsive compositions 
french culture minister jack lang said in a statement that 
hartung was a man of creation and freedom and one of those 
who constructed the new pictorial language of our time 
the germanborn hartung lived in france for more than 50 years 
and lost a leg fighting for the french in world war ii 
despite illness and old age he continued to paint each day 
standing propped up by his assistants 
he splashed canvases big and small with the pure bright colors 
that had long been his trademark he was equally at ease with 
chalk ink watercolors acrylic and oils 
best known for big bold abstract canvases hartung said his 
painting was impulsive the expression of deep emotion 
i paint when i want to convey a certain feeling he said in 
a 1984 interview 
hartung was born sept 21 1904 in leipzig germany the son of 
a welltodo doctor who once told him to abandon art if he wanted 
to make money 
he studied philosophy and art history at the university of 
leipzig 
hartung came to paris in 1926 and worked under painter fernand 
leger but hartung struck out on his own when leger tried to tell 
him what to do 
his approach to abstract art was anything but conventional 
besides brushes he liked to use his thumbs fingernails hair 
brushes mops even a sawedoff broom and anything else capable of 
spreading paint on canvases that often covered half a wall 
he was married divorced and remarried after the war to anna eva 
bergman also a wellknown painter 
hartung once said his favorite accomplishment was his home a 
white bauhausstyle houseworkshop in the hills behind antibes he 
designed the vast home himself down to the last detail no 
stairs 
he wrote many books including selfportrait in 1976 he 
was commander of the french legion of honor and he earned several 
war honors

with 15 million spent and no solution in sight 
authorities are thinking of disbanding the green river task force 
and say that the elusive serial killer of as many as 49 women may 
remain unknown forever 
forty to 50 people remain under investigation in the nations 
worst serial murder case without some breakthrough those queries 
should be completed in about a year said king county police capt 
robert evans head of the unit 
the task force was formed in 1984 to probe the deaths or 
disappearances of as many as 49 young women most with links to 
prostitution in the pacific northwest from the summer of 1982 to 
early 1984 the case takes its name from the river near where the 
first five victims were found 
police spokesman dave robinson said the county alone has spent 
some 15 million on the case which investigators admit could wind 
up as much a mystery as the identity of jack the ripper the 
unknown person who mutilated and murdered five prostitutes in 
london a century ago or the zodiac killer who stalked san 
franciscans two decades ago and sent taunting notes to authorities 
five months ago a former law student who was also a prison 
escapee was labeled a viable suspect by investigators but 
william jay stevens ii 38 was cleared in the case nov 30 
other men studied by the task force have not even reached 
viable status for example a 34yearold man was arrested nov 
16 in vancouver british columbia in a policestyle car found to 
contain guns knives mace a machete 10 feet of rope 
pornographic videos and identification listing eight addresses and 
various names investigators have speculated that the green river 
killer posed as a police officer to trap his victims 
but evans said the man arrested in canada apparently spent too 
little time in the seattle area to rank higher than not very 
likely 
evans and sheriff james montgomery said the 19member task force 
probably would lose a detective or two next month 
a budget for 1990 approved by the county council would cut two 
detectives from the major crimes unit which houses the task force 
and at least one probably will come from the green river probe 
montgomery said 
at its height the task force had separate offices and involved 
about 70 staff members from seattle tacoma king and pierce 
counties and the fbi 
while task force members still work almost fulltime on green 
river theyre awfully close to being melded in with the major 
crimes unit right now montgomery said 1990 is probably going 
to be the transition year 
without significant new leads he said i think the ability to 
specifically identify the task force will disappear probably 
after january 1991 
besides 41 known green river victims the case includes the 
disappearance of eight others who fit the victim profile generally 
young and linked to prostitution or other street life 
murder and prostitution go hand in hand and they have since 
the very beginning of time i believe evans said 
four were found near portland ore one not far from tacoma 
one in a seattle park and the rest around king county 
cause of death was listed as strangling in the first five cases 
but authorities have cited only homicidal violence since then 
there was clothing found at some of the sites but the 
absence of clothing is a significant factor at many of the sites 
evans said 
since the first five bodies were found most of the remains have 
been little more than bones 
investigators are even undecided on how many killers were 
involved 
i dont think there is a dominant theory evans said it 
could be two maybe even three separate serial murder cases 
as is customary in widely publicized murder investigations 
authorities have withheld some details of the crimes even if the 
investigation winds down in coming years montgomery said those 
details will remain known only to authorities and the killer 
i dont think its in the publics best interest certainly in 
the victims families best interests to lay open the entire file 
for the foreseeable future the sheriff said

an iranianbacked fundamentalist group 
linked to the holding of western hostages said saturday it had 
thwarted an attempt to assassinate its mentor 
a car rigged with 200 pounds of tnt was parked off the road that 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah takes daily from his house to beir 
elabed mosque in beiruts southern slums said a statement by 
hezbollah or party of god 
police said the bombladen car was set to be detonated by remote 
contol they said they could not confirm it was intended to kill 
fadlallah 
the bomb was safely defused in the car which was parked in 
front of a bank about 100 yards from the mosque and 12 miles from 
the shiite moslem clerics house in haret hreik district the 
statement said 
fadlallah 54 is the spiritual guide of hezbollah believed to 
be the umbrella of shiite extremist factions holding most of the 18 
western hostages including eight americans in lebanon 
the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

street battles between hezbollah and the mainstream shiite amal 
militia in which police said 13 people were killed and 22 wounded 
assassinations by car bombs or bomb blasts have long been a 
byproduct of lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the latest was the remotecontrolled bomb that killed president 
rene mouawad and 23 others in moslem west beirut nov 22 just 17 
days after his election no one claimed responsibility 
mouawad was elected as part of an arab leaguesponsored pact 
aimed at ending the war his election was opposed by the countrys 
christian leader and army commander gen michel aoun because the 
pact does not provide a timetable for the removal of syrian troops 
from lebanon 
the syrians were deployed here in 1976 under a peackeeping 
mandate aoun said they violated the mandate by siding with the 
moslems in the war

the trial of a former boeing co 
marketing executive offers an intriguing glimpse into an 
oldboy network of defense contractors in which classified 
documents were freely swapped no questions asked 
during three days of testimony last week witnesses spun tales 
that could have come right out of a spy novel car trunks stuffed 
with documents shadowy figures who may have sold the documents 
secret stashes and document destruction sometimes in home 
fireplaces 
the swapping of documents during the late 1970s and 1980s was 
described as endemic and common and there was an unspoken 
agreement that no one questioned where the documents came from 
not even pentagon investigators 
one witness said he was under pressure from his boss to secure 
the documents and others said their companies felt they had a 
need to know what was in the documents 
most of those involved in the document ring were former military 
officers who had served in the pentagon prior to going to work for 
defense contractors 
prosecutors described richard lee fowler who worked for boeing 
from 1978 until he was fired in 1986 after an investigation was 
begun as the linchpin of a document trading ring that involved 
employees of nine major defense contractors 
after deliberating only two hours a federal court jury 
convicted fowler on 39 counts arising from his possession of the 
secret budget documents boeing earlier had pleaded guilty to 
receiving classified documents and agreed to pay 52 million in 
fines 
henry hudson the us attorney for the eastern district of 
virginia refused to comment after the trial on whether such 
practices continue in the defense community but he did indicate 
there were ongoing investigations 
hudson said fowlers trial sends a clear message it wont be 
tolerated 
the documents were known as planning programming and budget 
system documents and included detailed budget information for 
projects such as the strategic defense initiative longrange 
ballistic missiles awacs aircraft military satellite 
communications and expendable launch vehicles 
former defense secretary frank carlucci along with two former 
pentagon comptrollers a military adviser to former president 
reagan and a string of generals testified that the documents were 
never intended for release to defense contractors 
one general said the contractors had broken the rules of 
engagement by getting the documents and another said the 
documents provided the contractors with a significant advantage 
because it gave them a road map to future military spending plans 
but despite testimony that everyone knew the documents were 
offlimits to contractors they often were on the street within a 
day after being finalized 
fowler regularly logged the documents into the classified 
document log at boeings office in rosslyn va just outside 
washington during the eight years he worked for boeing those logs 
were inspected at least 13 times by defense investigative service 
inspectors 
the generals said that everyone knew the documents were 
restricted but the exception apparently was the trained 
bloodhounds of dis john bray fowlers attorney said during 
closing arguments 
bray insisted throughout the trial that the only reason fowler 
was prosecuted was because he refused to give investigators the 
names of his pentagon sources 
bray also argued that the defense departments industrial 
security manual was unclear and confusing as to the release and 
handling of the documents 
testimony indicated that employees from boeing honeywell 
bendix rca ibm gruman raytheon rockwell and martin marietta 
were involved in exchanging documents 
some witnesses said they knew they shouldnt have had the 
documents while others insisted they had followed proper 
procedures in getting them 
the documents were important when contractors were trying to 
decide whether to pump millions of their own dollars into 
developing projects that the pentagon may or may not go forward 
with 
one witness said the documents let the contractors know just how 
serious the government was about pursuing a project 
no one alleged during the trial that the documents were stolen 
in some midnight blackbag job at the pentagon 
bray said fowler refused to give the investigators the names of 
his sources because he knew they would be goners

a group of american congressman took chisels 
and hammers in hand saturday to chip away chunks of the berlin wall 
were all getting a piece of the wall said rep mike espy 
dmiss part of a sixmember congressional delegation visiting 
berlin 
a small crowd of smiling but puzzled germans and several 
uniformed west berlin police looked on shaking their heads 
youre looking for the us group would you believe theyre 
over there breaking down the wall one policeman told a reporter 
helplessly 
the delegation led by maryland democrat steny h hoyer met 
with east germanys interim president manfred gerlach a day earlier 
other members of the delegation included reps martin frost 
dtexas e clay shaw jr rfla lawrence smith dfla and 
benjamin cardin dmd 
on saturday they visited the west berlin side of the wall at 
potsdamer platz just a few minutes walk from brandenburg gate a 
couple of them chipped away pieces of the cement barrier for 
souvenirs 
as the chipping continued with espy energetically flailing at 
the wall with hammer and chisel spraying bits of cement all over 
the place hoyer spoke about the groups earlier visit in east 
berlin 
turning around to look back to where espy was banging away at 
the wall hoyer said the status of berlin was not discussed by 
us in any depth but it will be much more open the breaking of the 
wall is a symbol of that 
during the talks gerlach told the delegation he thinks soviet 
troops based in east germany could be withdrawn soon hoyer said 
he didnt give a real timetable for the withdrawal but did 
mention in two to three years hoyer said 
the soviet union has about 400000 troups based in east germany 
while the us forces in west germany number about 250000 
east german deputy foreign minister ernst krabatsch who also 
met with the delegation said he expects the united states to 
withdraw some of its forces 
the talks only lightly touched on discussion of reunification of 
the two german states he said 
we got the feeling that even the opposition in east germany 
is worried about how capitalism would be for the poor hoyer said 
east germanys social net is aimed at ensuring cradletograve 
security for its citizens with everyone supposedly gainfully 
employed 
hoyer said he sees no precedent for what the east germans have 
in mind for establishing a new political system something between 
communism and capitalism where theres no real model for them to 
follow 
the east germans are in a transitional period he added 
it will take time for them to master the situation 
most of the people we talked to said the borders wont change 
and im talking about east germanys border with poland but the 
wall will go only a few pieces will remain as a reminder hoyer 
predicted

more than 4500 activists 
saturday opened the largestever antiapartheid conference with 
hopes of finding new tactics to topple the white minority 
government 
black white indian and mixedrace members of about 2100 
organizations some of them ideological rivals in past years 
filled a university hall for the conference for a democratic future 
the regime has done its utmost to break us whipping our 
people declaring the states of emergency assassinating and 
detaining our leaders said the keynote speaker african national 
congress leader walter sisulu it has failed we gather here in 
greater numbers than ever before 
meanwhile in boksburg an industrial city near johannesburg 
police used tear gas to break up clashes between white extremists 
and scores of mixedrace people who came to picnic at a whitesonly 
park ten people were arrested police said 
boksburg has been beset by racial tension since farright 
candidates won control of the municipal council last year civic 
leaders in rieger park boksburgs mixedrace neighborhood 
organized the picnic to protest alleged assaults on mixedrace 
women by members of the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement 
the government chose to allow the antiapartheid conference even 
though many participants belong to groups banned under terms of the 
3yearold state of emergency a similar conference was prohibited 
last year shortly before it was to open 
the agenda for this years gathering included plans for mass 
protests and the possible formation of a new organization 
encompassing all the participating groups decisions reached at the 
conference were expected to be announced sunday 
your diversity is our strength sisulu said the gigantic 
task of this conference is to confirm the crucial importance of 
unity and to plan a program of mass action that will challenge 
the apartheid state 
sisulu 77 was freed unconditionally in october by president 
fw de klerk after 26 years in prison but sisulu had no praise 
for the president or the whitecontrolled governments offer to 
negotiate some form of black political rights that stops short of 
majority rule 
mr de klerk your back is to the wall sisulu said come 
stand on the floor of a conference like this submit to the 
processes of democracy 
sisulu acknowledged that de klerk during four months in power 
has moved faster toward reform than his predecessors but we know 
he has limits beyond which he will not go sisulu said 
we reiterate our commitment to one person one vote as the 
nonnegotiable principle on which a future south africa will be 
built he said 
de klerk has said he supports giving south africas 28 million 
blacks some form of power but not the concept of one person one 
vote the nations 5 million whites control the economy and the 
government 
observers from 19 countries were present including norways 
deputy foreign minister knut wollenback and a soviet professor 
irina filatova it was the first time in decades that a soviet 
attended an opposition meeting here and she was cheered loudly 
during brief remarks to the crowd 
also granted observer status was the antiapartheid democratic 
party which some blacks reject because it holds seats in south 
africas whitecontrolled parliament 
fullfledged delegates included white civil rights activists 
black businessmen and antiapartheid politicians from the 
semiautonomous black homelands 
black groups espousing the socalled africanist philosophy 
which views south african whites as settlers who should be ousted 
rejected invitations to attend africanist leaders said they were 
excluded from planning the conference and that they opposed the 
inclusion of the democratic party and the homeland parties 
also absent was inkatha the 15million member zulu 
organization inkatha opposes militant forms of protest but has 
been feuding violently with groups aligned with the african 
national congress 
thus most of the participants shared to some degree the general 
policies of the anc which espouses a nonracial philosophy and has 
said it would negotiate with the government if certain 
preconditions were met 
the bid for unity did receive a boost through the participation 
of the black consciousness movement which in the past has opposed 
the ancs nonracial approach

alan cranston strides into the mayors 
crowded office flashing a smile and shaking hands looking more 
like a confident senate leader than a politician in deep trouble 
but the 75yearold cranston a virtual institution in a state 
not known for cultural or political permanence faces the most 
serious crisis of his career as federal agents and a senate ethics 
committee investigate whether he improperly intervened with 
government regulators in the failure of lincoln savings and loan 
on friday a los angeles times statewide survey of 2046 voters 
reported that cranstons image had nosedived with 58 percent of 
those polled saying they had an unfavorable impression of the 
senator 
in october before the scandal had begun to snowball a similar 
poll reported cranston had a 56 percent favorable rating 
nonetheless other recent polls have shown the senator holding his 
own among voters 
cranston the majority whip and the senates no 2 democrat 
told a los angeles news conference friday that the times latest 
poll was the result of bad press and wild charges 
he also said again that he will seek a fifth term in 1992 
responding to a fellow democrat rep nancy pelosi who urged 
cranston to consider not running 
from everything i know about alan cranston he will be a 
candidate in 1992 said darry sragow who managed cranstons 
successful campaign against silicon valley entrepreneur ed zschau 
in 1986 this lincoln wont stop him 
but others arent so sure 
the senate ethics committee with an independent prosecutor is 
investigating allegations that cranston and four other senators 
improperly intervened with federal officials 2 years ago when they 
wanted to shut down lincoln savings and loan the irvinebased 
thrift 
lincoln was finally taken over this year and it is estimated 
the move will cost taxpayers up to 2 billion possibly the most 
expensive thrift institution failure in the nations history 
in addition some 23000 lincoln customers bought 250 million 
in worthless bonds purchases which critics say could have been 
avoided if government regulators had closed the thrift down at the 
time 
for the past two weeks the senator has crisscrossed the state 
in a whirlwind campaignstyle tour from the far north to san diego 
the visits include town hall meetings on crime prevention 
fundraisers to tap wealthy farmers and meetings with local 
officials who hope the lawmaker can cut red tape on federal 
earthquake relief it was such a visit that brought him to this 
quakeshaken city last week 
cranstons office said the senator had scheduled 37 events 
between nov 27 and dec 15 that kind of heavy scheduling rivals 
cranstons calendar during his 1986 campaign 
to repeated questions about whether his schedule was prompted by 
his problems with lincoln cranston has replied that he is taking 
advantage of the senate holiday recess to handle constituent needs 
especially in light of the october earthquake in the bay area 
responding to questions about his role in the burgeoning scandal 
surrounding the collapse of lincoln savings and his relationship to 
lincolns highspending owner charles h keating jr cranston 
says that he has done nothing wrong that he only asked federal 
officials to expedite their decisionmaking 
for gods sake if a senator is not supposed to speak to 
regulators who are on somebodys back and seek to make sure they 
are being treated fairly and to end the process what is a senator 
supposed to do cranston recently told the san jose mercury news 
thus far many people appear to believe him 
hes honest and hes smart its a lot of media hype said 
sandy smith 28 an oakland woman who happened to be in the city 
hall vicinity at the time of cranstons visit in azusa before 
another meeting smiling high school students waved to cranston and 
asked to have their pictures taken with him 
but cranston received 47000 in campaign donations from keating 
and solicited 850000 from keating on behalf of three taxexempt 
voter registration groups including one headed by his son kim 
on top of the lincoln savings probe cranston must deal with 
reports that fbi agents and the internal revenue service are 
studying the voter registration organizations to find out whether 
they attempted to register more democrats than republicans a 
violation for such taxexempt groups 
it makes my blood boil cranston told a los angeles news 
conference last week 
it began as a story about five senators in washington and it 
is rapidly becoming a story about a failure to act in sacramento 
said sragow who currently manages former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinsteins run for the democratic gubernatorial nomination 
next year 
the other us senators being probed are john mccain rariz 
donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio and dennis 
deconcini dariz 
state authorities also are investigating lincolns collapse 
trying to determine whether california regulators appointees of 
republican gov george deukmejian were pressured by keatings 
largess to go easy on lincoln 
keating his companies or his associates donated at least 
150000 to deukmejians political campaign

before mayorelect david dinkins named a police 
commissioner or a sanitation chief he hired a criminal defense 
lawyer 
dinkins who becomes new york citys first black mayor in three 
weeks hasnt had much time to enjoy his nov 7 election there was 
a celebration followed by a vacation in puerto rico followed by a 
federal investigation into a stock deal with his son 
cancel those honeymoon plans 
as a matter of fact the absence of a honeymoon may have a 
silver lining because no matter what happens how bad can it be 
look what ive been through dinkins said last week 
how bad can it get one columnist wrote of an eddie ii 
scenario in which dinkins resigns and the current mayor edward i 
koch wins a special election dinkins had dashed kochs hopes for 
a fourth term by beating him in the september democratic primary 
another columnist jimmy breslin likened dinkins to a 
horseplayer who holds a winning ticket only to see his number 
flashing on the parimutuel board indicating an inquiry 
around city hall city council president andrew stein next in 
line should a mayor step down is jokingly called mayorelectelect 
stein 
all this may seem a bit harsh since dinkins finances were 
picked over quite thoroughly during the campaign especially by his 
opponent former us attorney rudolph giuliani and still dinkins 
won 
so whats the fuss 
no law has been violated by david dinkins or his son said 
his lawyer charles stillman this is a simple transaction 
between a father and son that has been blown out of proportion 
others say it wasnt so simple 
dinkins acquired stock in 1972 in a fledgling company inner 
city broadcasting corp the company prospered and in 1985 when 
dinkins became manhattan borough president he transfered the stock 
to his son david jr 
he told a newspaper in 1986 that it was a gift and his failure 
to file a federal gift tax return became a campaign issue this 
year in response he produced a handwritten note from his son 
dated 1985 which said the stock was sold for 58000 plus 
interest due in 1991 
investigators are analyzing the paper and ink in the note to try 
to determine when it was written 
and if it was a sale it wasnt listed on his city financial 
disclosure forms 
dinkins son and the president of inner city refuse to reveal 
stock certificates or other documents that might prove when the 
stock was transferred 
another twist before selling it for 58000 dinkins valued the 
stock at 1 million on a state form he said the value was an 
estimate of what the company would bring if broken up and sold 
58000 was the market value 
none of which helps a man who had to listen to campaigntrail 
reminders that he didnt file tax returns from 196972 
dinkins defeated one federal prosecutor giuliani only to find 
another us attorney andrew maloney looking into his affairs 
stillman has called the investigation rudy giulianis last 
hurrah though giuliani denies having anything to do with the 
investigation by maloney maloney is based in brooklyn while 
giulianis base as us attorney was manhattan 
at most of his public appearances the mayorelect is greeted by 
reporters with questions dinkins famed patience is wearing thin 
though he says i recognize that when you seek or hold public 
office there seems to be a new set of rules 
meanwhile other problems cropped up 
the city department of investigation is investigating his votes 
on cable television franchises when he was borough president the 
doi is also looking into the stock deal 
newspapers carried stories pointing out that he had not named 
his cabinet as quickly as other mayors had dinkins deflected some 
of that by appointing eight top aides friday 
his new press secretary pulitzer prizewinner albert scardino 
admitted having given dinkins advice during the campaign while 
still working at the new york times contrary to the newspapers 
policy 
and in the background is giuliani now a private citizen but 
occasionally in the public eye he suggested that the city unite 
behind the mayorelect 
but he repeated something from the campaign that it would be 
very very difficult for a mayor or a prospective mayor to take 
on the responsibilities of government if he were under 
investigation 
just how difficult may be seen shortly

the leaders of the european community 
said saturday they support the reunification of east germany and 
west germany but that other european borders must remain untouched 
the 12member ec announced its support after west german 
chancellor helmut kohl said bonn would not try to reclaim 
territories the german states held before world war ii 
we have a responsibility toward our neighbors we want to do 
nothing destabilizing kohl said as the ec completed a twoday 
summit in this french city on the german border 
eventual reunification seems possible in light of the political 
upheaval in communist east germany but the prospect has raised 
fears that a large german state would upset the political and 
economic balance in europe bonns powerhouse economy already 
dominates the european community 
i am not afraid of reunification said french president 
francois mitterrand i consider it to be legitimate 
but he also said countries must abide by international treaties 
and other obligations unless they are prepared to create 
dangerous and unnecessary tensions 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain who failed to slow 
the ecs drive toward european economic integration still praised 
the outcome of the summit 
despite their disagreements she said the leaders showed they 
can act as the driving force for the development of the whole of 
europe at a turning point in the continents history 
added mitterrand henceforth there is no longer a europe in 
two parts acting in the shadows or at the initative of the two 
superpowers 
the 12 leaders issued a joint statement that said we seek the 
strengthening of the state of peace in europe in which the german 
people will regain its unity through free selfdetermination 
this process should take place peacefully and democratically 
reunification also should occur the statement said in the 
context of the 1975 helsinki accords on european cooperation and 
security which permanently fixed postwar borders 
the wording of the statement was agreed to after dutch prime 
minister ruud lubbers and italian prime minister giulio andreotti 
pressed kohl at a dinner friday night for his definition of 
reunification 
belgian and dutch sources demanding anonymity said kohl made 
clear that reunification applied only to the two existing german 
nations and not to germanspeaking areas in neighboring countries 
belgian prime minister wilfried martens said it was the most 
tense moment of an otherwise lowkey summit 
in their final statement the leaders said they had no intention 
of taking advantage of the upheavals in communist eastern europe 
they promised to build up the weakened economies of emerging 
democracies and agreed to set up a european development bank to 
help 
the ec remains the cornerstone of a new european architecture 
and a mooring for a future european equilibrium the 
statement said 
overriding mrs thatchers objections the other 11 leaders 
agreed to hold a special conference next december in italy to 
rewrite parts of their founding treaty of rome 
the changes would be needed to carry out a sweeping plan for 
economic and monetary union that would lead to a common european 
currency and system of central banks any treaty revisions would 
require unanimous approval 
mrs thatcher objected to monetary integration saying it would 
rob member countries of sovereign rights to decide national 
economic policy 
she also was alone in opposing the summits adoption of a 
social charter on employment and other worker rights mrs 
thatcher said the nonbinding charter would increase unemployment 
raise costs and make ec goods less competitive

the communist party is willing to surrender its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power the partys chief 
ideologue said saturday after a meeting of the policymaking 
central committee 
vadim a medvedev also said the party is prepared to change its 
status as it moves away from daytoday management of all aspects 
of soviet life 
president mikhail s gorbachevs political reforms have outpaced 
the 1977 soviet constitutional provision article 6 that makes the 
20millionmember party the guiding force in soviet society 
medvedev told reporters 
in general terms we are not clinging to article 6 in the form 
in which it is included in the constitution medvedev said it 
is not our point that it must be kept there at any cost 
the debate over the partys role reflects a building debate in 
the soviet union following fastmoving reforms in eastern europe 
where hungary has dropped the name communist from the partys name 
and is preparing for multiparty elections poland has installed a 
noncommunist prime minister and czechoslovakia and east germany 
have repealed the communists monopoly on power 
on thursday lithuania became the first soviet republic to drop 
a constitutional guarantee of communist power and approve a 
multiparty system 
the 250member central committee elevated the new party chief of 
the ukraine vladimir ivashko to membership on the ruling 
politburo it also named the recently appointed editor of pravda 
ivan frolov to the secretariat which handles the daytoday 
running of party business and discussed preparations for this 
weeks reconvening of the soviet congress 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and several other 
members of the congress of peoples deputies have called a brief 
general strike monday to show popular support for removing the 
party clause from the constitution 
medvedev echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by 
gorbachev said the partys goal is to move away from being the 
guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a 
political vanguard 
for more than seven decades the party has dictated everything 
from the direction of soviet foreign policy to how much collective 
farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of 
soap 
some of the wording of the current article 6 clashes with new 
plans for the partys development medvedev said 
the wide debate in soviet society over changing the partys 
legal status once an unthinkable topic for public debate here 
was not a taboo subject he said 
however he accused sakharov of unethnical conduct for calling a 
general strike 
we do not have to act under the pressure of emotion 
medvedev said we do not need an approach to the constitution 
that would focus on just one article without suggesting anything in 
the way of replacement 
he denounced what he called attempts to use the debate to fuel 
political speculation that would damage the party 
medvedev said remarks at the plenary session by gorbachev on the 
partys constitutional status would be printed in the staterun 
press on sunday 
ivashko was promoted to the politburo succeeding his 
predecessor longtime ukrainian party boss vladimir v 
shcherbitsky who was retired at the last central committee meeting 
in september 
two newly named party chiefs in moscow and leningrad the 
countrys two largest cities failed to win seats on the partys 
ruling body in contrast to longstanding practice 
however medvedev said boris gidaspov of leningrad and yuri 
prokofiev of moscow had been named to the newly created party 
bureau for the russian federation which will be chaired by 
gorbachev and provide a separate party leadership for the countrys 
largest republic 
as often happens before such plenary meetings the session was 
preceded by rumors of a shakeup in the leadership and this time 
there was expected to be open division over whether to annul the 
partys legal monopoly on power 
the latest rumors were bolstered by the increasing difficulty 
soviet communists have had preventing their oncemonolithic party 
from breaking into factions 
in leningrad about 40000 rankandfile communists rallied last 
week to support gorbachev in the face of what they said was a bid 
by party conservatives to oust him and his allies including 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and alexander n yakovlev

furnish a place of employment which was free from recognized 
hazards that were causing or likely to cause death the second

the us department of housing and 
urban development has revoked its ban on religious decorations in 
federally funded shelters and will allow a salvation army homeless 
shelter to display a picture of jesus 
the salvation army chapter in new britain refused for months to 
take down the picture despite a hud policy against such displays 
but a hud official said friday that the agency has amended its 
policy 
essentially it means that if there is no other indication of 
religious influence religious decorations will be permitted 
said robert kenison an associate general counsel for hud in 
washington 
kenison said the new britain controversy was partly responsible 
for the change 
in may hud told salvation army officials they could not keep a 
9635 grant for the shelter because of the picture the money was 
not returned but the salvation army did not apply for another 
grant 
under the new policy which is still subject to congressional 
review the picture will not diminish the shelters chance of 
getting federal money in the future but other regulations 
including one that forbids promoting religious beliefs still will 
apply kenison said 
salvation army officials welcomed the change saying it will 
allow shelters with religious affiliations to preserve their 
principles 
to ask them to compromise their religious beliefs because 
there is some part of government funds in the program seems a 
little harsh said margaret doughty social services secretary 
for the salvation armys eastern chapters

the son of the late russian author 
boris pasternak received his fathers nobel literature prize 
saturday 31 years after it was awarded 
soviet officials forced the writer to refuse the prize when it 
was awarded to him in 1958 for his celebrated novel doctor 
zhivago he died in 1960 
a few days ago soviet authorities granted his 66yearold son 
yevgeny pasternak permission to travel to stockholm to collect the 
prize 
never ever did i think this could happen but the 
perestroika is so fast sometimes pasternaks son was quoted as 
saying by the national news agency tt perestroika is soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs program of political and social 
reform 
the prize ceremony was held in the nobel hall in stockholms 
bourse house 
pasternak completed doctor zhivago in 1955 but the epic of 
upheaval in 20th century russia was banned in his homeland it was 
first published in italy in 1957 and only last year in the soviet 
union 
this is a worthy ending of a tragedy and i am very 
happy the writers son told the audience when he received the 
nobel medal 
in the soviet union pasternak devotes himself to a museum built 
in peredelkino outside moscow to honor his fathers memory

president alfredo cristiani on 
saturday proposed renewing truce talks with leftist guerrillas on 
dec 20 if they stop attacking civilian targets 
cristianis proposal made on the eve of a summit of the five 
central american presidents appeared to be a concession to get the 
rebels back to the bargaining table 
he also offered a 250000 reward for information leading to the 
conviction of the killers of six jesuit priests and two others who 
were slain nov 16 
cristiani told a news conference his rightist government is 
willing to renew the process of dialogue on condition the farabundo 
marti national liberation front publicly pledges by dec 15 to end 
all terrorist actions that directly or indirectly affect the 
civilian population 
since cristiani began his fiveyear term as president on june 1 
two rounds of truce talks in mexico and costa rica have ended in 
deadlock because of government insistence that the rebels disarm 
immediately and join el salvadors political life 
cristiani said saturday that he did not expect the rebels to 
surrender their weapons while talks are under way if they want 
to remain on san salvador volcano thats all right but they 
should not attack the civilian population he said 
he said a meeting between his usbacked government and rebel 
representatives could be held in caracas venezuela to arrange a 
ceasefire and negotiate peace by feb 15 the rebels then would be 
expected to join the political process cristiani said 
when we speak of dialogue obviously there are issues that 
have to be negotiated and discussed but the fmln has positions 
that are absurd and others that can be discussed he said 
referring to the rebel organization by its spanish initials 
if the rebels reject his proposal the armed forces will 
continue to confront them militarily he said 
the rebels have accused the government of not negotiating in 
good faith 
they attacked the defense ministry compound in san salvador with 
mortars in october then canceled a third round of talks planned 
for nov 2021 in caracas when a leftist union hall and the offices 
of a human rights group were bombed apparently in retaliation 
on nov 11 the rebels launched the fiercest offensive in their 
decadeold war the offensive continued sporadically last week 
mostly in the capital 
attacks friday cut power supplies in san salvador and left the 
city hall in flames in el transito 75 miles southeast of the 
capital 
an estimated 2000 people have been killed in the latest round 
of fighting more than 72000 people mostly civilians have died 
since the war began 
since nov 11 up to now they the rebels have not attacked 
any military objective only civilian targets cristiani said 
he guaranteed a 250000 cash reward safety and immunity for 
anyone providing information or evidence leading to the conviction 
of those responsible for killing the priests their cook and her 
teenage daughter 
fellow jesuits have said government soldiers entered the 
university campus where the priests lived roused them from bed 
shot them to death and mutilated the bodies 
a maid at a nearby house now in florida for her own safety 
claimed she saw the soldiers enter the jesuits house and heard the 
shots 
any person or persons who against their will or unwittingly 
took part indirectly in this who provides relevant information that 
can clarify this crime will be awarded the money cristiani 
said 
he said his government has asked for help from the fbi scotland 
yard and police organizations in spain and canada

lester and nancy haley were the best of 
neighbors always willing to join a party do a favor or check on a 
friend but their concern for a neighbor led to their deaths after 
they stumbled upon her killers police say 
when haley noticed ida doughertys newspaper lying in her 
driveway last monday he and another neighbor verna horne wanted 
to make sure the 72yearold woman was all right they let 
themselves in with a key and encountered a teenage couple who had 
stayed in the house after burglarizing it police say mrs 
dougherty was already dead 
a short time later mrs haley grew worried about her husbands 
absence and went to the dougherty home where she too encountered 
a gunman hours later the 69yearold mrs haley and her 
87yearold husband a retired architect would be shot to death 
and mrs horne 68 would barely escape with her life 
tyrone baker 19 was charged thursday with murder in the deaths 
of the haleys and mrs dougherty his girlfriend lisa ann 
pfannenstiel 18 was charged with murder in mrs doughertys 
death both of them face a variety of kidnapping burglary and 
robbery charges they have not entered pleas 
weve had three individuals who were the epitome of 
respectability all their lives said police spokesman lt bud 
brooks all were professional people with good educations and 
they were tragically murdered by high school dropouts who were 
going down the wrong track of life 
the suspects did not know the victims the crimes were random 
acts of violence said brooks 
they picked out mrs doughertys house by happenstance he 
said it was a burglary they had tried several other houses and 
this one apparently was easier to get into 
the neighborhood where the victims lived falls short of wealthy 
but surpasses comfortable older homes wear holiday trim of red 
ribbon and green wreaths and reflect their owners pride through 
fresh paint and tidy yards 
colby hamilton who lived across the street from the haleys 
called them good friends and good neighbors theyd always do 
what they could to help you out in any way 
court and police records outline a chain of events dictated by 
chance investigators said they determined what happened through 
interviews with mrs horne and ms pfannenstiel who is cooperating 
with police 
after breaking into mrs doughertys house late sunday night 
investigators said the suspects robbed the retired real estate 
agent of 70 suffocated her and stuffed her body in the trunk of a 
car before dumping it in a rural area of neighboring douglas county 
the two returned to her house and opened her wrapped christmas 
packages looking for things to steal they spent the night in the 
house and were surprised when the neighbors let themselves in to 
check on mrs dougherty the next day 
ms pfannenstiel said baker alone drove the haleys and mrs 
horne to the same area where mrs doughertys body had been dumped 
during the drive the three neighbors offered to give baker 1000 
each to let them go an offer he appeared to consider 
but baker ordered them to lie on an embankment while he went to 
make sure mrs dougherty was dead police said 
the three ran into the woods and mrs horne volunteered to go 
for help while the other two hid she found her way to safety 
unhurt but on tuesday the haleys bodies were found each had 
been shot at least twice and mrs doughertys body was found 
wednesday covered with leaves 
the two suspects were in custody saturday bail for baker was 
set at 500000 and ms pfannenstiels at 200000 police said 
neither has a criminal record although bakers drivers license had 
been suspended since february and ms pfannenstiel had a history of 
running away from home 
the haleys both widowed were married in 1975 retirement for 
them meant visiting neighbors socializing with friends and for 
haley playing golf 
they were the model of family life the rev charles erb 
said at the memorial service friday at first congregational church 
there was much more to them than their last few hours of life 
the couple first met at the church while it was being remodeled 
and members sat on folding chairs instead of pews 
by the grace of god they sat next to each other erb told 
the crowd of about 400 mourners and on that fateful day when the 
congregation joined hands as a sign of peace they held hands and 
they fell in love

shot down by rebel forces outside baghlan city on the 200mile 
salang highway that is the supply line between kabul the afghan 
capital and the soviet union 
rahim said the two sovietsupplied planes were downed by rebels 
who captured hasantal a town near baghlan 115 miles north of 
kabul 
he said the fighting in northern afghanistan belies president 
najibs claims that rebel field commanders have made political 
deals with the marxist government 
najib is claiming that fighting is just going on in the south 
and along the border around jalalabad because of interference 
from pakistan said rahim but the fighting in the north proves 
that its not true and that the mujahedeen rebels have not 
reached any agreement with the government 
the rebels in 11 years of fighting successive marxist 
governments have been unable to capture a major city but control 
much of the countryside 
there were predictions the kabul government would collapse after 
the soviet union withdrew the last of its troops in february 
the soviets sent troops into afghanistan in 1979 to help the 
government

when kenneth warner left the hospital 
last week he wore a red sweatshirt that proudly said my wife 
gave me her heart and all her love now she gave me a kidney 
warner and his wife of 22 years roseanne timmie warner 
underwent a rare spousetospouse transplant 
roseanne warner 46 gave one of her kidneys to her 47yearold 
husband after becoming impatient with a shortage of available 
cadaver organs for transplant the nov 29 operation was made 
possible by a rare match in the tissues of an unrelated living 
donor and recipient doctors said 
the couple is recovering well at their home in this washington 
suburb physicians said two of their children kathleen 12 and 
ken jr 15 are documenting their progress on home videos 
our big concern was that the kidney would function properly 
kenneth warner said 
with antirejection drugs increasing the chance of survival for 
people receiving kidneys from donors who are not blood relatives 
many doctors view spousal transplants as a way to shorten the wait 
for transplants 
as of monday there were 280 people in the washington area on 
the waiting list for kidney transplants according to the 
washington regional transplant consortium 
most transplant organs come from cadavers but fewer are 
available because of better care for people who a few years ago 
would have died from their injuries said jimmy light chairman of 
transplantation at the washington hospital center where the 
warners had their surgery 
of those who do die and are medically suitable for organ 
harvesting only about 50 percent of their families give consent 
compared with 83 percent two years ago 
kenneth warner had those statistics to consider after both his 
kidneys failed in may warner a maintenance supervisor for the 
national security agency was given kidney dialysis treatments 
three times a week but didnt want to stay on dialysis for the 
rest of his life 
he decided he wanted a transplant kidney and set christmas as 
his personal deadline 
the couples oldest daughter kelly ann a 19yearold college 
student volunteered her kidney but roseanne warner recalled 
discussing a spousal organ transplant with a doctor 
the warners woke up on a saturday morning and i said why 
cant i give you a kidney the secretary said 
in a series of sophisticated tissuetyping tests to determine 
the kind of match roseanne warners kidney would make with her 
husbands body doctors determined that of the six tissue types 
the couple matched on three 
the chances of that happening between husband and wife are about 
one in 2000 light said

waving banners and chanting inocente 
supporters of william lozano rallied to his defense saturday and 
raised funds to appeal the suspended miami policemans manslaughter 
conviction 
lozano speaking mostly in spanish to a crowd of more than 300 
in miamis little havana section said he and fellow officers 
appreciate the outcry from the hispanic community after a jury 
thursday convicted him in the deaths of two black men 
the incident provoked three days of innercity rioting last 
january that left one man dead and more than 1 million in damage 
we want a system of justice not one of politics the 
colombianborn lozano said his supporters have claimed that the 
dade county circuit court jurys decision was influenced by fear of 
another riot 
accompanied by his children and wife who is also a miami police 
officer lozano said the verdict would have a chilling effect on 
law enforcement 
police now wonder if they shoot someone in the line of duty 
will they be the next ones to go to jail he told the rally at 
wocnam radio which has joined other spanishlanguage stations in 
raising money for an appeal 
later lozano appeared with several hundred supporters at a 
rally in front of the miami police departments headquarters 
lozano 31 is scheduled to be sentenced jan 24 on two counts 
of manslaughter for the deaths of motorcyclist clement lloyd and 
his passenger allan blanchard in miamis overtown section he 
faces up to 45 years his attorneys say they will appeal 
during the sevenweek trial broadcast live on local television 
and radio defense attorneys claimed lozano shot in selfdefense 
prosecutors alleged he could have avoided the motorcycle 
in miamis black neighborhoods the verdict was celebrated as a 
hallmark of justice 
but along the main street of little havana signs in english and 
spanish read lozano is 100 percent innocent and where would 
you be without police 
people are calling this justice but that is impossible to 
believe said lozanos mother zoila lozano look at the people 
out here to say that a police officer may go to jail for doing his 
job 
lozano is seen as a scapegoat in a system that is too worried 
about more violence from blacks said george gonzalez who joined 
the rally outside the station there is a mentality among the 
latins that a cop can do no wrong if he is out fighting bad guys 
nearby motorists honked horns in support and dropped cash and 
checks into wastebaskets and hats bearing prolozano bumper 
stickers 
this is peoples way of saying that justice has not been 
served said lozanos sisterinlaw berta 
inside the station a sign was posted with an address for a 
lozano defense fund a petition also was circulated calling for 
dade circuit judge joseph farina to allow lozano to remain free on 
bond until his appeal 
there were no immediate estimates of how much money was raised 
saturday 
cops are asking themselves now what is right said manuel 
perez president of the florida hispanic police officers 
association this is not they way it should be 
police chief perry anderson said earlier that the citys legal 
department is reviewing lozanos termination order which could be 
issued this week state law requires dismissal of any officer 
convicted of a felony

leaders of a crippling weeklong 
strike of public workers declared victory saturday after agreeing 
to end their walkout in exchange for a government pledge to seek 
loans to pay back wages 
after meeting for an hour late friday with union leaders prime 
minister herbert blaize promised to convene parliament on thursday 
to seek its permission to request bank loans to pay workers 93 
million in promised wages 
public workers union president lauret clarkson said saturday 
that civil servants gained a great overwhelming victory in the 
dispute with blaize 
the strike idled about 7000 public workers virtually all the 
caribbean islands teachers and post office port customs and 
other public employees 
it began dec 1 after blaize said he could not make the 
payments the money represents unpaid wage increases from 1987 to 
1989 
blaize said the funds were unavailable since 1987 the 
government has borrowed heavily from local banks to curb a growing 
budget deficit 
the strike paralyzed virtually all government agencies 
including key revenue earners such as customs the treasury and the 
post office 
it was widely believed blaize had avoided reconvening parliament 
for fear he would face a noconfidence vote forcing him to resign 
a split within the governing national party in august left him with 
a minority 
according to clarkson blaize said several officials would leave 
the island sunday to raise the money in miami and london

gov michael s dukakis signed legislation 
saturday banning assault weapons in boston saying hed like to see 
greater gun control across massachusetts and the nation 
semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons are designed for one 
purpose and one purpose only dukakis said they are designed 
to kill other human beings as fast as possible 
the ban prohibits the sale of six militarystyle weapons and 
requires anyone who already legally owns one to register it with 
the police commissioner it also bans certain shotguns and rifles 
this is a message to drug dealers and gangs bent on violence 
that we simply will not tolerate these weapons or the violence or 
destruction that they bring the governor said at the signing 
ceremony at an innercity police station 
police commissioner francis roache said the ban is not a panacea 
for bostons drug or gang problems but is an important step in the 
communitys response to violence 
its going to be a long and painful process until we fully 
come to the realization that were the most violent society in the 
world and we have an attitude problem roache said so we begin 
like this one city changing laws and changing attitudes 
the new law gives the commissioner power to place any firearm on 
the list of proscribed weapons for 30 days while a board provided 
for in the legislation decides whether to permanently add the gun 
to the list 
the measure began as a homerule petition from the city council 
in the spring the legislature approved it late last month after a 
lengthy debate 
michael yacino president of the gun owners action league 
described it as the toughest firearms regulation in the state but 
maintains it will do nothing to stop the gangrelated violence it 
targets 
gang and drugrelated slayings are rarely committed by licensed 
gun owners yacino argued and more homicides are committed with 
handguns than assault weapons 
mayor raymond l flynn said tapping the communitys outrage over 
violence turned the tide in the legislature 
we probably had more community meetings and discussions about 
lobbying state legislators for this legislation than any other 
flynn said lawmakers offices were flooded with phone calls in 
support of the bill 
its not enough to do it just for boston its time we did it 
for all of massachusetts and all of america dukakis said 
these are weapons that belong on the battlefield not in crack 
houses or in the neighborhoods 
the law bans the sale or illegal posession of the ak47 
semiautomatic rifle the uzi semiautomatic rifle the fnfl 
semiautomatic rifle the fnfnc semiautomatic rifle the steyr aug 
semiautomatic rifle and the sks semiautomatic rifle 
it also bans all shotguns with revolving cylinders and 
semiautomatic rifles with fixed magazine capacities of more than 10 
rounds as well as modifications of any proscribed weapons 
the first offense under the ban carries a 1000 fine 
subsequent offenses carry penalties up to 2 years in jail 
the bush administration imposed an import ban on assaulttype 
rifles in july but the ban didnt affect guns already owned by 
americans or similar weapons produced by us companies 
california in may became the first state to enact restrictions 
on the possession or sale of such guns the law was prompted by the 
shooting of 35 people at a stockton calif schoolyard by a gunman 
with an ak47 
cities and counties in georgia illinois indiana new jersey 
new york ohio colorado and texas also have enacted ordinances 
with certain restictions

when a newspaper published a purported 
inventory of the governors mansion including 156 chairs six 
television sets and 26 sofas a miffed gov rudy perpich and his 
wife lola responded by proposing that the state sell off the 
place besides his office says there are a mere 113 chairs and 15 
sofas 
in a huff at what she called criticism of her familys 
lifestyle mrs perpich said thursday that she and the governor 
will ask the 1990 legislature to sell the mansion and its contents 
and donate the proceeds to help the homeless 
ray bohn perpichs spokesman said friday the attorney 
generals office was asked to determine if a sale of the 1910 
mansion is possible perpich said saturday he was still awaiting 
that ruling 
key lawmakers say they would oppose such a sale even if they 
were agreeable the deed under which the mansion was donated to the 
state in 1965 stipulates the mansion be demolished if not in public 
use 
lynn anderson perpichs chief of staff says the perpiches are 
aware that the mansion could face destruction if the property is 
sold 
the dispute grew out of a story in tuesdays st paul pioneer 
press dispatch that included an inventory of items in the mansion 
and criticism from senate minority leader duane benson about the 
perpiches lavish lifestyle 
then on thursday mrs perpich accused the newspaper and senate 
republicans of waging a campaign to vilify her family and said 
she would ask the minnesota historical society and the minneapolis 
institute of art to immediately remove all artwork and furniture on 
loan to the mansion 
on friday perpich fueled his longstanding feud with the paper 
over coverage of his family by releasing an inventory of 
furnishings in the mansion 
these figures differ dramatically from those published in your 
newspaper report perpich said in a letter to the editor mrs 
perpich also said the newspaper had greatly inflated the amount 
of furniture in the residence 
the article and an illustration indicated the mansion contained 
156 chairs 28 cabinets 23 lamps 83 artifacts six television 
sets 26 sofas 81 tables 16 rugs and seven mirrors the article 
quoting the governors residence council put the furnishings 
value at 300000 
the inventory released friday lists 113 chairs six cabinets 23 
lamps six television sets 15 sofas 59 tables 12 rugs and six 
mirrors in storage are 42 chairs 11 sofas 22 tables four rugs 
and one mirror many of them put aside because they are too worn 
out to use perpich said in the letter the list did not give an 
estimate of worth 
the renovation of the 20room english tudor mansion became a 
serious project after perpichs 1982 election although mrs 
perpich originally said she would prefer living in a townhouse not 
the mansion she reconsidered under public pressure and began a 
campaign to raise private funds for renovation 
some 13 million has been raised for the mansion in the past 10 
years most of it since perpich took office 
sam grabarski chairman of the governors residence council 
said friday that request to have artwork loaned to the mansion 
taken out would have to be made by the 15member council of which 
mrs perpich is a voting member but not the only voting member 
the loan agreement is an agreement that is held between the 
museums and the governors residence council itself not the 
governors residence he said 
the first time the perpiches moved into the mansion was in late 
1976 after perpich then lieutenant governor took over when 
thengov wendell anderson resigned to fill walter mondales 
vacancy in the us senate the perpiches moved out after he was 
defeated in his first race for governor in 1978

members of the mount gretna polar bear club 
will have somewhere to go when its time to go jump in a lake 
their new years day tradition was put in jeopardy when the 
owners of conewago lake said the event couldnt be held there for 
the ninth year because of insurance liability concerns 
so the bluelip brigade began their search for a new site 
the turning point came when a television station did a feature 
story on the lakeless polar bears and happened to interview 
stephan boyer an owner of willow springs sportsmens club who 
suggested his club 
in past years up to 500 weatherdefying people have shown up 
and 100 have taken the plunge 
willow springs 12 miles from the former site is a flooded 
quarry known for its scuba diving among sunken vehicles and heavy 
equipment 
but it also has a shallow end which is necessary for polar 
bears who dont mind taking an arctic dip as long as they can keep 
their footing 
organizer gordon sheetz said the water at springfed willow 
springs is about 45 degrees in january about 10 degrees higher 
than conewago lake consequently bathers are unlikely to confront 
a sheet of ice 
cutting through the ice always makes it more interesting

a state board recommended no disciplinary action 
against four psychologists who speculated about why kitty dukakis 
drank rubbing alcohol 
the board of registration of psychologists said in a statement 
friday that it ended its investigation after finding that the 
counselors provided satisfactory explanations for their comments 
the board whose members are appointed by gov michael s 
dukakis said the psychologists had not violated ethical principles 
by commenting on the governors wife without being directly 
involved in her case 
in a nov 10 story in the boston globe psychologists barry dym 
david kantor carolynn maltas and esther shapiro said mrs dukakis 
appeared to suffer from a common problem in which one partner in a 
marriage breaks down because he or she carries all the emotional 
burdens of the relationship 
shapiro told the globe on friday that in the wake of the 
inquiry she hoped to develop new guidelines on how psychologists 
should talk to reporters 
the boards principles currently state that psychologists have a 
duty not to violate anyones civil rights and to avoid 
misrepresentation through sensationalism and superficiality 
one of the things i was concerned about was that there would 
be a terrible chilling effect shapiro said i want us to 
figure out how to be accessible as possible as a field because 
public education about emotional matters is as important a service 
as psychologists can serve 
part of the problem shapiro said was that a therapists 
comments about common behavior patterns could be mistakenly 
interpreted as a clinical diagnosis 
mrs dukakis who has a history of depression and substance 
abuse was hospitalized nov 6 after drinking a small amount of 
rubbing alcohol she has since been released and has appeared in 
public several times

communists are likely to lose power in 
estonia and latvia in local elections sunday according to polls 
taken in the baltic republics 
the past comes to an end today the grassroots prodemocracy 
peoples front proclaimed in latvia in an preelection appeal 
asking voters to wrest power from the communists 
results will be carefully watched in moscow since the two 
soviet republics are the first of 15 to hold elections for 
municipal councils under new rules allowing voters a choice of 
candidates 
the vote also coincides with rising debate over the role of 
communists on saturday the national partys chief ideologue 
vadim a medvedev said the party is willing to surrender its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power 
on thursday the legislature of the third baltic republic 
lithuania voted to revoke the constitutional clause guaranteeing 
communist supremacy in society and political life 
in estonia more than 9000 candidates are vying to fill 4200 
seats in city and rural councils throughout the soviet unions 
least populous republic with 16 million inhabitants 
polls show the most popular candidates are environmentalists or 
greens with ethnic estonians favoring the peoples front and the 
russians favoring workers associations with close links to 
communists 
but if both ethnic and nonethnic estonians are considered 
our opinion polls indicate 50 percent support for the greens by 
far the best support the communists would get under 10 percent 
said juhan kivirahk from estonias department of public opinion 
and market research 
he predicted that power in the estonian capital of tallinn would 
shift from communists to an electoral union of 10 groups including 
environmentalists and the estonian peoples front 
noncommunists are running on platforms ranging from 
environmental protection and economic reform to total independence 
for this baltic state which was absorbed into the soviet union 
through a 1939 pact with nazi germany 
a subtle issue only quietly discussed is the tension between 
ethnic estonians and immigrants mainly russians comprising about 
40 percent of the republics population 
i cannot openly declare that i am antirussian but every 
estonian knows which candidate is against the russians ain 
roopson an independent candidate said in an interview 
in october estonias parliament under kremlin pressure 
abandoned an attempt to impose residency requirements for voters 
but it retained the requirement that a candidate in the election 
must have lived in estonia for at least two years 
in latvia imans daudis a secretary of the top government 
executive body the presidium called sundays vote the first 
election conducted in the situation of real political pluralism 
only 34 percent of the candidates in the republic of more than 
25 million people are members of the communist party while 32 
percent are members of the peoples front 
in march elections for the new soviet parliament peoples front 
candidates trounced partybacked candidates in races across all 
three baltic states

tiny sarina jones was recovering well saturday 
after undergoing the nations second livingdonor liver transplant 
but the 15monthold faces a tougher battle recuperating in the 
next few weeks hospital officials said 
sarina remained in critical but stable condition saturday 
evening the day after doctors at the university of chicago medical 
center removed the left lobe of 20yearold father robert jones 
liver and implanted it in the infant jones condition was upgraded 
from critical but stable to serious but stable 
sarinas response since the 7hour operation was completed just 
after 1030 pm friday has been literally outstanding 
hospital spokeswoman mary fetsch said saturday she said jones 
also came back out of surgery just remarkably well 
jones a drywall installer from the memphis tenn area could 
be moved from the intensive care unit by sunday ms fetsch said 
dr christoph broelsch the transplant surgeon who performed the 
operation said the surgery was very difficult in part because 
doctors had to remove signs of a bacterial infection from the 
child they worried it could linger and infect the new organ 
ms fetch said doctors will closely monitor sarina during the 
next 24 to 48 hours for signs of infection or other complications 
after that the next hurdle shell have to overcome is within 
the next seven to 10 days when any signs of rejection of the new 
liver would begin to show up ms fetsch said 
if she overcomes those two hurdles the spokeswoman said the 
next step is to get her out of the hospital and that could be 
anywhere from four to eight weeks from now 
and once we get her to that point we feel that the next hurdle 
she has to overcome is the oneyear to threeyear mark where she 
doesnt experience any rejection or complications ms fetsch 
said and then we feel like shell be pretty much home free for 
the rest of her life 
dr peter whitington director of pediatric transplant services 
at the university of chicago medical center said doctors also want 
to see the youngster gain weight he said earlier in the week that 
sarina was every bit as malnourished as an ethiopian refugee 
because of her condition and infection 
sarina has suffered since birth from a usually fatal disorder 
called biliary atresia 
the congenital disorder also afflicted 21monthold alyssa 
smith who on nov 27 received part of her mothers liver at u of c 
in the first livingdonor liver transplant in the united states 
alyssa of schertz texas near san antonio was in serious but 
stable condition saturday evening with her liver function 
rapidly improving toward normal and no signs of her body 
rejecting the transplant ms fetsch said 
her mother teresa smith a 29yearold schoolteacher was 
released from the hospital thursday on the arm of her husband john 
l smith the couple planned to visit their daughter during her 
recovery and were staying at a nearby ronald mcdonald house a 
place for families of children hospitalized away from home

the department of energy is 
investigating a report that a structural engineer was fired after 
concluding that an earthquake could cause the walls to collapse at 
the departments y12 nuclear weapons plant a doe official 
confirmed saturday 
the engineer paul nestel says other engineers then rewrote his 
study to say the walls of the oak ridge plant were sturdy enough 
the revised report was based on spurious calculations that 
would be obvious to any engineer with earthquake experience 
nestel told the washington post he called the nuclear plant built 
near the end of world war ii an example of third world 
construction 
nestel was recruited in july by lockwood greene inc of oak 
ridge to conduct the earthquake study for martin marietta energy 
systems inc which operates the oak ridge plant for the energy 
department the post reported saturday 
i cannot comment on the study because it is still being 
drafted said steve wyatt a spokesman for the doe facilities 
i cannot comment on mr nestel because he is not a doe employee 
what i can comment on is that we are looking into the matter 
wyatt said a twoperson internal panel has been appointed to 
review the case beginning next week the review should take about a 
week he said 
nestel reported sept 25 that the unreinforced clay tile walls 
of the main building of the y12 plant would give way if struck by 
an earthquake with a lateral force of 12 percent of gravity well 
below the 19 percent used nationwide as the design basis for 
quake vulnerability studies 
san franciscos marina district was heavily damaged in the 
october earthquake by a force of 15 percent nestel told the post 
nestel a californian said the new madrid fault altered the 
course of the mississippi river when it last slipped early in the 
19th century the earthquake created reelfoot lake in western 
tennessee 
if it slipped again it would certainly destroy those walls 
he said 
although oak ridge is in east tennessee and the fault is several 
hundred miles west the shock of eastern earthquakes is spread over 
a wider area 
by oct 30 nestel told the post engineers with lockwood greene 
and martin marietta had met to discuss his findings he said they 
then reported to doe that the walls have the capacity to 
withstand the designbasis earthquake 
nestel was fired nov 3 
wyatt said the doe review into nestels allegations would 
include the circumstances of his firing and the report itself 
were bringing in one individual on the panel who has a 
knowledge of seismic studies to take an independent look at the 
whole affair wyatt said we cant make any judgments until 
weve reviewed all the facts of the matter

president mikhail s gorbachev told the communist 
leadership saturday he is ready to modify or abandon the partys 
constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping 
political reforms 
in the framework of this process any article of the 
constitution can be the subject of modification or be excluded 
this fully refers as well to article 6 gorbachev told the 
partys policymaking central committee meeting 
article 6 in the 1977 constitution makes the 20millionmember 
communist party the leading light and guiding force in soviet 
society 
the debate over the partys role reflects the reforms in eastern 
europe where hungary has dropped the word communist from the 
partys name and is preparing for multiparty elections poland has 
installed a noncommunist prime minister and czechoslovakia and 
east germany have repealed the communists monopoly on power 
on thursday lithuania became the first of the 15 constituent 
soviet republics to drop a constitutional guarantee of communist 
power and approve a multiparty system 
the central committee meeting was to prepare for the new session 
of the congress of peoples deputies the national parliament that 
convenes tuesday 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and several other 
members of parliament have called for a brief general strike monday 
to show support for removing the constitutional clause assuring the 
communist party of power 
vadim a medvedev the partys chief ideologue said sakharovs 
call for a strike violates the ethical standards of a legislator in 
view of parliaments appeal to refrain from strikes that could 
deepen the countrys economic crisis 
gorbachev in a clear reference to sakharov said those 
demanding the urgent revocation of article 6 were trying to 
demoralize communists lower their activity at a turning point in 
perestroika his program for restructuring the soviet economy 
and society 
we must not create a new constitution until we have more or 
less clearly defined the contours of the renewed social mechanism 
the optimal structure of organs of power and adminstration the 
order of interaction of political forces gorbachev said 
according to a text provided by the official tass news agency 
the 58yearold leader used the phrase political forces 
instead of political parties but he clearly was referring to a 
role for groups not controlled by the communists 
gorbachev called for patience in rewriting the constitution 
comrades lets not forget that this is already the fifth 
constitution under soviet power he said this time lets try 
to create a law that country can live with for a long time 
tass said gorbachev opposes a reassessment of the partys 
constitutional guarantees until preparations begin for a nationwide 
party congress in october 1990 
there is no need to speed up this process now gorbachev 
said of sakharovs effort to raise the issue in parliament 
tass said the 250member central committee agreed with gorbachev 
on what parliament should discuss 
in other developments at the committee session 
medvedev speaking at a news conference at the end of the 
central committee meeting said gorbachevs perestroika program was 
criticized during the 10hour meeting by conservative and 
dogmatic speakers 
he said gorbachev did not come under personal attack and he 
attributed the argments over reform to the exacerbated situation 
in the country and the need for fast progress 
the central committee endorsed a program to revive the 
faltering staterun economy and to prepare the 13th fiveyear plan 
for 199195 
it elevated the new party chief of the ukraine vladimir 
ivashko to membership on the ruling politburo it also named the 
recently appointed editor of the communist party newspaper pravda 
ivan frolov to the secretariat which handles the daytoday 
running of party business 
echoing a policy announced more than a year ago by gorbachev 
medvedev said the partys goal is to move away from being the 
guiding nucleus of the whole government structure to becoming a 
political vanguard 
for more than seven decades the party has dictated everything 
from the direction of soviet foreign policy to how much collective 
farms should produce and how much state stores charge for a bar of 
soap 
ivashko 57 became the 12th member of the politburo succeeding 
ukrainian party boss vladimir v shcherbitsky who was retired at 
the last central committee plenary meeting in september 
the new party chiefs in moscow and leningrad the countrys 
largest cities were not given politburo seats in contrast to the 
usual practice 
but medvedev said leningrad chief boris gidaspov and yuri 
prokofiev of moscow were named to the new 16member party bureau 
for the russian federation which will be headed by gorbachev and 
provide a separate party leadership for the countrys largest 
republic 
medvedev a politburo member indicated the kremlin would not 
try to stop the lithuanian communist party from declaring 
independence from moscow at a congress opening dec 18 
there are no problems that our party can fail to cope with 
medvedev said 
medvedev said the central committee will meet again in january 
to lay the groundwork for the 28th party congress in october that 
is empowered to change the partys policies and guidelines

east germanys communist party apologized 
saturday for leading the country into crisis and overwhelmingly 
elected as its new chief gregor gysi a 41yearold reformer known 
for defending the rights of the opposition 
gysi promised that the communists are willing to enter into a 
government coalition with other parties after free elections 
proposed for may 
he also said the party is abandoning its claim to absolute rule 
and held up a huge janitors broom symbolizing his determination 
to make a clean sweep and start anew 
gysi 41 a bespectacled blunttalking intellectual is the 
youngest communist party chief in eastern europe he was chosen 
during a 17hour emergency party congress that started friday night 
after the election reformist premier hans modrow set up a 
commission to study an overhaul of the nations increasingly 
troubled economy plagued by slow growth consumer product 
shortages and a foreign debt of 206 billion 
gysi called the partys problems insanely complicated 
despite promises of new ideas new personnel and more democratic 
ideas 
the party chairman also cautioned the more than 2700 delegates 
at the party congress that there arent any miracles 
miracles may be what is needed for the communists who were 
holding what almost certainly will be their last session as the 
countrys ruling force 
party officials disclosed tuesday that 500000 members had quit 
since september more than twice the previously published figure 
that brings the membership to less than 18 million seriously 
weakening the force that held an ironfisted sway over east germany 
for four decades 
the communists also have lost their monopoly on power in 
czechoslovakia where formation of the first government not 
dominated by communists was announced saturday 
in the soviet union president mikhail s gorbachev told the 
communist leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the partys 
constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping 
political reforms 
with seven former politburo members in jail and some ousted 
leaders charged with corruption the east german communists 
squarely faced up to the abuses of the past 
the first section of a report approved by the delegates issued 
an apology saying the former leadership had led our country into 
this crisis threatening its existence 
we are willing to make amends the report said 
the delegates decided to change the partys name later this week 
but voted against disbanding altogether they also voted to 
streamline the leadership 
gysi one of east berlins most prominent lawyers infuriated 
hardline rulers in october by representing the new forum 
opposition group in its bid to become a legal organization 
after weeks of trying amid growing tumult the 200000strong 
new forum gained legal recognition needed to avoid official 
suppression 
after his election gysi pledged to work for democratic 
socialism a term that has become increasingly popular among the 
countrys reformers both within the communist party and outside 
it he said the communists would be one party among others 
he pledged to continue the break with the abuses of hardline 
stalinism but also said the country has no intention of adopting 
capitalism and he repeated his opposition to reunification of the 
germanys 
more than 6000 people some of them east germans took part in 
a demonstration late saturday in west berlin to protest growing 
calls for reunification 
several west german politicians reacted skeptically to the 
communist party meeting volker ruehe the general secretary of 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats repeated his 
assertion that the east german communist party has failed despite 
the new chairman 
the communists have lost much of their control in recent weeks 
and have granted historic concessions to the opposition including 
opening the berlin wall and other borders in a desperate effort to 
remain in power 
longtime party leader erich honecker was ousted from power oct 
18 as tens of thousands of east germans fled west and thousands 
more took to the streets to demand democratic reforms he is now 
under house arrest and charged with corruption and abuse of power 
egon krenz took over from honecker and introduced reforms such 
as opening the borders but his longtime association with the 
honecker regime forced his ouster last week 
the 10member politburo and 163member central committee 
resigned at the same time and a 25member panel of reformers was 
named to run party affairs until the weekend congress 
gysi whose father is jewish served until last year as the 
state secretary for religious affairs a highranking post 
party spokeswoman brigitte zimmermann briefing reporters on the 
closed session of the emergency congress said gysi was the only 
candidate to become the partys third leader in less than two 
months 
the official news agency adn said 953 percent of the 2714 
delegates participating voted for gysi in balloting that took 5 
hours 
in a secret ballot delegates also chose other members in a new 
100member party leadership over which gysi will preside 
gysi has backed sweeping political and economic reforms he was 
a member of the interim party leadership and is heading a committee 
investigating corruption under the ousted leadership 
gysi is an avid supporter of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs glasnost policy of a more open and free society at a 
nov 4 rally of about 1 million in east berlins alexander platz a 
large square in the city center gysi said that glasnost belongs 
in the german vocabulary

premier marian calfa and 
opposition leaders agreed saturday to form the first government in 
more than four decades not dominated by communists 
calfa made the announcement shortly after president gustav 
husak the last hardline communist in a position of power 
announced he will resign as soon as the new government is installed 
the premier said the government will be sworn in sunday and will 
have 10 communists including calfa himself and 11 noncommunists 
two members each from the small socialist and peoples parties 
and seven ministers with no political affiliation 
the socialists and peoples parties were formerly docile 
communist allies but have helped the proreform movement by playing 
an increasingly independent role 
speaking on national television calfa said the communists and 
opposition representatives decided on the government of national 
understanding after a very difficult day of bargaining he 
did not say how the portfolios would be distributed 
opposition leader vaclav havel speaking after calfa declared 
the opposition satisfied with the outcome of two days of 
roundtable negotiations that ended late saturday 
it was the maximum that could have been achieved at a given 
moment under these conditions havel said he described the 
negotiations as very intensive tiring and complicated 
however the opposition was in buoyant spirits when its 
delegation returned to cheers claps and kisses from workers at its 
central prague headquarters 
havel flashed a vforvictory sign as he dashed into a 
closeddoor meeting which opened with greetings from polish 
solidarity leader lech walesa 
this is 99 percent of my wishes come true said composer 
michael kocab who was in the opposition delegation that negotiated 
with calfa the other 1 percent would be havel for president 
the peaceful revolution here follows similar reforms in poland 
hungary and east germany 
in czechoslovakia the talks on the government were the second 
attempt in a week to create a government acceptable to the 
opposition which has staged a stunningly successful prodemocracy 
campaign 
the communists agreed nov 28 to give up their partys 41year 
monopoly on power communist premier ladislav adamec then named a 
cabinet that gave noncommunists only five of the 21 seats and left 
communists controlling all key posts 
the opposition threatened a nationwide general strike if a new 
cabinet with more noncommunists was not named by dec 10 hundreds 
of thousands of people staged rallies in support of the demand 
adamec resigned and was replaced by calfa 
jan carnogursky a dissident lawyer who heads the opposition 
group public against violence said he hoped new elections could be 
held soon carnogursky is among the opposition activists named for 
inclusion in the new government possibly as a deputy premier 
reformminded communist economist valtr komarek also has the 
backing of the opposition 
husak will swear in the ministers as his last official act 
the 76yearold president was one of the hardliners put into 
power after warsaw pact tanks crushed the 1968 prague spring 
reform movement the others including party chief milos jakes 
have been ousted in the last month 
right after the naming of the new government i will resign 
to make further development easier said husak who has held 
the largely ceremonial job since 1975 
husak had been the focus of many antigovernment demonstrations 
and the opposition had demanded he quit by sunday 
his resignation will mark the end of two decades of strict 
communist rule in czechoslovakia that began after the 1968 invasion 
that crushed alexander dubceks reforms 
dubcek was dumped as communist party leader and replaced by 
husak who served from 1969 until his replacement by jakes in 1987 
husak remained president and his present fiveyear term had been 
set to expire in may 1990 
the five warsaw pact nations that took part in the 1968 invasion 
have since condemned the action husak alluded to recent criticism 
of the post1968 crackdown allowing that there were some bad 
things 
but he stuck fast to his lifelong belief in the socialist system 
whatever mistakes occurred were the mistakes of people and not 
of fundamental ideas he said welcoming what he called the 
renaissance of socialism under way in eastern europe and the 
soviet union 
in east germany the communist party on saturday chose a 
reformer gregor gysi as its new chief and apologized for mistakes 
of the past that led the country into crisis 
in the soviet union president mikhail s gorbachev told the 
communist leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the partys 
constitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweeping 
political reforms 
the czechoslovak opposition won yet another concession saturday 
with the announcement by interior minister frantisek pinc that 
authority over all police including counterintelligence and secret 
police will pass from the ministry to more direct government 
control 
pinc also apologized to students who were beaten by riot police 
on nov 17 the attacks on peaceful protesters sparked the 
prodemocracy movement 
nothing like this will happen again ctk quoted pinc as 
saying we fully support the creation of a truly democratic 
society

supports abortion rights from taking communion according to a los

catholics and 70 percent of protestants the newspaper reported 
saturday 
assemblywoman lucy killea was in the midst of a bitterly 
contested race in san diego county for the state senate last month 
when bishop leo t maher ordered her not to take communion unless 
she recanted her abortion views 
killea a democrat who had been seen as an underdog in the race 
against republican assemblywoman carol bentley won a narrow 
victory tuesday bentley said the bishops sanction propelled her 
opponent to victory

president bushs decision to send two 
highlevel emissaries to china in hopes of normalizing relations 
will not mean the lifting of sanctions imposed after beijings 
crackdown on prodemocracy movements last june white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said saturday 
fitzwater said the unannounced trip by national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
was an exception to formal policy that bars highlevel talks with 
beijing he said political and economic sanctions bush invoked 
after troops brutally suppressed prodemocracy movements will 
remain in place for the time being 
in beijing speaking at a dinner held by foreign minister qian 
qichen scowcroft said we come to reduce the negative influence 
of irritants in the relationship 
rep stephen solarz dny and chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs criticized the 
sudden trip 
i thought it was another example of the administrations 
unfortunate tendency to kowtow to the chinese solarz said it 
also struck me as a repudiation of the presidents own policy of 
suspending all highlevel contacts with china pending an 
improvement in the human rights situation in that country 
last spring bush a former us liaison to china was 
criticized for not reacting strongly and quickly enough to chinas 
harsh repression of political dissent 
fitzwater said the trip was chiefly intended to brief the 
chinese on bushs summit last week in the mediterranean with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
bush felt in addition that we should take this opportunity 
to also begin exploring ways of resuming relations in the 
aftermath of chinas brutal crackdown last june on prodemocracy 
demonstrations fitzwater said 
the trip which wasnt announced by the white house until the 
two men arrived in china at 1 am est saturday is an exception to 
formal policy fitzwater said similar exceptions were made when 
secretary of state james a baker iii met with the chinese foreign 
minister in paris and again in new york he added 
asked about the unusual middleofthenight announcement well 
after most newspapers deadlines fitzwater denied any intended 
secrecy

and said the chinese had asked that it not be disclosed until the 
two men had arrived fitzwater said he did not know why beijing

through tiananmen square the site of rallies by hundreds of 
thousands of chinese fitzwater said of keeping the sanctions in 
place

long term 
we needed to at least start the process of having contacts and 
some normalization of relations with the chinese 
fitzwater said scowcroft would raise issues of human rights

announced a series of sanctions designed to show us disapproval

chinese students marked the 54th anniversary of a 
student uprising saturday with official functions stressing loyalty 
to the communist party and the socialist system 
the official media reported that art festivals symposiums and 
performances were held around the country to commmemorate the 
dec 9th movement of 1935 when beijing students took to the 
streets to protest japanese aggression in china 
as with other anniversaries of historic student movements the 
government moved to preempt any student activism by holding events 
in which the emphasis was on obedience rather than resistance 
li ximing party chief in beijing and a member of the politburo 
told a symposium that college students should take the social 
responsibility to devote themselves to the socialist cause the 
official xinhua news agency reported 
it quoted one student from the beijing normal university a 
center of activism during the prodemocracy demonstrations this 
year as saying that students had begun to turn to the works of 
marx lenin and mao tsetung because after the political turmoil 
they realized their theoretical level was low 
but it also noted that another student commented that the dec 
9th movement anniversary was different this year because students 
were more calm and thoughtful rather than being full of 
experience 
xinhua reported that at beijing university an audience of 1000 
gave warm applause to 100 students singing the east is red the 
sun is rising china has brought forth a mao tsetung 
the youth news said that in the central city of wuhan the play 
we and the motherland was staged and the teaching of 
revolutionary tradition and patriotism was carried out 
in the shandong provincial capital of jinan the daily said 
students at a symposium pledged to follow the communist party and 
integrate themselves with workers and peasants 
student dissent was effectively silenced by the violent military 
takeover of studentheld tiananmen square on june 34 and the vast 
majority of students wishing to avoid repercussions are carefully 
mouthing the party line 
privately however some students say the harsh political 
repression since june has only hardened their resentment toward the 
government and their convictions that the intransigence of the 
current leadership will only lead to further conflict

saying they talk of peace while supporting military solutions 
he appealed to the united states and the soviet union to help 
end the regions civil wars 
five central american presidents will begin a twoday summit 
sunday trying to rescue their shredded regional peace plan to end 
armed conflicts in nicaragua and el salvador 
arias did not mention the united states and soviet union by 
name but spoke of superpowers in and out of the american 
continent that are twofaced talking about political solutions 
while they encourage military offensives 
diplomats expressed doubt the summit would get the peace process 
back on track 
only a miracle would produce an agreement said a central 
american diplomat who helped arrange the meeting i do not see a 
solution to the political crisis 
guatemalan president vinicio cerezo said saturday we are 
going through a very difficult moment we are not very optimistic 
but it is a question of being willing to do something about it 
arias said the recent offensive by leftist rebels in el salvador 
eliminated whatever political space had opened there for the 
opposition there is a polarization there that will be very 
difficult to eliminate 
the summit the latest in a series of gatherings aimed at 
working out a regional peace had been scheduled for nicaragua 
it was moved from managua to san jose after salvadoran president 
alfredo cristiani suspended diplomatic relations with nicaragua 
accusing it of supplying surfacetoair missiles to the salvadoran 
rebels 
a summit conference aug 7 in tela honduras resulted in a 
surge of optimism as nicaragua agreed to hold elections the 
salvadorans agreed to talk to their guerrilla opponents and all 
five presidents agreed that ussupported contra guerrillas should 
be demobilized by dec 5 
but hopes fell in the last six weeks fighting surged inside 
nicaragua as contra rebels mounted attacks and president daniel 
ortega declared an end to a 19month ceasefire 
in el salvador farabundo marti national liberation front 
guerrillas launched their biggest attack of the war 
the deadline for contra demobilization passed with the contras 
still in their camps in honduras and nicaraguas sandinista army 
massing along the border 
the fifth president to attend the summit is jose azcona hoyo of 
honduras 
an important actor in the central american drama the united 
states does not attend the regional meetings but does try to 
influence decisions 
the united states supports cristianis government economically 
and militarily and provides nonlethal support to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
honduran presidentelect rafael callejas who takes office jan 
27 has said that his nation like guatemala and costa rica needs 
peace to attract investment and spur an economic recovery there 
has been virtually no new foreign investment in his nation in years 
nicaragua wants the contras those inside nicaragua and those 
living and training on the honduran side of the border disarmed 
and disbanded the government has offered an amnesty program 
but contra military leaders with us backing want to keep 
their groups together as a viable force until after feb 25 
elections are held in nicaragua to keep pressure on the sandinistas 
to hold a fair vote 
the slowly evolving regional peace plan produced a ceasefire in 
nicaragua in march 1988 brought about talks between salvadors 
guerrillas and government and produced the program for 
demobilization of contra groups by dec 5 
ortega was expected to arrive early sunday just moments before 
the opening of the meeting he said he would discuss the 
demobilization of the contras and his government was willing to 
extend the deadline until dec 31

a man accused of laundering more than 1 
billion for a colombian cocaine cartel has been extradited from 
uruguay to the united states the fbi said saturday 
uruguayan national police turned raul silvio vivas over to fbi 
agents at a naval base under heavy guard friday and he was flown to 
los angeles that night said thomas r parker assistant agent in 
charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in 
los angeles 
an alleged key member of the medellin cartel which is believed 
to supply a majority of the cocaine entering this country vivas 
was a target of a department of justice investigation codenamed 
operation polar cap which has been described as the biggest 
moneylaundering probe in us history 
vivas a 39yearold native of argentina had been held in a 
uruguayan jail since february 
his extradition occurred just two days after a devastating 
terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed dozens and 
wounded hundreds outside colombias police intelligence 
headquarters 
a group of drug lords calling themselves the extraditables 
has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to 
force the government to end its war on the cartel and stop the 
extraditions 
vivas was a badly wanted fugitive and his extradition 
marks yet another turning point in the willingness of the 
international community particularly in south america to work 
with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these 
drug empires parker said 
operation polar cap led to the indictment of vivas and 30 others 
in february the probe allegedly uncovered a bogus gold shipping 
network dubbed la mina the mine that laundered about 12 
billion of drug money between 1987 and february 1989 
the charges against vivas allege that he personally controlled 
the flow of over 1 billion of drug money out of the united states 
to the medellin drug cartel in colombia parker said 
eduardo martinez romero a 35yearold colombian economist and 
reputed financial wizard behind the medellin drug cartel was sent 
to atlanta on sept 6 to face charges stemming from polar cap he 
was the first person extradited since the colombian government 
began its crackdown on drug traffickers 
the fbi said vivas was under tight security officials would not 
disclose his location more specifically than the los angeles 
metropolitan area vivas was scheduled to appear before a us 
magistrate in los angeles on monday 
vivas has claimed he is a legal trader in gold uruguay has some 
of the most liberal banking laws in south america citizens and 
foreigners may enter and leave the country with gold and freely 
transfer capital in and out
