ralfone a 5yearold orangutan 
who escaped from a crate in paris three years ago and led 
authorities to a dozen other smuggled primates is returning to the 
malaysian island of borneo 
the reddish ape was handed to malaysias science technology and 
environment minister stephen yong on tuesday in a brief ceremony 
witnessed by five association of southeast asian nations 
environment ministers who had just ended a regional conference in 
kuala lumpur 
she will be taken to the sepilok orangutan sanctuary in 
sandakan 1030 miles east of kuala lumpur on borneo island then 
returned to the jungle after about six months of rehabilitation 
officials said 
mohamed khir johari malaysian president of the world wide fund 
for nature said officials of the organization and the french 
government seized ralfone at the paris airport in may 1987 
the ape with another orangutan and 11 macaque monkeys 
apparently was headed for mexico all the animals were in poor 
health and had received little or no food and water khir said 
how she was smuggled remains a mystery khir said 
ralfones escape led to the discovery of the other animals he 
said the second orangutan will remain in the antwerp zoo in 
belgium because it has become accustomed to captivity and the 
monkeys have been sent to the paris zoo he said 
orangutans live wild only in the jungles of borneo and sumatra 
where ther are an estimated 30000 of them

david johnny has witnessed so many 
atrocities in liberias war including seeing the bulletriddled 
bodies of family members that his eyes are blank and his face 
shows no emotion as he recounts them 
his tragedy is one of thousands in a nearly 6monthold war 
whose chief victims are civilians targeted by both sides because of 
their tribal affiliations 
the horrors for johnny 18 began two weeks ago when rebels 
attacked the village near the bong iron ore mine where he attended 
boarding school 
they start killing the soldier people there just spraying 
them with their guns in one group they gunned i saw at least 20 
soldiers die he said in an interview at a church mission here 
where he was given shelter and reunited with a brother 
then they surrounded the compound for mandingos and krahns and 
just started cutting the peoples throats with the knives from 
their guns 
johnny and a school friend who also witnessed the killings are 
members of the gio tribe many rebels also are gios and have been 
slaughtering civilians of president samuel does krahn tribe and 
mandingos whom the rebels accuse of enriching themselves during 
does 10year rule 
there are no reports of rebels killing gio or mano people but 
because many of them support the guerrillas they have become the 
target of government soldiers 
johnny said he and his friend fled into the forest and hid there 
for two days living on nuts and leaves before making their way 30 
miles south to grimes farm a village near the town of kakata where 
his parents lived 
they spent the night with johnnys father who is a subsistence 
farmer and retired rubber plantation worker and his mother and two 
sisters 
the next morning june 9 the two friends were out picking pine 
nuts for the family when then heard gunfire johnny said 
we waited until the shooting stopped then tried to creep into 
the village through the bushes but the soldiers spied us and fired 
at us touching me with a bullet he said displaying a graze on 
his hip 
my friend hauled me by the hand and dragged me into the 
forest and we hide there for two days in fear 
when they crept out and went back to the family hut johnny 
found the bodies of his father and two sisters his mother was 
missing 
the friends spent another two days working their way through the 
bush to the village of cowway where johnnys younger brother 
joseph 15 was staying but before they got there the village was 
attacked 
joseph picked up the story men with guns came shooting they 
killed many people and hurt others i dont know what happened to 
the woman i was staying with 
joseph said the attackers wore uniforms but did not know 
whether they were rebels or government soldiers adults who came 
from the same village said only gios lived there and that the 
killers were does soldiers 
joseph said he walked for almost three days until he got to 
monrovia where he sought shelter at don bosco polytechnic one of 
six church missions sheltering mano and gio people fearing attacks 
by soldiers 
when david reached cowway he was told his brother had gone to a 
church in monrovia the brothers were reunited last week 
they got some good news during the weekend a family friend told 
them their mother musu johnny was alive she had been seriously 
wounded in the grimes farm attack and was being treated at kakata 
hospital 
the town is behind rebel lines and there was no way for the 
brothers to check the report 
they are among about 250000 people who have fled the fighting 
many to neighboring countries 
about 600 sleep on mats in classrooms at don bosco a technical 
and business school run by the salesian roman catholic priests who 
are based in stockton england 
the schools dean the rev brian jerstice has been busy 
organizing classroom instruction for the many refugee children 
making sure the makeshift clinic has enough staff and medication 
distributing donated clothing and worrying about food supplies and 
sanitary conditions 
we thought we could put up 200 people now there are 600 
crowded here and there is no more sleeping space jerstice said 
the hardest part is having to turn people away

despite the global thaw in eastwest 
relations the cold war is chilling efforts to end angolas 15year 
civil war 
billions of dollars worth of soviet and us weapons have kept 
the war going between the marxist government and jonas savimbis 
unita rebels 
though the superpowers now want to spend less on regional 
conflicts neither seems willing to see its client lose the 
struggle for power in one of africas potentially richest nations 
when portuguese colonizers pulled out in 1975 a tribalbased 
conflict between northern central and southern angolans soon 
became a surrogate war as the kremlin battled the west for 
influence in southern africa 
some 50000 cuban soldiers and the best red army hardware were 
sent to help the popular movement for the liberation of angola 
mpla which declared independence and became the government in 
luanda 
most western nations except the united states israel and south 
africa recognized the mpla government headed by agostinho neto 
south africa allied its army with unita the national union for the 
total independence of angola 
south african aid to the rebels officially ended with regional 
peace accords signed by angola and cuba in december 1988 but unita 
still receives us military assistance thought to be 50 million 
this fiscal year 
cuba has already sent home more than 33000 soldiers under the 
agreement but western estimates put continuing soviet support at 
between 600 million and 15 billion a year 
despite efforts by african and european diplomats and a letter 
from us congressmen to president bush urging him to raise the 
angolan issue with president mikhail s gorbachev at their recent 
summit there is still superpower involvement 
backing continues although its getting much more difficult 
to support aid increases to savimbi in the current eastwest 
climate said one western official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity 
secretary of state james a baker iii said last week that us 
supplies might be cut off if luanda agrees to free and fair 
elections but the bush administration has since asked congress to 
earmark an added 10 to 15 million a year for the rebels 
congressional sources say the rebels would use some of the money 
to buy hawk antiaircraft missiles adding to an arsenal of 
shoulderfired stinger rockets 
yuri yukalov a leading kremlin diplomat specializing in 
southern africa recently pledged that arms supplies to luanda 
would go on as long as the war continues according to portuguese 
news reports 
an article from a recent edition of the soviet weekly new times 
published in the portuguese media said that between 600 and 1000 
soviet military advisers are still in angola though not actively 
involved in the war 
foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem of angola has 
criticized south africa and the united states for continuing to 
funnel unita aid through zaire 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire brought savimbi and 
president jose eduardo dos santos together for an initial truce 
last june 22 at gbadolite but the ceasefire collapsed days later 
in confusion over peace terms 
government military campaigns this year have been countered by 
increased rebel urban sabotage that is crippling angolas economy 
a second round of lowlevel peace talks ended monday in portugal 
and a portuguese official said the two sides had agreed to meet 
again probably next month however savimbi recalled his 
delegation for consultations after differences arose on the third 
day of negotiations and hardliners on both sides are still 
pressing for more military campaigns 
unita has agreed to recognize the angolan state and dos santos 
as its head while the government has indicated it might agree to 
free elections after peace neither side can agree on terms for 
monitoring a ceasefire diplomats say 
opposition to elections in the singleparty state is strong 
especially among marxist hardliners pitted against the more 
moderate dos santos 
security minister kundi payama recently told mpla militants that 
angola would maintain its marxistleninist system because 
capitalism has never served the interests of the angolan people 
billboards around the capital proclaim 1990 the year for 
broader democracy and the ruling partys third congress slated 
for december might produce steps toward multiparty democracy if a 
truce is fixed before then western observers say 
dos santos has been edging away from comunist economics since 
1987 and has brought pragmatists such as de castro van dunem into 
the politburo and his inner circle last week he promoted 
moderates in a cabinet reshuffle 
most of angolas trade and its 55 billion foreign debt is with 
the west 
the united states whose oil companies have major interests in 
angola have withheld diplomatic recognition as an incentive to get 
unita represented in government

despite appeals for it to stop 10yearold craig 
shergold receives hundreds of getwell cards daily from strangers 
trying to help him win a place in the guinness book of world 
records 
craig who suffers from a rare form of brain cancer broke the 
record months ago but the cards keep coming more than 16 million 
have arrived 
we dont want any more cards because it looks as though were 
taking cards for no reason craigs mother marion said from the 
family home in carshalton south london 
every card says we hope you make it in the record books so 
it seems kind of greedy to keep accepting them she said 
donald mcfarlan the editor of the guinness book said he tried 
to dissuade the shergolds from their record bid and warned them 
that it would spiral out of control 
our experience is that once it goes international it is 
absolutely unstoppable mcfarlan said 
the getwell card category was discontinued once after mario 
morby held the record with 1000265 cards mcfarlan said the 
13yearold english boy is recovering from his leukemia but the 
family still receives cards three years later 
mcfarlan revived the category after intense pressure and craig 
now holds the record 
i thought i had decided over a year ago that mario morby 
would be the last one but it is very difficult to hold out against 
an emotive press i couldnt do my job wellintentioned very 
sentimental people called me at work and i received quite a lot of 
hate mail including one that said if you have children i hope 
they die of cancer 
craigs record will be included in the 1991 edition published in 
october he said guinness hasnt announced a specific figure for 
their book but the count is above 16 million 
the editor said he was trying to protect the shergolds from an 
ugly situation particularly if craig had died the cards would 
have kept coming 
craig had an operation in january 1988 that removed 
threequarters of a brain tumor mrs shergold said doctors believe 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy have successfully stemmed the 
diseases spread into his spinal cord 
hes in wonderful spirits mrs shergold said 
when craig is feeling up to it he visits the wallington post 
office the local depot responsible for delivery of the cards 
last night we had 68 trays of about 350 letters per tray for 
craig shergold those were mostly from the states and some from 
south africa said michael wilkinson the post office manager 
last week we had 51000 items and judging by yesterday and 
todays load well have even more this week 
the crush causes extra work for the post office wilkinson said 
the cards are stuffed into bags and delivered to the sutton 
united football team club house where 30 of craigs family and 
friends spend four hours every thursday night counting between 
50000 and 100000 cards 
teddy bears baseball caps and japanese origami cranes have 
arrived with the truck loads of cards prime minister margaret 
thatcher and pop star michael jackson were among those who wrote 
wilkinson said 
the appeal started by word of mouth sept 24 1989 
some wellintentioned but misguided people sent out chain 
faxes which requested the plea for cards be sent to 10 business 
associates mcfarlan said the faxes went to every country 
where the fax is known and when you look at the third generation 
of faxes the arithmetic gets frightening 
the used stamps have been sold and the cards recycled raising 
34200 for leukemia research and the royal marsden hospital where 
craig gets weekly treatments

fox broadcasting won ugly as they say in 
sports breaking into the top five in the ratings with tvs most 
boorish families the simpsons and the bundys of married 
with children 
the simpsons was the no 3 show last week and the equally 
grumpy but nonanimated brood of married with children was 
no 4 the ac nielsen co said tuesday 
it was the first time in foxs fouryear history that it broke 
into the top five and the proud parents were jubilant 
were extremely excited about this said fox spokesman 
michael peikoff 
foxs unprecedented ratings were helped by the big three 
networks being kneedeep in reruns 
they also benefited from 10yearold bart simpsons sawtooth 
head blazoned across rolling stone magazine tshirts and the pages 
of news magazines 
but foxs victory was far from sweeping in overall ratings nbc 
was still the no 1 network receiving an average rating of 104 
cbs was second with 97 and abc last with 93 each ratings point 
represents 921000 households 
in a top 10 where only one show the seinfeld chronicles on 
nbc was not a rerun abcs roseanne was the toprated 
program the wisecracking bar crowd of nbcs cheers was no 2 
nbcs the cosby show which will face off against the 
simpsons in the fall fell to fifth place 
here are the top 10 shows their network and rating 
roseanne abc 168 cheers nbc 167 the 
simpsons fox 147 married with children fox 145 
the cosby show nbc 142 a different world and empty 
nest tied nbc 14 coach abc 138 designing women 
cbs the golden girls nbc the seinfeld chronicles nbc 
tied 136 
there was no news in the network news wars abc remained no 1 
by a wide margin with a 92 average cbs had a 78 and nbc a 75

after 22 years as an obsessive collector 
peter p cecere is putting his ecuadoran python skin his japanese 
kamikaze waistband and his antique urinal from holland and much 
much more on the auction block this weekend 
crated and trucked away from ceceres home in suburban reston 
va are scores of ceremonial masks and devil dolls from south 
america hes blown his last oompah on the old brass tuba from 
bohemia hes bid adios to the spanish butchers shop sign 
decorated with bull goat and rams heads 16 meat hooks and 58 
iron flowers with light sockets 
frankly he says its a huge relief 
your collection becomes your wife your children your 
mistress he said it owns you and limits your options in a 
certain benign way it enslaves you 
cecere estimates he has spent 175000 compulsively gobbling up 
folk art antiques outrageous gewgaws and wondrous kitsch during 
his travels as a foreign service officer with the us information 
agency in bolivia uruguay mexico ecuador and barcelona spain 
he collected seashells toy trains and civil war memorabilia as 
a kid in brooklyn ny but his passion became a consuming mania 
in 1968 when he visited an exhibition of indian folk art in 
cochabamba bolivia 
it was an apocalyptic event like the scales falling from the 
eyes of st paul he said i went ape i was jumping up and 
down with joy and unbridled happiness i knew my life would never 
be the same i started buying stuff right there the madness had 
begun 
at one point he was spending 1400 a month on things like 
ostrich eggs walrus tusks octopus traps and antique flatirons 
tobacco tins patent medicine bottles handforged tools and a 19th 
century infant potty seat with original leather upholstery 
he couldnt resist those fantastic pinball machine panels the 
antique wire turkey foot grabbers a set of spanish sheep bells 
and the sevenfoot papiermache womans skeleton clad in hot pink 
gown and gilded spiked heels from a mexican day of death 
festival 
ditto for the antique horse hair clipper the 1928 buick 
radiator cap the table lamp mounted on a uruguayan firefighters 
helmet and the tractor tire shoes with the words love and 
peace inscribed on the soles 
before he quit cold turkey last fall cecere had amassed more 
than 20000 artifacts his fivebedroom house was overflowing the 
stuff filled the bathrooms and even hung from the ceilings the 
walls were literally buckling and cracking under the weight he 
said 
he thought of quitting his job buying a farm in the virginia 
countryside and building a museum to display his collection hed 
do a little antique dealing on the side to help pay the bills 
then i began to see the oppressive side to that dream he 
said i realized i would be a baby sitter for my collection my 
freedom would be severely limited by my things

he has hugged plo chief yasser arafat he has 
visited libyan leader moammar gadhafi he has praised cubas fidel 
castro as a tower of strength and he has advocated government 
control of south africas minerals and banks 
nelson mandela is making some americans feel uncomfortable even 
as thousands of others are pouring out love and adulation for the 
black south african hero who spent 27 years in jail and is now 
negotiating with the white government to end its monopoly on power 
the bush administration is emphasizing mandelas achievement 
since his prison release five months ago in giving black south 
africans hope that their racial segregation known as apartheid 
may soon end 
he is the only one with the credibility and following in both 
the white and black communities who could have brought this off 
said a state department official describing what president bush 
and secretary of state james a baker iii will talk to mandela 
about next monday 
but some difficult questions also will be raised 
baker in fact already brought up some questions with mandela 
when the two met at namibias independence celebrations last march 
baker wanted to know whether mandelas african national congress 
has renounced the violence that landed its leadership in jail or 
exile in the 1960s 
mandela indicated that he favored negotiations rather than 
violence to end apartheid and the white minoritys domination of 28 
million blacks said a source familiar with the meeting 
but in public comments mandela has been less diplomatic the 
only type of violence we accept is organized violence in the form 
of armed action which is properly controlled and where the targets 
have been carefully selected he said at a news conference 
earlier this month 
baker and bush also want to ask mandela about his stated support 
for government control of south africas major economic sectors 
government control of the economy has failed in eastern europe 
and in other african countries and we hope mr mandela will be 
cognizant of those failures and look to private enterprise a 
market economy system said the state department official 
conservatives in congress where mandela is being accorded the 
rare honor for a civilian of addressing a joint meeting of the 
senate and house next tuesday are uneasy but also aware that 
criticizing mandela is not a popular cause 
rep dan burton rind of the house africa subcommittee said 
he recognizes that mandela is playing a vital role in efforts to 
abolish apartheid but we have severe concerns about the things 
mandela has said about nationalizing industries and his open 
support for the south african communist party said an aide to 
the congressman who asked not to be identified 
rep henry hyde rill also admires mandela but adds at 
the same time i think some caution is due so long as he fulsomely 
praises gadhafi castro arafat 
hyde said mandela might moderate his support for such leaders 
as well as his advocacy of socialism as negotiations with the 
government of president fw de klerk progress and as he exposes 
himself to world public opinion during his extensive travels 
mandelas defenders explain his support for gadhafi arafat 
castro and other third world leaders as a tribute to their military 
and political support in the long years when the anc was banned and 
exiled 
analysts regard mandelas support for the south african 
communist party which like the anc was banned for many years in 
the same light 
the communist party was the ancs channel for soviet weapons and 
is an integral part of the south african opposition movement said 
pauline baker of the carnegie endowment for international peace 
in any case with the demise of communism in eastern europe 
mandelas support for the south african party can no longer be 
viewed as a threat analysts say 
mandela and the newly unbanned anc are not locked into socialism 
or other economic dogma but they are looking for ideas that will 
give blacks a share of the countrys lands and wealth ms baker 
said 
they are open to suggestions they are on a learning curve 
she said 
mandela edged toward appeasing some critics at two recent 
meetings with jewish leaders in which he expressed support for 
israels right to exist

once upon a time in hollywood an actress who 
wears quirky clothes went to a cable mogul she carried two bags 
full of illustrated fairy tales and said she wanted to turn them 
into shows 
why sure the mogul said and this is no fairy tale 
its how shelley duvall became a mogul herself when fresh from 
playing olive oyl in the movie popeye she got the okay in 1980 
to produce faerie tale theater for the showtime cable channel 
a friend had warned her the major networks would be wasted time 
she says so i walked into showtime and the head of the company 
was laughing at me with my two cloth knitting bags full of books 
but they gave me an order for three shows right off the bat 
she said and thank goodness they had the courage to put their 
faith in olive oyl as the producer otherwise i wouldnt have 
gotten here 
duvall who played rapunzel in one faerie tale since has 
produced two other showtime series tall tales amp legends and 
nightmare classics and a cable remake last year of dinner at 
eight 
her latest effort running tonight and friday on the disney 
channel is a gently bent music special called mother goose rock 
n rhyme like faerie tale theater it also can be bought or 
rented in video stores 
as is the duvall custom the special does things differently 
its childhoodtale characters are played by a variety of performers 
you wouldnt normally see in your basic mother goose show like zz 
top debbie harry little richard and the everpopular pia zadora 
duvall who also appears as little bo peep started that which 
led to her producing career while playing olive oyl to robin 
williams popeye in popeye one of seven robert altman films 
shes done 
the film musical was filmed on the tiny island of malta and 
since id been told we were going to be there a while i figured 
id better bring a book she says so i brought along a book of 
grimms fairy tales 
i was reading the frog prince one day and thought oh 
god wouldnt robin make a hilarious frog 
he wound up merrily croaking away in the first faerie tale 
directed by former monty python inmate eric idle she enlisted 
similar topname folk in subsequent efforts appealing to their 
desire to do the offbeat 
this led to such pairings as elizabeth mcgovern and vanessa 
redgrave in snow white liza minnelli and tom conti in the 
princess and the pea and by golly ricky schroder and joan 
collins in hansel and gretel 
duvall now 40 was born in houston and her speech still 
retains a trace of lone star twang she has continued acting in 
films but not much her last work in 1987 was in the steve 
martin comedy roxanne 
duvall the actress wants to emote more but duvall the producer 
still has more things to produce among them a new version of jack 
londons call of the wild for ted turners new tnt cable 
network 
she also would like to tackle the greek myths which you dont 
hardly see on tv these days 
there also is a wild and crazy dream involving the late jay 
wards rocky and bullwinkle and fractured fairy tales 
those hip literate and badpun cartoon series of tvs yesteryear 
she loves them she says always did and i would like to go 
back and get the same group that made them together again and have 
them make some more because its too good not to have on 
television

house democrats frustrated by a stalemate with 
president bush over budget cuts and taxes are starting to 
appropriate spending for next year beginning with 208 billion 
for energy and water projects 
ignoring the absence of an overall budget accord the house 
voted 35559 tuesday to raise by 350 million what bush would spend 
in fiscal 1991 to clean up the nations atomic weapons complex the 
house vote also would launch 25 water projects opposed by the 
administration 
what the house has done is to flaunt or doom the budget 
summit said rep bill frenzel rminn as several efforts to 
cut the spending were defeated this is something that is going 
to get this house in great trouble 
the measure is the first of 13 appropriation bills for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 to pass either the house or senate 
until tuesday congressional leaders had stalled action in hopes of 
reaching an overall budget agreement with the white house 
negotiators have been meeting for five weeks on trying to cut 
45 billion to 60 billion from next years deficit which could 
reach as high as 208 billion according to administration 
estimates 
participants in the budget talks said the administration was 
ready to present its deficitcutting plan today an official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said the white house would offer a 
plan to cut up to 50 billion 
democrats admitting that cuts will have to be made later said 
one reason to start acting on spending bills is to put pressure on 
the administration 
if we do not proceed that would be the worst way to deal with 
the budget summit said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of 
the house budget committee in a vacuum in which we do nothing 
no pressure will be brought to get action 
if we dont pass this well be here at christmastime and i 
dont like washington at christmastime added rep john myers of 
indiana the ranking republican on the house energy and water 
appropriations subcommittee 
as passed the bill would provide the army corps of engineers 
36 billion nearly a halfbillion dollars more than it received 
last year for its 550 water projects 
the 87 water projects run by the interior departments bureau of 
reclamation would get 957 million nearly 7 million less than 
this year but still 42 million above what bush sought 
but the bulk of the money 109 billion would go to 
maintaining the energy departments vast atomic weapons complex 
including 33 billion for environmental cleanups around nuclear 
warhead manufacturing plants 
that is 15 percent more than the president requested and 66 
percent above what is being spent this year on cleaning up 
radioactive debris around the plants that effort is expected to 
cost between 50 billion and 200 billion over the next 20 years 
the nearly 45 billion in nondefense energy department 
programs includes bushs request of 318 million for the 
superconducting super collider in texas of which 169 million is 
devoted toward beginning construction 
the massive atomsmasher consisting of an underground tunnel 
54 miles in circumference is intended to explore subatomic 
particles and allow researchers to study matter and the origin of 
the universe 
rep howard wolpe dmich deplored the super collider as the 
emergence of a scientificindustrial complex to replace the 
military industrial complex but he offered no amendment to scale 
back spending on it 
officials estimate that by its anticipated completion in 1998 
the super collider will cost 8 billion nearly double the 44 
billion predicted three years ago 
the bill also includes 
115 million for solar energy research 14 million more than 
bush requested and 32 million above this years spending 
310 million for nuclear power research 48 million less than 
the presidents request and 38 million below current spending 
315 million for the nuclear regulatory commission 
135 million for the tennessee valley authority 44 million 
above bushs request and 16 million above current spending 
150 million for the appalachian regional commission 21 
million above last year and 100 million more than the 
administration wanted

a constitutional amendment against burning the 
american flag is speeding toward a house floor vote with critics 
saying the momentum is with us and backers grumbling about too 
much haste 
its going to be close rep jack brooks dtexas said 
tuesday as his house judiciary committee sent the measure to the 
full house for a vote thursday it would be close this week it 
would be close next week 
speaker thomas foley dwash agreed with that assessment 
brooks said the 1917 vote by which the panel sent the measure 
to the floor with no recommendation for or against was a sign 
that the final outcome also would be by a narrow margin 
to become part of the constitution the amendment must get 289 
votes in the house and 67 in the senate plus ratification by 38 
state legislatures 
president bush is pressing for approval of the amendment which 
would allow congress and the states to outlaw burning or other 
desecration of the flag 
house and senate democratic leaders oppose the measure saying 
it would undermine the constitutions first amendment guarantee of 
free speech 
the amendment was sidetracked last year when critics prevailed 
on lawmakers to pass the 1989 flag protection act that law was 
held unconstitutional by the supreme court last week rekindling 
debate over the amendment 
the momentum is with us were picking up a vote here and a 
vote there said rep don edwards dcalif a leading critic 
rep joe moakley dmass chairman of the house rules 
committee scheduled a meeting of his panel today to clear the 
amendment for floor action thursday he said he was prepared to 
waive house rules if necessary to keep the measure rolling 
but supporters said the house needed more time to weigh the 
issue 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis said he would object to any 
waiving of a house rule under which most measures must wait three 
days after committee approval before coming to a floor vote 
they dont want to give time for the veterans of foreign wars 
and the american legion and the rest of the organizations to 
mount a letterwriting campaign said rep henry j hyde rill 
he said he would prefer to see a floor vote delayed until next 
week although i wouldnt want it beyond next week 
republicans said various veterans groups had agreed to send out 
mass mailings and buy newspaper advertisements to generate pressure 
for the plan although some ads were not scheduled to appear until 
friday 
uncommitted lawmakers reported no surge in lobbying on the 
issue i havent seen any organized pressure said rep terry 
bruce dill who has yet to reach a decision and is approaching 
the amendment warily 
it is the kind of issue that makes you think he said i 
think we should do what an appeals court does in some of these 
cases and take it under advisement i think we should go nice and 
slow 
last week the house civil and constitutional rights subcommittee 
voted 53 to advance the amendment to the full judiciary committee 
but it did so with an adverse recommendation 
the measure comes up for a hearing in the senate judiciary 
committee on thursday 
the house judiciary committee acted after critics attacked the 
measure in strong terms rep patricia schroeder dcolo said the 
description of the amendment as tailored for use on the fall 
campaign trail was one of the things that has made me sickest 
throughout this entire debate 
conservative supporters of the amendment fired back with hyde 
saying 
those who are shocked and revolted and frustrated by the 
excesses of the counterculture the pornography the obscenities 
that inundate our entertainment industry the drugs the aids 
explosion the high abortion rate view flag burning as one more 
slap in the face at the millions of veterans who found enough 
values in america to give their lives in combat

the arbiters of the french language have made a few 
corrections that will force all its citizens to relearn how to 
spell 
the 15 pages of spelling changes recommended tuesday by the high 
council of the french language have been accepted by premier michel 
rocard who said he will ask national education minister lionel 
jospin to assure they are taught in all schools as of next year 
the council said the spelling changes are fewer than those made 
in the 19th century as compared to the 18th century 
it was never a question that the government legislate in such 
matters the language belongs to those who use it rocard 
said but it is up to the government to favor that usage 
which appears most satisfactory 
rocard called on francophone minister alain decaux to meet with 
dictionary specialists publishing houses the press and others 
dealing with the written word to find the best way to bring the 
changes into normal usage 
the five categories of spelling changes affect hyphens accent 
marks the plural form of compound words accordance of the past 
participle in reflexive verbs and anomalies 
the hyphen much used in french is going out of style 
according to the council which is all but discarding it even the 
hyphen previously used in words borrowed from english such as 
cowboy striptease or weekend will disappear 
more drastic changes do away with the feminine e or plural 
s at the end of past participles when they are used with 
reflexive verbs but only in certain cases 
in another change the second half of compound words when 
plural will always end in an s while the first half will lose 
its s if it had one 
the changes were approved by the academie francaise along with 
the councils of the french language of the french communities of 
belgium and quebec 
but the association of university professors the societie des 
agreges criticized the changes as confusing and unnecessary 
under the pretext of correcting fancied anomalies new ones 
are being introduced the group said in a statement 
once again the error is being made that french is no longer a 
universal language because it is too difficult english has become 
a spoken language around the world the group said despite the 
fact that its spelling is unchanged and often without logic

eleven dominican stowaways hiding 
in the cargo hold of a puerto rican ship were killed by a pesticide 
that was sprayed on the vessels cargo of cocoa officials say 
the puerto rican government on tuesday sent condolences to the 
dominican republic over the deaths 
the 11 dominicans all of them men were discovered monday 
aboard the ss humacao owned by the puerto rico maritime shipping 
co shortly after the vessel left the southern dominican port of 
rio haina 
company officials said the cargo of the ship headed for 
elizabeth nj had been sprayed with the pesticide methyl bromide 
in compliance with us department of agriculture regulations 
the san juan star an englishlanguage daily said five of the 
men were found dead in the cargo hold and six others died later at 
a hospital from inhaling the poisonous fumes 
two stowaways in the cargo hold survived one was treated at a 
dominican hospital and released while the other was arrested on 
unspecified charges dominican authorities said 
in a letter to dominican president joaquin balaguer puerto rico 
secretary of state antonio colorado said the us commonwealth will 
work with its caribbean neighbor to avoid such tragedies in the 
future he did not specify any possible safeguards however

ban on the pesticide some deaths have been blamed on its use in 
fumigating homes

away on ships bound for the united states and other foreign ports 
in 1980 22 dominican stowaways died of suffocation in the 
ballast tank of the panamanianregistered regina express bound for 
miami

at least 100 people some armed with 
guns or baseball bats converged on a lowincome neighborhood 
tuesday night apparently to protest police handling of a 
teenagers death authorities said 
shots were fired and bottles and bricks were thrown but no 
serious injuries were reported in this city of nearly 40000 people 
on lake michigan police said 
weve had shots going off all night said policeman mike 
elkins no shots have been fired by us were in full riot gear 
about 20 people had been arrested by 1030 pm three hours 
after the disturbance by at least 100 people began in a fourblock 
section of the neighborhood 
state and county police and state prison officers were 
dispatched to help city police control the crowd elkins said 
i know there were problems up there last night said laporte 
county sheriffs sgt mark ludlow i dont think its fair to call 
it a riot maybe a civil disturbance 
there were minor injuries but it was not immediately known how 
many people had been hurt ludlow said 
the disturbance was apparently a protest of the death late 
monday of chris crawford 16 and the wounding of his cousin 
michael cain 17 
cain who was shot in the left side said he and crawford were 
standing near a video arcade when they were approached by an 
unknown man who fought with them 
cain said his cousin was forced into the street then hit by a 
car and killed cain said he was shot as the vehicle passed he was 
taken to memorial hospital where he was treated and released 
residents of the neighborhood which is near a housing project 
said police were less responsive to crimes in their area than in 
more affluent neighborhoods 
police took more than an hour to reach the scene of monday 
nights violence said resident vince woodard 
we called them on 911 and they didnt come woodard said 
elkins disputed allegations that police were slow to respond 
monday im sure in a case like that we were there right away 
he said 
the officer said police dispatchers received the call at 1139 
pm and arrived at the scene within a minute 
were only a couple of blocks away elkins said

the bush administration is ready to open 
bargaining at slowmoving budget negotiations with congress by 
presenting its own plan for paring next years deficit 
participants in the talks say 
one official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
white house would offer a plan cutting the fiscal 1991 budget gap 
by close to 50 billion at todays session 
but sen bob packwood of oregon a republican negotiator said 
he believed the administration would present a plan similar to the 
budget president bush unveiled in january 
that package proposed reducing red ink by 37 billion in the 
fiscal year that begins oct 1 it relied largely on raising nearly 
20 billion in taxes and other new revenues and limiting the growth 
of benefit programs such as medicare by 14 billion 
packwood said the administrations package was a response to 
democratic demands that bush make the first offer at the budget 
talks since he is the one who sought the negotiations 
its just a way of getting things started he said 
meanwhile the house began appropriating spending for next year 
on tuesday approving 208 billion for energy and water projects 
despite the lack of agreement over budget cuts and taxes 
democratic and gop negotiators have said 45 billion to 60 
billion in savings are needed for the coming fiscal year 
the official who set the administrations package as approaching 
50 billion said it would include about 20 billion in new revenue 
17 billion to 18 billion in reductions in benefit programs and 
about 4 billion in cuts to other domestic programs 
in addition the official said it would include perhaps 3 
billion to 6 billion in defense reductions and 15 billion in 
savings from lowerthanexpected interest payments on the national 
debt 
the official said administration bargainers would offer few 
details of where the savings would come 
todays session was to be the 10th in a series of budget talks 
that began may 15 so far the meetings have dealt with technical 
issues 
unless action is taken next years budget gap could climb above 
200 billion the administration has said the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law limits the red ink to 74 billion in fiscal 1991 
on tuesday the senate voted 962 for a measure that would press 
lawmakers to remove the huge surpluses in the social security trust 
fund from the governments deficit calculations 
it was the first vote by the full senate on the issue since it 
reached prominence early this year 
the provision was sponsored by sen john heinz rpa he has 
argued that the surpluses reaching tens of billions of dollars 
annually make the budget gap look smaller and are a misuse of 
money intended for payments to future retirees 
the measures fate is uncertain however because it was adopted 
as an amendment to a bill boosting federal spending on housing that 
the administration has threatened to veto the house version of the 
housing bill is dramatically different and does not mention the 
social security surpluses

but impassioned after a prolonged illness announced a new 
international aids outreach effort tuesday targeting grassroots 
organizations in developing countries

the fund which taylor said is off to a modest start will 
expand amfars reach to east and central africa latin america the 
caribbean and southeast asia 
from tiny villages in uganda to the teeming slums of rio the 
international fund for aids will soon sow the seeds of knowledge 
and hope potentially saving thousands of lives in the process 
said taylor a cofounder of amfar and the organizations national 
and international chairman 
the fund which raised 400000 last december will sponsor 
small workshops designed to help organizations in developing 
countries focus their strategies to combat aids such efforts will 
aid the groups when they approach western donors for support said 
amfar president mervyn silverman 
i always like the idea of training the trainer because then 
you magnify your effort he said 
silverman introduced taylor expressing delight she was able to 
attend the reception 
we didnt call her trying to be sensitive to her needs he 
told the crowd she called us against her doctors orders she 
said i must be there its important i be there 
taylor on the arm of an amfar colleague needed assistance to 
step up to the podium platform and smiled with relief as she 
negotiated the 12inch rise 
dressed in a black tealength dress high heels and bold gold 
accessories taylor appeared radiant she waved to the cheering 
crowd smiling and clearly enjoying the enthusiastic welcome

the influx of tens of thousands of soviet jews 
has produced a housing crunch that is driving up rents forcing 
some longtime residents into the streets 
these homeless israelis have pitched tents in front of 
parliament in jerusalem and across from municipal buildings in 
remote suburban towns their plight has gripped a country that had 
been swept by immigration euphoria 
officials warn of an impendent social explosion directed at 
the immigrants unless the housing crisis is resolved soon 
on tuesday the story of avi golan a 40year old father of four 
who set his tent in front of the municipality in kiryat bialik led 
israel televisions popular evening newsreel 
kiryat bialik near the northern port city of haifa took in 450 
immigrant families in recent months and golan an invalid has to 
leave his apartment by this weekend the rent doubled and he can no 
longer afford it 
i tried to find another apartment and they demanded 400 a 
month to be paid a year in advance i cannot pay in advance i can 
hardly pay every month golan said 
i dont know what to do shall i laugh or cry really i dont 
know i dont know how to raise my kids even if i would want 
to steal i cannot they would catch me immediately he said 
hugging two of his children in front of a small bluecolored tent 
golan is not alone 
the mayor dani zack says he knows of five or six other 
homeless families who have apparently lost all hope to my 
sorrow there is almost no solution to this in kiryat bialik it 
has to be a government solution 
uri gordon head of the absorption department at the jewish 
agency that helps resettle immigrants warned on tuesday that the 
crisis may lead to a social explosion between the israelis and 
new immigrants 
rents have skyrocketed throughout israel with the arrival of the 
soviet wave which totaled 13000 in 1989 and more than 43000 so 
far this year it may exceed 150000 by the end of 1990 
housing ministry officials say israels estimated 20000 vacant 
rental units will be filled in four months and three months later 
israel would exhaust its supply of alternate housing such as 
holiday flats army camps and offseason hotel rooms 
the ministry has called for 60000 new housing starts this year 
so far ground has been broken for just 7000 new units 
plans to import prefabricated houses have run into trouble 
following objections from local companies 
in addition the union of construction workers on tuesday 
decided to launch a struggle against the import of prefabricated 
houses they are backed by the powerful histadrut israels largest 
trade unions federation 
the arrival of immigrants who get a government housing subsidy 
of some 237 per month led to a housing shortage in modestly 
priced units the landlords raised the rents for cheapest 
apartments to match the subsidy causing an overall housing price 
inflation 
many israelis say they cannot compete with the soviets who also 
get their subsidy a full year in advance and are thus forced to 
leave their homes the average monthly aftertax income for an 
israeli family of four is 1160 
protest groups are being organized across the country tents 
have sprung up that are reminiscent of those set up in the early 
70s by the impoverished sephardis or jews of middle eastern and 
north african origin 
at the kings of israel square in downtown tel aviv one can find 
mordechai dilmuni 27 his wife and two children on a sitin 
strike the story is familiar they can not afford to rent an 
apartment 
in rishon lezion near tel aviv where rents have doubled to up 
to 600 for a twobedroom unit 28yearold saleswoman kochi nadav 
is busy organizing a protest group 
my husband is an engineer we have two children age four and 
five we earn 3000 shekels 1500 a month and it is hard to pay 
500 a month in rent nadav told the daily yediot ahronot 
immigration is good for the state but i blame the government 
and the jewish agency for causing price hikes she said 
others are less tolerant 
i have nothing against immigration let them come but if the 
government cant at the same time help us former soldiers and 
young couples they better stop immigration yitzhak kovni a 
34yearold unemployed beersheba resident told the paper

the future of the national endowment for the 
arts clouded by political furor over works of art deemed 
offensive will be fought out on the floor of the house 
a house committee voted tuesday to kick the issue to the full 
house in a move that acknowledged the panel was unable to resolve 
deep divisions over whether and how to restructure the federal arts 
agency 
at issue is a bill continuing the nea for another five years 
without any restrictions on grants and controversial works of art 
the bill was proposed by the bush administration but the white 
house has been negotiating with republicans in congress to come up 
with acceptable restrictions on the agencys grantmaking authority 
its house sponsor rep pat williams dmont said he opposes 
any restrictions but expects the house will add them even without 
them he said the political furor has had a chilling effect on the 
neas grant process 
chances are less than 5050 that the bill will pass the house 
as it is now written with regard to content restrictions 
williams said 
regardless of what happens on the bill the nea may never be 
the same he said 
the house education and labor committee voted by voice to 
approve the administrations bill but leaders said the intent was 
simply to postpone the debate 
the full house probably will consider the bill in midjuly said 
speaker thomas s foley dwash it will also consider several 
proposed amendments that would restructure the arts agency or 
impose restrictions against support for pornographic sacrilegious 
or other offensive art 
every reasonable issue ought to be considered by the house 
foley said 
the follows a year of political controversy inflamed by a series 
of disclosures of seemingly offensive art that received federal 
subsidies 
in the latest the washington times reported tuesday that a 
9000 nea grant went to a nonprofit group in san francisco that 
is sponsoring a homoerotic movie festival 
some advocates of restrictions warned that without them 
political support for the nea would evaporate and congress could 
kill the agency entirely 
there is a responsibility that comes with the expenditure of 
federal dollars said rep marge roukema rnj the issue is 
not censorship but sponsorship 
rep fred grandy riowa a former television actor defended 
the nea and said only a few grants out of thousands turned out bad 
he said adding any restrictions could damage artistic excellence 
im far more concerned about mediocrity than i am 
pornography grandy said 
rep paul henry rmich distributed a proposed amendment he 
drafted after negotiations with nea officials and the white house 
it calls on the agency to ensure it supports art which is 
sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship and does not 
deliberately denigrate the cultural heritage of the united states 
its religious traditions or racial and ethnic groups 
money could not go to art that violates prevailing standards 
against obscenity or indecency 
some conservatives have proposed more restrictive language on 
pornography another group of republicans is proposing a 
restructuring of the nea that would send more federal money 
directly to state arts agencies for distribution

dairy farmers would be assured 1010 per 
hundred pounds of milk for the next five years under a section of 
the 1990 farm bill approved by the senate agriculture committee 
its the same guarantee offered by the house agriculture 
committee that completed its work on the bill last week 
but its less than the 1310 per hundredweight that dairy 
farmers have recently gotten in the open market and thats 
good sen rudy boschwitz rminn said tuesday as the senate 
committee wrapped up the dairy section of the legislation that sets 
farm policy until 1995 
high market prices mean dairy producers make more money selling 
on the open market than to the government at the guaranteed price 
thereby saving the government money and preventing the accumulation 
of surpluses 
this package reflects the midpoint between divergent views on 
the dairy program said sen patrick leahy dvt the 
agriculture committee chairman most of the provisions are the same 
as the house 
we can keep a 1010 price support floor without exceeding 
budget without requiring an assessment without requiring price 
cuts and without going over production leahy said 
he said dairy production has been in line with market demands 
however under the bill the agriculture secretary would take steps 
to reduce dairy production if government dairy surpluses reached 7 
billion pounds 
but under a provision offered by sen max baucus dmont the 
secretary could not use dairy herd slaughtering as a method of 
cutting production 
baucus said cattlemen lose 25 to 30 a head on beef cattle when 
the government buys dairy herds to be slaughtered to reduce the 
milk supply 
the cleanest way not to pit one group against another is to 
make sure there is no buyout said baucus 
the committee also approved a provision that requires the 
agriculture secretary to study whether an excess of milkfat is 
being produced and to consider changing pricing policies if he 
finds that it is a problem 
additionally the bill prohibits any state from offering higher 
price supports than the federal government this provision was 
opposed by sen pete wilson rcalif whose state has such a 
program as an edge against higher production costs 
the measure also authorizes a milk promotion program that would 
be financed by processors

the government is spending billions of 
dollars to boost food production but its an uphill battle iran 
already cant feed itself and its population is multiplying faster 
than indias 
thirty years ago iran was a food exporter now it has to spend 
2 billion to 4 billion a year on food imports thats a third of 
its total import bill 
food subsidies cost another 175 billion a year straining an 
economy that is in poor shape after a decade of mismanagement and 
the 198088 war with iraq 
president hashemi rafsanjanis government has allocated 64 
billion for agricultural development in its its fiveyear plan 
onethird invested by the government and the rest by the private 
sector 
the question is not whether agriculture can be boosted but if 
it can race to keep up with the population a un official said 
under the shah agricultural production did increase but so 
did the population but since the revolution there has been a 
definite downward trend in agriculture said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi launched agricultural 
reforms before he was toppled in the 1979 islamic revolution but 
agricultural production was falling behind population growth long 
before the monarchs ouster 
that trend has accelerated since the revolution despite erratic 
attempts to boost food production 
irans population about 55 million is swelling at the alarming 
rate of 39 percent a year one of the highest in the world by 
comparison indias population is growing at 22 percent and 
chinas is increasing at 14 percent 
if irans current birth rate continues unchecked the population 
will reach 140 million in 20 years 
iranian officials contend that attempts to curb the birth rate 
so far have been halfhearted partly because many shiite moslem 
clergymen maintain that birth control is proscribed by islam 
the mullahs argue that a large population will help iran become 
the leader of the islamic world and ensure its power and prosperity 
the iran statistics center reported in march that the country 
has 138 million acres of arable land but just 39 million acres are 
being cultivated 
the statistics center noted that wheat barley and rice 
production have increased considerably since 1982 but still lag 
behind population growth 
a lot of farmland fell into disuse during the war when funds 
were channeled to the military and an estimated 750000 people a 
year move from the countryside to the cities 
former tehran mayor morteza tabatabaie noted recently that the 
mass migration to the cities has caused irreparable damage to the 
agricultural sector 
until the mid1960s more than onethird of iranians worked on 
farms and the country was able to feed itself today only 
oneeighth of the population works in agriculture and the 
government is hard pressed to keep people on the farm 
the population of tehran the capital has mushroomed from 3 
million a decade ago to around 10 million other cities such as 
isfahan shiraz tabriz and mashhad are bursting at the seams as 
well 
ali a 36yearold construction worker in tehran said his 
family has farmed for generations in northern gilan province but 
he and his three brothers were forced to leave their land because 
they could no longer make a living there 
shortages forced us to buy seeds fertilizers and pesticides 
at exorbitant prices he said as he shared a lunch of bread and 
cheese with two other workers on a tehran construction site 
but when we demanded higher prices for our products we were 
forced to sell at officially designated rates at a loss he 
complained after living with dignity under my fathers roof i 
dont like this life 
to lure farmers back to their villages a massive land reform 
program snarled in the bureacratic morass for years is being 
pushed through parliament 
the program aims to force large landowning government 
organizations to break up their holdings 
redistribution of land has been a political football since the 
revolution with radicals campaigning for breaking up the vast 
estates once owned by the shahs acolytes and conservatives 
insisting they should be left alone 
officials agree that the birth rate should have been checked 
years ago and believe it will be years before it can 
just three years ago the government was offering incentives to 
families to produce children for the jihad or holy war 
against iraq which has a population onethird irans

president bush is heading south for the latest 
in a series of road trips to boost republican election efforts and 
to make a pitch for his moonandmars exploration proposal 
bush was stumping in alabama today for gov guy hunt and in 
north carolina on behalf of sen jesse helms 
in huntsville ala he planned to attend a reception to help 
hunts reelection bid tickets sold for 250 500 and 1000 
while in huntsville bush scheduled a stop at nasas marshall 
space flight center aides said he would use the occasion to urge 
congress to approve his 300 million request for the moonmars 
program in next years budget 
the sum is part of bushs 1991 budget request for 127 billion 
in overall space exploration money including existing programs 
the president announced last july a goal of putting a manned 
spacecraft on mars by 2019 and return manned missions to the moon 
the plan suffered a setback in congress last week when the house 
appropriations subcommittee that handles the national aeronautics 
and space administration slashed the 300 million request from its 
budget draft 
bushs oneday southern swing emphasized electionyear 
politicking however he has spent an increasing amount of time on 
the road across the country to help raise money for his partys 
senate and gubernatorial candidates 
hunt serving his first term as alabama governor faced minor 
opposition in his primary race and is in good shape to face the 
winner of the june 26 democratic runoff race between teachers 
association lobbyist paul hubbert and state attorney general don 
siegelman 
the democrats have been slicing one another up siegelman has 
accused hubbert of being a specialinterest lobbyist whose efforts 
hurt the cause of education hubbert has charged siegelman with 
fiscal irresponsibility and made veiled references to siegelmans 
admission that he smoked marijuana when he was young 
from alabama bush heads to charlotte nc to attend a 
fundraising dinner for conservative stalwart helms who faces a 
close race against democrat harvey gantt a former mayor of 
charlotte 
a recent charlotte observer poll found helms trailing gantt by a 
few percentage points encouraging news for gantt who is black 
was in the 35 percent support he got from white voters polled 
helms was backed by 50 percent of the whites and democratic 
strategists calculate that gantt needs nearly 40 percent of the 
white vote to beat helms 
democrats are hoping to portray helms as a rightwing extremist 
out of touch with his constituents needs 
helms has sent out a fundraising letter alleging gantts 
campaign is backed by the powerful homosexual political lobby

the air force says a further proposed cut in 
purchase of c17 transport planes will cause irretrievable 
damage to a program that congressional investigators charge is 
over budget and behind schedule 
the general accounting office citing delays and manufacturing 
problems with the c17 program urged lawmakers on tuesday to go 
beyond the cuts defense secretary dick cheney proposed in april 
cheney called for slashing the total program from 210 to 120 
planes and reducing the budget request for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 from six planes to two 
based on that cut the air force said tuesday the cost of the 
widebody c17 plane which will replace the current c141 
aircraft will be 249 million each the overall program would cost 
slightly more than 30 billion 
officials of the gao an investigative arm of congress told a 
senate armed services subcommittee that congress should consider 
further reductions in the fiscal 1991 buy and advance purchase for 
six planes in fiscal 1992 
this could provide an opportunity to further reduce 
concurrency in the program by having the air force limit production 
commitments until the critical elements of a realistic and 
achievable flight test program are completed and any identified 
problems resolved said nancy r kingsbury of the gao 
she did not say whether gao was recommending that the air force 
purchase no c17s or just one next year 
the air force plant representative assigned to the manufacturer 
mcdonnell douglas corp believes the company cannot product the 
aircraft to either budgeted cost or planned schedule ms 
kingsbury told the projection forces subcommittee 
the air force representative concluded that the absence of an 
organized system at the manufacturer resulted in late designs 
shortages of parts late deliveries and unacceptable quality the 
gao said 
these problems caused a delay in the first flight of the 
aircraft from august 1990 to at least june 1991 and an 11 percent 
increase in cost from the 375 billion to 418 billion for the 
original plan of 210 planes 
air force maj gen stephen croker said any additional cuts in 
the program along the lines of zero production in fiscal 1991 would 
cause irretrievable damage to the c17 program 
croker director of strategic and airlift programs and special 
operations forces said he agreed in part with the gaos assessment 
but questioned the implications that delays on the first plane will 
continue throughout the program 
by the ninth aircraft the program will be as little as two 
months late by the 12th aircraft the program will be on 
schedule said croker who added that the manufacturer has made 
significant improvements since november 
but sen edward kennedy dmass the subcommittee chairman 
questioned whether lawmakers can accept the air forces assessment 
that everything is hunkydory based on recent changes by the 
mcdonnell douglas 
croker argued that by abandoning the current plan for two planes 
in fiscal 1991 the government will lose much of the projects work 
force in addition he said parts already under construction would 
have to be stored with some likely to disintegrate 
the gao proposal does not improve employee learning it 
does save dollars in fiscal 1991 but those costs will be greater 
in 1992 the general said

about 600000 military and civilian workers 
would be cut from the pentagons payroll if the armed forces are 
reduced by onefourth over the next five years says defense 
secretary dick cheney 
even under president bushs military spending plan criticized 
on capitol hill as far too high a smaller military is coming 
cheney told reporters tuesday as he compared several options for 
military cuts 
even under the presidents program were still going to have 
to take some steps that probably will result in forcing people out 
who would like to stay the secretary said 
we are not going to have as large a military in the future as 
we have today and somehow youve got to shrink the force to get 
there 
cheney attempting to stave off even more severe budgetcutting 
proposals from the house and senate argued at budget negotiations 
that a 25 percent cut in forces could save 86 billion over five 
years 
this would result in retiring six activeduty army divisions 
111 navy ships and 11 air force tactical fighter wings it would 
remove 442000 men and women from the militarys 21 million active 
duty ranks over the next five years as well as civilian workers 
and members of the national guard and reserves he said 
the total if you add it up is almost 6000000 military 
and civilian personnel cheney said 
cheneys proposal would reduce the fiscal 1991 defense budget 
bush submitted in january from 3033 billion to 302 billion over 
five years it would cut 86 billion from bushs proposal 
the secretary charged that house and senate plans could end up 
closing up to half the us militarys installations around the 
world and lay off more than 1 million of the pentagons 31 million 
civilian and military work force 
the houses proposal to cut pentagon spending to 2954 billion 
would require a 35 percent cut in troop levels while the senate 
budget committee plan for a 2939 billion level would force a 50 
percent slash in force strength the defense chief said 
such cuts would do serious damage to the nations military 
cheney contended arguing that the result would be unbalanced 
forces units that are undermanned in some key areas 
cheneys figures dissatisfied many congressional democrats who 
attended the budget talks they contended that the numbers amount 
to a savings of only about 10 percent 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
argued that cheney could have made different decisions in the 
structure of the military that could have yielded savings of 18 
percent to 27 percent 
they have made a set of policy choices to get there that i 
think are awfully cautious aspin dwis told reporters its 
quite clear from this exercise that we are nowhere near an 
agreement on the budget 
cheney for his part insisted his numbers were meant as an 
illustration not an offer to budget negotiators 
but he acknowledged they represent the clearest outline yet made 
public of how the pentagon can shape its forces in response to the 
reduced soviet threat and the lessened chance of a land war in 
europe amid the collapse of the warsaw pact 
the defense budget is seen as a major source of savings as the 
negotiators search for 45 billion to 60 billion in new taxes or 
spending cuts before fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1

dogs exposed in vietnam to the same chemical 
sprays as us soldiers developed almost twice as many tumors of 
the testicles as military dogs that served only in the united 
states federal investigators report 
in a study published today in the journal of the national cancer 
institute researchers said the increased number of testicular 
cancers among canine veterans of vietnam may predict the 
development of such tumors among american servicemen who served in 
the same country 
the dog is a sentinel model for man said howard m hayes a 
national cancer institute researcher and coauthor of the report 
he could be used to foretell the risks for exposure to the same 
chemical insults encountered by soldiers in vietnam 
hayes and his coauthors examined autopsy records for dogs that 
served with american troops in vietnam from 1968 to 1973 they also 
examined autopsy records of dogs that served in vietnam and later 
died elsewhere 
these records then were compared with those of military dogs 
that served only in the united states japan korea and thailand 
hayes said the dogs serving in vietnam had 80 percent more 
testis tumors of all kinds than did dogs that served only in the 
united states the vietnam dogs also had 90 percent more seminomas 
a malignant tumor of the testis 
dogs serving in korea japan and thailand had fewer of both 
types of tumors than did the us dogs 
to further verify the risks hayes said his group examined 
records of 96 male dogs that served in vietnam and died elsewhere 
between 1974 and 1978 these records were compared with those of 
dogs that served only in the united states and died during the same 
period 
we observed the 96 vietnam veteran military working dogs to 
have significant excess risk for seminoma which supported the 
findings in the earlier period the report said 
additionally the study showed that dogs that served in vietnam 
had 70 percent to 100 percent more testicular dysfunction than did 
dogs that served only in the united states 
hayes said about 99 percent of the military dogs in the study 
were german shepherds a breed that has a predisposition to 
testicular tumors 
as a result he said the dogs may be a particularly sensitive 
sentinel for exposures leading to increase seminoma risk in man 
dogs in vietnam hayes said served sidebyside with infantry 
troops and were exposed to the same chemical sprays such as the 
herbicide agent orange as were the soldiers 
unlike most of the humans however the dogs tours in vietnam 
were not limited to one year 
additionally hayes said the dogs in vietnam were treated 
several times with tetracycline an antibiotic used to control a 
tickborne parasitic disease the tetracycline the study said 
may have contributed to the increased risk of testicular 
problems 
veterans groups have contended for years that soldiers who 
served in vietnam have experienced more cancers and other ailments 
as a result of their exposure to chemical sprays while in vietnam 
agent orange an herbicide widely used to defoliate the jungle has 
come under particular attack by veterans groups as the cause of 
cancers and skin ailments 
the department of veterans affairs announced earlier this year 
that it would provide compensation to vietnam veterans who have 
nonhodgkins lymphoma or softtissue sarcoma two cancers that 
have been associated with chemicals in agent orange 
adm elmo r zumwalt jr a special adviser to veterans 
secretary edward j derwinski said in an interview that there now 
is no compensation provided to vietnam veterans who develop 
testicular cancers he said the new study may cause tumors of the 
testis to be considered as possibly servicerelated illnesses for 
vietnam veterans 
ive already recommended that testicular cancer be included 
and this the hayes study is powerful evidence in support of it 
he said 
zumwalt had a son who served in vietnam and later died of 
cancer which zumwalt attributed to agent orange

a senior house banking committee member is 
demanding that federal regulators spell out their charges against 
president bushs son neil in the 1 billion collapse of silverado 
banking savings and loan association 
neil bush is a former director of the denver thrift which 
failed in 1988 
the office of thrift supervision noted that it said in january 
it was bringing administrative charges against bush and had since 
done so but it would not give details 
no law or regulation prevents the agency from revealing the 
charges rep frank annunzio dill said tuesday during the 
latest hearing by the house banking committee on the failure of 
silverado 
can any agency of the united states fairly and impartially 
investigate the son of the president of the united states 
annunzio asked it should make those charges public 
an unsigned undated internal ots document released by the 
committee alleged that bush willfully breached his duty as a 
director and recommended that he be barred from the industry 
but william fulwider a spokesman for the regulators said the 
document cited by annunzio was a draft after it was written he 
said the agency found there was not sufficient evidence to support 
a prohibition and a less serious cease and desist order was 
proposed 
bush 34 denied any wrongdoing in voluntary testimony before 
the committee on may 23 the panel had been probing whether his 
business interests in colorado conflicted with his role as a 
director of silverado he called allegations of conflict of 
interest frivolous 
fulwider said a cease and desist order against bush had been 
proposed by ots which said in january it would do so but the 
proposal of the order was not made public 
such an order would bar bush from engaging in future actions 
that would involve a conflict of interest fulwider said 
there is no question that we have brought charges he said 
he declined to say where the proposed order stands in the agencys 
procedure he did not say why his agency had not detailed its 
accusations against bush 
five other former officers and directors of silverado including 
former chairman michael r wise have consented to orders banning 
them from the financial institutions industry 
the ots document alleges that bush failed to disclose his 
business relationships to the other directors including the fact 
that one of his business partners developer kenneth good had 
committed to invest more than 3 million in bushs oil exploration 
company 
at the same time it said the directors were being told that 
good probably would not be able to fully repay his loans from 
silverado 
bush has said he abstained on all directors votes involving 
good

even as a free man nelson mandela cant 
escape the constraints of security 
the state departments office of diplomatic security is mounting 
its largestever protective operation for the african national 
congress leader who spent 27 years in south africa behind bars 
mandela 71 arriving in new york today spent part of his time 
in jail on robbin island a notorious prison off the coast of cape 
town treacherous seas make escape virtually impossible 
although mandela is not an official government visitor 
taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the blanket of security 
said meg ravnholt a department spokeswoman she did not give a 
cost estimate 
the law gives secretary of states james a baker iii the right 
to approve security for visiting dignitaries who are private 
citizens such as mandela solidarity leader lech walesa and the 
queen of england 
just the sheer number of people who are turning out for these 
events would qualify him for protection ravnholt said 
for about a month agents trained in methods similar to the 
secret service have fanned out across the country to arrange 
security for mandela he will visit eight cities in 11 days 
the agents will handle everything from the moment he lands 
until the moment he leaves ravnholt said 
one of the biggest security challenges comes today when 
thousands turn out for a tickertape parade through lower manhattan 
a mandela mobile a flatbed truck with a bulletproof 
glassenclosed area large enough for mandela his wife winnie and 
four aides was specially designed for the parade through lower 
manhattan 
undercover agents were being sent into the crowd and rooftops 
along the way were being guarded by uniformed emergency service 
unit sharpshooters said police sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mandela will also speak at public rallies in harlem and yonkers 
during his fourday stay in new york where authorities have 
mounted operation topaz with 12000 officers the cost is 
expected to be in the 2 million range 
i dont think there is one worst security problem said 
police spokesman capt robert cividanes you look at the areas 
that hes going to be in is there one worst thats difficult to 
say 
during his public appearances police and federal agents will 
form a 75foot security zone around the silverhaired statesman to 
keep him at a safe distance 
after arriving at john f kennedy airport mandela was being 
escorted by 40car motorcade from the queens airport to brooklyn to 
meet with students at boys and girls high school 
officials said streets and roads would be closed hours before

the fbi has documented at least 25 cases of 
harassment and intimidation of chinese students by their own 
government in the united states but the state department does not 
believe that is grounds for sanctions against beijing a department 
official says 
rep stephen solarz dny reacting to information given in a 
closeddoor fbi briefing called the administrations position 
shocking and bluntly told the official im not sure were 
living in the same universe 
solarz said the briefing clearly showed a consistent pattern of 
intimidation that requires sanctions under a law he wrote nine 
years ago 
the bush administration has announced its intention to renew 
mostfavorednation trading status for china almost exactly a year 
after beijings bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
and around tiananmen square 
kent wiedemann director of the state departments office of 
chinese affairs said the contacts with students involved 
relatively few of the chinese embassy and consular officials in the 
united states and represented a very sporadic pattern 
they were mostly in 1989 in the summer and fall and have 
dwindled to basically nothing by the beginning of this year 
wiedemann told a joint hearing of solarzs asia subcommittee and 
the human rights subcommittee of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
the contacts usually involved threats or implied threats of 
consequences for students when they return to china or to their 
families if they continued prodemocracy activities he said 
but they were sufficiently few in number and sufficiently 
indirect as to not be a consistent pattern as the law defines it 
he said

william k reilly administrator of the 
environmental protection agency says he will recommend that 
president bush veto clean air legislation if the final bill 
contains a jobs protection amendment when it reaches the white 
house 
i consider it bad environmental policy bad social policy and 
bad economic policy reilly said tuesday in discussing a 
provision that would assist workers who lose their jobs because of 
the tougher air pollution requirements 
both the senate and house are preparing for a conference 
committee to work out differences in largely similar bills to 
strengthen federal clean air laws for the first time in 13 years 
one of the differences involves an amendment in the house bill 
that would allow for 250 million to be spent in added unemployment 
compensation and retraining for workers if forced out of their jobs 
by the new legislation 
the administration says this could force industry spending well 
above the 21 billion or so annually called for by the senate 
version partly because it would be extremely difficult to tell 
whether a job had been lost because of the provisions of the 
legislation 
reilly said his objections to this jobs proposal sponsored by 
rep bob wise dwva were strong enough that he would recommend 
that the president veto the entire bill if that section is not 
removed by the conference committee 
the jobs issues is certain to be one of the main battles in the 
conference committee debate an aid package in the senate sponsored 
by sen robert byrd dwva lost by only one vote byrds 
amendment would have helped only coal miners while the less costly 
wise amendment expands the assistance to workers in all industries

the massacre of eight people by a man with a rifle 
could undercut the powerful gun lobby at a time when florida voters 
are considering a constitutional amendment imposing a threeday 
wait on handgun purchases 
anytime you have a tragedy those people with hidden agendas 
see any and every emotional opportunity to try to justify their 
erroneous position and try to deprive the people of their rights 
said marian hammer spokeswoman for the national rifle 
associations florida branch 
the debate over the amendment on novembers ballot intensified 
after james edward pough 42 a day laborer killed eight people 
monday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with a 
revolver at an auto loan agency police said pough also killed two 
people on the street sunday with the rifle 
how many messages do we send to the congress how many to the 
state legislature jacksonville mayor tommy hazouri said tuesday 
if it means seeking changes were going to do that 
state rep ron silver chairman of the house criminal justice 
committee said the fact the waiting period is being settled by a 
referendum rather than a vote in the legislature shows many 
lawmakers still fear the nras clout 
but he added that polls indicate heavy support for the 
amendment and he said passage could give legislators confidence to 
pass other guncontrol laws 
i think florida is waking up silver said 
california passed an assault weapons bill in 1989 in the 
aftermath of the stockton calif schoolyard spree by a drifter 
with an ak47 assault rifle who killed five children and wounded 30 
other people president bush approved an import ban on assault 
weapons and a senate bill would extend the ban to domestic 
manufacture of four weapons identified as used mainly in drug 
violence 
florida has tackled gun legislation several times in recent 
years 
a 1987 law removed gun registration from county control in favor 
of statewide registration rules a law taking effect oct 1 
requires gun sellers to check all applicants through a crime 
computer in tallahassee 
but lawmakers on a study commission on assault weapons failed to 
agree on which weapons should be banned 
us rep bill nelson a democrat running for governor has 
called banning assault weapons a priority 
it is harder to rent a car in florida than it is to buy an 
ak47 he said during a debate monday before he knew of the 
shooting spree a nelson aide needed less than 10 minutes to walk 
into a miami gun shop and come out with an ak47 and ammunition 
last month 
gov bob martinez a republican seeking reelection said 
tuesday the law requiring a background check by gun dealers is a 
responsible step but at the same time we must maintain the 
freedom to own guns which have useful sporting purposes 
poughs 30caliber semiautomatic rifle would be banned under 
new jerseys monthold law on assault weapons considered the 
nations toughest because its clip held more than 15 rounds 
nelson wants a sevenday waiting period on handgun purchases 
democratic frontrunner lawton chiles also supports a waiting 
period 
now gun purchasers are required to have some identification 
such as a drivers license and fill out a questionnaire on 
arrests mental illness and drug use 
but there is no way for merchants to confirm the information 
other than by investigating on their own 
it is illegal in florida for a convicted felon to own a handgun 
but technically pough wasnt a convicted felon 
in 1971 he was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death 
of a man he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced 
to five years probation court records show after probation his 
record was wiped clean 
that made it legal for pough to own a gun under florida law 
its a loophole we need to plug up jacksonville sheriff jim 
mcmillan said

a federal judge ruled that thousands of 
purported heirs to the spindletop oilfield fortune have no claim to 
the land or the estimated 200 billion generated since the first 
gusher blew there in 1901 
us district judge howell cobbs ruling tuesday was the latest 
in a series of lawsuits brought by wouldbe heirs against oil 
companies that have developed the tract that brought about the 
texas oil boom at the turn of the century 
cobb ruled in favor of amoco production inc mobil oil corp 
phillips petroleum co texaco inc and chevron inc 
the lawsuit was filed by four relatives who claimed kinship to 
pelham humphries and asked for 200 billion the relatives had 
sought to have their case declared a classaction suit on behalf of 
numerous other heirs 
brown peregoy representing 3000 members of the humphries heirs 
trust association contended pelham humphries received a grant to 
the spindletop property from the mexican government in 1835 and 
left no will 
the judge ruled however that humphries conveyed the grant to 
william inglish whose heirs conveyed it to william mcfaddin in 
1883 
this court desperately desires that the ghost of pelham 
humphries will no longer haunt the halls of the united states court 
system cobb wrote the pelham humphries litigation is over 
requiescat in pace rest in peace 
spindletop still an active oilfield caused a boom that moved 
the oil industry from the north to the southwest its first six 
wells produced more oil in their first year than had been produced 
in the united states up to that time 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals held in favor of the oil 
companies in the 1950s and 1960s 
the judge will decide later whether to order the plaintiffs to 
pay legal fees as a penalty for bringing claims that the oil claims 
said had been decided already

a 9yearold turkish girl is going home four 
years and seven operations after coming to the united states for 
treatment of a birth defect that left her eyes covered with skin 
dilek erdogan is still blind but acrylic implants have made her 
look more like other children and given her the confidence she 
lacked when her face had just a nose and a mouth 
when she coming here you can no touch her said matt 
deletioglu the turkish native and former chicago restaurateur who 
has made the girls treatment a personal crusade she fill with 
fear she shaking you touch her and she scream and scream 
now he said she look like normal human being like other 
child she now believing in herself she wants to walk with you 
dilek who lives in an apartment a half block from deletioglus 
house will rejoin her father in istanbul with her mother guldane 
and her 7yearold brother ozan by the end of june deletioglu 
said 
i am very happy dilek said i am going home miss father 
i miss grandfather grandmother and aunt i miss my home 
dilek was born with skin covering her eyes a condition called 
cryptophthalmos or hidden eye deletioglu a native of antioch 
turkey decided to help dilek after he saw her picture in a 
newspaper from his homeland 
two doctors at the university of illinois hospital allen 
putterman and joel sugar agreed to donate their services leaving 
only hospital bills to be paid by deletioglu or through donations 
putterman surgically built eye sockets and an eyelid for the 
girl two years ago but doctors were unable to restore her sight 
the left eye was badly scarred and was replaced with an 
artificial one an operation to implant a cornea in her right eye 
failed because she had no iris or pupil 
putterman said tuesday that doctors had considered another 
procedure that would have allowed her to see shapes and forms 
called kerotoprosthesis it would involve implanting something like 
a little telescope into the eye 
but he said the implant could have become infected and that 
could threaten the whole eye 
hopefully in the future somebody will develop something that 
will allow her to see without the risk of the eye being infected 
and completely lost he said 
the surgeon also said it was promising that dileks eye sockets 
are still intact that i think allowed her to get into the 
social world go to school be accepted by her peers he 
said that was a very big step for her 
dilek is more like a normal happy child than before the 
operations said deletioglu she attends special education classes 
in a city school she laughs and plays 
deletioglu said he was unsure of the cost of dileks treatments 
but he said more than 20000 came from armitage baptist church 
on sunday dilek visited the church to thank god and the 300 
members present for their love and moral support 
everyone was crying over there said deletioglu 
dileks family hopes to return in 10 years if doctors have 
developed a procedure to implant real eyes by then 
meanwhile deletioglu said he hopes to stay in touch with the 
girl who is now like a daughter to him 
at least now she has confidence with herself he said at 
least she have good start now

homeowners a barkeep and bikers who lost 
vintage harleydavidsons were among flood victims who reported to a 
disaster relief center after a flash flood that killed at least 21 
people 
thirteen people were still listed as missing 
the army corps of engineers today planned to begin removing 
about 15 acres of debris backed up on the ohio river at the 
hannibal dam and locks about 25 miles south of here 
workers for various agencies handed out about 100 aid 
applications tuesday 
bruce connor 33 said he and two other members of the sentinels 
motorcycle club came to apply for money to replace 
harleydavidsons the club is in the backwoods along pipe creek 
which was deluged by rain thursday 
some of those bikes were collectors items probably worth a 
lot of money we had harleys from the 1920s and 30s bikes my 
father and his father had and tools they used to work on them 
connor said 
gene neiditch of the federal emergency management agency said 
the sentinels may qualify for relief if the motorcycles were for 
transportation and work but not if they were luxuries 
ken gibbons 41 who crawled into his attic to escape a 25foot 
wall of water said that his losses totaled 300000 but that he 
could recover only about 10400 in government grants 
they send money freely overseas to other countries but dont 
want to do anything to help people here gibbons said he vowed 
never to work again so he wouldnt have to pay income taxes

ive had that 15 years he said and everybody in this town 
came down there for entertainment

weeks the agency estimated 700 homes were damaged or destroyed

republican pierre rinfret the political 
neophyte challenging the reelection bid of gov mario cuomo is 
starting out on the defensive amid reports he exaggerated his 
academic and political credentials 
rinfret who heads an international economic consulting firm 
has presented himself as holding a doctorate and having turned down 
offers to join president nixons cabinet 
but the new york times on tuesday reported that rinfret never 
earned a doctorate and that some former nixon administration 
officials were unaware of any offers of cabinet posts 
rinfret 66 was nominated at the state gop convention last 
month the millionaire economist was chosen after an 11month 
effort by the gop to persuade betterknown republicans to run 
against the popular twoterm democrat 
even rinfrets political affiliation has been a source of 
controversy 
it was not until last week that he registered as a republican 
while rinfret had earlier told reporters and gop leaders that he 
was a republican and had voted in republican primaries election 
board records dating to 1976 showed rinfret wasnt enrolled in any 
party he said he had made a mistake 
on tuesday the times reported rinfret never earned a doctorate 
even though he has used the title dr rinfret on resumes legal 
documents and biographies 
a biography rinfret distributed at the gop convention last month 
cited him 13 times as dr rinfret however a biography 
distributed last week by rinfret had replaced all dr rinfret 
references with mr rinfret 
rinfret said he had been told by a french diplomatic official 
that the diploma he received from the university of dijon in france 
in 1946 could be called a doctorate university officials said it 
was the equivalent of an american masters degree 
rinfret said that even if the dijon diploma isnt a doctorate 
he can claim the title because he received an honorary doctor of 
laws degree from pepperdine university in 1973 
in response to the newspaper report that several top nixon aides 
were unaware rinfret had been seriously considered for any cabinet 
positions the candidate tuesday produced a statement from nixon in 
his defense 
as president i had hoped that he would join my administration 
as a member of the council of economic advisers or later as a 
member of my cabinet said the statement 
the candidate canceled his only scheduled public appearance 
tuesday a fundraising dinner in albany to benefit state assembly 
republicans 
aides to cuomo wouldnt comment on the flap 
other new york gubernatorial candidates did 
it matters it matters a great deal said conservative party 
candidate herbert london its a question of character and a 
question of what this person is actually bringing to the table in 
the way of credentials 
he has what we euphemistically called in the marine corps 
hoofinmouth disease said louis wein the righttolife party 
candidate 
wein is circulating petitions in an attempt to challenge rinfret 
in a sept 11 primary for the gop nomination 
assemblyman john faso an republican named rinfrets campaign 
manager monday said he wasnt certain if the newspaper report 
would have any lasting impact 
it doesnt help it but its important to get these things out 
of the way in june rather than in september faso said

opening a new round of peace talks 
salvadoran rebel leaders are sticking to their longstanding demands 
that the rightist government slash its military and rid the ranks 
of alleged death squad leaders 
speaking to reporters before tuesdays opening session 
guerrilla commander shafik handal called the issue of a reduced 
salvadoran military the gordian knot that needs cutting to bring 
peace to our country 
col mauricio vargas spokesman for the government of president 
alfredo cristiani declined comment on handals statement 
the unmediated discussions expected to last eight days are 
aimed at moving closer to a goal negotiators proposed in caracas 
venezuela last month a september ceasefire in el salvadors 
10yearold civil war 
rights groups estimate 73000 people have been killed since the 
war began in october 1979 most of them suspected leftists slain by 
death squads 
since then the united states has been supporting a succession 
of governments with military and economic aid now averaging more 
than 1 million a day el salvador has about 55000 military 
personnel dominated by rightwing officers 
alvaro de soto un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars 
personal representative who is mediating the talks between the 
leftist farabundo marti national liberation front and the 
government in this mountain resort outside mexico city said the 
discussion has been cordial and respectful 
david escobar legal adviser for the government delegation said 
the first session is on a good track where both side are 
presenting their viewpoints with optimism 
rebel commander roberto canas described them as just normal 
canas said the guerrilla front also demanded punishment for 
those responsible for a series of political slayings by rightist 
death squads during the countrys decadeold civil war 
escobar said six issues were on the list armed forces human 
rights economic problems and reforms in judicial electoral 
systems and in the constititution 
i dont think that were going to arrive at spectacular 
agreements like a ceasefire or incorporation of the guerrillas 
into civilian life at the mexico meeting escobar said anyway 
we have until sept 15 to live up to the caracas accords 
during five days of talks last month in venezuela the two sides 
agreed on an agenda and a tentative calendar to negotiate an end to 
the war committing themselves to try for a ceasefire by 
midseptember 
talks with the cristiani government in june and september 1989 
broke off when the guerrillas mounted attacks on san salvador in 
november in which more than 2000 people were killed 
three rounds of peace talks under the christian democratic 
administration of the late president jose napoleon duarte in 1984 
and 1987 ended in deadlock

folklore holds that this village along 
the ohio river got its name from railroad conductors who suggested 
that passengers get off on the shady side of the tracks 
a pamphlet found in a library says james leasure planted 
evergreens along the road to his farm and hung a sign reading 
shady side at his gate opposite the railroad platform in the 
1870s 
eventually it became known as the shadyside stop said 
belmont county coroners investigator chuck vogt its just a 
nice middleclass america town 
but its also a town that has seen hard times even before last 
weeks flash flooding killed at least 21 people and left 13 missing 
the southeastern ohio county lies in the coal and steel country 
of the appalachian foothills its heavily wooded hills are dotted 
with bedroom and retirement communities for the mills and mines of 
wheeling wva and western pennsylvania 
because of the closing of many many coal mines and the 
reduction and closing of some steel mills the population has been 
declining said martins ferry library director john wp storck 
the average age in belmont county is increasing too 
figures from the 1980 census show belmont countys population 
grew from 80917 in 1970 to 82569 in 1980 but the figures are 
still below the 1940 peak of 95614 
figures from the 1990 census are not yet available but are 
expected to reflect a further decline storck said 
shadyside classified as a city until the 1980 census had to be 
reincorporated as a village because its population count of 4300 
was 700 below the ohio cutoff for a city 
figures in a 1989 report compiled by washingtonbased woods amp 
poole economics inc show the average age of the countys residents 
is about 327 years compared with the statewide average of 299 
the report predicts the average will increase to 374 in 1995 and 
411 by 2010 
but there has been little change in the character of shadyside 
residents said sandy wallace who grew up in bellaire and reports 
on the area for the martins ferry timesleader 
everybody knows everybody else and thats why this flood has 
become such a devastating emotional issue she said 
theres this quality of giving and openness a very closeknit 
and neighborly situation she said and thats something that 
ive noticed has really come to the fore in the past few days 
donations of food clothing technical assistance and labor for 
the backbreaking process of debris removal came from all over 
southeastern ohio western pennsylvania and northern west virginia 
so much clothing was donated that authorities ran out of storage

a federal judge has ordered an inventory of 
medieval artwork believed stolen by a us soldier from a german 
mineshaft during world war ii and stashed in a smalltown bank 
vault in texas 
us district judge sidney a fitzwater ordered tuesday that the 
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the 
inspectors and the objects which have been valued in the millions 
by german art experts 
the lutheran cathedral in quedlinburg east germany is suing to 
recover the artwork from the first national bank in whitewright and 
the family of joe t meador 
meador a former army lieutenant is believed to have stolen the 
objects and stashed them in his hometown of whitewright about 60 
miles north of dallas 
the treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in 
quedlinburg a castle town occupied by us troops at the end of 
world war ii meador died of cancer in 1980 and his family put the 
objects in the bank for safekeeping said branch president john 
farley 
farley said he never knew the art had been stolen and had been 
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership we wanted to do 
what was right he said 
government officials have said it is unclear whether charges can 
be brought in the case because of statutes of limitations on thefts 
of art 
the judge on tuesday dictated the circumstances of the inventory 
down to the type of flash to be used in photographing the items 
the placement of the cameras and a requirement that all inspectors 
wear cotton gloves 
the lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects were taken by meador 
including a silver ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th 
century a 10th century byzantine rockcrystal flask and an ivory 
comb inlaid with precious stones 
also listed as stolen are two manuscripts one from about 1300 
and the other from 1515 bound in precious metals and encrusted 
with gems 
meadors brother and sister jack meador of whitewright and jane 
meador cook of mesquite have refused to comment 
farley said the bank will ask to be dropped from the lawsuit 
because first national never claimed to own the relics

the countrys white parliament 
has repealed a segregation law that for decades allowed public and 
private facilities to exclude blacks 
the repeal of the separate amenities act on tuesday was the 
latest in a series of reforms by de president fw de klerk since 
he came to power last year the changes have angered conservative 
whites who oppose the idea of sharing power with the black majority 
the separate amenities act passed in 1953 gave government and 
privately owned enterprises the right to reserve facilities such as 
parks hotels swimming pools libraries toilets and recreation 
centers for whites only 
not affect by the act are neighborhoods and schools the main 
institutions still segregated under the governments apartheid laws 
tony leon an antiapartheid member of parliament who voted to 
scrap the measure said 37 years of segregated facilities had given 
the country a disfigured human landscape 
jan hoon of the proapartheid conservative party opposed repeal 
of the measure saying it was another step down the road to black 
rule 
in major cities such as johannesburg cape town and durban 
public facilities have been integrated for years but in hundreds 
of smaller towns and villages there have been no public facilities 
for blacks or vastly inferior segregated ones 
at parliament in cape town de klerks ruling national party and 
the antiapartheid democratic party outvoted the conservative party 
to scrap the law 10538 the mixedrace and indian chambers of 
parliament voted unanimously for repeal the countrys 28 million 
blacks have no voice in national affairs 
de klerk in february promised to scrap the separate amenities 
act he says he wants to end racial discrimination and negotiate a 
new constitution that will bring blacks into the national 
government 
however he opposes a oneman onevote majorityrule system 
saying it would replace white domination with black domination the 
president envisions a mechanism that would give whites veto power 
on major policy decisions 
de klerk has promised that next year the government will amend 
the group areas act that segregates neighborhoods by race he 
opposes full repeal of the measure and appears to favor a system 
that would allow some neighborhoods to be integrated and others to 
remain segregated 
the government has given no indication it plans to integrate 
public schools although many private schools are multiracial 
since taking office in september de klerk has legalized dozens 
of black opposition groups permitted peaceful protests freed 
scores of political prisoners suspended the death penalty and 
ended segregation on beaches and in hospitals 
the latest change came a day before black nationalist leader 
nelson mandela was to arrive in the united states he is in the 
midst of a foreign tour urging countries to continue sanctions 
against south africas government until it ends apartheid 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress was 
freed from prison in february after serving 27 years for plotting 
against the south african government 
de klerk has argued that the reforms show that his country is 
changing and he has urged foreign countries to lift economic 
sanctions

donald trumps major bank leaders have 
tentatively agreed to give him a little breathing room the new 
york times reported today 
the four lead banks agreed to lend him 65 million and defer 
interest and principal payments on about 850 million of the 3 
billion in debt the developer ran up in building his real estate 
and gambling empire the newspaper said 
but the package would be secured by nearly every asset in 
trumps empire and the agreement hinges on getting other lenders 
particularly japanese banks to agree the newspaper said citing 
unidentified people involved in the talks 
trump has about 1 billion in junk bond debt in addition to 
roughly 2 billion in bank debt and is said to be in a cash crunch 
his lenders are worried his properties arent generating enough 
cash to handle his debts 
trump missed a roughly 43 million payment due last friday on 
junk bonds used to finance the purchase of trump castle one of his 
three atlantic city hotelcasinos but he has a grace period for 
making the payment 
the banks and trumps spokesman dan klores refused to comment 
on the talks the four banks are citicorp manufacturers hanover 
corp chase manhattan corp and bankers trust co 
the developer also has not yet made a 30 million debt payment 
due manufacturers hanover corp 
the restructuring plan is aimed at helping trump to keep making 
debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in value so some 
could be sold 
his assets which include hotels and office and apartment 
buildings in new york have fallen in value because of the slumping 
real estate and casino markets his trump shuttle also has posted 
disappointing results

france west germany belgium the 
netherlands and luxembourg have agreed to allow people to move 
freely across their shared borders in a pact hailed as a model for 
the entire 12nation european community 
the five countries signed the agreement tuesday and it will 
include east germany after the expected reunification if the two 
germanys the required ratification by the nations parliaments may 
take two years 
the longawaited accord was in the works sinced 1985 its 
signatories agreed to end border checks have a common visa and 
asylum policy and share data on illegal aliens suspected criminals 
and missing persons 
our agreement is a model for the free movement of people 
in the european community dutch deputy foreign minister piet 
dankert told reporters on behalf of the signatory nations 
yet he doubted all 12 of the european communitys nations were 
ready to remove their borders after dec 31 1992 when the 
countries are to merge their economies to create a single 
barrierfree market 
the 12 ec states have not even reached agreement on how to 
handle asylumseekers 
negotiations are to open this week with italy which wants to 
join the schengen accord named for this village on the 
luxembourggermanfrench border where it was signed 
under the accord the five signatory nations will 
remove internal border checks for their citizens and legal 
residents and let legally admitted people from outside the five 
nations move within their boundaries for three months without a 
visa 
apply a joint policy to prevent asylum shopping whereby 
refugees go from one nation to the next to get residency visas 
intensify cooperation between police and justice officials and 
allow police to chase suspected criminals across national 
boundaries 
simplify extradition procedures and harmonize guncontrol 
legislation 
share information on people wanted or missing or who are 
considered dangerous such a databank will also keep tabs on such 
items as stolen cars and passports 
the schengen agreement primarily benefits passenger traffic on 
road transport the five ec nations pledged to keep border checks 
at the lowest possible level by removing some of the red tape 
that hampers road transporters 
the agreement allows any state to revert to fullfledged border 
checks on national security grounds 
reflecting the sensitive nature of dropping border controls 
tuesdays signing ceremony was three years behind schedule 
in past negotiations the issue has encountered several hurdles 
ranging from luxembourgs refusal to water down its bank secrecy 
laws to concerns elsewhere that the computer databank may lead to 
an invasion of privacy

the kansas city evening news a modest 
new tabloid in a city that recently lost its afternoon daily is 
calling it quits today after 27 issues 
publisher stephen f rose on tuesday blamed the papers demise 
on city officials who refused to allow teenagers to hawk the 
tabloid on the street 
we were forced to make a very painful decision to go down in 
history as perhaps the only paper to close while making money 
rose said we simply wouldnt be making any money if we had to 
convert to home delivery 
rose launched the evening news on may 14 two months after the 
afternoon kansas city star merged with the morning kansas city 
times to form the morningonly star rose put startup costs at 
250000 
analysts had predicted the evening news would have a difficult 
time in a city dominated by star which has a daily circulation of 
about 300000 
the evening news with 10 fulltime employees averaged 32 pages 
a day and used mostly wire service reports on national and 
international news rose president of a familyowned group of 18 
suburban weekly papers was the sole investor 
tuesdays announcement came only a week after rose had said the 
50cent tabloid sold on the street and at newsracks and in stores 
was selling 15000 copies a day and making several thousand 
dollars a week in profit 
but rose said that some suburbs had ordinances against street 
sales and that kansas city also cracked down on the street 
hawkers ticketing one and forcing others off medians city 
officials cited safety and traffic concerns 
i think the safety issue was overblown although i understand 
the concerns of city officials rose said the fact is hawkers 
are utilized all over the country successfully and safely 
the evening news was the second unsuccessful attempt to start a 
metropolitan newspaper in the kansasmissouri area in recent 
months ralph ingersoll ii launched the st louis sun in september 
but closed it in april citing low circulation

researchers have broken down a 155digit 
number into three numbers that cannot be further divided raising 
concerns about the safety of computer programs used by banks and 
the military 
scientists at bell communications research in morris township 
said tuesday they came up with three factors of the number dubbed 
the worlds most wanted number after using about 1000 
computers during a fiveweek period one of the factors is seven 
digits one 49 and the third is a 99digit number 
arjen lenstra a member of bellcores technical staff worked 
with mark manasse of digital equipment corp of palo alto calif 
to break the number down lenstra says the effort shows that 
tampering with certain computer messages encoded in 150digit 
numbers is possible 
the fact that we are able to figure this number shows that 
others are less safe than previously thought lenstra said 
but the significance of the development for major institutions 
such as banks and the military that use large numbers to encode 
computer messages was downplayed by david kahn author of the 
codebreakers 
kahn said that in most code systems both the sender and receiver 
of information have the same system and key 
in the widely used cryptographic system the research applies to 
the encoding and decoding keys differ 
the keys are related mathematically through a number that is 
usually the product of two large prime numbers the product is in 
the open but the primes are kept secret and the system depends for 
its security on the difficulty of factoring large numbers 
according to kahn 
the labs breaking down of the 155digit number indicates that 
the second system can be factored down more quickly than previously 
believed kahn said but for practical purposes the system is 
mostly used to enable one computer to recognize another 
an official with the american bankers association which 
represents about 95 percent of us commercial banks said he was 
not alarmed by the bellcore breakthrough 
most banks use the data inscription standard and i know of no 
one who has ever broken that code said al belisle chairman of 
the associations systems security committee

tamil rebels launched counterattacks 
today from their stronghold in northern sri lanka fighting bitter 
handtohand battles with government troops in the third day of a 
fullfledged civil war 
military officials said rebels bombarded a military airfield and 
a naval base near the city of jaffna but suffered heavy casualties 
in a second futile attempt to seize an army garrison housed in a 
200yearold fort 
jaffna about 190 miles north of colombo is the headquarters of 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelem the main rebel militia 
the military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity had 
few details of casualties but said four rebels were killed when 
the naval base at karainagar northwest of jaffna came under rebel 
attack 
at least two soldiers were killed when rebels pounded the palali 
airfield 10 miles north of jaffna with mortars and rockets they 
said 
in their attempt today to seize the jaffna military garrison 
the rebels suffered heavy casualties the officials said 
the tigers had on tuesday launched a failed assault on the 
200yearold dutch fort where the garrison is located 
tiger rebels used armorplated bulldozers today to break down 
the doors of the fort and attempted to scale its 20foot walls the 
officials said 
bitter handtohand fighting ensued 
soldiers used helicopter gunships and armored cars to repulse 
the attack officials said 
about 1000 people are believed to have been killed since the 
tigers repudiated a yearlong ceasefire with the government on 
june 10 and overran police stations in the tamildominated north 
and east 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne has said at least 600 
rebels have been killed in the fighting another 392 rebels 
soldiers policemen and civilians have also died according to 
reports compiled from tiger sources military officers and 
residents 
in the east government troops bombed and burned deserted rebel 
bunkers around the port city of batticaloa military officers said 
the rebels withdrew from the city on monday a day before 
government troops took it over 
the troops killed a tamil woman and her 10yearold child while 
advancing into the city said batticaloa residents contacted by 
telephone 
on tuesday the army made significant advances in the east 
dislodging rebels from several cities and freeing at least two army 
camps that been under seige by rebel forces as the attacks 
intensified rebels were seen fleeing the cities and towns into the 
jungle where they were expected to prepare for what could be 
another bloody guerrilla war 
the counterattacks today were seen as an attempt by the rebels 
to kick the army out of the north and allow for the establishment 
of a secure base for antigovernment operations 
the rebels took control of all major towns in the northern and 
eastern provinces after indian peackeeping troops withdrew from sri 
lanka in march the indian forces had failed to disarm the tigers 
during a 32month occupation 
government forces and tiger rebels jointly patrolled the streets 
of the towns while leaders of both sides held a series of meetings 
to decide on the political future of the regions 
the talks had not made much headway when the fighting resumed 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of the population the sri lankan armed forces police 
and government are also dominated by the sinhalese 
before this months fighting at least 11000 people had been 
killed since tamil militants began fighting for an independent 
nation in 1983 
in 1987 india brokered a peace accord between the two sides and 
sent its peacekeeping force but the tigers reneged on the accord 
and turned their guns on the indians 
in may 1989 the government negotiated a ceasefire with the 
rebels and requested that the indians pull out

an art gallery and its director must stand 
trial in september for displaying two robert mapplethorpe 
photographs that include nude or seminude children a judge has 
ruled 
hamilton county municipal judge david albanese also said tuesday 
he plans to hear more evidence before deciding whether the 
contemporary arts center and director dennis barrie also must face 
obscenity charges for displaying five sexually graphic pictures 
i was hoping it wouldnt go to trial but now that it is going 
to trial i feel very confident we will win barrie said 
after a hearing i know that what we are doing is right and we 
will be vindicated in court 
albanese refused defense requests to dismiss the two misdemeanor 
charges against barrie and the gallery 
this court will try to make a decision of what in ohio 
constitutes the definition of obscenity the judge said 
obscene material is not protected by the first amendment this 
case is not about the rights of the curious to view an exhibition 
a county grand jury indicted the gallery and barrie on april 7 
the day the sevenweek exhibition robert mapplethorpe the 
perfect moment opened to the public if convicted barrie faces 
up to six months in jail and 1000 in fines on each charge the 
arts center faces up to 5000 in fines on each charge 
the indictments first count set for a jury trial sept 24 
charges barrie and the gallery with illegal use of a minor in 
material involving nudity the charge involves a picture of a boy 
with his genitals exposed and a picture of a girl with her genitals 
exposed 
on the second charge pandering obscenity albanese said he 
wanted to conduct an evidentiary hearing aug 20 before deciding 
whether it should go to trial 
the prosecution is asking albanese to limit the case to the 
pictures named in the indictment the defense contends the court 
must consider the 175photo exhibit as a whole including its 
portraits and pictures of flowers 
this court is not presumptuous enough to believe that it has 
the background and information necessary to try to rationalize 
whether these pictures can be taken as a whole or independently 
albanese said in ordering the aug 20 hearing 
barrie said more than 81000 people saw the exhibit before it 
closed may 26 
in his ruling albanese said he considered the contemporary arts 
center to be a gallery rather than a museum and noted that a 
museum is permitted more latitude in displaying art 
one defense request to dismiss the charges argued that ohio 
obscenity law specifically exempts material exhibited for artistic 
or educational purposes 
this court will not pretry the case in pretrial motions 
albanese said in a written copy of his ruling

a leading japanese newspaper reported today that 
cuban president fidel castro has asked japan to arrange for him to 
meet president bush at emperor akihitos coronation ceremony in 
november 
the masscirculation asahi shimbun quoting unnamed sources in 
the government and governing liberal democratic party said cuba 
has asked japan to arrange such a meeting with a view toward 
improving relations between havana and washington 
the paper said however that it was not yet known whether bush 
would attend the akihito coronation 
however a foreign ministry official said the ministry has not 
received any cuban request for japan to help arrange a cubaus 
summit it also has received no official reply on who will 
represent cuba at the coronation ceremony said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
an official of the cuban embassy in tokyo also requesting 
anonymity said we have not received any official confirmation 
of whether president custro will come to tokyo and we have had no 
confirmation about the reported request to japan 
quoting a governing party official the asahi said the cuban 
government unofficially informed japan recently that castro would 
attend the emperors coronation scheduled for nov 12 
if confirmed the request for a castrobush meeting could signal 
a major policy change by cuba which has held to a hardline 
position during the current eastwest reconciliation 
cuba and the united states broke diplomatic relations in 1961 
the us invasion of panama in december and the start of 
anticastro broadcasts in march have sharpened the chill between 
them 
japan which recognized the castro government in 1959 maintains 
good relations with cuba

a leadership struggle between archrivals shimon 
peres and yitzhak rabin has erupted in the centerleft labor party 
and a leading laborite said today that peres continued leadership 
is increasingly in doubt 
the first step in a showdown could come at a meeting thursday of 
the partys 140member leadership bureau 
tomorrows meeting could be very important concerning the 
peresrabin confrontation party spokesman shmuel elgrabli said 
in a telephone interview 
peres 66 and rabin 68 have been rivals for most of their 
careers they grew up in politics as proteges of israels feuding 
founders with peres following david bengurion and rabin following 
golda meir 
the latest struggle flared following peres failure to form a 
government after toppling labors coalition with the rightwing 
likud bloc in march the split between the parties stemmed from a 
dispute about middle east peace moves 
rabin defense minister in the last government has since 
mustered support from disgruntled laborites relegated to 
parliaments back benches when prime minister yitzhak shamir formed 
a rightwing cabinet on june 11 
opinion polls show the israeliborn rabin the favorite choice 
for prime minister he owes much of his popularity to his 
ironfisted policies against the 30monthold palestinian uprising 
in the occupied territories 
rabin also a former army chief of staff announced on june 12 
that he sought peres ouster 
even peres staunchest allies have shifted support to rabin the 
most recent is former education minister yitzhak navon who told 
israel radio today that it isnt a matter of personal revenge 
against shimon peres but of clearly viewing which of the two in 
the existing circumstances could win more public support 
other party leaders also have considered challenging peres 
according to israeli reports among names that have been mentioned 
are economics minister gad yaacobi and former energy minister moshe 
shahal 
the polishborn peres has rejected appeals to step down 
claiming he is not solely responsible for labors failings 
labor spokesman elgrabli said thursdays weekly bureau session 
would likely set the stage for a showdown between the two leaders 
bureau members were expected to vote on proposals to hold a 
party membership census needed before a vote for chairman elgrabli 
said 
an attempt to block the census could put off the contest rabin 
also could use thursdays meeting to further his campaign while 
peres is in the united states 
in other developments today 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip staged a 
general strike marking a months passing since the massacre of 
seven arab laborers by a lone israeli gunman outside tel aviv 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said israel would renew 
cooperation with the united states if washington rules out plo 
participation in the middle east peace process 
the remark in a speech to a meeting of the world zionist 
organization came amid increasingly chilly usisraeli relations 
that have followed shamirs scuttling of a usbacked peace plan

two explosions rocked the us aircraft carrier 
midway today during flight operations at sea injuring 16 crew 
members and leaving one missing the navy said at least seven were 
seriously hurt 
a fire that broke out at the time of the first explosion was 
later extinguished and the 980footlong ship was steaming under 
its own power about 125 miles northeast of tokyo the navy said in 
a statement 
the navys public affairs office said the ship would not return 
tonight to its port at yokosuka near tokyo and a decision would 
be made thursday on whether it needs to come in 
yokosuka city demanded that the midway be barred from the port 
until its safety had been confirmed and the causes of the fire 
clarified city spokesman ryutaro koizumi said the demand was 
relayed to the foreign ministry 
the fire broke out in a parts storeroom four decks below the 
carriers flight deck and was confined to the storeroom said 
petty officer 2nd class frank mowry of the public affairs office at 
the navy base at yokosuka 
mowry was unsure what caused the fire and explosions or how 
long the fire burned but he said that 1 hours after the first 
fire broke out firefighters were moving into the storeroom to 
extinguish it 
among the injured he said five were flown to yokosuka one was 
in critical condition two in very serious condition one in 
guarded condition and one in stable condition 
four others who were seriously burned were taken by helicopter 
to the us air base at yokota west of japan and then to two 
separate japanese hospitals mowry said 
he had no immediate information on the other seven injured crew 
members 
the navy said no deaths had been reported aboard the ship which 
had 4500 people aboard including fliers and aviation crews the 
51000ton carrier was launched in 1943 and was later extensively 
modernized 
the navy statement said the first explosion occurred at 1223 
pm about half an hour after smoke had been reported 
firefighters were called and a second explosion occurred about an 
hour later it added 
the cause and extent of the explosion and fire are unknown at 
this time it said the navy said the midway was conducting 
routine flight operations at the time 
kyodo news service said the japan council against atomic and 
hydrogen bombs a private antinuclear organization had demanded 
that the japanese government refuse to let the midway enter 
yokosuka 
japanese news reports said there had been concern in japan 
because the midway was capable of carrying nuclear weapons 
japan the only nation ever attacked with atomic bombs bans all 
nuclear weapons from its territory critics contend that us ships 
have brought nuclear weapons into japanese ports but the 
government says the united states would have to ask japans 
permission and never has done so 
as a matter of policy the united states refuses to comment on 
the location of its nuclear weapons 
the last major blaze aboard a us warship was may 8 when fire 
broke out before dawn on the guidedmissile destroyer uss conyngham 
during routine operations in the atlantic about 100 miles southeast 
of norfolk va 
one crewman was killed and 18 other sailors were injured in the 
fire which broke out in the engine roome officials said the 
cause is under investigation 
at the time it was the worst shipboard blaze since a string of 
accidents prompted the navy to suspend operations for a twoday 
safety check in november

former highranking communist ion 
iliescu whose leadership has been tarnished by violent attacks on 
opponents took the oath of office as president today and swore to 
uphold democracy and human rights 
iliescus heavyhanded tactics especially in calling in miners 
last week who beat suspected government critics have alienated 
leaders in western capitals us ambassador alan j green jr 
boycotted the inauguration although the ambassadors of all other 
major western nations attended 
green returned from washington on monday saying the democratic 
process in romania had come to a halt 
an opposition leader ion ratiu praised the american action 
calling it the most eloquent way the us could show its 
condemnation of the vigilante tactics that mr iliescu generated 
last week 
no major protests were reported today although some university 
students and teachers were on strike the government this week 
arrested several opposition leaders but offered to talk with other 
activists 
i swear faithfulness to the romanian people and to their 
ideals of freedom and prosperity iliescu told parliament and 
foreign diplomats during the ceremony in the atheneum concert hall 
in downtown bucharest 
i swear to observe the countrys laws to defend democracy 
and the fundamental human rights and freedoms the sovereignty 
and the territorial integrity of our homeland he said 
in his first decision as president iliescu appointed petre 
roman as premier roman 44 a former engineering professor has 
been interim premier since the bloody december revolution that 
toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu 
iliescu 60 a highranking communist official in the late 
1960s was formally declared president by alexandru birladeanu 
chairman of the senate the parliaments higher chamber 
iliescu and his national salvation front took power in the 
december revolution and won the may 20 election by a landslide 
critics say the front which counts many former communists among 
its leaders is little more than the old repressive regime in 
disguise 
last week police attacked peaceful antigovernment protesters 
to break up a 53day vigil on a central square rioting followed in 
which government buildings were attacked and iliescu appealed to 
the miners 
the miners attacked people suspected of being government critics 
and ransacked the offices of opposition parties and their 
newspapers 
in his inauguration speech iliescu blamed last weeks unrest on 
extremist political groups who he said were organized and 
coordinated according to a scenario for destabilization 
but he also criticized the miners he had personally thanked 
them on friday for breaking into public institutions 
opposition party headquarters and private homes and for roughing 
up people who were innocent 
we registered excesses violations of some institutions 
attacks on some citizens iliescu said we uneqivocally 
dissociate ourselves from the actions which transcended the legal 
framework 
this week the government is at once talking to opposition 
groups and detaining their leaders 
lawmakers have authorized police action to stop any new street 
demonstrations antigovernment protesters gathered this week in 
university square demonstrators were forcibly removed from the 
square last week 
a communique carried by the state rompres news agency said 
interior minister viorel doru ursu and the romanian information 
service the new intelligence agency that replaced ceausescus 
feared securitate had invited student organizations and 
intellectuals to discuss problems of common interest 
parliaments lower house on monday gave police and soldiers the 
authority to clear university square of protesters the upper 
chamber in a separate measure urged police to take immediate 
action against unauthorized protests 
on tuesday the interior ministry arrested two opposition 
figures dumitru dinca and nica leon leader of the small national 
democratic party 
it said dinca had been charged with larceny and instigation 
toward committing major crimes while leon was detained under a 
warrant accusing him of destruction of public property 
the two were being held as part of an investigation into the 
june 13 breakup by riot police of the university square sitin and 
the subsequent unrest the government has claimed fascists were 
trying to overthrow it but has yet to produce any evidence 
some romanians have speculated that the violence was provoked to 
give the government the opportunity to silence or at least 
intimidate the opposition on monday authorities detained marian 
munteanu a student leader severely beaten by progovernment miners 
last week munteanu was taken to a police hospital on charges of 
instigating violence 
that led his wife claudia to seek refuge at the home of dutch 
ambassador coen f stork 
government opponents seek the ouster of iliescu and the other 
former communists who hold top posts in the national salvation 
front they have also demanded an independent television station

the parliament of uzbekistan began discussing a 
declaration of independence today becoming the first of the five 
soviet central asian republics to consider breaking with moscow 
the official tass news agency reported 
the supreme soviet of uzbekistan debated a measure that would 
establish the republic as a separate country responsible for its 
own domestic and foreign policy tass said 
the arid povertystricken central asian republics of the soviet 
south have suffered from repeated outbreaks of ethnic unrest but 
until now have not followed the parliamentary struggle for 
secession waged by the three baltic republics in the northwest 
moscow imposed economic sanctions and an oil and gas embargo on 
lithuania after it declared independence on march 11 latvia and 
estonia followed suit by declaring a transition period to 
independence 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has denounced lithuanias 
independence declaration as illegal and has demanded that it be 
suspended 
uzbekistan a cottongrowing republic of 20 million people has 
the bestorganized popular movement in the region berlik and is 
seen as a center for activism in largely moslem central asia 
tass said initially that uzbekistans declaration of 
independence was approved by a majority of supreme soviet members 
but it later issued an advisory withdrawing the report 
alexander snasten an editor at tass world service said 
discussion of the measure had begun but that it had not been 
approved 
the declaration stipulates uzbekistans state sovereignty its 
independence and the supremacy of republican laws on its entire 
territory tass said 
it said the measure would put all issues of domestic issues of 
domestic and foreign policy under the authority of uzbekistan 
the declaration suggests the soviet union would be treated like a 
foreign country saying uzbekistan would determine the nature and 
foundations that underlie its future economic cultural and other 
relations with the ussr and other states 
tass said many deputies had argued that the declaration should 
wait until a new federal treaty is worked out among the 15 soviet 
republics but were overruled 
meanwhile the parliament of soviet georgia pressed by hunger 
strikers convened a special session today to discuss legal steps 
for securing independence for the caucasus republic tass reported 
on march 9 the georgian supreme soviet condemned the republics 
annexation by the soviet union and urged negotiations on 
independence becoming the fourth of the 15 soviet republics to 
begin a parliamentary struggle for secession 
the supreme soviet convened a month ahead of scheduled in 
response to demands from hungerstriking university students in the 
georgian capital of tbilisi the soviet news agency said 
the dozens of students ended their hunger strikes last week 
after their demands on the session and its agenda were satisfied 
said valerian khukhunashvili a moscowbased georgian activist 
the session that opened today was to discuss bills on the 
transition to independence elections citizenship economic 
independence and other measures 
georgia a mountainous republic of 53 million people was 
occupied by the red army in 1921 and subsequently signed treaties 
incorporating it into the soviet union

a supreme court justice has cleared the way 
for courtordered corrective surgery for a 6yearold california 
boy born with clubfeet and a dislocated hip 
justice sandra day oconnor refused to set aside rulings that 
the surgery may be performed on kou xiang without the consent of 
his parents hmong immigrants from the hill region of laos 
oconnors denial was dated tuesday but not disclosed until 
today 
an emergency request submitted in behalf of kous father ger 
xiang of fresno said the surgery ordered by a state judge would 
violate religious freedom and parental rights 
ger xiang and his wife houa vue believe their family would be 
punished by spirits for tampering with their sons deformities 
according to court documents they believe the boy was born with 
clubfeet as punishment for some wrong committed by another relative 
fresno county judge lawrence oneill in february ordered the 
corrective surgery after officials of the countys department of 
social services sought such help 
kou has said he does not want the surgery 
medical testimony during a twoday hearing before oneill 
indicated the boy would lose movement in his legs and be 
wheelchairbound by adulthood without the surgery 
waiting until the boy is old enough to make his own decision 
would decrease the chances of success according to the medical 
testimony 
the judge postponed the effect of his order to let the boys 
father appeal two state appellate courts rejected those appeals 
in the emergency request acted on tuesday lawyers for ger xiang 
said county social services officials cannot demonstrate a 
compelling state interest sufficient to override the familys 
religious beliefs 
the request said the series of unwanted major surgical 
operations should not be forced on kou and his family 
the case is ger xiang vs superior court a892

under fire from communist hardliners president 
mikhail s gorbachev said today that he might soon leave his post 
as party leader 
tomorrow or after 10 days or 12 days there may be another 
general secretary or chairman of the party gorbachev told the 
largely antireform delegates at a conference of the russian 
republics communist party 
he did not say if he might resign or if he expected to be ousted 
from the party job giving up that position legally should not 
affect his fiveyear term as president of the soviet union 
there has been speculation for months that gorbachevs 
longrange strategy is to shift the key leadership positions from 
the party to the government 
his appeal appeared to be an effort to gain support at the 
fractious meeting conservative delegates have attacked him for 
diminishing their influence 
politburo member yegor ligachev without mentioning gorbachev 
criticized him indirectly for retaining the job of party general 
secretary after his election earlier this year to the new post of 
soviet president 
it is impossible to run the party this guiding force without 
devoting full time to it ligachev the most prominent soviet 
hardliner told the congress 
gorbachev did not rebut the conservative criticism but said his 
accusers were poorly informed and disrespectful 
the comrades seem to suspect the general secretary of the 
communist party of some vacillation hesitation and so forth he 
said angrily some of the comrades are being too casual with the 
general secretary with the president of the country 
before expressing opinions and especially accusations you 
have to know a whole lot and understand it and not just speak off 
the cuff gorbachev said 
the delegates at this weeks meeting will form the majority of 
delegates at the national party congress opening july 2 which is 
expected to make considerable changes in the party leadership 
the foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov when asked by 
reporters whether gorbachev would be elected then said well 
see at the congress it will add suspense to your lives 
gorbachev came under heavy fire for his reforms at tuesdays 
opening session a siberian hardliner speaking for his regional 
communist organization urged gorbachev and the entire leadership to 
resign for taking the party out of decisionmaking 
other delegates won applause for criticizing gorbachevs 
reforms which have ended the communist monopoly and transferred 
its power to the government 
the conference considered a dress rehearsal for the key 
national party congress also voted by an overwhelming majority 
today to condemn a legislative proposal that would liquidate party 
cells in the army kgb and government 
by a 2008to398 margin the conference delegates approved a 
resolution saying the decree would weaken communist influence in 
society and strengthen reactionary elements 
the vote was described as a rebuff to boris n yeltsin who 
calls for even more radical reforms than gorbachev in his position 
as the new president of the russian republic 
yeltsin heads the republics parliament which gave preliminary 
approval monday to a decree on power that calls for party cells 
in the government security police and armed forces to be 
liquidated 
the vote strongly indicated that hardliners would similarly 
battle gorbachevs liberal program at the soviet communist party 
congress 
the russian party conference also moved today to form a separate 
communist party of the vast russian republic the formal decision 
to create the party which would require a twothirds majority from 
among the 2700 delegates was expected to be taken later in the 
day 
the russian communist party which would remain within the 
framework of the national party of more than 18 million members 
was absorbed by the central party 65 years ago 
of the 15 soviet republics only russia has not had its own 
party in part because russians dominated the national party 
russia contains threequarters of the soviet territory

bangor maine daily news on flag burning 
the american flag which has been shot at set afire sunk with 
foundering ships vilified belittled and scorned remains a 
flawless symbol of the united states the flag remains unscathed 
not because of its material but because of the freedoms and 
responsibilities it represents by protecting the material of the 
flag through a constitutional amendment we risk weakening those 
freedoms and responsibilities 
the supreme courts 54 ruling making unconstitutional a law 
that would prohibit flag burning looked beyond the emotional 
support for the flag to the freedom for americans to express 
dissent and to challenge the government though burning the flag is 
an ugly act that many would call a type of political pornography 
this is not a question of taste but of rights

the keene nh sentinel on flag burning 
thomas jefferson and james madison the principal authors of the 
bill of rights believed that the key to maintaining a free society 
was to cultivate a respect for liberty but not necessarily a 
respect for every manifestation of liberty the distinction is 
important jefferson and madison understood that the exercise of 
freedom would inevitably result in the expression of very unpopular 
opinions 
president george bush and reps chuck douglas and robert smith 
both rnh are among contemporary politicians who dont seem to 
understand that concept with unbecoming arrogance they are 
proposing to improve upon the work of jefferson and madison they 
want to pass a constitutional amendment to amend the bill of rights 
for the first time in the countrys history

the plain dealer cleveland on flag burning 
the constitution protects americans right of political dissent 
even if they express their protest in ways the majority may 
deplore with its reasoned defense of the first amendments 
guarantee of free expression the supreme court should have put 
a stop to the demagoguery over an emotional nonissue the phony 
furor over flag burning 
no other nation has an absolute guarantee of its citizens 
freedoms if the right of free expression is to remain intact 
mainstream americans must tolerate dissent even in its most 
eccentric or offensive forms 
yet a momentary scare about flag burning has incited 
opportunists to cheapen the meaning of patriotism the 
moreloyalthanthou posturing stagemanaged by the white house 
in a deplorable effort to sway votes in this election year 
foreshadows another campaign season of flagfactory rallies and 
mass recitations of the pledge of allegiance 
such flag fanaticism has become worse than a mere frivolity it 
now threatens to shred the constitution itself

the free press mankato minn on flag burning 
here we go again 
the supreme court again overturned a federal law prohibiting 
flag burning 
this ruling means that now were sure to see a constitutional 
amendment barreling down the congressional pike to make flag 
burning illegal lets hope sanity prevails on capitol hill and 
our representatives vote down this wrongheaded move 
few if any have ever been swayed because somebody else torched 
a flag to the contrary such acts are found by the vast majority 
of us to be repulsive 
so why not make this exception to free speech 
because the right of free speech has importance and value as one 
of the fundamental rights of our political system the first 
amendment protects unpopular speech popular speech needs no 
shield the flag has importance and value but only as a symbol of 
our system free speech is the more important right in our system 
it may be too much to hope that the demagogues of the republican 
party will let this issue drop but we can hope as we do that 
congress will reject the flag burning amendment

the north jersey herald and news passaic nj on the legal 
reaction to flag burning and rap group 2 live crew 
this is scary as eastern europeans and soviet citizens struggle 
to emerge from an oppressed past to a democratic future some 
americans are ready to turn back the clock more than 200 years on 
our own bill of rights 
in fort lauderdale fla a federal judge declared a rap album 
by the group 2 live crew as nasty as they want to be obscene 
and prohibited its sale 
a grandstanding sheriff in broward county ordered the arrest of 
a store owner for selling the record then busted band members for 
performing songs from the album even though the concert was 
adultsonly 
meanwhile in our nations capital lawmakers have turned an 
irrelevant nonissue into the nations top priority the problem a 
few jerks in podunk might burn the american flag as a statement of 
protest so president bush and congress in a cynical appeal to 
patriotism want to tamper with the us constitution 
short of yelling fire in a crowded theater americans must 
not give in to the temptation of shutting up people whose 
statements we may find objectionable those who would have 
government censor the public can look to point east to see the 
consequences

commercial dispatch columbus miss on sobriety checkpoints 
the us supreme court was right on target the other day when it 
ruled that law enforcement checkpoints are a reasonable means to 
combat drunken driving 
these checkpoints are a small inconvenience considering the more 
important benefits helping to keep drunk drivers off our 
highways 
the real effectiveness of these checkpoints is deterrence 
critics argue these programs cannot be proven to be more effective 
than other techniques but local and state law enforcement 
officials were quick to note that checkpoints do work theyre 
convinced of it so why shouldnt local authorities have the right 
to decide whether such techniques will be used on their roads 
pertaining to charges these interruptions are simple harassment 
by government the key word as far as bill of rights protection 
goes is unreasonable 
but to us it would seem far more reasonable to be concerned 
about the bloodbath linked to drunken driving all across our nation 
23000 deaths in 1988 according to us department of 
transportation figures 
it just makes good sense that our lawmen should have among their 
preventive arsenal the right to conduct sobriety checkpoints

the hindustan times northern india on space exploration 
president bush last month set the deadline for a manned mission 
to mars 2019 the 50th anniversary of the first apollo manned 
landing on the moon like president kennedy before him bush is 
apparently challenging the nation to spend large resources and to 
risk lives to go to another world 
nasa set up by the eisenhower administration in 1958 succeeded 
magnificently by putting 12 men onto the moon by december 1972 
can it repeat a far more complex and spectacular feat to the red 
planet in less than 29 years in fact is a manned journey to mars 
even technically feasible the red planet is hundreds of times 
farther away than the moon 
the voyage would probably take some two to two and and a half 
years to complete 50 times longer than the longest apollo mission 
and to achieve it would require technical advances on three fronts 
which are far from being accomplished 
first the effects of prolonged weightlessness have yet to be 
overcome secondly reliable closed cycle space habitats 
spaceships adequate enough for six to eight people to live and 
work in without being resupplied have to be built and thirdly a 
giant rocket with ten times more propulsion power than the saturn 
v moon rocket would be required 
since the decommissioning of saturn v the us has lacked a 
heavylift rocket the prohibitive cost estimated at an additional 
15 billion a year on top of the expense of present space 
activities doubtful technical feasibility and lack of political 
will all make the mars manned journey a dream less likely to become 
a reality

alahram cairo on israelplo 
the united states is still arousing doubts around the future of 
the americanpalestinian dialogue because of what the american 
adminstration has repeated about the plo not outrightly condemning 
the failed palestinian commando raid on the shore of tel aviv 
the american threat arouses a number of questions 
first the united states brings up the subject of cutting off 
the dialogue as though the dialogue was the aim resulting from the 
palestinian concesssions in 1988 
second anyone who has followed the results of the dialogue 
between the two sides up to now will easily realize that there is 
no positive result the us could not even obtain initial israeli 
approval of the baker plan which the plo had reservations over 
third american insistence on a plo condemnation of the raid 
provokes the issue of equal treatment and specifically a request 
from israel for a condemnation of the terrorist acts it practices 
against the palestiniaian people 
fourth just as the plo is asked to condemn an act it has not 
perpetrated so should israel be requested to condemn violent acts 
it has not perpetrated such as those against plo members in many 
countries 
the american threat to cut off the dialogue with the plo has no 
gravity neither as concerns the value of the dialogue nor as 
concerns the justice of the request especially after the formation 
of a government of war in israel

the fundamentalists victory in the local elections marks the 
second algerian revolution but the adversary was still france 
yesterday because it was the colonizer today because it represents 
the successful economic model of the west in algeria revolution 
is first of all revulsion 
as the first expression of their identity the algerians 
experimented with socialism 
now algerians seem tempted by a second dead end that of 
fundamentalism despairing of the future that was vainly promised 
them through socialism they are turning toward the past they want 
to take refuge in a faith which for each complicated question

and still this relief food does not reach the needy people 
easily due to the heavy fighting going on in some strategic areas

straits times singapore on the future of canada 
the threat of national disintegration leads to the larger and 
perpetual question of a canadian identity canadians are said to 
have a problem defining themselves in a way that distinguishes them 
sufficiently from us americans the penetrative vigor of whose 
civilization is enhanced by geographical proximity economic logic 
and ethnic links 
much of the problem one suspects stems from canadians trying 
to do something which they need not do the existence of countries 
like that of human beings does not need to be justified 
the real question is to ask what would happen to canadians 
identity complex if the country were to disappear what would 
replace it what surer identity awaits the doubting canadian if 
there is none is it not better to look within the nation and 
examine the links which are there however problematic these might 
be rather than seek the sense of self either through divisiveness 
at home or distinctiveness abroad 
this sounds negative and necessarily so for ethnic identity in 
all multicultural societies is a negative starting point the whole 
point is to move beyond that line creating an identity in the very 
act of looking for one for countries again like children are not 
just born but grow

the independent london on eastern europe 
in romania the government of the national salvation front has 
behaved in a fashion virtually indistinguishable from that of the 
ceausescu regime it overthrew in bulgaria and in yugoslavia too 
a revival of nationalism and the rudiments of democracy have not 
yet brought back anything recognizable as the rule of law 
european governments ought certainly to make plain their 
disapproval to ion iliescu and underline it in the most 
effective way by stating that no aid will be forthcoming to 
governments that send licensed bullies to beat up their citizens

heavy rains caused flooding in illinois where a rescue worker 
was dragged off a collapsed bridge and was missing today and 
vicious storms pummeled parts of kansas authorities said 
flooding shut down roads in several counties near springfield 
and peoria in central illinois national weather service 
meteorologists said at least 4 inches of rain had fallen in several 
counties in the area since 1 am 
a washburn fire department rescue worker was swept away by flood 
waters on state route 26 the worker whose identity was not 
immediately known disappeared after stepping out of an ambulance 
on a collapsed bridge according to illinois state police 
dispatcher peggy dehnbostel 
state emergency services and disaster agency officials whose 
springfield offices were flooded said today they were still unable 
to determine where else flooding had occurred 
in kansas several counties were lashed by tornadoes and sheets 
of rain the storms overturned mobile homes leveled trees damaged 
property and left more than 40000 people without power 
it was like a bomb went off mark bogner of weatherdata inc 
said of the dozens of storms cells that exploded over the prairie 
from dodge city and pratt east to butler county 
the violent night followed a hot day in wichita a record high 
of 105 a poor dona violeta 
mrs chavarrias husband jose is a bricklayer who brings home 
20 a month slightly more than she earned as a grade school 
teacher her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently 
from esteli so they decided she should open the store 
many people seem to share the guarded optimism of mrs chavarria 
and the neighbor but there also is a show me attitude that 
good times are not just around the corner 
nicaraguans voted the sandinistas out feb 25 and inflation 
still is high nearly two months after mrs chamorros proamerican 
government was inaugurated 
inflation reached 36000 percent in 1988 then declined to 1800 
percent in 1989 
francisco mayorga president of the central bank now gauges it 
weekly his figures were 47 percent for the first week of may then 
17 percent 12 and 11 for the next three 
mayorga who was educated at yale and devised mrs chamorros 
economic recovery plan accused the sandinistas of using the 
twomonth transition period to undermine the new government 
he said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the 
deficit 
president bush signed a 300 million aid package may 26 the 
first 60 million arrived quickly and between may 25 and may 31 
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310000 cordobas 
to 290000 
the exchange houses are supplying dollars again thats why it 
went down said jose gutierrez one of two dozen currency dealers 
on a street near the mexican embassy 
gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing 
motorists and police look the other way 
another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted 
farm acreage over last year mayorga said food production fell 
steadily under the sandinistas 
on the negative side nicaraguas currency has been devalued 
frequently since mrs chamorro took office the parallel exchange 
rate which governs most dollar transactions had gone from 70800 
cordobas to 226600 by may 31 
some chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble 
maybe we would have been better off under the sandinistas 
said julio gonzalez 33 who runs an auto repair shop with his 
cousin former president daniel ortega he said had the economy 
more or less under control 
what does he expect to happen now maybe well see an 
improvement in six months a year but it better happen just like 
we knocked down somoza we knocked down the sandinistas well we 
can knock down this government too 
the sandinista revolution overthrew the late president anastasio 
somosa in july 1979 
rolando perez sanchez a 29yearold sandinista union leader 
listened with skepticism to gonzalez his friend and neighbor 
its not going to happen he said shaking his head this 
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and 
leave the workers the crumbs 
what we have to do is what daniel said rule from below to 
defend the conquests of the revolution 
ruling from below took the form of a crippling strike by 
public employees in may after which the government gave broad 
concessions to unions 
mrs chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the 
militant sandinista opposition 
her government plans to review confiscations of property under 
the sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy firing 
public employees 
sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have 
not materialized and their protest marches draw smaller crowds if 
economic improvement continues the sandinistas could lose the 
leverage of being the defenders of workers buying power 
another sandinista rallying point the contra rebels might 
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize 
im like st thomas ill have to see it to believe it 
gonzalez said 
for mrs chavarria who has three small children abolition of 
the twoyear draft for boys of 16 is great progress 
you dont know what a relief this is for us mothers she 
said as for the rest of it well have to wait at least we eat 
every day

the massacre of eight people by a man with a rifle 
could undercut the powerful gun lobby at a time when florida voters 
are considering a constitutional amendment imposing a threeday 
wait on handgun purchases 
anytime you have a tragedy those people with hidden agendas 
see any and every emotional opportunity to try to justify their 
erroneous position and try to deprive the people of their rights 
said marion hammer spokeswoman for the national rifle 
associations florida branch 
the debate over the amendment on novembers ballot intensified 
after james edward pough 42 a day laborer killed eight people 
monday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with a 
revolver at an auto loan agency police said pough also killed two 
people on the street sunday with the rifle 
how many messages do we send to the congress how many to the 
state legislature jacksonville mayor tommy hazouri said tuesday 
if it means seeking changes were going to do that 
state rep ron silver chairman of the house criminal justice 
committee said the fact the waiting period is being settled by a 
referendum rather than a vote in the legislature shows many 
lawmakers still fear the nras clout 
but he added that polls indicate heavy support for the 
amendment and he said passage could give legislators confidence to 
pass other guncontrol laws 
i think florida is waking up silver said 
california passed an assault weapons bill in 1989 in the 
aftermath of the stockton calif schoolyard spree by a drifter 
with an ak47 assault rifle who killed five children and wounded 30 
other people president bush approved an import ban on assault 
weapons and a senate bill would extend the ban to domestic 
manufacture of four weapons identified as used mainly in drug 
violence 
florida has tackled gun legislation several times in recent 
years 
a 1987 law removed gun registration from county control in favor 
of statewide registration rules a law taking effect oct 1 
requires gun sellers to check all applicants through a crime 
computer in tallahassee 
but lawmakers on a study commission on assault weapons failed to 
agree on which weapons should be banned 
us rep bill nelson a democrat running for governor has 
called banning assault weapons a priority 
it is harder to rent a car in florida than it is to buy an 
ak47 he said during a debate monday before he knew of the 
shooting spree a nelson aide needed less than 10 minutes to walk 
into a miami gun shop and come out with an ak47 and ammunition 
last month 
gov bob martinez a republican seeking reelection said 
tuesday the law requiring a background check by gun dealers is a 
responsible step but at the same time we must maintain the 
freedom to own guns which have useful sporting purposes 
poughs 30caliber semiautomatic rifle would be banned under 
new jerseys monthold law on assault weapons considered the 
nations toughest because its clip held more than 15 rounds 
nelson wants a sevenday waiting period on handgun purchases 
democratic frontrunner lawton chiles also supports a waiting 
period 
now gun purchasers are required to have some identification 
such as a drivers license and fill out a questionnaire on 
arrests mental illness and drug use 
but there is no way for merchants to confirm the information 
other than by investigating on their own 
it is illegal in florida for a convicted felon to own a handgun 
but technically pough wasnt a convicted felon 
in 1971 he was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death 
of a man he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced 
to five years probation court records show after probation his 
record was wiped clean 
that made it legal for pough to own a gun under florida law 
its a loophole we need to plug up jacksonville sheriff jim 
mcmillan said

businessmen and former government officials 
asked congress on wednesday to provide a modern marshall plan 
to help small businesses and boost us exports to eastern europe 
saying the united states is losing ground to western european 
entrepreneurs they endorsed legislation to set up centers to 
develop small business in poland hungary and czechoslovakia and a 
corps of american volunteers to train individuals 
the original marshall plan primarily benefited the us as the 
wardevastated economies of western europe were resuscitated and 
tremendous export markets developed for us companies said d 
bruce merrifield an assistant secretary of commerce in the reagan 
administration 
this modern marshall plan will be equally beneficial for all 
concerned he said 
the marshall plan sent billions of dollars in us government 
money into the industry of western europe in the 1940s and 1950s 
he called for passage of the bill introduced by rep john l 
lafalce dny chairman of the house small business committee 
m p kobelinski small business administrator under president 
carter american businesses have been too slow to move into eastern 
europe 
i travel to poland often and witness the literal invasion of 
potential foreign investors scores of japanese german italian 
swedish french and korean businessmen and the very small 
smattering of american business representatives he told the 
committee 
he suggested the federal governments exportimport bank

forget president bushs reputation for caution 
and compromise hes been wielding his veto pen more frequently and 
with more success than most recent presidents 
the score stands at bush 11 congress zero but lawmakers arent 
giving up the house voted today by a more than 3to1 margin to 
override bushs veto of revisions to the hatch act easing 
restrictions on political activities by federal workers 
ten of bushs 11 vetoes were in his first year in office by 
contrast presidents reagan and carter only vetoed two measures 
apiece in their first years and were sustained in each of those 
instances 
weve been very lucky bush recently told a white house 
audience we may take one on the chin but generally the 
republican side has stayed together 
the bush shutout has emboldened the white house to engage in 
what some critics suggest is negotiationbyvetothreat on a range 
of bills 
veto no 12 on the hatch act prohibition could be the first to 
be overridden by congress if the senate goes along with todays 
32793 house vote 
no 13 a threatened veto of bill congress passed last week 
requiring companies to give employees up to 12 weeks unpaid leave 
for family emergencies is waiting in the wings 
no 14 could be the civil rights act of 1990 which bush aides 
say would lead to hiring quotas and no 15 could be the national 
affordable housing construction act which the administration 
complains would spend too much on public housing 
aides to reagan rarely talked publicly about a veto in advance 
bush aides do it all the time 
some bush aides suggest the veto threats themselves are behind 
bushs successful track record 
fred mcclure bushs chief lobbyist in congress said that 
vetoes are not something we do haphazardly we sort of let 
everybody know up front 
over the course of his eightyear term reagan vetoed 78 bills 
and was overridden nine times in his four years carter vetoed 31 
bills and was overridden twice 
while outdistancing reagan and carter bushs brisk pace doesnt 
come close to that of president ford who vetoed 28 bills in his 
first year and 66 in his 2 years in office in all ford was 
overridden 12 times 
but the alltime record goes to franklin d roosevelt from 1933 
when he took office to his death in office in 1945 roosevelt 
vetoed 635 bills only nine were overridden 
richard nixon president from 1969 to 1974 vetoed 43 bills 
five were overridden lyndon johnson president from 196369 
vetoed 29 bills and none was overridden 
bush piled up his 110 record even though both chambers of 
congress are in the hands of opposition democrats 
when the house overwhelmingly voted to override bushs veto last 
winter of a bill to extend us visas of chinese students the odds 
seemed to be that the senate would follow suit but after a heavy 
lobbying campaign the senate upheld bushs veto with three votes 
to spare 
last week the senate upheld bushs amtrak veto by a scant two 
votes we never said it would be by a landslide said chief of 
staff john sununu 
it requires a twothirds vote in both chambers to override a 
veto 
in the 100member senate where republicans have more clout than 
in the house bush needs 34 votes to sustain a veto 
sen alan simpson rwyo bushs chief vote counter as minority 
whip said the hardest bush veto to sustain may be the hatch act 
revision which passed both chambers by more than the requisite 
twothirds majorities needed to override 
the vote was 334 to 87 in the house 67 to 30 in the senate 
the bill would allow federal employees to participate in 
partisan politics for the first time in more than a halfcentury 
bush said it would lead to politicizing the federal work force 
we have 33 votes and a pool of four to fish in said simpson 
but he was reminded by a reporter bush doesnt have much of a 
reputation for catching fish 
oh yes he has simpson said hes got 11 vetoes that have 
all been sustained so i think hes probably very successful 
fishing in the great congressional pool 
now islamorada fla is a different matter simpson said 
of one of the presidents favorite fishing haunts

one of three outspoken government critics who 
disappeared three weeks ago said wednesday he spent the time 
vacationing under police supervision fishing riding horses 
and even getting a sunburn 
the whole thing is all really comical gao xin said several 
times shaking his head and laughing he said he was unable to 
explain why he was allowed to return home tuesday night after being 
taken away by police the night of may 30 
on may 31 gao and two other dissidents had been scheduled to 
hold a news conference announcing an open letter demanding freedom 
for political prisoners gao was the second of the three to 
resurface he was brought home late tuesday zhou duo returned 
monday morning 
the whereabouts of hou dejian a wellknown folk singer born in 
taiwan remains unknown taiwans official radio station reported 
that hou arrived in taiwan on wednesday but did not say whether he 
had been expelled from china 
gao 34 told the associated press in an interview in his home 
in beijing that he spent the past 20 days resting and having 
fun in the outskirts of beijing accompanied by several policemen 
he said he had not seen hou or zhou since the day before the 
planned news conference and had no idea what had happened to them 
the three were the only chinese to continue publicly appealing 
for democratic reform after last years military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement with police permission they separately 
gave many interviews to foreign reporters about their activities 
during the movement and their hopes for chinas future 
the three men and university lecturer liu xiaobo staged a hunger 
strike in the final days of the massive prodemocracy movement to 
protest the imposition of martial law in beijing 
when troops moved into tiananmen square on the night of june 
34 the four negotiated with soldiers for safe passage from the 
square for the protesting students 
all except hou were arrested soon after gao was released in 
december zhou in may liu remains in prison without charge 
in their open letter to chinese leaders the three asked 
specifically for lius release the news conference was to coincide 
with the oneyear anniversary of the day they decided to stage 
their hunger strike gao said 
the night before the news conference uniformed police went to 
hous home where gao was spending the night and took the two men 
away separately gao said 
after questioning him through the night and most of the day 
about the letter and the news conference the police suggested he 
leave beijing until after the anniversary of the june military 
crackdown passed he said 
they said it was best i not be around during this sensitive 
period and i couldnt refuse them gao said adding that the 
police made it clear that he was not being investigated or detained 
they were very polite and treated me as an equal he said 
i wasnt beaten or mistreated in any way 
they took gao to miyun a suburb about 50 miles outside beijing 
where he spent so much time outdoors that he got a bad sunburn 
i learned to fish and to ride horses things ive never had 
the chance to do before gao said 
he said he was not watched very closely had his own room and 
was allowed to read books and newspapers and to write letters

the house voted overwhelmingly today to 
override president bushs veto of legislation broadening the rights 
of millions of federal workers to participate in political 
campaigns 
the 32793 vote was well over the twothirds majority needed to 
override the veto the house action sets up an expected showdown 
thursday in the senate where a close vote is expected 
bush vetoed the bill last friday saying it would inevitably 
lead to repoliticizing the federal work force and destroy the 
neutrality of civil servants fostered by the 1939 hatch act 
the democraticcontrolled congress has failed to override any of 
bushs previous 11 vetoes 
the bill would remove prohibitions that make it illegal for an 
estimated 3 million federal and postal workers to attend political 
conventions as delegates or speak at rallies on behalf of 
candidates 
it would allow them for the first time to hold party offices and 
solicit contributions from coworkers on behalf of federal employee 
union political action committees while off the job 
but it would continue to bar federal workers from taking leaves 
of absence to run for public elected office or solicit campaign 
funds from the public on behalf of candidates 
unlike all other workers or their neighbors for that matter 
federal workers cannot legally take part in the most routine 
political activities such as displaying yard signs or a bumper 
sticker or stuffing envelopes said rep william ford dmich 
one of the bills chief sponsors 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo recalled that early in her 
career she resigned a job as an attorney for the national labor 
relations board after learning that i could not go to a caucus 
that my husband was holding in our living room 
opponents however echoed bushs suggestions in his veto 
message that without the current hatch act protections federal 
workers will be coerced into supporting candidates of one party or 
the other 
rep frank wolf rva said the united states has developed the 
finest nonpartisan and professional civil service in the world 
with the help of the law 
times have changed but the facts that made the hatch act 
necessary have not changed said wolf human nature has not 
changed whatever is permitted will become expected 
the bill originally passed the senate 6730 administration 
officials were lobbying to win over enough republicans who 
supported the bill to sustain the veto 
the heaviest pressure according to congressional sources was 
being focused on republican sens pete domenici of new mexico 
arlen specter of pennsylvania and alfonse damato of new york all 
supported passage of the bill in may 
more than half of the houses 176 republicans including gop 
leader bob michel of illinois bolted from the administration to 
support the veto override 
the original law was passed in response to evidence that 
enrollees in jobcreating public works programs of the new deal era 
were being required to donate to democratic campaigns

more than 200 us roman catholic 
bishops are meeting here this week for a private retreat 
the gathering at jesuitrun santa clara university comes as 
debate escalates over what tactics the national conference of roman 
catholic bishops should use to persuade catholic politicians to 
fight abortion 
the retreat which begins thursday and runs through june 27 is 
billed as a week of prayer reflection and workshops around the 
topic of bishop as priest prophet and leader 
the clergy also will have time for poolside sunbathing golf 
and a sunday picnic at a beach organizers say 
but it is likely that the recent controversy over abortion in 
politics will come up in the private talks cardinal john oconnor 
of new york last week suggested in a church newspaper column that 
catholic politicians who promote abortion rights must be warned 
that they are at risk of excommunication he later said he never 
threatened to excommunicate anyone

the nations mayors wrapped up their annual 
meeting today with a pledge to hold washington accountable to city 
voters and signs of potential discord among their ranks 
the talk was of bipartisanship as the us conference of mayors 
installed republicans in the organizations no 1 and no 3 posts 
but in the middle is boston mayor raymond flynn who made it 
clear that he wanted the mayors to take an aggressive stance 
against the bush administration 
this is the time to rock the boat flynn said 
colorado springs mayor robert isaac the new president of the 
conference said he hoped to strike a more cooperative relationship 
with the administration 
we want to restore the partnership he said 
democratic and republican mayors alike said it was time for 
mayors to use their local political organizations against members 
of congress who do not support cities 
were entitled to help from the federal government said 
atlanta mayor maynard jackson 
the mayors began their meeting five days ago with high hopes of 
drafting an urban agenda that counts on billions of dollars from 
the federal government 
but they since have received word from two influential members 
of congress that cities are unlikely to receive much if any of 
the peace dividend expected from cuts in defense 
that message angered the mayors who view washington as 
increasingly indifferent to urban americas needs and many vowed 
to bypass the congress and take their case to the people 
at the center of the populist appeal is the argument that 
washington has ignored cities and their poor residents while doling 
out billions to rescue the savings and loan industry 
after a decade of being told that the budget deficit prevented 
any new help for cities the mayors point to the sampl bailout as 
proof washington can find money when it has to 
now the mayors say they must improve their lobbying to make 
their voices heard in washington some mayors are threatening to 
cause political trouble for members of congress who do not go to 
the mat for cities 
it is hard for us at times to speak with one voice said 
mayor sharpe james of newark nj but the bigger problem is that 
mayors have allowed the congress to become fat cats smug secure 
assured of their positions theyre not fighting the real fights 
anymore 
the meeting concluded with the formal endorsement of a broad new 
domestic lobbying agenda that calls for major increases in federal 
funding for housing education antidrug antipoverty and other 
urban programs 
new yorks david dinkins and flynn believe a populist appeal can 
sway voters to support the mayors agenda 
we the mayors of urban america must send a message to 
washington that only after we have housed our people only after we 
have educated our young people only after we have repaired our 
roads and only after we heal our sick can we commit to the 
extravagant bailout of a corrupt system dinkins said tuesday 
never underestimate the people said flynn 
one of the newer faces among the mayors milwaukees john 
norquist said the mayors and their organization share the blame 
for the declining effectiveness in washington 
too often norquist said the mayors appeals sound like 
requests for handouts 
pity doesnt get you much he said pity usually leads to 
contempt

a canadian cruise ship has come up with a new 
gimmick to attract passengers nude dancers 
but us officials say the wayward princess had better not live 
up to its name if it strays onto the us side of the border the 
princess could get busted 
canadian owner jacques beauchamp said sinking business led to 
his venture which will operate six nights a week on the detroit 
river between detroit and windsor ontario and in lakes erie and 
st clair 
hey its going to be a fun thing to do as long as the ship 
remains a clean ship beauchamp said tuesday 
the ship which will serve alcohol will feature male and female 
nude dancers on two different decks said beauchamp 50 a windsor 
cruise operator for the past six years 
the cruiser which will charge a 5 cover when anchored and 10

peep 
if the wayward princess licensed by canada crosses 
international waters beauchamp could be fined or imprisoned under 
michigans misdemeanor obscenity laws said police officer dan 
smith of the detroit harbormasters section 
heck this is something new smith said but hed probably 
be ticketed or arrested for indecent exposure 
windsors licensing commissioner ronald reaume said the 
establishment met ontario laws personally id rather not see 
it but were not there to license the morality of the situation 
canadian police fought the licensing and said it will be 
difficult to enforce laws and ensure security aboard the 110foot 
325capacity vessel 
is our boat going to follow jacques beauchamps boat just 
waiting for trouble to start asked windsor police inspector 
glenn stannard 
beauchamp said he intends to run a tight ship they say the

the us economy is continuing to grow 
sluggishly although the construction sector appears to be 
weakening according to a federal reserve survey released wednesday 
the tone of district reports suggests continued slow growth in 
the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate 
said a summary of the survey of the 12 fed district banks 
the survey completed june 8 was similar to three polls 
conducted earlier this year that found slow but continued economic 
expansion with moderate inflation 
it was conducted by the cleveland district bank for use at the 
july 23 meeting of the central banks federal open market 
committee which establishes us monetary policy 
the fed has kept a tight grip on credit to slow the economy and 
lessen inflationary pressure some officials and economists believe 
the economy has slowed too much and could slide into recession if 
the fed does not loosen its grip 
one sign of sluggishness the survey found was very little 
growth if not a decline in real consumer spending for durable and 
nondurable goods this quarter from last 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity and has been a driving force for the economy for 
much of the last eight years since the last recession 
recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in 
several districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent 
months and are expected to remain so in the short term the 
summary said 
retail sales about half of consumer spending fell in may for 
the third consecutive month the commerce department reported last 
week the last time retail sales declined for three straight months 
was in the fall of 1981 during the last recession 
the fed said it was unclear how much unusual weather and other 
temporary factors contributed to the sales softness 
both residential and nonresidential construction have been 
edging downward in recent months in most districts and indicators 
of future construction suggest further softening the survey 
found 
an underlying problem in commercial construction is an 
apparent excess supply of new office space in many parts of the 
country particularly downtown manhattan and in metropolitan 
areas of the dallas district the report said 
credit demand appears to be easing but real estate consumer 
and business loans are still growing although at reduced rates it 
said 
lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially 
for real estate loans but there is still little information that 
suggests credit restraint is spreading to other markets the 
survey found 
it reported that manufacturing production has been relatively 
flat for several months this sector has been particularly affected 
by the feds highinterest rate policies since many of its products 
are purchased with loans 
however several districts reported they expect manufacturing to 
strengthen despite softness in some industries including defense 
building construction machinery and apparel 
automobile and related industries have been a drag on 
manufacturing in the atlanta district but chicago and cleveland 
respondents noted some strengthening in production that should add 
to total output this quarter and perhaps next 
in contrast the aerospace industry is a source of strength in 
several regions of the country boston minneapolis and san 
francisco and the energy sector is expanding dallas and kansas 
city it added 
the survey found indications of continued growth in capital 
goods industries another area of strength in recent months 
prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a 
result of ample rainfall in previously droughtstricken regions of 
the country the survey found but cool wet weather has 
delayed planting by as much as several weeks

former east german leader erich honecker 
denied wednesday that his government harbored terrorists and blamed 
the charges on a campaign against the good reputation of his 
regime 
the 77yearold honecker in a rare public statement defended 
what he said was his communist governments pursuit of peace and 
battle against terrorism 
nothing in these accusations corresponds to reality 
honecker said in a statement released through the east german 
government news agency adn 
his denial came after authorities arrested nine reputed members 
of the notorious red army faction a leftist group blamed for a 
series of bombings and killings in west germany 
all the suspects had phony identities and some said they were 
aided by members of honeckers secret police some had been 
fugitives more than a decade 
all were arrested during a twoweek stretch beginning june 6 
after west german authorities and east germanys current democratic 
government launched a hunt for terrorist suspects 
honeckers comments were the latest entry in the furious debate 
over the terrorist ties of the old regime and the sinister 
espionage war between two nations about to unify 
western authorities have long alleged the east german government 
harbored supported and perhaps trained terrorists 
the west german newspaper die welt said wednesday that east 
germanys secret police knew in advance and tolerated a 1986 
bomb attack on a west german disco by libyan terrorists two us 
soldiers and a turkish woman were killed and 229 people were 
injured 
honecker defended his stalinist government which used the vast 
secret police network to maintain his ironfisted rule for nearly 
two decades until it was toppled in october during the peaceful 
anticommunist revolution 
with the current campaign apparently the good reputation of 
the german democratic republic as a stronghold of peace and the 
easing of tensions in the world is being undermined the 
statement said 
he said the campaign seeks to negate the peaceful relations 
between the german states that honecker said he championed 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel said monday 
that harboring west german terrorists was the personal hobby of 
honecker and his ousted security chief erich mielke 
the red army faction waged a deadly terrorist war against west 
german capitalism and nato in the 1970s and 1980s the most recent 
victim deutsche bank chief alfred herrhausen was killed in a 
bombing attack in november 
like every other citizen i have followed the arrests of the 
terrorists and their supporters in the press radio and 
television honeckers statement said 
as former chief of state of the german democratic republic i 
would like to declare before the german and international public 
that i and the former communist party and state leadership of the 
gdr sharply condemned every form of terrorism on political and 
humanitarian grounds and also took part in the struggle against 
international terrorism 
honecker is in failing health and living in a hospital in the 
town of beelitz 
prime minister lothar de maiziere meanwhile chided west german 
politicians for demanding that honecker and other members of his 
government be extradited to west germany to face charges allegedly 
committed during honeckers leadership 
he said anything that happened during honeckers regime must 
be cleared up here and not elsewhere 
we are still two sovereign states he said in an interview 
wednesday with the west german newspaper bild 
the two german states are to merge their economies july 2 and 
perhaps unify fully by years end but questions remain to be 
worked out over the vast differences in the legal systems of two 
countries 
east germany has turned down west german extradition requests 
for captured terrorists suspects in an apparent tiff over 
jurisdiction and it remains unclear where they will be prosecuted

former president carter was met by protesters 
when he arrived at a lowincome neighborhood to help build seven 
homes for impoverished families 
about a dozen pickets who spoke to carter before he and his 
wife rosalynn started working on the project tuesday objected to 
the number of homes that will be built on the 1acre site in 
southeast san diego 
about 200 volunteers are working on the project which several 
neighborhood residents tried to stop in court because they believe 
the new homes would increase traffic congestion and lower property 
values a superior court judge last week declined to grant an 
injunction that would have stopped the project 
carter said he was sympathetic to the residents concerns but 
added that he believes the project is worthwhile 
i think that within a few months these concerns will be 
over and gone and forgotten carter said they will find that 
they have seven wonderful new neighbor families and the community 
will accept them 
habitat for humanity based in americus ga has sponsored 
projects in more than 600 communities in 30 countries the carters 
have been involved in the organization since 1982

the worlds newest nation namibia 
joins the queue of the worlds poorest countries thursday in asking 
prospective donor countries for startup financing to build a new 
economy 
namibia approaches the unsponsored donors conference in new 
york as a bad candidate for international aid not because it is 
too poor but because on the surface it appears rich 
grants not loans will be the theme of namibias plea 
president sam nujoma and other government officials want to 
redirect social spending toward the vast majority of poor people 
without borrowing huge amounts of foreign money 
they want onetime grants to use as startup funds for 
selfgenerated development of their country which became 
independent from south africa on march 21 
with only 13 million people in a country almost as large as 
western europe namibia has an annual per capita income of 1200 
making it the richest country in subsaharan africa 
but the majority of namibias people live in poverty and 5 
percent the whites have most of the wealth 
namibia has the highest number of tarred roads per capita in the 
world and the best ratio of hospital beds per person in africa 
water is clean in most places the telephones work and its public 
administration is on par with the developed world 
its constitution had been praised by leaders throughout the 
world as one of the most democratic documents ever devised and its 
government and people are at least for the present committed to 
a multiparty democracy and a mixed economy 
the united nations which shepherded namibia to independence by 
supervising its elections last year and the world bank have said 
the fledgling nation has the potential to become a model for peace 
and prosperity in africa 
but illiteracy stands at 60 percent housing is scares teachers 
are underqualified and aside from commercial farmland the rural 
areas are virtually undeveloped 
thirty percent of the population is unemployed armed 
exsoldiers of the former colonial army and the guerrilla forces of 
the nowruling party are posing an increasing threat to civil order 
the new government says it is under severe pressure to address 
the equity problem at an acceptable pace to the hitherto 
disenfranchised and neglected majority without jeopardizing 
growth or further neglecting its highly developed infrastructure 
independence itself has brought new expenditures such as united 
nations membership fees embassies and the creation of a central 
bank and new currency by 1992 
the government also faces a severe inherited fiscal problem to 
serve its white constituency the south african government created 
an excessively overstaffed public administration it financed the 
wage bill and public debt through higher taxes that was at the 
expense of public investment which has steadily shrunk to minimal 
levels over the past decade and is partly responsible for the 
current depressed economy 
the namibian government together with the world bank and the 
united nations development program have devised a onetime 
investment program consisting of 83 individual priority projects 
totalling 400 million to set the stage for future selfsustained 
development 
the world bank has recommended that most of the aid be given as 
direct grants so as not to give the new country a foreign debt 
problem at its birth 
but direct grants are normally allocated only to the worlds 
least developed nations and so far namibia has failed to qualify 
as one of those

a small group of environmentalists and 
labor activists picketed today outside a logging mill kicking off 
a series of redwood summer protests against the cutting of 
californias grand redwoods 
about 35 to 40 environmentalists and members of the 
international workers of the world gathered at the louisiana 
pacific plants front gate to protest clearcut logging and 
exportation of logs to mexico for cheaper processing 
i feel strongly about this i came up here to make a strong 
statement that i support the environment said one picket david 
solnit 26 a carpenter from san francisco 220 miles to the south 
there was one procompany demonstrator duane plant of eureka 
who was carrying a sign that read say no to terrorist stop 
earth first 
they scare me plant said i am afraid of getting hurt i 
am afraid of my kids getting hurt i cant believe theyre not 
violent 
the picketing was to be followed by rallies in this tiny coastal 
community near eureka the events are part of a redwood summer 
series of protests planned for northern california by the group 
earth first 
environmentalists say the protests were inspired by the freedom 
summer of 1964 when civil rights activists converged on 
mississippi 
mainstream environmental groups have distanced themselves from 
the demonstrations the sierra club has refused to endorse the 
plans and the wilderness society has denounced them 
both timber industry and environmental sources refused to 
estimate how many protesters would participate 
there will be rallies there will be a labor picket line in 
the morning there may be some civil disobedience said mickey 
dulas spokeswoman for the northcoast environmental center in 
arcata but we are committed to nonviolence 
the protests have raised tensions along the states rugged north 
coast where the economy is based largely on timber and tourism 
tensions were heightened by a may 24 bomb blast in oakland that 
injured earth first leaders judi bari and darryl cherney in a car 
it has not been determined whether they were victims of a bomber 
or were transporting the explosive when it went off

the rev friedemann gosslau 
said his heart soared when he heard that medieval artworks 
belonging to his church are believed to be in a texas bank 
he has complete faith priceless objects that disappeared in 1945 
at the end of world war ii will be found and restored to his 
500member parish and quedlinburgs 12thcentury cathedral 
we must defend the interests of the church when the pieces 
are here again we will show them but this time well need help 
with security gosslau said with a smile 
the treasures among germanys most famous artworks are the 
subjects of an international struggle the lutheran church in 
quedlinburg has filed suit in texas to try to recover a collection 
that includes a silver ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or 
10th century a 10thcentury byzantine rockcrystal flask with 
sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with precious 
stones 
it is believed the works were taken to whitewright texas by the 
late joe t meador a former army lieutenant who served in 
quedlinburg in 1945 
during the war the objects were removed from the romanesque 
cathedral to a mine shaft to keep them safe from allied bombing 
they disappeared in 1945 
gosslau came to quedlinburg 25 years ago and learned about the 
missing works by studying cathedral archives 
i thought maybe wed find traces and then convince the people 
to give the pieces back peacefully i dreamed of it but i never 
counted on it gosslau said in an interview in his home 
the lutheran minister said it was always thought the missing 
pieces could have been taken by ordinary germans during the chaotic 
end of the third reich by nazi ss forces who seized the cathedral 
at the start of the war or by the american soldiers who occupied 
the town 
then in may there was news that a private west german foundation 
that searches for stolen artworks had recovered a 9thcentury 
illuminated manuscript of the four gospels 
we had no idea where it was its fantastic news and its sure 
it comes from the church because it is described in the 
inventory gosslau said 
a second illuminated manuscript also noted in church archives 
was recovered in june full details of how those works were 
recovered have not been made public and they have not been returned 
to the church 
a federal judge tuesday ordered the first national bank of 
whitewright to open its vault for inventory by the cathedral 
we were proud of what we have and about what we didnt have 
anymore gosslau said the cathedral treasure is small but it 
is exquisite 
he would like any pieces found in texas to join the rest of the 
treasure that is kept in glass cases in the cool stone vault 
constructed in the middle ages to hold the priceless objects 
the part of the collection still in quedlinburg is a dazzling 
display that includes a syrian vase brought back by crusaders a 
4thcentury translation of the bible and a 13thcentury 
gemencrusted illimunated manuscript 
in the middle ages the vault guard was a nun trained to watch 
over the works which were used in services that the royal family 
attended 
tourists taking the cathedrals guided tour are allowed to look 
at the treasure vault a small room with tiny windows at the top of 
a staircase on the edge of the nave 
during a tour this week the guide did not mention the lost 
treasures nor were they mentioned in the small guidebook to the 
church on sale at the entrance 
the town had no chance to seek recovery of the lost valuables 
once it became part of east germany in 1949 contact was limited 
until the countrys former communist leaders opened the countrys 
borders last year 
we knew the crates were broken into and some things taken 
away but we didnt know where they went said walter gold the 
citys cultural adviser 
because the world was divided we had no contact with the west 
so we couldnt do anything about it 
the remains of heinrich i germanys first king and his wife 
mathilde are buried inside the cathedral heinrich i died in 936 
while the cathedral is still state property gosslau maintains 
that according to old laws the treasure belongs to the parish and 
should be returned to the vault

delays at the pentagon held up discovery of a 
mexican border drug smugglers tunnel for six weeks allowing 
cocaine to pour through the passage into arizona according to a 
published report 
just days after finding the northern end of the passage in 
douglas ariz federal agents intercepted a shipment of more than 
one ton of cocaine 
nobody thought there was a delay pentagon spokesman maj 
doug hart said according to todays editions of the los angeles 
times it went through regular channels 
despite a highprofile administration effort to use the military 
in drug interdiction the pentagons slow response raised questions 
about the effectiveness of the policy 
they announce that drugs are a major national security threat 
and then this takes six weeks the times quoted an unidentified 
official as asking what the heck is going on here 
customs officials said they couldnt say how much cocaine passed 
through the tunnel between midmarch when agents in arizona asked 
for military assistance in finding the passage and late april 
when the equipment arrived 
the tunnel which led to agua prieta mexico was found in 
midmay and the shipment of more than one ton of cocaine was 
stopped a few days later 
thomas mcdermott the us customs service agent in charge of 
the inquiry said the tunnel was probably a major artery for 
northwardbound drugs 
the customs service learned of the tunnel in november but could 
not find it in march the agency learned of a seismic detection 
device being developed by the military and asked for help from 
joint task force six a new military group for border narcotics 
missions 
the custom services request labeled urgent was passed up the 
chain of command from the task force to the joint chiefs of staff 
the nations highest military office 
stanley e morris deputy director of the office of national 
drug control policy called the lag unfortunate but said toplevel 
defense department review is needed to guard against missions that 
might unnecessarily anger the mexican government or deplete 
military stocks 
as folks become more comfortable with what were doing i 
think it wont have to go up to joint chiefs of staff level said 
col thomas c carter deputy commander of the joint task force 
the task force may operate only on the 300 miles of the 
1900mile usmexico frontier that is public land military 
patrols along the rest of the border must be conducted by the 
national guard

the guardians of french who spend much of their 
time defending the purity of their mother tongue have conceded it 
contains absurdities uncertainties and anomalies and issued 15 
pages of spelling corrections 
the governmentrequested overhaul proved that spelling is a 
national psychodrama the daily newspaper liberation said 
premier michel rocard who requested the spelling review last 
year on tuesday accepted the changes submitted by the high council 
on the french language he ordered that the new spellings be taught 
in all schools starting next year 
he also ordered a meeting of dictionary specialists publishing 
houses the press and all those dealing with the written word to 
find the best way to make the new spellings the norm 
it was never a question that the government legislate in such 
matters the language belongs to those who use it rocard said 
but it is up to the government to favor that usage which 
appears most satisfactory 
anticipating a collective shudder from the citizenry the high 
council offered reassurances the new spellings would for example 
change no more than two words on two full pages of prousts la 
pleiade 
small comfort to schoolchildren parents and teachers said an 
association of university professors who predicted that some words 
would have two different spellings for years to come 
once again students parents and teachers will be disoriented 
and finish by accepting no rules at all said the societe des 
agreges under the pretext of correcting fancied anomalies new 
ones are being introduced 
the high council said it was not reforming the language only 
making certain rectifications of absurdities uncertainties 
and anomalies that troubled the experts themselves 
the five categories of changes affect the hyphen accent marks 
the plural form of compound words accordance of the past 
participle in reflexive verbs and a potpourri of anomalies 
the hyphen much used in french is going out of style 
according to the sages who are all but discarding it even the 
hyphen used in english words like cowboy striptease or 
weekend will disappear 
there will be fewer circumflexes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
accent grave the left to right slash above certain letters 
will be generalized removing the many exceptions under which 
it is applied 
more drastic changes do away with the feminine e or plural 
s when according past participles with reflexive verbs in 
certain cases and the second half of compound words when plural 
will always end in s while the first half will lose the s 
the academie francaise whose 40 immortals are the ultimate 
arbiters of the french language approved the changes along with 
the councils of the french language of the french communities of 
belgium and quebec 
the french language has always been a reverent issue here and 
successive governments have tried to stamp out anglicisms and other 
impurities sometimes resorting to fines for offenders 
last week president francois mitterrand a vociferous defender 
of his mother tongue complained that english was supplanting 
french in the european community 
mitterrand said ensuring the place of french as an official ec 
language was a top priority of his government and added that 
france was prepared to help the ec enable its employees to 
acquire the linguistic competence needed to perform their 
missions 
but the university professors said the spelling changes would 
defeat that cause 
once again the error is being made that french is no longer a 
universal language because it is too difficult english has become 
a spoken language around the world the group said despite the 
fact that its spelling is unchanged and often without logic

lech walesa said in an interview wednesday 
that he must become president to preserve polands new democracy 
and prevent his former allies in solidarity from forming a 
dangerous power monopoly 
the union leader challenged his former friends in warsaw who now 
oppose him to start a separate centerleft political party and 
relinquish using the broad label of solidarity 
i do not want to be president but i will have to be 
president walesa said in the interview in gazeta wyborcza 
polands largest newspaper 
as president walesa said he would not oppose the government of 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki but he would use presidential 
decrees to put the problems of our country in order 
specifically he would intervene to stop holdover communist 
officials from purloining state property they still control 
walesa said he is waging political war because he is in deadly 
fear that a new power monopoly is being formed by his former 
solidarity allies who control the government parliament and media 
now i will create a war at the top it is a war that i 
want to win walesa said 
what is really needed right now is patience responded 
solidarity parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek one of the 
former allies targeted by walesa 
asked by radio solidarity about walesas comments geremek said 
polands success is possible only when we have patience and 
hope 
i think that mr walesa at the moment is unaware that by means 
of his way of thinking way of talking declarations he creates 
danger for this very weak democracy we have achieved in poland 
geremek said 
in recent months open conflict has erupted between walesa at 
union headquarters in gdansk and the east blocs first 
noncommunist government in warsaw the government was created by 
solidarity and led by mazowiecki who like geremek was among 
walesas closest advisers for nearly a decade 
walesa says his motive is political pluralism the framing of 
distinct parties to push the reform process faster now that a 
united solidarity no longer faces a united communist foe 
i am in deadly fear of a monopoly not of my friends but of 
their successors that once again i will be in prison and my 
children for sure because every monopoly ends up like that 
walesa said 
a new political group the center alliance backs walesa for 
president on tuesday walesa met with peasant party 
representatives who could offer substantial support like walesa 
the center alliance says it wants to speed change in poland and 
accuses mazowieckis government and geremeks parliament caucus of 
acting too slowly to oust former communists from positions of power 
government supporters including many longterm solidarity 
figures are trying to form a counteralliance out of local 
citizens committees that ran solidaritys parliament campaign last 
year 
the stillunnamed federation rejects political labels but 
advocates stability and unity to support the government while 
dramatic economic reforms are under way it wants to calm fears 
among westerners considering investment in poland 
the continued presence in the government of president wojciech 
jaruzelski the former head of the nowdissolved communist party 
symbolizes the dispute the general who declared martial law 
against solidarity was given the post to smooth the transition in 
oncehistoric reform agreements now overtaken by the breadth of 
change in eastern europe 
jaruzelskis term runs to 1995 but a new constitution could 
change that date it is widely expected that presidential elections 
will occur no later than next spring 
although nominally in charge of the army jaruzelski has been a 
largely ceremonial head of state and has done nothing to block the 
mazowiecki government 
but walesa said that we need a president with an axe 
decisive sharp forthright 
if this axe is supposed to undercut this fledgling polish 
democracy i would be against it geremek said 
walesa also alluded to suggestions printed in gazeta wyborcza 
that he is not refined enough to be president 
criticism that i do not know how to talk with presidents 
walesa asked i have talked to them and they want to talk with 
me

president bush today suspended an 
18month dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
saying the group had failed to forcefully condemn an unsuccessful 
may 30 terrorist attack against israel 
bush said the united states cannot maintain contact with the plo 
as long as this terroristic act is sticking in our throat he 
called on the plo to satisfy us that those who are responsible 
would be disciplined 
bush conceded that his decision might prompt renewed violence in 
the region he said he hoped that wouldnt be the case and added 
i would like to see the peace process move forward 
weve given the plo ample time to deal with this issue bush 
said at a news conference at the marshall space flight center 
bush has called on plo chairman yasser arafat previously to 
condemn the may 30 raid he said a general plo statement denouncing 
attacks against civilians was not sufficient to meet us terms 
for a continuation of the diplomatic talks 
at any time the plo is prepared to take the necessary steps 
we are prepared to resume the dialogue he said 
bush called on all parties in the middle east to eschew violence 
and said i would like to see the peace process move forward 
bush called the may 30 attempted attack a seaborne terrorist 
infiltration and said the size of the force and the geographic 
target strongly indicated that civilians would have been the 
target 
bush had urged arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline 
those who sent two speedboats filled with palestinian fighters 
toward tel aviv where they were spotted by radar and intercepted 
by the israeli navy 20 miles offshore 
the palestine liberation front a faction of the plo headed by 
abul abbas claimed responsibility for the attack in which four 
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured 
at the same time bush said the dialogue begun in the final 
months of the reagan administration had contributed to progress 
in the peace process 
he said the united states is prepared to resume contacts with 
the plo one day we are committed to a comprehensive 
settlementhe said 
he added that any peace process must recognize israels security 
and palestinian rights 
bush recently wrote israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who 
heads a newly formed government in an effort to revive the 
process through an emissary israeli cabinet secretary eliakim 
rubinstein the government in jerusalem has promised to pursue 
peace with the arabs 
on other subjects bush 
said he does not plan a bold new initiative to help the 
ailing soviet economy he said his administration stands ready to 
talk with allies who reportedly favor a costly plan to assist 
mikhail s gorbachevs program of economic reform 
defended his press secretary marlin fitzwater for his 
comments on tuesday critical of democrats on the savings and loan 
bailout issue he said fitzwater was responding to a couple of 
shots across my bow on the subject he said he hopes to work with 
congress to fix the difficulties and said active prosecution is 
under way of those who violated the law 
said he would tell nelson mandela next week that american 
sanctions against south africa will remain in place until 
conditions fixed under law are met he also paid a tribute to south 
african president fw de klerk for what hes done to start 
dismantling apartheid hes come a long way bush said 
the israeli embassy issued a statement praising bushs 
suspension of the plo talks israel believes that the 
administrations decision will enhance and promote the peace 
process and will encourage those palestinians seeking peace with 
israel to seize upon this opportunity to begin a direct dialogue 
with israel the embassy said 
in new york the plo envoy to the united nations said he would 
reserve comment on reports the united states will sever its 
dialogue with the plo until the government makes an official 
announcement 
zehdi labib terzi permanent observer of what the united nations 
calls palestine said he could not respond until he reads the 
official statement 
un officials said that secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar would not comment in advance of the official announcement 
the united nations considers the plo to be the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people 
rep william broomfield rmich the senior republican on the 
house foreign affairs committee said bushs decision was the 
only one he could have made under the circumstances 
america must let arafat know that the plo cant talk peace and 
wage war at the same time he said in a statement president 
bush was wise to suspend rather than terminate the talks arafat 
should know that the united states is still willing to cooperate in 
the search for peace but not under the barrel of a gun 
the dialogue with the plo was established by the reagan 
administration in december 1988 after arafat at the urging of the 
united states disavowed terrorism and recognized israels 
existence 
talks have been held since then outside tunis the plo 
headquarters between plo officials and robert pelletreau jr the 
us ambassador to tunisia 
the state department in a report to congress in march said the 
plo was adhering to its commitment palestinian groups have 
launched nearly 30 border and rocket attacks against israel since 
the talks began 
but the report said we have no evidence in those cases or 
any others that the actions were authorized or approved by the plo 
executive committee or by arafat personally 
abbas is a member of the committee 
a number of talks were held by pelletreau with plo officials 
since may 30 but us peacemaking efforts in the middle east have 
been stalled for months over israeli objections to the american 
formua for negotiations 
the 1988 us opening to the plo boosted the prestige of arafat 
and his organization in putting together a framework for 
negotiations the bush administration consulted with the plo mostly 
through egypt

republican gov guy hunt billed 
president bush as the feature attraction at a fundraiser 
wednesday but for alabama voters the real show now is the broiling 
democratic gubernatorial runoff 
it has been a freeswinging namecalling political slugfest 
replete with whiffs of marijuana smoke and allusions to adolf 
hitler and a convicted child molester 
beneath blazing skies state teacher lobbyist paul hubbert and 
attorney general don siegelman have exchanged rhetorical blows 
since the june 5 primary when hubbert led siegelman by 49000 votes 
the winner of tuesdays runoff will move on to the november 
election against hunt the first republican governor of alabama in 
112 years 
siegelman struck first following the primary when he accused 
hubbert of defending incompetent teachers including a convicted 
child molester and making worthless promises that would double 
the state budget and cost 10 billion in new taxes 
hubbert in turn linked siegelman rhetorically to hitler and to 
jane fonda who is still reviled by many alabamans for her antiwar 
protests during the vietnam war 
he also indirectly reminded voters that the state attorney 
general admitted smoking marijuana briefly in college hubbert 
began carrying a mop and buket on the campaign trail saying it was 
time for siegelman to clean up his act 
on the eve of bushs arrival in huntsville for the hunt 
reelection fundraiser hubbert and siegelman called a truce at 
least temporarily 
the temperature was 98 degrees at the state capital but in 
nearby prattville the two democratic runoff opponents talked coolly 
of democratic unity the setting was an autauga county democratic 
club forum 
no matter what the outcome i pledge im going to get behind 
the democratic ticket said hubbert i hope to lead it but if 
not im going to get behind it 
i know that paul hubbert and don siegelman are going to do 
what we can to make sure there is a democratic party victory in 
november said siegelman 
hubbert 54 and siegelman 44 are depicted by hunt as 
liberals but both have stressed their conservatism while calling 
for more progressive and dynamic leadership in montgomery 
and both have relied heavily on negative advertising 
siegelman is making bobby sanders the willie horton of the 
alabama runoff horton is the convicted massachusetts murderer who 
unwittingly played a prominent role in the 1988 presidential race 
sanders convicted of sodomizing teenage boys in tennessee was 
provided legal counsel by the alabama education association in 1985 
when he fought his firing as a teacher in huntsville 
sanders was entitled to the counsel through his membership in 
the teacher organization but siegelman repeatedly has raised the 
case in ads and speeches 
many of our children are going without books science labs and 
decent facilities said siegelman yet we have to spend our 
taxpayer money to keep child abusers out of classrooms mr 
hubbert thats dead wrong 
hubbert said siegelmans tactics bring to mind hitlers big 
lie tactic of boldly repeating a falsehood until it is accepted 
as truth 
in another campaign salvo siegelman said hubberts promises 
would cost alabama taxpayers 1 billion in new taxes over four 
years to that hubbert said one must wonder what he was smoking 
that may have caused him to come up with those numbers 
that was a thinly disguised allusion to siegelmans marijuana 
admission siegelman spokesman rick dent called it a cheap shot 
hubbert also pointed out that siegelman received a 1986 campaign 
contribution from a group that included ms fonda siegelman said 
he sent the money back 
dr william stewart a political science professor at the 
university of alabama who is coauthor of a 1988 book on alabama 
politics said the 1990 runoff is not unusual in its viciousness 
but he said it could hurt the democratic nominee in the general 
election 
the level of rhetoric has reached the point where the main 
beneficiary in my opinion is guy hunt stewart said

five men have been charged with robbing a 
grave and using the body of a suicide victim as the centerpiece for 
a blackrobed ceremony in a fantasy game of dungeon and dragons 
the men were arrested monday and tuesday and charged with 
stealing the body of 20yearold steven glen morgan columbia 
county sheriff tom tramel said morgans body missing one leg was 
found last month in a wooded area in adjacent union county 
morgans mother later found the leg propped against a tree in 
the same woods authorities said 
tramel said investigators do not think the leg was intentionally 
separated from the body 
tramel said the five gathered frequently to play dungeons and 
dragons a fantasy game in which players pretend to be characters 
with great strength or magical powers as they participate in a 
quest of their own devising 
we believe that the motive was due to their involvement with 
dungeons and dragons which they have been involved in for quite 
some time and that became very serious tramel said 
dungeons and dragons game was developed as a board game in 1973 
and became popular in the early 1980s detractors say the way the 
game is sometimes played is dangerous because it can blur 
distinctions between fantasy and reality 
morgans mother dorothy morgan said tuesday that one of those 
arrested had called her to say her sons body had been taken to a 
house near lake city where about 30 to 40 people dressed in black 
robes held a ceremony she did not identify the caller 
at one point he called me and told me to keep my mouth shut 
because glen belonged to them now she said 
god will see that they will pay she said 
arrested were leon jody thompson 21 charles vincent womack 
jr 23 thomas christian cox 21 joseph r pottgen 21 and 
frederick day 19 all live in the lake city area about 60 miles 
west of jacksonville in north florida 
they were charged with disturbing the contents of a grave a 
felony that carries a fiveyear maximum sentence and were being 
held wednesday in the county detention center pending court 
appearances 
the turning point in the case was when a person who witnessed 
the grave robbery talked to officials said investigator russ 
williams his name is being withheld tramel said because he fears 
for his life 
investigators are trying to determine whether there is a link 
between the morgan grave robbery and another grave robbery in the 
area last october that body was found in a field by a farmer 
before anyone knew the grave had been disturbed 
authorities are not sure what the suspects did with the body or 
how it got to union county they also do not think the five knew 
morgan before he died in december from a selfinflicted gunshot 
wound

the parliaments of georgia and uzbekistan took 
cautious steps toward sovereignty on wednesday but followed a 
different path than the one blazed by the baltic republics 
they were the latest challenges to face president mikhail s 
gorbachev who has been offering greater autonomy in an effort to 
persuade the soviet unions increasingly restive republics to 
remain within the fold 
uzbekistans supreme soviet passed a declaration of 
sovereignty of the uzbek soviet socialist republic within a renewed 
soviet federation the official soviet news agency tass reported 
it was the first of the five soviet central asian republics to move 
toward a break with moscow 
the renewed soviet federation referred to in the declaration 
does not currently exist gorbachev has spoken often of revamping 
the relationship between the soviet government and the republics 
last week he offered to establish a new looser union of 
sovereign states joined under a treaty 
some 1240 miles away the georgian supreme soviet decided to 
create a legal mechanism for restoring the republics independence 
tass reported 
neither step was as radical as the declarations of independence 
approved by the soviet baltic republics but they showed how the 
spirit of breaking from central rule is spreading across this vast 
multiethnic country 
gorbachev imposed economic sanctions against lithuania after it 
declared its independence march 11 he called the declaration 
illegal and demanded it be suspended 
some deputies of uzbekistans parliament meeting in the 
republican capital tashkent wanted to postpone consideration of 
the sovereignty declaration until the new union treaty is 
completed tass said but they were overruled and the declaration 
was approved by a majority 
the declaration proclaims uzbekistans state sovereignty and 
the supremacy of republican laws on its entire territory tass 
said the declaration puts all issues of domestic and foreign 
policy under the authority of uzbekistan 
the tass report made clear uzbekistan is not considering 
seceding from the soviet union but one uzbek official said no 
options were being ruled out 
if it the union doesnt support the wellbeing of the 
workers doesnt get us out of the crisis then we will be obliged 
to think it over with deputies uzbek premier sh mirsaidov told 
soviet television 
uzbekistan a cottongrowing republic of 20 million people is 
home of the regions bestorganized grassroots political movement 
berlik and is a center for activism by the majority moslem 
population 
there are many sources of discontent with moscow 
the economy environment and ethnic relations among people in 
the arid region have suffered from central kremlin rule 
unemployment is the highest in the nation overfertilization has 
polluted waterways and ruined crops and ethnic tensions are boiling 
over 
georgias supreme soviet decided to form a commission to create 
a legal mechanism for restoring the independence the republic lost 
after red army troops occupied the area in 1921 
tass said lawmakers in the mountainous republic of 53 million 
people also gave preliminary approval to a law on economic 
independence and appealed to the russian federations legislature 
to establish ties with it as a sovereign government 
on march 9 the georgian supreme soviet condemned the republics 
annexation by the soviet union and urged negotiations on 
independence becoming the fourth of the 15 soviet republics to 
begin a parliamentary struggle for secession 
wednesdays session was held a month ahead of scheduled in 
response to demands from hungerstriking university students in the 
georgian capital of tbilisi tass said

q mr president about your announcement 
q mr president 
bush yes john sorry norm 
q doesnt your announcement of today coupled with secretary 
bakers words that the israelis should call the white house when 
they are serious mean that the us position on the peace process 
in the middle east is dormant right now 
bush john its not moving forward right now and the offer 
still stands i have sent a letter to prime minister shamir i have 
very specifically asked questions that relate to seriousness about 
the peace process 
but i would like to see the peace process move forward nothing 
herein should indicate anything different because here we are 
simply taking inaudible shot at terrorism 
norm excuse me i forgot my protocol here 
q marlin seemed to have lit a fairly short political fuse with 
his comments on the sampl bailout in accusing the democrats of having 
had a big part in that mess 
are you ready to play that game this election year and blame the 
democrats for a problem that others have laid on years of 
permissive regulation by the reagan administration 
bush norm youre almost getting me into the fight by the way 
you ask the question but no im not going to chuckles no i 
want to get the savings and loan problem solved 
and marlin properly seeing a couple of shots across my bow 
from certain distinguished members of the united states senate 
decided not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response 
what he did was appropriate but what im trying to do is not 
respond to individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this 
on this process and not try to be out there saying heres whos to 
blame and heres whos not to blame 
but it was interesting because i think youre right a spark 
seemed to be ignited there and i think more important than 
continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively with 
the congress in trying to get this mess solved 
and of course that is a part of what will be discussed in the 
budget process 
i would say to the american people on this one the obligation 
is to protect the depositor thats what our obligation is 
and another obligation is to prosecute those who have broken the 
law and there has been an active prosecution under way i talked 
with dick thornburgh at lunch yesterday i got some impressive 
numbers of the numbers of cases that are that are being followed 
up on now and i expect well see plenty more 
so protect the depositor put those that are guilty into the 
dock where they belong and see that they are you know brought to 
responsibility for what theyve done 
q do you in retrospect though agree with the argument that 
deregulation or unregulation of the savings and loan the financial 
industry occurred too quickly went too far in the 80s 
bush well i think in looking back i think some of the 
excesses of the loan policies are rather obvious basically we 
made some proposals i think in that task force that i headed that 
might have corrected some of the abuse 
but i dont want to i dont want to argue in favor of 
reregulation of industries but i will say that i think some of 
the loan policies instituted after the changes were made were 
foolish and were certainly illadvised and the result is a 
pounding for the original purpose of the sampls which was financing 
primarily financing housing in this country 
yeah john 
q is it true that none of our allies with the exception of 
course of the israelis wanted you to suspend these talks with the 
plo and you said you have given the plo enough time i mean why 
now i mean is there some reason to toughen in today 
bush no i dont think of any reason today and i didnt set 
it you know in my mind x numbers of days but john i think 
there will be a lack of agreement with what ive done here on the 
part of our strongest allies 
and i know this is true on the part of some of the most 
reasonable and moderate arab states 
but i would simply remind them of the conditions upon which the 
dialogue started in the first place and i would also remind them 
that if they look at this statement and remedial action is taken 
the dialogue from the us side can promptly be restored

q mr president at the same time youre having this trouble 
with the plo youve also got a new israeli government that has an 
avowed policy of settling in the west bank more rapidly than its 
been settled in the past how are you going to deal with that 
government whats your policy going to be on aid for that 
government specifically on housing guarantees for soviet 
immigrants 
bush well jerry i think i probably my position on 
settlement in the territories is probably as well known as 
anything and our policy is not to have new settlements and our 
policy is certainly not to finance new settlements is that 
responsive or was there another part to your question 
q theres a specific question now though of whether well 
provide housing guarantees for soviet immigrants of 100 million 
bush well but not to settle in the in the post 67 
territory in the territories beyond the 67 lines 
q are you going to seek specific new guarantees from this new 
government that that wont happen 
bush well i will and i hope im successful but i think they 
they there is no question that the shamir government knows my 
position on this knows the standing position of the united states 
here and then jim 
q mr president as you know nelson mandela arrived in the 
united states today and youre going to meet with him next week 
what are you going to tell him on the sanctions question 
and second the second part there have been reports oh some 
weeks ago that the united states central intelligence agency was 
involved in a process that led to a rift many years ago and there 
have been suggestions that you should apologize on behalf of the 
united states government and the american people will you do that 
bush no i will take my leadership on that question from mr 
mandela who put it very well when he said let bygones be 
bygones and that is not to agree with or disagree with the 
charge 
on the second point your first my second the sanctions 
under the law cannot be lifted until certain additional steps are 
taken by south africa 
let me be very clear i salute mr de klerk for what hes done 
hes come a long long way and i salute mr mandela for his 
approach to de klerk i think that demonstrates a willingness to 
talk that few of us might have predicted a couple of years ago but 
there still are things that have to be done under our law in order 
to lift the sanctions 
and ive listed them here but anyway you dont want to go into 
the details on it but if you do id be glad to click them off for 
you 
but in any event there has to be progress and id like to find 
a way to show mr de klerk that we the united states are grateful 
for this new approach that is having south africa evolve to a much 
more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color blind 
in terms of participation in the political process 
but i cant lift the sanctions under existing us law but im 
looking forward to talking to mr mandela about this there are 
black leaders in south africa that disagree with him on this 
question of sanctions the foremost of those that come to mind is 
mr buthelezi but with whom i have talked about this question 
and i historically have not felt that certainly adding to the 
sanction base would help at all and i had some original 
reservations about a sanction approach but i will say that it 
seems to if you can credit sanctions with the evolution of 
towards democracy in south africa id have to say well it seems 
to be you know there are some good things to it 
but its delicate because i want to find a way to show our 
appreciation to de klerk and yet i dont want to pull the rug out 
from under mr mandela

q mr president 
q mr president are you 
bush oh jim sorry well come back youre standing up i 
cant see you 
q mr president are you planning to support a g7 initiative 
to offer economic aid to the soviet union at next months economic 
summit and if so what has caused you to change your mind on that 
bush no im not planning to do that and i expect though 
that matter may be discussed there are ive tried to be very up 
front with mr gorbachev when he was here about difficulties in 
terms of financial support i talked to him in malta about that 
indeed we presented him with a list of things that might be 
done to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with them 
on that 
but i dont plan a new a new initiative and yet i want to 
see perestroika continue i havent changed my view that economic 
reform is important and i recognize that support from the west can 
well can well help the economy 
but there is an awful lot of reform that has to take place in 
the market and the distribution systems theres some political 
problems that we have that ive discussed very frankly with mr 
gorbachev not the least of them 5 billion a year going down to 
cuba 
so weve still got some problems there but discount the fact 
that we are planning some bold new initiative on the other hand 
im perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject and i 
think that will probably be one of them 
q well there are reports that president mitterrand would 
propose such a plan is that 
bush well the germans are interested too and im not saying 
were not interested but i am saying there are some formidable 
obstacles 
yeah jim 
q back on the plo one of the theories passed around in your 
own administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack was 
to derail the peace process are you at all concerned that by 
suspending the dialogue youre playing into the hands of the 
hardliners like abu abbus and is there also a danger 
bush yes let me stop you there just to respond so i dont 
get forget the question yes i am concerned about that go ahead 
scattered laughter 
q well if youre so concerned about it then why did you why 
did you take this action 
bush well because we had to weigh the whole question and the 
question was complicated by the fact that there were three specific 
undertakings one of which a very important one in my view has 
clearly has been violated 
so but its not an easy call because i know some feel that 
the plo dialogue is totally unproductive and as i indicated in 
this statement i dont 
and the question up here was well do our allies will they 
agree with the steps that ive taken here in huntsville today and 
the answer is no some of them will not agree because they do 
feel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some parts 
of the middle east 
so so what the answer to it is is for the plo to take the 
action that ive called for and to satisfactorily to satisfy us 
that those who were responsible will be disciplined and condemn 
this specific act its not enough to simply reiterate ones 
concern on terror 
q if i may follow up 
bush please 
q is there a danger too that those palestinians who would put 
some hope in the dialogue between the plo and the us might now 
throw up their hands in desperation and resort to violence 
bush well i hope thats not the case and yet i would refer 
you to the very last page of my last paragraph or two of the 
statement when i did call for no violence and i think its fair 
to say that at any time youre dealing with something as 
complicated as the middle east you worry about that 
but i hope thats not the case and i hope theyll see in my 
statement a rather temperate view here that though were specific 
in calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act 
that once that is done in keeping with the arafats arafats 
undertaking that we can resume talks 
there has been a frustration jim in the arab world that this 
dialogue has not resulted in more progress and i understand the 
frustration i dont happen to agree with it i think things are 
better because weve had the dialogue but israel has strongly 
objected to it and some palestinians have been as we can clearly 
see concerned about it but i believe that we ought to try to find 
a way to get it back at some point

future international aids meetings wont be 
held in the united states and other countries that restrict the 
entry of people infected with the aids virus a top conference 
official said wednesday 
its not appropriate to hold the conference in countries that 
have restrictions said dr paul volberding of the university of 
california san francisco 
volberding is the incoming president of the international aids 
society which picks the sites for the annual aids meeting he is 
also cochairman of this years gathering the sixth international 
conference on aids being held this week in san francisco 
volberding said that canada japan and australia are among other 
countries that will be barred from being hosts of the meeting 
because of similar restrictions on travel by foreigners infected 
with the aids virus 
while the united states has significantly eased rules on 
admitting people who carry hiv the aids virus the regulations 
have emerged as a major issue at this meeting and about 100 
organizations are boycotting because of them 
it isnt fair its discriminatory and it wont do anything 
to stop the spread of hiv infection volberding said 
in 1987 the us senate voted 97 to 0 to add hiv infection to 
the list of medical conditions for which foreigners can be denied 
visas in april the justice department said it would issue special 
10day visas for people traveling to the united states to attend 
specific conferences including the aids meeting without requiring 
them to admit they are infected with hiv 
administration officials have contended they cant throw out the 
hiv restriction entirely since it was imposed by the senate 
however dr june osborn chairman of the national commission on 
aids said federal health officials should regrasp their 
authority to decide which diseases are contagious enough to be on 
the list 
the 1992 aids meeting is scheduled to be sponsored by harvard 
university in boston last week harvard officials threatened to 
withdraw from the meeting unless the travel rules are changed 
on wednesday alan fein head of the harvard aids institute 
said harvard will pull out unless all restrictions on people with 
hiv infection have been eliminated by the time congress adjourns in 
november 
volberding said that if the boston meeting is abandoned it may 
be too late to find another country to be host of the 1992 
gathering the meeting is scheduled to be held in florence italy 
next year and in berlin in 1993 
the international aids meetings are the principal forum for 
exchanging new information on the spread and control of the 
epidemic an estimated 12000 scientists doctors social workers 
and other aids professionals are expected to attend this weeks 
meeting

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
sound out us allies on a proposed western aid package to boost 
the faltering soviet economy but president bush said wednesday he 
sees formidable obstacles to such assistance 
us officials said baker was expected to take up the proposed 
assistance package being pushed by both west germany and france 
at negotiating sessions in east berlin on the question of german 
unification 
direct aid to the soviets is viewed as one way to overcome 
kremlin resistance to nato membership for a unified germany 
asked at a news conference in huntsville ala about the soviet 
aid proposals bush said he was willing to discuss the matter with 
us allies but cautioned against looking for any bold new 
initiative coming from the upcoming sevennation economic summit 
i am not saying we are not interested but i am saying that 
there are some formidable obstacles bush said 
bush mentioned the need for the soviets to do more to reform 
their economy and alluded to congressional opposition because of 
the crackdown on the breakaway baltic republics and continued 
soviet assistance to cuba 
there are some political problems that we have that i have 
discussed very frankly with mr gorbachev not the least of them 
the 5 billion a year going down to cuba bush said 
the west german government several months ago took the lead in 
offering to help president mikhail s gorbachev cope with his 
economic woes 
the bush administration approved the overture as part of a 
ninepoint package baker discussed two weeks ago with soviet 
minister eduard shevardnadze at a human rights conference in 
copenhagen 
one of the goals of the discussions is to see how we can 
assist the soviet economy through some sort of economic package 
a us official said before baker left for east berlin its 
likely they will discuss it in berlin 
french president francois mitterrand said tuesday he would ask 
the united states and five other major industrial democracies to 
consider extending financial and technical aid to the soviets at an 
economic summit meeting in houston next month 
baker officials said also was weighing other assurances to 
allay moscows concerns 
officials said those assurances included issuance of 
declarations by nato and the sovietled warsaw pact designed to 
reflect the lowering of eastwest tension and the prospective 
withdrawal of tens of thousands of us and soviet troops from 
europe 
the monthly 2plus4 talks bring together the four victors 
of world war ii the united states the soviet union britain and 
france and the two germanies who are set to merge their 
currencies july 2 and may hold allgerman elections in december 
baker also will meet separately with shevardnadze on friday and 
on thursday with markus meckel and hansdietrich genscher of east 
germany and west germany 
gorbachevs economic problems are apt to be compounded when east 
germany is absorbed by west germany there are an estimated 380000 
soviet troops in east germany some would stay for a transitional 
period under a us proposal baker took up with shevardnadze in 
copenhagen 
but the soviets would be limited to no more than 195000 
soldiers in all of central europe including what is now east 
germany under a treaty being negotiated in vienna by nato and the 
warsaw pact 
the return of the troops would strain the soviet budget both in 
terms of housing them and finding jobs for those mustered out of 
the service as part of a cutback of 500000 men promised by 
gorbachev in december 1988 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
proposed aid package could include the possibility of having the 
west germans pay for housing the withdrawn soldiers in the soviet 
union 
but the official added well hold off any serious decisions 
until the summit 
baker also is likely to discuss with shevardnadze a renewed 
soviet threat to suspend emigration of soviet jews if israel keeps 
settling some of them on the west bank and in gaza 
the bush administration also opposes allowing jews to live on 
land israel seized from jordan and egypt during the 1967 mideast 
war and that the arabs hope to recover but the threat to suspend 
emigration which gorbachev voiced here june 3 at the end of his 
washington summit meeting with president bush is stiffly opposed 
by the administration 
baker told shevardnadze in copenhagen that he was concerned 
about gorbachevs threat to end an exodus of jews that has reached 
20000 people a month a historic high 
shevardnadze told baker that soviet officials had no plan to 
change their immigration policy but a us official said that 
gorbachev since then twice has raised the prospect of suspending 
exit permits unless israel gives assurances the refugees wont 
settle in the territories

q mr president 
q follow up sir what about the flip side of that coin if i 
might as you grappled with this did you worry and are you worried 
now that israel will just take this and say see weve been 
right about the plo all along and 
bush im not so troubled on that because i think they will see 
here that i am not accepting the premise that there is no good to 
come from talking to the plo so i dont worry too much about that 
point 
q but do you see mr shamir as too hard line as the kind of 
leader who is going to say well we were right and therefore 
well stay away from inaudible 
bush well i am hoping thats not the case and one of the 
reasons i sent him this long lengthy letter was to make clear to 
him that it is our view the peace process ought to go forward and 
its going to be difficult for him but it must go forward and it 
must go forward along the original the lines of what originally 
was the shamir plan and then it became mubarak got interested and 
he played a useful role in it then jim baker got involved and has 
done a heroic job in trying to get the talks going 
so we are we are i hope that the us will have a useful 
role to play regardless of the step i have taken here in the plo 
because as we all know we were not proposing that the plo be at 
the table this was a charge made against us by some of the some 
in israel and that isnt that doesnt happen to be the case and 
i think the government knows that 
yes rita excuse me i shouldnt have gotten you earlier 
q mr president during the campaign you said often that weve 
got to find a way that people who have children wont be threatened 
with the loss of their jobs and now youre saying that that has to 
be a voluntary provision on the part of employers to give parental 
leave how does that fulfill your campaign promise for people who 
work for employers who wont give voluntary leave 
bush youve got to keep working for them till they do because 
my campaign promise did not go to what they call mandated benefits 
and just to be sure i was right we looked it up again yesterday 
and but my position has not changed and i see that i must 
convince some republicans as well as many democrats that it hasnt 
changed 
q do you have any point of view on how you are going to 
convince these employers many of them say if its not a mandatory 
requirement why should they do it 
bush well i have a great great faith that collective 
bargaining and market forces move towards progress and weve seen 
it in the private sector and i want to see it faster and quicker 
in the private sector without burdening every business by the same 
formula of mandated benefits 
q mr president 
bush yes charles excuse me 
q you specified that the plo dialogue has been positive and 
productive but you havent really told us in what way could you 
be a little more specific about that what productivity do you see 
in it 
bush well i think the very fact we are talking can and 
thats one of the reasons i hope that it can be restored can 
eliminate differences and i would like to feel that the plo 
because of our dialogue doesnt see us as quite the hostile 
country that once they did 
and theres all kinds of small points that are taken up by our 
ambassador pelletreau in tunis that i think have reduced the levels 
of misunderstanding i dont want to leave you the wrong 
impression that i think the dialogue has resulted in a more 
dynamic peace process but i do think its i do think that its 
good and i think that it encourages moderation in the palestinian 
within the plo ranks 
i think the we lose sight of the fact that arafat did 
something that was predicted no palestinian leader could do when he 
recognized israels right to exist as a state and some might say 
well its about time and im one of them but that was quite 
a step forward 
it was quite a step forward when he recognized resolution 242 
and i think that was positive and then i think weve had a chance 
to solidify those gains modest though they might have been 
through dialogue 
but i cant point to the fact that that has really solved the 
question of middle east peace i just feel that talking offers more 
potential than stiffarming each other and yet we cant digest it 
as long as this this terroristic act is sticking in our throat 
and properly so as a country that decries international terror

q mr president a question about rafters here 
bush the rafters coming two rafter questions here 
q a question about space how serious are you about this 
lunarbased mars mission proposal would you go so far as to veto 
the bill that contains nasa appropriations if congress decides to 
delete all the money 
bush i havent even contemplated any veto strategy id like to 
get what i want i think its in the national interest i think 
that the united states must remain way out front on science and 
technology and this broad program that ive outlined seed money 
that ive asked for should be supported but im not i think 
its way too early to discuss veto strategy weve got to take one 
took one on the chops in a house committee the other day and 
ive got to turn around now and fight for what i believe 
yeah and then over to brit yeah 
q mr president how far will you go to protect the nasa budget 
in the future can you remove it from hud and give it to 
bush its pretty hard given the way congress functions and 
that is a function of the congress not of the executive branch to 
decide under what committees these budgets are budgets are worked 
but i think it is fair to say that i will fight for a 
fullyfunded space program weve put forward what i think is a 
bold one ive taken some shots saying hey how can you propose 
something this big when we have such a large deficit and i 
understand the question but were talking about stretched out 
were talking about stretchedout financing and were talking about 
hopefully a continued dynamic economy and between the two we can 
accommodate this goal if we all get with it 
brit up in the attic 
q was there not a need here sir to not appear to be indulgent 
of the plo at a time when the administration has been tougher than 
perhaps any recent administration has been to israel 
bush thats not what made my decision and i dont know that 
weve been tougher im the president of the united states and the 
united states has a policy and im supposed to i think go forward 
with our policy 
and one of the big problems we have had is the question between 
ourselves and the israeli government is this question of 
settlements but i dont i wouldnt read my decision here to go 
as follows he made this decision because hes concerned about a 
complicated relationship with israel at this point thats not 
why i made the decision 
but some may read it as that but we are we are staying with 
our concept on the peace process and we are staying and are 
staying with our policy on settlements and this action that i have 
taken today is consistent with our policy on antiterror 
q mr president 
bush yeah 
q do you feel that israel has committed acts of terrorism upon 
palestinians 
bush well we spoke out in the on recent recent violence in 
the gaza and please note my last comment to call for calling for 
peaceful resolution to these questions as opposed to violence and 
international terror and thats the way i would respond on that 
q why youre here in huntsville sir if you are here to help 
raise money for gov guy hunts gubernatorial campaign 
bush im not standing right here to do that but i was downtown 
doing exactly that and i hope we were successful because i am 
totally committed to his reelection i have respected the progress 
the state of alabama has made under his leadership and as i look 
at the way my philosophy of government works the governors are 
very very important on all this 
i cite not just the education summit in which i worked closely 
with guy but this whole concept that the states and localities 
have a significant role to play not just in the money end of it 
but in the whole setting of objectives and goals 
so im glad you raised it and yes im here that part of the 
trip was strongly to support him to support other political 
leaders too 
q mr president are you going to appoint an alabamian on the 
tva board 
bush maam 
q you have goals for your space initiative do you believe 
governor hunt can help you reach some of those by being so strong 
in the tennessee valley 
bush well i think hes a proponent of the space program that i 
have set forth i think hes got great credibility 
with other governors if im not mistaken i think hes hosting 
the national governors down here and thatll give him an 
opportunity to make the case for space or any other initiatives 
for but he is seen by other governors to know what he is talking 
about in this area and clearly to be a strong proponent so i guess 
the bottom line is yes i think governor hunt here can be helpful 
to our objectives of terms of a vibrant space program 
q mr president are you going to nominate or appoint governor 
hunts nominee to the tva board 
bush well i dont know that im going to carry my enthusiasm 
that far but laughter hes made a strong case for a person 
that he believes in and he did it in his typical way typical of 
guy hunt right direct he told me exactly why he favored a certain 
nominee and then seemed to be saying look i recognize that you 
have a lot of factors to weigh in this decision 
but i leave here understanding exactly why he has taken the 
position he has and i leave it and the position has respect and 
im not prepared to discuss further what i might or might not do in 
this tva youre talking about the tva appointment 
q can you say how long its going to take you to make an 
appointment 
bush a matter of days laughter 
reporters thank you 
bush thank you all very much

in the east troops were conducting mopping up operations and 
consolidating their position said the ministry statement 
residents in batticaloa the largest population center in the 
east said the town was tense and deserted and was being heavily 
patrolled by troops 
the residents contacted by telephone said the troops killed a 
tamil woman and her 10yearold child while advancing into the city

number of sinhalese civilians before withdrawing into the jungles 
in the east

eastern provinces after indian peacekeeping troops withdrew from 
sri lanka in march the withdrawal made at the request of sri 
lankan president ranaisnghe premadasa followed an unsuccessful 
32month exercise to disarm the tigers 
premadasas government at that time was holding peace talks with 
the tigers after calling a truce in may 1989 the talks had not 
made much headway when the fighting broke out this week 
before the latest hostilities at least 11000 people had been 
killed since tamil militants began fighting for an independent 
nation in 1983 in 1987 india brokered a peace accord between 
tamil rebels and the government and sent in peacekeeping troops 
sri lankas tamils who make up 18 percent of the countrys 16

americas mayors on wednesday ended their annual 
meeting united in a rhetorical assault on congress and the white 
house but divided somewhat over the best way to lobby for federal 
support 
republican mayors were installed in two of the top three posts 
of the us conference of mayors the new president republican 
robert isaac of colorado springs spoke in a conciliatory tone in 
offering cooperation between the mayors and the white house 
we want to restore the partnership isaac said were not 
going to get anywhere by continually bashing the administration and 
congress 
but several democratic mayors led by conference vice president 
raymond flynn of boston said that unless president bush offers 
significant help to cities soon it was no time for mayors to duck 
a confrontation 
this is a time to rock the boat this is not a time to go 
along to get along flynn said at a news conference after the 
mayors endorsed an array of policy statements calling on the 
federal government to make major new investments in city housing 
education antidrug and other programs 
the mayors also took aim at congress saying that the virtual 
lock incumbents have on their jobs has allowed the lawmakers to 
ignore the plight of urban america 
they dont feel much vulnerablity said kansas city mayor 
richard berkley who was among the mayors who said that city 
leaders need to use their political might to win back the support 
of congress 
the power is in the ballot box said flynn 
the most colorful rhetoric came from altanta mayor maynard 
jackson who chastised congress and the white house for using the 
federal deficit as an excuse to deny aid to cities 
jackson said programs enacted in washington force mayors into 
the trenches to deal with drugs homelessness and other problems 
but that the lack of federal money makes it a lonely fight 
we get no paddles no oars no sails no rudder no nothing 
jackson said were entitled to help from the federal government 
weak leadership will have to be replaced 
isaac is widely respected among the democrats but several this 
week expressed worries that partisan pressure will keep him from 
forcefully pressing the mayors agenda 
isaac assured his colleagues that would not be the case 
admitting he has differences with the bigcity democrats who 
dominate the conference but promising to rally behind the policies 
endorsed by the group 
democratic charleston sc mayor joseph riley a softspoken 
but powerful voice in the conference offered praise for isaac who 
proved deft in addressing democratss concerns without directly 
criticizing the republican bush administration 
you wont see bob isaac being strident or overly partisan in 
attacks on the administration riley said but he will present 
the case strongly in a gentlemanly fashion we have others who can 
be more partisan if necessary 
flynn who aggressively courts his fellow mayors for support 
left little doubt he was happy to supply the partisanship 
i will not sit idly by said flynn who is in line to become 
president of the group next year were not going to sit by idly 
and allow the kind of lip service we receive from the congress and 
readmylips service we receive from the administration to shatter 
our cities

egg producers will vote next month on whether 
to eliminate refunds permanently under a federal research and 
promotion program the agriculture department said wednesday 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said ballots will be mailed by july 16 to all 
producers of record 
all commercial egg producers owning more than 30000 laying hens 
during the period jan 1 through march 31 1990 except those 
producing mostly hatching eggs will be eligible to vote 
in 1988 congress amended the egg research and consumer 
information act to suspend refunds for 18 months beginning jan 1 
1989 pending results of a national referendum 
for the new provision to be adopted approval would have to come 
from at least twothirds of those voting this summer or a majority 
of producers representing at least twothirds of the volume of eggs 
produced by all voters 
if adopted producers will continue to pay mandatory 
nonrefundable assessments of five cents per 30dozen case of 
commercial eggs to the american egg board for research promotion 
and consumer education programs 
exemptions would continue for producers with flocks of 30000 or 
fewer hens and for all alaskan and hawaiian egg producers 
currently the assessments raise about 72 million annually 
the agency said

australia and new zealand on wednesday presented 
new evidence of increasing damage to the earths protective ozone 
layer at an international environmental conference 
scientists from the two countries have discovered a 15 percent 
drop in ozone during the last three years over macquarie island 
800 miles southeast of tasmania 
the conference attended by senior scientists and officials from 
more than 100 nations is considering a ban on ozonedepleting 
chlorofluorocarbons cfcs the conference is preparing the 
groundwork for a june 2729 meeting of environment ministers from 
56 countries 
also wednesday britains stratospheric ozone review group said 
in a separate report that the fragile ozone layer is declining in 
midlatitudes over north america and europe the report said major 
cutbacks in cfcs which are mostly used in refrigerators and 
airconditioners would slow the damage 
stratospheric chlorine is expected to continue to increase at 
levels higher than previously experienced there is a risk that 
these might trigger disproportionately larger ozone losses the 
report said 
the australian results were released to inject a sense of 
urgency back into the proceedings a conference source said 
dr mostafa tolba executive director of the united nations 
environment program appealed for international cooperation on the 
issue 
no country no region no group will ever be capable of 
solving any of these problems alone it is a must that north and 
south east and west cooperate tolba said failure is not an 
option success is imperative 
the meeting is a sequel to the 1987 montreal protocol 
conference which agreed to halve the world consumption of 
chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century 
fiftysix countries have signed the protocol considered a 
watershed in green diplomacy it marked the first time nations 
agreed to protect the global environment against future dangers it 
also committed nations to targets before the technology was 
available to achieve them 
five months after the agreement was reached there was mounting 
scientific evidence of the threat to the ozone layer and most 
signatories said the protocol was inadequate 
if we had known in montreal what we know in london we would 
have then drawn up a much stronger treaty with much faster 
phaseout of cfcs and halons tolba said 
tolba on wednesday proposed completely eliminating cfcs and 
halon by the end of the century adding carbon tetrachloride to the 
list of ozonedepleting chemicals and cutting production and use 
of methyl chloroform by the year 2000 
chlorine gases used mainly in refrigeration systems and 
aerosols damage the ozone layer that protects life from 
ultraviolet rays a 1989 un report confirmed ozone depletion had 
started posing significant threats to food production ocean life 
and human health 
in addition to increasing the risk of skin cancers exposure to 
ultraviolet rays could cause suppression of the human immune system 
and lead to a rise in infectious diseases the report said 
cfcs also are major contributors to global warming 
but eliminating cfcs is costly for developing nations and many 
including populous china and india have not signed the protocol a 
chinese delegate said use of cfcs in his country was growing 12 
percent yearly and would cost 42 million over three years to phase 
out the chemicals 
last week the bush administration announced it was willing to 
contribute 25 million to a fund to assist developing nations to 
eliminate cfcs

nelson mandelas admirers stayed away from work 
skipped school and ducked out at lunch wednesday to greet the 
last of the black heroes with clenched fists and open hearts 
from kennedy airport to city hall hundreds of thousands of 
people of many races lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the 
black south african leader 
just look around its whiteblackwhiteblackwhiteblack 
businessman tom kellerhals said of the crowd that turned out along 
broadway in lower manhattan sometimes the answer is in front of 
us 
mandelas ride through a storm of confetti in broadways 
canyon of heroes was the days emotional apex people who 
waited for hours after mandelas parade was delayed could not 
contain themselves when he finally arrived in the early afternoon 
the greatest freedom fighter ever exulted derrick fuller as 
mandela rolled by in his glassenclosed mandelamobile 
we have him like a lion in a cage chortled one man as 
ticker tape and other debris piled up around his ankles 
fathers hoisted sons on their shoulders to catch a glimpse of 
the passing hero and women thrust forward uncomprehending babies 
as if they were cameras there were cries of mandela and 
keep the pressure on 
a group of elementary school children chanted welcome 
mandela and across the street a group of adults would answer 
no more apartheid 
at city hall where mandela accepted the key to the city city 
employees hung a sign out a thirdfloor window we shall 
conquer 
ive seen people crying and shouting but never anything like 
this said gov mario cuomo it was the single most memorable 
thing ive ever witnessed 
leslie anderson 27 of plainfield nj took the day off to 
see the man she called a legend i was too young to see 
martin luther king and malcolm x hes the last of the great black 
heroes 
we dont live in apartheid but its here its real she 
continued new york is a prime example think of bensonhurst 
where a black youth was slain by a white mob last year 
she wore a tshirt which said free south africa with an 
image of a black man with a noose around his neck pulled by a white 
man on the back her shirt said its a black thing you wouldnt 
understand 
but standing a few feet away was fred marks a white businessman 
who also had come out to see mandela 
i think any man who spent 27 years in jail deserves a look 
marks said referring to ms andersons tshirt he said 
something like this transcends color 
a fatherandson guitar duo sat under a tree nearby playing the 
blues 
me and my father wrote a little something about mandela and 
dinkins meeting about the mandelas in new york said ted 
williams r its happy its nice you can do the chicken dance 
to it 
most of those who skipped work declined to be interviewed for 
the record but one man agreed to appear on television asked what 
he would tell his boss if he was spotted he said im gonna say 
two words nelson mandela 
sean smith a foreign currency options broker saw irony in the 
parades location this is the biggest laughable thing that ever 
happened that wall street supported apartheid and turned around 
and threw a tickertape parade 
not everyone was impressed with the visit a young black man 
named wayne moore squatted at broadway and liberty street shining 
the shoes of a welldressed white man shine em up he yelled 
as he buffed shine em up 
moore had come to this corner he explained because i heard 
mandela was coming down today so thered be a big crowd and id 
make more money 
do i think he could change my situation he said repeating 
a question kinda hard to think that

automakers and insurers traded accusations of 
greed and portrayed themselves as the consumers friend wednesday 
in a debate over copyright protection for product designs 
the auto industry urged congress to approve legislation that 
would prohibit independent manufacturers from copying a parts 
original design for a decade after it first appears on the market 
the bills would protect consumers from shoddy imitation parts 
auto lobbyists told the house subcommittee on courts intellectual 
property and administration of justice 
imitation sheet metal parts are often of lesser quality in 
fit finish and durability said kenneth w myers of ford motor 
co 
he spoke on behalf of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association which represents the big three us automakers 
opponents led by insurers said the legislation was designed to 
squelch competition in the lucrative replacement parts industry 
which generated 52 billion in sales in 1988 the price of parts 
will soar if the bills are passed they said 
american consumers will have to pay hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year in monopoly profits to auto manufacturers and 
they will get nothing in return said ca ingham vice president 
of state farm insurance co 
the subcommittee is considering three bills dealing with 
intellectual property rights but most of the testimony focused on 
a bill cosponsored by house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and minority leader bob michel rill 
it would allow manufacturers to secure copyrights on their 
product designs similar to the protection available to artists and 
writers 
the copyrights would be easier to obtain than design patents 
which are granted only for new original and ormantental design 
after a cumbersome application process that can last years myers 
said 
automakers invest heavily in designing and testing parts each 
part is designed to enhance overall aesthetics and also must 
function properly as part of the whole vehicle myers said 
competing parts manufacturers do not have to make such 
investments he said they just copy the original design and make 
imitation products that often are of poor quality he said

a house republican accused speaker thomas s 
foley on wednesday of kowtowing to ilk like the communist youth 
brigade by refusing to delay until next week thursdays showdown 
vote on a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag burning 
rep gerald solomon rny later apologized for the remark and 
it was stricken from the record but the exchange reflected the 
general bitterness and tension over the issue on the eve of the 
vote both opponents and proponents of the amendment said the 
proposal likely would not muster the necessary twothirds margin 
supporters of the amendment who since last year had been 
pushing foley to allow the vote sought a delay to give veterans 
groups more time to organize a mass mail campaign in the 
amendments favor they also wanted the showdown to come closer to 
the fourth of july 
republicans pressed the white house meanwhile to get president 
bush to do more private oneonone lobbying in behalf of the 
measure which he has repeatedly endorsed publicly 
the supreme court a year ago ruled that flag burning was 
protected by the constitutional guarantee of free speech it 
reaffirmed that decision last week in rejecting a congressional 
attempt to overcome the earlier ruling without resorting to 
changing the constitution 
we fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation 
to a vote on thursday complained walter g hogan national 
commander of the veterans of foreign wars 
foley dwash an outspoken opponent of the amendment said 
this bill has been before the congress for over a year it has 
been debated and discussed as much as any other legislative 
proposal in this congress i dont understand why that is a 
problem 
foley also cited a comment by rep newt gingrich rga the 
house minority whip who said for a republican campaigner the best 
outcome might be to lose by one vote that would keep the flag 
issue alive and more relevant in individual races 
all this talk about being concerned about the flag they are 
concerned apparently about the political issue and the political 
opportunities foley said i dont think the american people 
are going to respond favorably to that 
but solomon in a speech on the house floor said foley and the 
democratic leadership were deliberately gagging 10 million 
veterans through this nation at the same time they were 
kowtowing to ilk like the communist youth brigade to allow them 
to trample and desecrate the american flag 
solomons comments drew heated protests from the democratic side 
of the aisle forcing him to apologize and his words were struck 
from the record 
later in a meeting of the house rules committee solomon and 
other republicans pleaded for the scheduling panel to grant a delay 
but even democrats who support the amendment seemed eager to get 
the vote done 
rep henry hyde rill said the expedited procedure ill 
behooved democrats and he warned republicans could make hay of the 
fact they hustled this bill through 
you dont need that burden he said 
justice delayed is justice denied quipped rep jack brooks 
dtexas chairman of the house judiciary committee 
if all 433 current house members vote thursday 289 will be 
required for passage or conversely 145 needed to block it 
leadership sources said wednesday that democrats were becoming 
more confident they could muster the blocking votes from their 
party and between 12 and 15 republicans might vote against the 
amendment as well 
the senate is also expected to consider the amendment before the 
end of next week but it would be a moot point if the house rejects 
the measure a twothirds vote from both chambers followed by 
approval by 38 states is required for the amendment to become part 
of the constitution 
in addition to the constitutional amendment the house was 
expected to vote thursday on a new statute to ban flag burning 
the statute more narrowly drawn than the one overturned by the 
supreme court last week would set jail terms and fines for 
destroying a flag belonging to the federal government or on federal 
land or to promote violence by destroying any flag 
the bill introduced wednesday by reps jim cooper dtenn 
rick boucher dva and ron wyden dore would attack flag 
burning during the period before an amendment could take effect 
it also fit into foleys strategy on the amendment giving those 
who oppose tinkering with the bill of rights an alternative they 
could support 
gingrich labeled the proposed statute was a liberal fig leaf 
which the american people would quickly see through 
meanwhile senate minority leader bob dole rkan said if the 
house rejected the constitutional amendment he hoped the senate 
would approve it and send it back to the house for a second vote 
to give the house one more chance to come through for old glory

some call it the odd couple 
what are pearl bailey and wynton marsalis going to do 
together wonders george wein who paired the veteran singer and 
young trumpeter for a june 27 concert during the jvc jazz festival 
wein said he was interested in the concerts content and pleased 
at ticket sales as this years festival kicks off on friday 
im interested to see what stan getz does with a whole evening 
of his quartet and sextet wein says hes such a genius weve 
never presented him for a whole evening it should be very 
interesting 
getzs june 29 concert is titled 50 years in music but wein 
expects getz instead of starting with early colleagues to play in 
the first half with his usual quartet and augment it with a few 
veterans in the second half 
miles davis and the group hiroshima will pack lincoln centers 
avery fisher hall in two concerts on opening night and ella 
fitzgerald is expected to sell out her june 29th performance even 
though she gave a concert a few months ago at radio city music hall 
we always sell a lot of tickets the last week wein said 
everything seems to be going along very well were selling at 
the same speed as last year which was a relatively good year 
its interesting that the two shows were doing at town hall 
bassist milt hinton celebrating his 80th birthday june 23 and a 
salute to guitarist jim hall june 26 seem to be doing better than 
any town hall shows weve ever done 
most of the concerts are at carnegie hall and avery fisher hall 
where we have trouble is whenever we try something different 
like minimalist composer steve reich is a problem wein says 
reich and the world saxophone quartet share a june 23 bill 
the things that sell sell wein says the things that 
dont dont 
pianist oscar peterson canceled his june 28 evening the 
doctor told him he was exhausted and should take six weeks off 
wein says 
sarah vaughan had been booked for the festival when she died 
this spring there wont be a tribute to the singer this year wein 
said well do something next year i dont like to do those 
tributes so fast i like to plan and do them so theyre historic 
evenings

former communist ion iliescu pledged 
wednesday to be a democratic president of reconciliation but the 
united states boycotted his inauguration to protest his role in 
violent attacks on opposition figures 
the capital was generally quiet following a tumultuous week of 
antigovernment riots mob rule by loyalist miners and a crackdown 
on dissent 
this is the happiest day of my life iliescu told reporters 
before swearing faithfulness to the romanian people and to their 
ideals of freedom and prosperity 
he pledged to defend democracy and fundamental human 
rights and freedoms 
i shall firmly militate for the safeguarding of civic 
liberties on our way to a genuinely free and democratic 
society iliescu said pledging to be a president of 
reconciliation 
proiliescu supporters cheered him when he emerged from the 
downtown findesiecle atheneum music hall after his inauguration 
iliescus inauguration came one week to the day after riot 
police brutally dispersed a 53day rally of his opponents demanding 
that he and other former communists be banned from politics for 10 
years 
rioters subsequently assaulted and firebombed government 
buildings and thousands of clubwielding miners from transylvania 
descended on the capital in response to an appeal by iliescu 
attacking opposition politicians and anyone deemed a government 
critic 
numerous countries and international human rights groups 
condemned the violence and its links to the national salvation 
frontdominated government some governments have suspended 
nonhumanitarian aid 
petre roman who was formally appointed prime minister by 
iliescu after serving as interim premier since december tried to 
ease foreign concerns 
he told state radio we want to prove to the international 
community that our way to a true democracy is irreversible 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
human rights violations in romania are continuing he said romania 
has arrested 45 opposition figures in the past two days and said 
the administration believes the purpose is to intimidate romanians 
from exercising their rights 
ambassadors from canada and countries of the 12nation european 
economic community attended the inaugural ceremony but echoed us 
criticism 
iliescu expressed disappointment with the us stance 
we want to think it is an isolated incident and that the 
conclusions will be accordingly corrected following a lucid 
judgment on the events he said in a statement to the state 
rompres news agency 
ion ratiu the national peasants partys presidential candidate 
who finished a distant third to iliescu applauded the us boycott 
and called it the most eloquent way the us could show its 
condemnation of the vigilante tactics that mr iliescu generated 
last week 
commenting at length on last weeks violence iliescu publicly 
distanced himself for the first time from the miners subsequently 
vigilante tactics 
there was overreaction in the public order restoration 
process he said institutions opposition party headquarters 
and homes were broken into and citizens unconnected with the 
earlier violence were roughed up 
we unequivocally dissociate ourselves from all actions that 
transcended the legal framework iliescu declared 
however he also asserted that the antigovernment violence that 
brought the miners was an organized coup detat 
he described the events as a true rebellion aimed at 
discrediting the countrys lawfully and democratically elected 
leadership at home and abroad 
the 60yearold iliescu a highranking communist in the late 
1960s pledged to transform his formerly communist nation into a 
full political democracy with a market economy incorporating mixed 
forms of ownership 
he vowed to remove disgraced corrupt and incompetent 
persons in an apparent bow to an opposition concern that people 
compromised by serving deposed communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
continue in responsible positions 
some critics have included in that category iliescu and other 
former communists in the national salvational front who were 
criticial of ceausescu despite their renunciation of communism and 
clear victory in free elections may 20 
the government has appeared divided on the best course of action 
to quell further unrest 
officials were talking to opposition groups while detaining 
their leaders and authorizing police action to stop renewed protest 
bucharest was free of demonstrations during the day wednesday 
but about 80 protesters gathered as dusk fell at university square 
the chanted down with iliescu and knelt briefly in prayer

president mikhail s gorbachev came under fire 
from hardline communists on wednesday and acknowledged that he 
could lose his party post at a national congress in less than two 
weeks 
critics at a party meeting castigated the national leadership 
they did not mention gorbachev by name but said they did not think 
one person should be soviet president and general secretary of the 
communist party gorbachev holds both jobs 
it is impossible to run the party this guiding force without 
devoting full time to it said yegor ligachev the most prominent 
soviet hardliner he spoke at a meeting called to found a new 
communist party of the russian federation the largest of the 15 
soviet republics 
another communist leader said he expected gorbachev to be 
nominated for the national partys top job at a party congress 
starting july 2 but he said he expects other candidates to surface 
as well 
in recent months gorbachev has transferred some of the 
communist partys powers to elected legislative bodies thereby 
protecting himself somewhat from personal political damage that 
could result if he lost the party leadership 
moreover he was elected in march to a fiveyear term in the new 
post of president and has wielded considerable power in that job 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party is to consider 
structural changes and elect a leader when it convenes july 2 
the 2700 delegates to the current russian conference will also 
attend the national congress where they will form a majority of 
the 4700 votes 
the mood of the russian congress was decidedly conservative and 
critical of gorbachev 
really important miscalculations and serious mistakes were 
made in the tactics and methods and approaches to the 
transformations under way in the soviet union said ligachev 
the socialist community has disintegrated while the positions 
of imperialism have been dramatically consolidated said 
ligachev his remarks were reported by the state news agency tass 
gorbachev has acknowledged making mistakes but he said in a 
speech to delegates wednesday that his accusers were poorly 
informed and disrespectful 
the comrades seem to suspect the general secretary of the 
communist party of some vacillation hesitation and so forth 
gorbachev said angrily 
some of the comrades are being too casual with the general 
secretary with the president of the country he said 
it is not a question of me personally he said tomorrow 
or after 10 days or 12 days there may be another general secretary 
or chairman of the party before expressing opinions and 
especially accusations you have to know a whole lot and understand 
it and not just speak off the cuff 
otherwise if that is going to be the attitude toward the 
people that we nominate at such turning points in history then we 
will not get anywhere except to chaos he said 
one leading conservative ivan polozkov said the falling 
credibility of the party stemmed not only from mistakes made 
during the period of stagnation before gorbachev came to power in 
1985 
there have also been mistakes made in the period of 
perestroika he said using the russian word for gorbachevs 
reforms he singled out for criticism alexander yakovlev a close 
gorbachev ally on the partys politburo 
the crisis is not just in the communist party but above all 
in its leading bodies said polozkov 
foreign reporters were not allowed to attend wednesdays 
session but portions of it were shown on closedcircuit television 
at the foreign ministry press center 
the party chief for the city of moscow yuri prokofiev told 
reporters that gorbachev likely would be one of several candidates 
for the job once again of national party leader he said he hoped 
that gorbachevs comments did not mean he would refuse to run for 
the post 
in another indication of the conservative mood of the congress 
the delegates overwhelmingly condemned a proposal before the 
russian parliament to liquidate party cells in the armed forces 
the kgb security police and the regular police force 
nikolai boiko head of the political department of soviet 
antiaircraft forces warned that such a step would weaken its 
defense potential 
by a 2008to398 vote the congress passed a resolution calling 
the proposed liquidation of party cells in security organs a step 
toward the further disintegration of the party 
such a step would lead to a sharp fall in the influence of the 
party would create an anticommunist attitude and would heighten 
the political destabilization of the country it said 
later wednesday the russian parliament rejected a proposal to 
ban party membership for judges prosecutors and officials of law 
enforcement agencies tass reported deputies also rejected a call 
to eliminate party cells in the soviet army

convicted drug dealer charles lewis testified 
at marion barrys drug and perjury trial wednesday that he and the 
mayor agreed to get our stories straight and hide their crack 
cocaine use when police began closing in on them 
lewis said barry also told him to drink lemon juice and lots 
of water to obscure results of a possible drug test by police 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy swiftly sought to undermine 
lewis effect on the jury he displayed a notebook belonging to 
lewis and said it showed the witness was a courier for a washington 
cocaine ring 
then under mundys cross examination lewis conceded he didnt 
begin to cooperate with prosecutors until after he was convicted of 
drug charges in the virgin islands where he is awaiting sentencing 
a key prosecution witness lewis has testified he and the mayor 
used cocaine frequently between 1986 and 1988 in the virgin islands 
and the nations capital 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor charge of cocaine conspiracy 
and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use 
the threeterm mayor could face up to 26 years in prison and 
fines of 185 million if convicted on all counts at the trial 
which is expected to last several weeks 
beginning his second day of testimony lewis said he and barry 
used crack cocaine three times together in december 1988 at lewis 
washington hotel room 
he said he spoke with barry by telephone dec 22 1988 after 
learning that police were investigating lewis actions about how 
to conceal their drug use 
it was like fixing a dam said lewis he said he and 
barry agreed we have a problem we need to fix it we need to 
get our stories straight 
lewis destroyed a crack pipe barry had given him and flushed the 
remains down the hotel room toilet he said 
lewis said that the next night barry asked him on the telephone 
to lie to authorities about their drug activity 
he wanted me to tell the police the same thing i had told the 
post reporter said lewis who earlier testified that he told a 
washington post reporter he and barry had never done drugs 
barry also coached him on how to obscure evidence of cocaine use 
if police gave him a drug test he told me just use lemon juice 
and lots of water lewis told the court adding i used a 
considerable amount of lemon juice 
barry leaned back in his chair at the defense table and smiled 
broadly at the remark 
saying he had lied to police and a federal grand jury when he 
denied using drugs lewis said it was my effort to protect 
myself and the mayor 
in the days after barrys visits to lewis became public the 
mayor denied in several statements to the press that he had used 
drugs with lewis or at any other time 
mundy took aim at lewis motives in crossexamination 
you didnt start looking around to make deals until you were 
convicted did you mundy asked you started cooperating with 
the government because you wanted to help yourself didnt you 
yes lewis replied 
and mundy said lewis notebook showed he was involved in a 
cocaine ring with james mcwilliams another potential government 
witness 
lewis insisted he had not been coached by prosecutors and was 
not testifying to convict the mayor 
lewis growing defensive said he wasnt getting a free ride 
from the government 
this agreement that was approved it wasnt something like a 
present complained lewis who served a sevenmonth prison 
sentence outside washington on federal drug charges 
police began investigating after lewis is alleged to have 
offered cocaine to a maid at the washington hotel 
lewis said he learned from a reporter that city police had 
aborted a planned undercover drug buy from him the afternoon of 
dec 22 1988 after they learned barry was in the hotel room 
lewis testified that he and the mayor spoke in code about 
sticking to the same story because lewis feared his telephone was 
bugged 
he said he told the mayor that he had told a washington post 
reporter there were no drugs in the room he barry said no 
thats right 
lewis then asserted he did not use drugs no none lewis 
said barry replied 
lewis said he then added you dont use drugs either and he 
barry said no right i dont

a bill that could send doctors who 
perform abortions to jail for 10 years was sent to the louisiana 
senate without recommendation wednesday after a committee 
deadlocked on the measure 
if passed the measure would be the toughest state abortion law 
in the nation 
with only six members of the sevenmember health and welfare 
committee present wednesday motions aimed at approving or killing 
the bill failed on 33 ties 
the full senate later voted 354 to consider the bill in debate 
the debate and a vote on final passage could come as early as 
next week 
the bill has no exceptions for women who become pregnant as a 
result of rape or incest gov buddy roemer has said he will veto 
the bill without those exceptions 
the bills author state rep woody jenkins said such 
exceptions would jeopardize plans to use the bill to attempt to 
overturn roe vs wade the 1973 supreme court decision establishing 
womens abortion rights 
jenkins said louisiana abortion law has never recognized rape or 
incest as legal reasons for abortion its possible that the 
court might really recognize this as an inconsistent position he 
told the committee 
much of the testimony at the committee hearing was a rehash of 
arguments made in more than eight hours of previous hearings 
a woman who said she once operated an abortion clinic in texas 
urged passage of jenkins bill 
abortion is not about rights abortion is not about choices 
abortion is not about rape or incest abortion is about money 
said carol everette who said she could have been a millionaire had 
she stayed on with the clinic 
dr diana dell a baton rouge physician said making abortions 
illegal would only drive women to seek unsafe illegal abortions 
she said death rates from tonsillectomies and apendectomies far 
exceed deaths from legal abortions 
dell said she abhorred the use of abortion as simple birth 
control but she said the health and welfare of a woman with an 
unwanted pregnancy must take precedence over that of a fetus 
the fetus is the future it does not have equal rights to the 
here and now dell said

the fire aboard the uss midway the navys 
oldest active aircraft carrier raises haunting questions for the 
service about its safety record and the wisdom of keeping aging 
warships at sea defense analysts said wednesday 
the 45yearold ship extensively overhauled during its career 
including a threeyear renovation from 1967 to 1970 is scheduled 
to be retired next year 
defense secretary dick cheney announced during his visit to 
japan in february that the midway whose home port is yokosuka 
would be replaced by the 31yearold uss independence like the 
midway an oilburning carrier 
the incident on the midway the last of three nearly identical 
sister ships still on active duty could hurry that schedule along 
navy sources and independent defense analysts said 
there may be an adjustment to the timetable but theyll have 
to assess the damage first said a senior navy officer who spoke 
on condition he not be mentioned by name 
joshua handler a research associate with the environmental 
advocacy group greenpeace and a critic of the navys nuclear 
weapons policies said fires aboard carriers are a particular 
concern given chances nuclear weapons are most probably aboard 
theyve had trouble with the midway for so long this may be 
the straw that breaks the camels back he said its time is 
well up and im sorry that this sort of thing had to happen to 
make the point 
after the 1970 overhaul it was discovered that so much weight 
had been added in hightech equipment that the 67000ton vessel 
rode dangerously low in the water 
sixhundredfootlong compartments were added to each side to 
increase buoyancy and and let the ship ride higher in the water 
this modifcation made the ships natural roll quicker making it 
harder to operate aircraft 
the stability of a ship is crucial when the ships f14 jet 
fighters or a6e attack planes slam onto its deck traveling at more 
than 100 mph 
navy spokesman cmdr jim mitchell said the midway fire 
apparently was confined to a rather small area in compartments 
that store firefighting and emergency repair equipment 
all sailors on board ship are trained to fight fires at special 
schools in norfolk va and san diego calif to help deal with 
such emergencies he said 
we train our people in damage control its not because we 
expect problems but these things do happen given the hazardous 
nature of a ships operations at sea you cant call for the fire 
department every sailor is the fire department he said 
the navys safety record has come under intense scrutiny in the 
wake of last years explosion aboard the uss iowa in which 47 
sailors lost their lives 
following a sixweek string of mishaps last fall the navy 
ordered all ships and planes to undergo a 48hour standdown to 
review safety procedures 
the service maintains that its safety record has improved over 
the past decade with its best safety records compiled in 1988 and 
1989 
five years ago there were 101 major accidents involving surface 
ships aircraft and submarines in 1989 there were 69 and in 1990 
so far there have been 23 the navy said 
in calender 1989 the service recorded 104 deaths in training 
and operations a number which includes the iowa 47 so far this 
year nine fatalities have occurred the navy said 
during the reagan administration the navy once had plans for a 
600ship navy and it did grow to 585 it has 15 carrier battle 
groups fourteen groups are deployed at any one time with one 
carrier always in overhaul 
now a much smaller navy is in store amid the lessening soviet 
threat and budget pressures one day before the midway fire broke 
out cheney revealed that a possible 25 percent cut in the nations 
force structure would reduce the navy to 455 warships and an even 
dozen deployed carrier groups 
some on capitol hill have pressed for even deeper cuts in the 
carrier fleet 
the influential chairman of the senate armed services committee 
sen sam nunn dga has recommended as few as 10 
you hurt people by keeping men on these things contended 
david isenberg an analyst with the center for defense information 
who wrote a critical study of carrier battle groups for the 
independent research group the cato institute which generally 
advocates conservative positions 
isenberg argues that building new carriers at 33 billion each 
plus associated costs for planes and escorts is not the most 
efficient use of the navys funds in the postcold war era 
carriers have rendered enormous service to the nation and 
still have a role to perform he said but he argues that the 
navy should make more use of attack submarines in order to 
achieve a mix of capabilities in which less emphasis is place on 
power projection and more on sea control

the number of passengers taking domestic us 
flights has leveled off over the last three years after years of 
increasing travel an industry report said wednesday 
the report however predicted huge growth in air travel by the 
end of the century 
passengers flying within the united states increased only 1 
percent in 1989 while the number of passengers boarding 
international flights from us airports rose 11 percent the 
airport operators council international said 
our traffic results for 1989 might indicate a slight weakening 
in the growth rate of aviation for the year but we foresee a 61 
percent increase in passenger traffic by 2000 said george 
howard aoci president 
an accompanying report by the partnership for improved air 
travel said aviations contribution to the economy hit nearly 600 
billion in 1989 a 138 percent increase over the last study which 
covered 1987 the most dramatic growth was in commercial aircraft 
manufacturing where jobs payrolls and other economic factors rose 
22 percent 
aviations share of the gross national product remained at 56 
percent said the partnership a wideranging group set up to 
ensure that us aviation meets future demands 
reports by the two aviation organizations were released at a 
joint news conference 
howard blamed slow overall economic growth higher fares and the 
eastern airlines strike for the stalled growth in domestic 
passengers he said tight capacity at larger airports also may be 
hindering growth in traffic 
the aocis annual traffic report on each of the worlds major 
airports showed three of the highestdensity airports new yorks 
kennedy and laguardia and washingtons national actually lost 
traffic in 1989 
chicagos ohare had just a 06 percent increase but remained 
the worlds busiest airport with more than 59 million passengers 
boarding flights last year the report said 
dallasfort worth surpassed los angeles and atlanta for second 
place atlantas hartsfield airport fell to fourth primarily 
because of the strike against eastern which uses atlanta as a hub 
howard said 
the aoci report showed new york with three major airports 
continued to be the worlds most heavily traveled market followed 
by chicago and london 
altogether six of the top 10 american airports lost traffic in 
1989 while airports around the pacific rim reported a 138 percent 
increase and european airports a 7 percent increase according to 
the report 
federal aviation administration figures compiled by aoci show 
4156 million passengers for domestic flights in 1989 and 4155 
million in 1987 the figure dipped to 4142 million in 1988 
there is evidence of a shift in the growth of traffic to 
smaller airports where capacity while still a large concern is 
still somewhat more available howard said 
aviation experts indicated they were surprised the growth was so 
flat but said the number of passengers was still sharply up from 
the 1983 total of 2907 million 
and howard said the aoci predicts 76 percent of us air 
travelers will face delays if the capacity of the nations system 
of airports is not increased the aoci which represents airports 
throughout the world supports a bush administration proposal to 
allow airports to charge a passenger tax to help build up the 
system 
the partnership for improved air travel has taken no position on 
the passenger tax but opposes the administrations proposed 
increases in other aviation taxes 
the partnership includes airlines travel and tourism interests 
unions consumer groups and business organizations it proposes 
spending more of the billions of dollars in the taxfed aviation 
trust fund to help aviation

a senior plo official on wednesday called 
president bushs suspension of the usplo dialogue a blow to 
the peace process and predicted increased violence in the 
israelioccupied territories 
but in jerusalem an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
praised the decision saying it removed a major obstacle to 
peace 
jamil hilal director of the plos information department said 
the us move would encourage israels new hardline government to 
escalate its repression against the arab population under 
occupation 
in tunis salah khalaf regarded as the plos secondincommand 
was quoted by the french news agency afp as saying bushs move 
would freeze peace efforts and reinforce extremist forces in 
the middle east 
in new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
he hopes that ways will soon be found of resuming a dialogue that 
can serve the great purpose of achieving peace in the middle east 
hilal said in a telephone interview from tunis that the 
suspension of the dialogue can be judged only as an unfriendly 
and colonial move its a blow to the peace process and a 
provocation to arabs states 
hilal said he expects the palestine liberation organization in 
retaliation for the suspension of talks to call on arab nations 
to apply economic sanctions against the united states i expect 
the uprising in the occupied territories to escalate 
plo chairman yasser arafats chief advisor bassam abu sharif 
said in another phone interview from tunis that the plo 
leadership has received the news transmitted through the media the 
leadership is studying carefully the text of his bushs 
statement 
he refused further comment 
avi pazner a top aide to shamir praised bushs decision to end 
the dialogue 
its an important and positive decision as far as the peace 
process in the area is concerned he said the plo was a major 
obstacle to peace and now that obstacle is removed 
in the occupied west bank jamil tarifi a proplo palestinian 
leader who has been named as a possible peace negotiator condemned 
the us move 
we are very sorry for this position because the us as a 
superpower put itself under the pressure of the rightist israeli 
government instead of pressuring the israelis to move forward for 
peace tarifi said 
anyone who wants to talk to the palestinians must talk with 
the plo he added 
bush suspended the 18monthold dialogue wednesday saying the 
plo had failed to forcefully condemn an unsuccessful may 30 
terrorist attack against israel 
bush had urged arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline 
the plo faction that sent two speedboats filled with fighters 
toward a tel aviv beach 
khalaf said the united states knows we have given all we can 
in this affair he added that the united states and the plo do 
not share the same interpretation of terrorism agence 
francepresse reported 
the boats were intercepted by israel and four guerrillas killed 
and 12 captured 
the dialogue began after arafat renounced terrorism and accepted 
israels right to exist 
in stockholm swedish foreign minister sten andersson said he 
regretted bushs decision 
andersson was instrumental in persuading the plo to renounce 
terror and start its dialogue with the united states 
andersson said he was in contact with secretary of state james 
a baker iii earlier wednesday and that baker had urged sweden to 
continue its efforts to bridge the differences between the 
parties in the middle east conflict

the food and drug administration on wednesday 
approved a new combination drug treatment that has been shown to 
prolong survival for patients with advanced stages of colon cancer 
the therapy combines levamisole a drug previously approved only 
for eliminating intestinal parasites in animals with fluorouracil 
already approved for treatment of several types of cancer 
fda officials said the combination of the two drugs in patients 
who have undergone surgery for colon cancer that has spread to 
nearby lymph nodes has been shown to reduce tumor reccurence and 
death in some patients 
michael friedman associate director of the cancer therapy 
evaluation program of the national cancer institute said the 
combination drug therapy is an important advance but he 
added studies on it must continue to improve treatment and 
determine whether it is effective for other stages of the disease 
colon cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is classified as 
stage 3 also referred to as stage dukes c about 21000 of the 
110000 americans diagnosed with colon cancer each year are in this 
stage about 40 percent live for five years or more after surgery 
the fda said 
the combination therapy was tested in two clinical trials 
sponsored by the national cancer institute that involved about 
1700 patients who had undergone surgery for stage 3 colon cancer 
researchers found that the treatment reduced the death rate for 
these patients by about onethird and the tumorrecurrence rate by 
about 40 percent 
they dont know however how the fiveyear survival rate will 
be affected since they have not followed these test patients that 
long yet said fda spokeswoman eva kemper 
more than 4000 patients with stage 3 colon cancer have received 
the combination therapy since may 1989 when it was approved under 
the fdas treatment ind investigative new drug program that makes 
promising experimental drugs available to patients with no other 
hope the agency said 
the most common side effects of the treatment are nausea 
occasional vomiting headache diarrhea sores in the mouth and 
depressed blood count the fda said also a blood disorder called 
agranulocytosis caused one death among patients in the cancer 
institute trials 
the therapy which lasts one year consists of levamisole 
tablets given orally for three consecutive days every other week 
and fluorouracil given intravenously once a week

the government of el salvador and 
leftist guerrillas fighting that nations leadership on wednesday 
discussed reforms in the armed forces during the second day of 
unmediated peace talks 
there is a good propect of reaching concrete accords at the 
end of this round of negotiations un mediator alvaro de soto 
said i feel quite encouraged because the discussions are frank 
and constructive 
rebel leader roberto canas said the armed forces were a key 
point in conversations wednesday between the farabundo marti 
national liberation front and el salvadors rightist government 
led by president alfredo cristiani 
the rebels want sharp reductions in el salvadors 55000man 
military they also want the armys ranks purged of soldiers linked 
to rightwing death squads and punishment of those responsible for 
political slayings 
most of the 73000 people killed in el salvadors decadeold 
civil war have been civilians though thousands of those are 
believed to be victims of rightist death squads 
the rebels have said they wont discuss putting aside their 
weapons until the question of the armed forces is resolved the 
government would prefer to focus on a ceasefire 
a rebel leader shafik handal said that despite the 
differences both sides were working with respect and the 
disposition to reach a substantive accord 
salvador samayoa a member of the rebel delegation said its 
important that for the first time the government has agreed to 
discuss the armed forces 
david escobar a member of the government negotiating team said 
six issues were on the agenda the armed forces human rights 
economic problems and reforms in the judicial and electoral 
systems and in the constititution

down the prospects of a major agreement 
we dont expect to sign spectacular accords he said

the caracas accords 
the talks expected to last at least a week are the second

moscows chief negotiator in arms control talks 
with the united states said wednesday the soviet union will press 
for britain and france to follow the superpowers in cutting their 
nuclear arms arsenals 
the question of involving other nuclear states in the 
bilateral process of nuclear arms reductions acquires ever greater 
urgency yuri nazarkin said in a prepared statement 
he noted the soviet union in 1986 agreed not to include the 
french and british nuclear forces in talks then launched with the 
united states 
however nazarkin said it appears obvious that nuclear 
arms reductions cannot proceed endlessly on a bilateral basis 
only 
nazarkin was speaking at a colloquium organized in preparation 
for an international conference next august to review 
implementation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
the treaty signed in 1968 is designed to halt the spread of 
atomic weapons there are 141 countries that are parties to the

the records will be analyzed to determine the health effects of 
lowlevel exposure to radiation said daniel berger attorney for 
the three mile island public health fund the organization 
represents people who live near the nuclear power plant that was 
the site of nations worst commercial nuclear accident 
lawyers for the us energy department agreed a month ago to 
turn over the information but berger said some paperwork remains 
to be worked out 
there has never been access to this data other than by 
researchers in the department of energy berger said its been 
tightly controlled 
the data which is on computer tapes will be analyzed by 
researchers at birmingham university in england alice stewart who 
heads the the research team took part in a project more than a 
decade ago that found a startlingly high incidence of cancer among 
workers at the hanford nuclear reservation in washington state 
if the preliminary findings at hanford are borne out it seems 
to me the occupational safety standards will have to be heightened 
at nuclear facilities said berger 
the first records are expected for 50000 hanford workers the 
government has also agreed to turn over records for 90000 workers 
at four more plants the savannah river site in south carolina the 
linde plant in tonawanda ny and the x10 and y12 plants at the 
oak ridge reservation in tennessee 
the records include details about the sex and race of the 
workers and their age when they were exposed to radiation the 
doses they received and their job titles and occupational 
histories 
if the workers have died the records also list the cause and 
date of death to protect the workers privacy their names are to 
be withheld 
as soon as possible the government has promised to turn over 
similar records for 60000 workers from these plants rocky flats 
colo los alamos national laboratory nm mound laboratory 
miamisburg ohio and the pantex facility amarillo texas 
by may 18 1991 the energy department has pledged to turn over 
records for 20000 workers at the k25 plant at oak ridge the 
mallinckrodt chemical works in st louis and the feed material 
production center in fernald ohio 
stewart the birmingham researcher told the philadelphia 
inquirer she expects the new data to show three to five times as 
many cancer cases as most experts expect to find among people who 
have been exposed to lowlevel radiation 
the hanford study she worked on in the late 1970s found 
unusually high rates of pancreatic lung and bonemarrow cancer 
among workers even those exposed to radiation levels 30 times 
lower than the government safety minimum 
the government discontinued funding for the study and turned 
aside legal efforts to give the data to the researchers or others 
on grounds it was protecting the workers privacy 
the tmi public health fund pursued the data as a source of 
information about longterm exposure to lowlevel radiation berger 
said the energy department agreed last year to release the records 
the fund will be first to get the records but they also will be 
available to other researchers with the capacity to use the 
computer tapes said jeff sherwood an energy department spokesman 
the fund was set up in 1981 as part of a settlement of a lawsuit 
brought by people living within 25 miles of the three mile island 
nuclear power plant against the plant and its owners operators and 
insurers

president francois mitterrand told 
african leaders wednesday they must move toward democracy then 
announced new steps to ease the continents debt burdens 
democracy is a universal principle its the direction that 
must be taken mitterrand said in his opening address to a summit 
attended by 35 african delegations many from oneparty states 
have confidence in freedom mitterrand said he promised 
french support for countries that took the road to democracy 
about 200 protesters calling for reforms in african nations 
marched as the summit formally opened 
mamadou diouck spokesman for the panafrican forum for 
democracy said it was necessary to cleanse the political morals 
of africa to permit true development 
king hassan ii of morocco urged the west to help africas 
young democracies make a peaceful transition from oneparty to 
multiparty systems 
the countries of africa have no need to be ashamed but they 
have to learn the king said time is needed and patience even 
more so 
mitterrand said france would give outright grants rather than 
loans to the poorest african nations and would limit the annual 
interest charged on loans to middleincome countries to 5 percent 
the opening speeches followed private talks late tuesday in 
which mitterrand according to one of his aides advised the 
african leaders to move away from oneparty political systems 
president abdou diouf of senegal speaking to a handful of 
reporters said he favored rewarding nations that move toward 
pluralism i think it is necessary to encourage us a bit give us 
a little push 
but diouf warned a democracy without development has no sense 
and in the end is dangerous 
he said he would like to see an african common market or 
political federation because as small states we cannot advance 
we need to be a big grouping 
after 30 years of independence for many african nations the 
illusions have disappeared diouf said it is perhaps easier 
now to unite our weaknesses to become an economic and political 
force 
of the delegations at the summit in the brittany beach resort 
22 are led by heads of state some facing unprecedented political 
opposition at home 
in his speech mitterrand said he intends to ask the heads of 
state and government at the sevennation economic summit in houston 
next month to join france in helping african countries alleviate 
their heavy debt loads 
he has depicted france as africas most generous supporter and 
said the problems of developing countries would be eased 
dramatically if japan and the united states gave equal support 
french officials said the decision to limit the interest rate 
paid by certain middleincome african countries on their public 
debt with france means loan payments will be about halved 
the measure chiefly applies to gabon the ivory coast congo and 
cameroon which collectively owe france more than 10 billion 
calude arnaud an aide to mitterrand said president hissene 
habre of chad complained during the talks late tuesday that western 
lending institutions were making democracy more difficult by 
imposing economic austerity measures 
the summit is to conclude thursday

a bill repealing many of the industrys 
exemptions from antitrust laws was approved wednesday by the house 
judiciary committee over unanimous republican opposition 
on a 1917 vote the panel voted to open insurance companies to 
antitrust lawsuits for pricefixing attempted monopolizing 
allocating territories among rival companies or forcing consumers 
to buy insurance they do not want in order to qualify for coverage 
that they do 
three of the committees 22 democrats reps dan glickman of 
kansas bruce morrison of connecticut and edward feighan of ohio 
voted with all of the 14 republicans in opposing the bill 
insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from 
antitrust suits since 1945 under the mccarranfeguson act which 
delegated regulation of the now 500 billionayear industry to 
state governments 
consumer groups and others have complained since the mid1970s 
that lax oversight by some states has permitted the companies to 
use anticompetitive practices to both deny coverage and raise rates 
dramatically 
private individuals local governments and businesses of all 
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage 
severely restricted said rep jack brooks dtexas the 
judiciary committees chairman congress can no longer ignore the 
widespread economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high 
premiums or policies that are unavailable at any price 
the federal antitrust prohibitions would not apply in states 
with active regulatory programs thus preserving the 
mccarranfergusons basic policy to defer regulation to states he 
said he did not say which states would qualify 
the bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw 
data on claims but after a fiveyear transition period it would 
greatly weaken companies reliance upon the insurance services 
office a new yorkbased industry organization that now advises 
what rates should be charged 
a similar bill was approved by the panels economic and 
commerical law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an 
intensive industry lobbying effort democrats said they hope to 
bring the new version to the full house in late summer or early 
fall 
although similar legislation has been introduced in the senate 
industry lobbyists say they are counting on sens dennis deconcini 
dariz and howell heflin dala both members of the senate 
judiciary committee to prevent it from every reaching a floor vote 
there 
if this bill is enacted into law it may prove disastrous for 
consumers adn small insurance companies alike said lowell beck 
president of the national association of independent insurors 
every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust 
counts legal costs which by necessity would be passed on to 
consumers would soar 
consumer groups acknowledged they face an uphill fight but 
voiced optimism that the committees vote wednesday opening the way 
for a fight on the house floor will put a public spotlight on the 
issue 
this represents an important breakthrough said robert 
brandon vice president of citizen action a grassroots consumer 
organization claiming 2 million members it demonstrates that an 
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industrys 
stranglehold over legislators 
linda lipsen legislative counsel for consumers union predicted 
the bill will become a major electionyear issue once it reaches 
the house floor 
behind food and shelter insurance is the single largest 
expenditure of the year for the average consumer she said 
just like the gun lobby the insurance lobby is no longer being 
perceived by congress as invincible 
lipsen disputed industry claims that premiums would rise citing 
a report by the general accounting office showing that rates fell 
by 30 percent in michigan after its legislature in 1982 repealed a 
state antitrust exemption for workers compensation insurance 
in addition to consumer groups the bill has strong support from 
the american bankers association and other bank trade groups whose 
members are eager to jump into the insurance business through 
subsidiaries

federal prosecutors agreed wednesday to release up 
to 6 million from manuel noriegas european bank accounts saying 
they wanted to move quickly with the drug trafficking case against 
the former panamanian leader 
meanwhile panamas new government told the court it will file a 
53 billion lawsuit against noriega accusing him of racketeering 
including murder theft and fraud against the panamanian people 
us district judge william hoeveler took note of the civil 
lawsuit to be filed in the next two weeks but said he wouldnt 
allow it to interfere with the criminal proceeding against noriega 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan said the agreement to 
unfreeze 45 million to 6 million in assets solves a legal battle 
that began april 29 when defense attorneys threatened to withdraw 
from the case they said the governments seizure of 20 million of 
noriegas assets deprived them of fees and expenses 
sullivan warned that judges both in the united states and europe 
would have to approve the releases we have agreed to make our 
best effort to unfreeze accounts that are currently frozen in 
europe he said 
lead defense attorney frank rubino said his team of five 
attorneys was satisfied with the agreement we feel we now will 
have the ability to go forward and give gen noreiga the defense he 
deserves 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said the deal will allow 
prosecutors to focus on the true issues in the criminal case 
this avoids distracting litigation and premature presentation 
of evidence that would only sidetrack us from the real issues 
lehtinen said in a statement released from his office 
rubino had vowed to fight a protracted legal battle to release 
and make public payments made by the cia and other intelligence 
agencies to the former panamanian leader the defense has said the 
payments added up to 11 million but the government claimed the 
amount was much lower 
hoeveler who had warned prosecutors the government would have 
to justify its seizures unless it released funds for noriegas 
defense said he approved the deal he added that it would allow 
the case to progress more quickly toward a planned jan 28 trial 
date 
noriega who surrendered to us troops jan 4 is being held in 
the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami on a february 
1988 indictment accusing him of taking 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a way station 
for cocaine trafficking 
after hoevelers ruling gregory craig an attorney from the 
washington law firm williams and connolly addressed the court 
saying he represented the new government of panama installed after 
the us invasion last december 
craig said the panamanian government within two weeks would file 
federal and florida racketeering lawsuits claiming 300 million in 
actual damages as well as 5 billion in punitive damages against 
the panamanian people 
outside the courtroom craig said the lawsuit would include 
allegations of murder grand theft extortion as well as breach 
of trust and other civil violations by noriega 
craig said the lawsuit was being filed so that no irreparable 
damage be done to those funds that rightfully belong to the 
panamanian people 
before the hearing attorneys for both sides met at the federal 
courthouse to seek a solution said defense attorney jon may 
attorney steven kollin said noriega would need as much as 5 
million to counter the 37 million the defense estimates the 
government is spending on the trial 
in a sharply worded opinion issued june 15 the judge said the 
government failed to give noriega due process when it seized the 27 
bank accounts around the world valued at 20 million along with 
other assets such as the deposed panamanian leaders homes cars 
and personal property 
during the invasion of panama troops also found 58 million in 
cash in noriegas quarters which it turned over to the new 
panamanian government 
prosecutors and defense attorneys tried once before to resolve 
the dispute over defense attorneys fees but the deal was ruled 
illegal because federal law did not allow the government to pay 
300anhour fees or reimburse the number of attorneys noriega says 
he needs

politician who for a time adopted southern planters garb and who 
as louisville mayor invited ordinary people to air their gripes at 
city hall has died he was 83 
the democrat who died tuesday at a nursing home here was mayor 
from 1948 to 1953 and served in the us house of representatives 
from 1965 to 1967 he was a state legislator for four years in the 
1930s 
officials at the nursing home and funeral home wednesday evening 
were unable to give a cause of death 
as mayor farnsley may have been best known for the beef 
session every monday night he held court at city hall inviting 
any citizen with a problem or complaint to present it directly to 
him 
he energetically attacked what he saw as the citys problems 
farnsley turned empty lots into parks installed street lights 
raised city workers salaries improved police and firefighters 
pensions converted old schools into community centers and replaced 
old garbage trucks 
charlie was really one of the great planners and builders of

the bush administration presented the first 
deficitcutting proposal of the lagging budget summit on wednesday 
a 51 billion package of savings for next year that produced a 
lukewarm reaction from democrats 
it is a beginning said house majority leader richard 
gephardt of missouri the lead democratic at the closeddoor talks 
we have a good long way to go 
the significance of the proposal was not so much its contents as 
its very existence it was introduced in the tenth session of the 
talks six weeks after the meetings began and barely three months 
from the oct 1 start of the new fiscal year 
we today have succeeded in starting serious negotiations 
said gephardt 
sen pete domenici of new mexico a republican bargainer said 
the white house package would save 51 billion in fiscal 1991 and 
about 440 billion over the next five years others said the plan 
would save 50 billion in its first year 
its a good starting point said domenici the ranking gop 
member of the senate budget committee 
participants in the talks said the package included 20 billion 
in new taxes and other revenues 18 billion in cuts in benefit 
programs like medicare and 6 billion in defense reductions 
the participants who asked to not be identified said the plan 
also contained about 4 billion in cuts to domestic programs and 2 
billion in savings from reduced interest payments 
but gephardt said democrats believe that greater savings are 
needed over the five years in the range of 500 billion to 600 
billion 
some had concerns which they expressed gephardt said of 
democratic negotiators 
the majority leader said democrats would have to study the 
proposal overnight before responding to it 
earlier in the day senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser had said the white house proposal would go nowhere if it 
resembled bushs january budget that spending plan has been 
largely ignored on capitol hill even by republicans 
simply putting a new suit on that old corpse isnt going to 
revive it said senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
the first real flurry of bargaining in the negotiations which 
started six weeks ago came as white house and congressional budget 
experts said the federal deficit looks even worse than it did a 
month ago 
amid the evergloomier expectations about the governments 
finances white house budget director richard darman prepared to 
offer congressional negotiators a package that would pare next 
years shortfall by nearly 50 billion officials said 
i assume there will be many proposals darman told reporters 
democrats have been pressing for about 60 billion in savings 
for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 and nearly 600 billion in 
budget reductions over the next five years they have not specified 
from where the savings should come 
republicans have said saving 45 billion next ear and 450 
billion over five years should be adequate 
the apparent size of the problem the two sides are facing 
continued to grow wednesday 
darman told negotiators that next years budget gap will be 159 
billion excluding the costs of rescuing the savings and loan 
industry participants said thats 21 billion more than he 
projected last month 
the budget director said the 1991 shortfall would reach 200 
billion to 227 billion if thrift bailout costs are included in 
may the figure he used was 199 billion 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office also boosted its 
deficit forecasts 
cbo said next years shortfall would be 164 billion without sampl 
costs and 232 billion with them in may cbo estimated those costs 
at 149 billion to 159 billion and 196 billion to 246 billion 
respectively 
the problem is getting worse sasser said 
the grammrudman law requires the president and congress to 
reduce next years budget gap to 64 billion if they miss that 
target by more than 10 billion the law imposes cuts in most 
government programs 
cbo officials attributed the worsening numbers to less than 
expected tax collections and the growing size of the sampl crisis

philippines vice president salvador laurel 
said wednesday his governments policy on military base 
negotiations with the united states is in disarray because of a 
lack of leadership by president corazon aquino 
laurel said in an interview that contradictory statements by 
government officials have created confusion about what filipino 
policy on the bases is 
this is the time to come out definitely take a definite 
stance and show leadership laurel said referring to aquino he 
said aquino has said only that her government should not rule out 
any option concerning the bases 
the negotiations focus on us operations at subic bay naval 
base and clark air base and several smaller installations 
laurel a political rival of aquinos is in the united states 
on a private visit he met with senators and house members on 
tuesday 
with the current base agreement scheduled to lapse next year 
the united states and the philippines opened base talks last month 
in manila 
laurel said he takes seriously statements by bush administration 
officials that the united states will remove its military presence 
from the philippines if it is no longer welcome 
he said he advocates a gradual phase out of the american 
presence over a five to 10 year period the pace of the withdrawal 
would be guided by geostrategic factors such as soviet military 
behavior in southeast asia he said adding that the kremlin has 
indicated a willingness to reduce its presence in vietnam 
he also said that tensions between the united states and the 
philippines could be eased if during the course of the 
negotiations a number of irritants related to the bases are 
removed 
among others laurel mentioned the lack of jurisdiction of 
filipino courts over crimes committed on the bases 
if we want a real smooth relationship we should remove these 
irritants he said

subcommittee 
the sponsor of the provision rep nancy pelosi dcalif said a 
bank loan to china of 300 million to help plant trees did not 
cover a basic human need the bush administration considered that 
it did and supported the loan 
there is no agreement on what makes a basic human need 
spokesmen for the bank the biggest source of aid to the third 
world say that is not one of its standards the banks charter 
says it must base loans on a countrys economy 
many in congress want to punish china for suppressing the 
movement toward democracy and want the bank and the bush 
administration to join them one member called the loan for the 
trees a first anniversary gift for the chinese tank attack on

president bush lashed out wednesday at 
members of congress who say sending americans to mars is less 
important than other spending priorities he likened the critics to 
the naysayers of christopher columbus 
touring nasas marshall space flight center bush criticized the 
house appropriations subcommittee for voting last week to pull 
the plug on this historic undertaking by axing 300 million in 
seed money bush had requested for the project 
bush wants to return americans to the moon and to land a manned 
space flight on mars within 30 years 
some say the space program should wait that we should only go 
forward once the social problems of today are completely solved 
bush said at the space center but history proves that attitude 
is selfdefeating had columbus waited until all the problems of 
his time were solved the timbers of the santa maria would be 
rotting on the spanish coast to this day 
the president said american schoolchildren reading about 
columbus doubters have shook their heads in disbelief that these 
naysayers could have been so shortsighted 
we must not let the children of the future shake their heads 
at our behavior he said history tells us what happens to 
nations that forget how to dream the american people want us in 
space 
bush campaigning in alabama and north carolina for republican 
officeholders seeking reelection took time off for the trip to the 
space center 
bush spoke to a crowd that gathered outside the space center on 
a 114degree day after he told a news conference he was suspending 
talks with the plo 
the president toured portions of the space center and met with a 
group of seventh and eighth graders participating in nasas class 
from space program they students will ask questions of 
astronauts when they are in space during an august mission 
bush also participated in a demonstration of how starlight is 
analyzed touching liquid lithium to a flame to turn the flame red 
its kind of fun bush said 
bush stumped in alabama for firstterm gov guy hunt and in 
north carolina for sen jesse helms 
before several hundred contributors in charlotte bush praised 
helms with whom he has had sharp differences as a man who 
isnt a trendy follower who flows with the current hes a 
visionary who alters the tide 
he said they agree on many issues such as a strong defense and 
value issues such as a right to prayer in the schools and the 
need for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag 
lets face it people dont always agree with him but they 
respect him bush said of helms 
spokesman steve hart said the hunt even raised 450000 he 
estimated the helms event brought in about 1 million 
in huntsville the president headlined a reception to help hunt 
who is considered in good shape as he faces the winner of a june 26 
democratic primary runoff 
bush used that occasion to make a pitch for the proposed 
constitutional amendment to bar flag burning and for his anticrime 
package which congress has completely overhauled 
bush said that a carefully drawn amendment to make burning of 
the american flag a crime is needed because the flag is a unique 
symbol 
at the marshall space center bush pushed congress to approve 
the 300 million he wants in the 1991 budget to get the moonmars 
project going 
the sum is part of bushs 1991 budget request for 127 billion 
in overall spaceexploration money out of a total nasa budget of 
152 billion the president has announced a goal of landing a 
manned spacecraft on mars by 2019 and returning manned missions to 
the moon 
last week however the house appropriations subcommittee that 
handles the national aeronautics and space administration slashed 
the 300 million from its budget draft

house republicans began a marathon of 
anticrime speeches wednesday night touting the gop as the 
toughoncrime party and accusing democrats of stalling president 
bushs bill to fight the problem 
the speechmaking began at 715 pm and the republicans planned 
to keep the house in session through 8 am thursday the event was 
scheduled intentionally to be held exactly one year after bushs 
presentation of his legislation 
speaker thomas foley dwash earlier in the day called the 
session total nonsense and a politically motivated activity 
because he already has agreed to bring a major crime bill to the 
floor this year 
and in another counterattack house judiciary committee 
chairman jack brooks dtexas announced comprehensive anticrime 
legislation will be considered next week by the panels 
subcommittee on crime 
the gop members arranged for citizens from across the country to 
call in crimes as they are reported to police so the lawmakers 
could discuss them 
rep lawrence coughlin rpa early in the session announced 
in the first report that the coast guard had just made a major drug 
seizure coughlin is ranking republican on the select committee on 
narcotics abuse 
rep bill mccollum rfla ranking republican on the crime 
subcommittee said the gop traditionally has forced democrats to 
pass crime legislation 
here we are again leading the charge he said there has 
been no major initiative by those on the other side of the aisle 
ninety percent of whatever product eventually passes he said 
will be based on the initiative that republicans put 
together 
rep don ritter rpa complained that much of the 
presidents plan has been stalled right here in the congress by 
partisan politics 
its time for congress to deal with violent crimes and with 
drugs they are priority issues said rep hamilton fish rny 
senior minority member of the judiciary committee 
the crime bill to be considered by the committee would expand 
use of the death penalty for federal crimes including presidential 
assassination strengthen controls over chemicals needed to 
manufacture certain drugs and toughen criminal sanctions on those 
distributing anabolic steroids 
the legislation also includes federal grants to state and local 
governments to relieve prison overcrowding and improvements in 
procedures for seizing criminal assets 
another subcommittee is considering provisions to streamline 
appeals by death row inmates to avoid inordinate delays 
among bushs proposals were those to expand the federal death 
penalty for 30 offenses including presidential assassination and 
streamline the habeas corpus process by which prisoners challenge 
the legality of their arrests and punishment

weeks of security planning and drills paid off 
wednesday as 750000 people welcomed nelson mandela to new york 
without incident police said 
we did a lot of planning put a lot of police officers on the 
street handpicked the ranking officers on the scene and it all 
came to fruition said assistant chief thomas walsh commander of 
patrol officers in southern manhattan 
things looked great it was terrific walsh added 
no arrests were reported during mandelas stops at a brooklyn 
high school or during the tickertape parade honoring the 
antiapartheid leader 
there was a point when the things got tense a bunch of youths 
in their exuberance rushed the mandelamobile but we had 70 
police officers on each side of the flatbed truck and they held 
them back the chief said 
nobody was arrested in the incident which took place as the 
bulletproof vehicle neared city hall the chief said 
officers also moved a small group of demonstrators to a spot 
near city hall but out of the march route 
everything went smoothly from the beginning of the day right 
through said police deputy commissioner of public information 
suzanne trazoff 
security for mandelas threeday visit to new york exceeded the 
protection provided for soviet president mikhail gorbachev and 
rivaled measures taken to protect pope john paul ii during his 
visit in 1979 
three thousand police officers were assigned to protect mandela 
on wednesday part of 12000 officers slated to protect the 
71yearold civil rights leader during his new york visit 
the elaborate security plans codenamed operation topaz took 
state department officials and police six weeks to develop and 
ranged from the development of the mandelamobile to deployment 
of 6200 sawhorses for crowd control 
operation topaz was also the largest safety effort ever mounted 
by the state departments office of diplomatic security which 
provides protection to dignitaries who arent heads of state said 
spokeswoman meg ravnholt 
one of the jewels of the security plan was the specially 
designed 58000 mandelamobile a flatbed truck with a 
bulletproof glass bubble that held mandela his wife winnie and 
four aides 
the specially outfitted vehicle included such james bond touches 
as an explosionproof fuel tank and tires filled with 
bulletresistant material said trazoff 
state department agents used electronic devices as well as 
bombsniffing labrador retrievers to sweep the stops on mandelas 
schedule during his public appearances police and federal agents 
formed a 75foot security zone around mandela to keep him at a safe 
distance from onlookers 
undercover police officers and detectives were among the crowds 
lining the parade route and rooftops along the way were guarded by 
uniformed sharpshooters said police sources who spoke on condition

the parents of kidnapped american gold 
miner scott heimdal said wednesday they have taken over 
negotiations with their sons abductors so they can personally work 
for his release 
roy and marge heimdal of peoria ill arrived in quito late 
monday in the hopes of winning the release of their 27yearold 
son who was kidnapped april 28 near the colombia border by men 
believed to be communist guerrillas 
in a statement released wednesday through the us embassy the 
heimdals said they were taking direct charge of all negotiations 
with the persons who have our son scott 
we have relieved all other persons that represent us in these 
negotiations were trying to establish direct contact with the 
persons that have scott to try and obtain his freedom the 
statement said 
were confident and optimistic that they will hear our pleas 
and deal directly with us and understand the suffering were going 
through 
the statement did not say whether heimdals parents planned to 
travel themselves to the jungled area along the colombia border 
where its believed heimdal is being held or who would help them 
with spanish translations in the talks the heimdals speak no 
spanish 
heimdal was kidnapped by a band of armed men while traveling in 
a canoe on the bermeja river 100 miles northeast of quito where he 
worked for the small gold mining company iminco the boats pilot 
was killed 
the companys general manager jeffrey fino has until now been 
closely involved in negotiations with the guerrillas who are 
demanding a ransom of 612000 paid in colombian pesos 
attempts to reach fino for comment wednesday were unsuccessful 
the heimdals a workingclass family scraped together 60000 
most of it in community donations believing that was the price the 
kidnappers were asking but they learned last week the ransom 
demand was 612000 and that the 60000 was only to guarantee 
their sons safety 
fino expressed in an interview last week his growing distrust of 
the guerrillas he said they have behaved erratically and 
unpredictably in talks with finos negotiator 
the kidnappers identified themselves as members of the peoples 
liberation army a communist guerrilla group operating in the 
colombian jungle 
wednesdays statement was the first made by the heimdals since 
they arrived in quito us embassy officials have warned publicity 
about the negotiations could endanger heimdals life 
in a fourpage letter from heimdal made public by his parents 
last week the kidnap victim said the guerrillas was under the 
impression heimdals family was rich because they were able to see 
a cable news network tv report about the fundraising effort in 
peoria where the heimdals live in a rented home

gov mario cuomo refused wednesday to 
extradite four executives of a new yorkbased bluemovie satellite 
broadcasting company to face obscenity charges in alabama 
in a letter to alabama gov guy hunts legal staff cuomo 
counsel evan davis said state law doesnt allow the governor to 
comply with such an extradition request unless the alleged offense 
is a crime in new york 
the march indictments name home dish only satellite network 
inc four of its executives the giant gte corp and some of its 
executives the charges resulted in home dishs american exxxstasy 
channel and its related tuxxedo channel being pulled off the air 
the charges against gte and its executives were dropped shortly 
after gte pulled the plug on home dish 
the indictments set off a debate over censorship in the 
hightech era because the action in alabama ended up cutting off 
the movies to subscribers nationwide 
home dishs american exxxstasy channel had broadcast hardcore 
movies for a 20amonth fee to about 30000 subscribers nationwide 
who owned satellite dish antennas which often cost 2000 or more 
the tuxxedo channel went to 12 million cable subscribers who 
paid 5 in addition to the regular cable fee 
the charges against home dish were brought by montgomery county 
ala district attorney jimmy evans who is running for state 
attorney general in alabama 
evans was on the road campaigning wednesday night and couldnt 
be reached immediately for comment on cuomos decision 
our clients are very happy with cuomos move said paul 
sherman a new york city lawyer representing home dishs four 
executives they do not believe they have done anything wrong 
sherman said home dish has been out of business since the 
indictments were handed up and satellite owners refused to 
transmit the xrated and rrated fare supplied to subscribers of 
the american exxxstasy and tuxxedo channels 
sherman said he didnt expect the broadcasts to resume anytime 
soon because alabama charges remain in force against home dish and 
gte spacenet the satellite operating arm of gte 
also remaining under indictment in alabama is the us satellite 
corp of utah which operates a ground station to beam 
transmissions to communications satellites 
the four home dish executives cuomo refused to extradite were 
company chairman paul klein his wife janet klein the companys 
vice president president jeffrey younger and treasurer robert 
kramer 
klein a former executive vice president for programming at nbc 
is working as an independent producer said sherman 
evans move against home dish has drawn fire from first 
amendment activists 
without proving that anything is obscene jimmy evans has 
succeeded in bankrupting this company home dish and keeping the 
rest of the country from seeing these movies in the privacy of 
their home martin mccaffery vice president of the civil 
liberties union of alabama said recently 
evans however called the satellite transmissions a national 
scandal i know from experience that hardcore obscenity leads 
to the abuse of women and children

a senator said he wanted another pentagon 
investigation of procurement waste after learning the air force 
bought jet engine pliers for 999 a pair just under a 1000 
ceiling implemented as a reform 
us sen charles grassley riowa has asked the pentagons 
inspector general to take another look at acquisitions abuse over 
the custommade pliers that contractor pratt amp whitney sold to the 
air force the miami herald reported wednesday 
the maker of the pliers city tool of florida charged pratt amp 
whitney 669 a pair for the pliers the newspaper said the 
contractor added 330 to the price of each pair to the air force 
the herald said 
the final price fell just 1 shy of a rule that requires the 
military to buy directly from manufacturers for items that cost 
1000 or more the newspaper said 
other recent military spending includes 1868 for toilet covers 
for c5 cargo planes 120 for cup dispensers and 117 for 
soapdish covers the herald said 
an air force official and a pratt amp whitney spokesman defended 
the amount charged for the pliers 
pratt amp whitney based in palm beach county did warranty the 
item they did make sure the item was made in accordance with the 
drawings with all the necessary checks and compliance and 
whatnot said cliff goodhue a cost analyst at the air force 
logistics command headquarters in ohio 
perhaps 999 was a bargain for this item after all he said 
a crackdown on military waste began in 1985 by thendefense 
secretary caspar weinberger when a 435 hammer topped a list of 
costly pentagon purchases the effort produced the 1000 rule 
among other reforms 
pratt amp whitney decided the performance of 20yearold f111 
engines could be improved by installing new exhaust gas deflectors 
but unique curved pliers were needed to hold new clips in place 
the herald said 
the air force concurred that the price was correct and 
appropriate for what they needed to do said pratt amp whitney 
spokesman robert gh carroll iii

the spread of aids is slowing among some 
gay men but soaring among teenagers women crack smokers and 
heavy drinkers researchers reported wednesday on the opening day 
of the international aids conference 
in particular the emergence of crack cocaine use as a risk 
factor for the transmission of hiv is a new and disturbing 
development in the epidemiology of aids said don c des jarlais 
of the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city hiv is the 
virus that causes aids 
about 80 protesters were arrested outside moscone center where 
1800 reporters and 12000 delegates to the sixth international 
conference on aids gathered for the presetation of new research 
demonstrators contended the federal government is dragging its feet 
in the search for a cure for aids 
the arrests mostly on misdemeanor charges of interfering with 
police officers came after about 300 protesters gathered outside 
the center chanting such things as were here were queer and 
we demand access 
some of those arrested hopped barricades and sat down on 
sidewalks others were arrested for blocking streets 
act up members have scheduled a series of demonstrations 
focusing on their contention that the federal government is 
dragging its feet in the search for a cure for aids 
inside the convention center the conference opened with 
researchers criticizing the policies of the immigration and 
naturalization service that allow foreigners with aids virus 
infections to be barred from the united states 
more than 100 groups boycotted the meeting in opposition to that 
policy said dr john l ziegler chairman of the conference 
the conference organizers also oppose the us immigration 
policy in the strongest possible terms ziegler said 
peter staley an activist with the militant aids coalition to 
unleash power or act up criticized president george bush for 
staying away from the conference 
staley incited some of the delegates to begin chanting three 
hundred thousand dead from aids where is george 
mayor art agos noted that after last years earthquake congress 
gave san francisco 4 billion and california passed a special tax 
to help the city retrofit our physical infrastructure 
but where said agnos is our retrofit for aids 
a few hours earlier a member of act up disrupted a symposium on 
aids drugs when he stood in the audience at the masonic auditorium 
and refused to be silenced 
the disruption prompted doctors discussing a report on a new 
aids drug to leave the stage their presentation later was 
televised to the audience from a room in the rear of the nob hill 
auditorium 
act up member gdali braverman of new york said afterward that 
he had no intention of disrupting this meeting we wanted to get 
our information across about the drug ddc developed by hoffman 
laroche which sponsored the symposium 
des jarlais is one of the authors of aids the second 
decade an attempt to summarize all existing information on the 
likely future course of the epidemic it was prepared by experts 
assembled by the national research council of the national academy 
of sciences 
the report presented earlier in the day offered little ground 
for optimism 
we believe the picture of aids and hiv infection in the 
foreseeable future is one of a continuing toll of sickness and 
death for a steadily broadening profile of individuals des 
jarlais told reporters 
populations not previously thought to be at special risk for 
aids infection are suddenly becoming infected he said 
the disease is moving out of the large urban centers he 
said 
women are being more seriously affected the proportion of aids 
cases in women has grown from 6 percent in 1982 to 10 percent in 
1989 des jarlais and his colleagues found 
younger gay men are putting themselves at risk by practicing 
unsafe sex at twice the rate of older gay men said thomas j 
coates of the university of california san francisco older gay 
men are more likely to use condoms a safer sexual practice that 
cuts the risk of hiv being spread 
new people are entering this pool and they consider themselves 
invulnerable coates said 
in new york city 1 percent of black and hispanic teenage 
mothers are infected with hiv des jarlais said 
alcohol too is associated with the spread of aids because 
like crack it often leads to unsafe sexual behavior the 
researchers said 
the rev cecil williams of the glide united methodist church in 
san franciscos drugplagued tenderloin district who has worked 
with crack users said the panels findings confirmed his 
observations 
women are the prime recipients of crack cocaine said 
williams who was not connected with the report it heightens 
sexual intensity it gives sick people a feeling of being 
completely free 
the blood supply is safer than ever said cladd e stevens of 
the new york blood center she said infections from 
aidscontaminated blood are occurring at the rate of one for every 
50000 to 250000 units of blood transfused 
some 4 million americans get blood transfusions each year and 80 
to 400 of them are getting aids from the transfusions she said 
the national research council also found that female prostitutes 
do not appear to be serving as a bridge for hiv transmission into 
the larger heterosexual population 
the explanation may be that many are using condoms or engaging 
in oral sex which could reduce the risk of transmission des 
jarlais said 
the panel endorsed efforts to educate the public to the dangers 
of aids and to tell intravenous drug users that using clean 
syringes can help prevent the spread of aids 
the fears of some that explicit sexual messages or the 
availability of clean syringes may entice the uninitiated into 
sexual activity or drug use is not borne out by the facts des 
jarlais said

advance people and a schedule of events complete with a theme for

a member of seattles act up chapter one of the media coordinators 
during the fiveday conference

arrested were charged with the misdemeanor of interfering with 
police officers authorities said 
while the conference headquarters are in lush digs at the 
marriott and moscone center feldman and his crew operate out of a 
room at the best western down the street from the bus terminal

the group has issued a schedule for the week with times and 
locations for demonstrations each day has a theme wednesday was 
protests over restricted access to research treatment and the 
conference itself thursdays activities will stress what 
protesters say are instances of government inaction and corporate 
profit 
but there will be other activities not on information sheets 
faxed to various media feldman said many actions are expected by 
affinity groups clusters of a dozen or so people who may 
decide on an impromptu move to disrupt a meeting or stage some show 
for the cameras 
very often they will decide to do an independent action to 
bring attention to their concern he said 
that happened tuesday during a march of 1000 people protesting 
us travel restrictions placed on foreigners infected with the 
aids virus 
eight people broke from the crowd as it approached immigration 
and naturalization service offices climbed over barricades and 
were quickly arrested feldman said that action was not part of the 
plan for the march 
no one has a count on the number of activists who have come to 
san francisco for the conference feldman believes most of the 40 
act up us chapters are already represented along with members 
from 25 foreign chapters he said the turnout for tuesdays march 
was larger than expected 
the degree of organization among the activists follows months of 
preparations among groups at times at odds over questions of policy 
and action 
some activists like larry kramer of new yorks act up called 
for riots at the conference others have argued against disrupting 
the conference and the flow of information about the disease 
feldman said although there is a degree of organization among 
the many voices there is still great independence 
i said were all playing off the same sheet its just that 
theres no paper its written on

reported wednesday 
moores attorney planned to write us district judge walter e 
hoffman indicating that moore wants to back out of his plea 
agreement with the justice department wsaztv and the 
heralddispatch of huntington reported citing anonymous sources 
the charleston gazette reported rumors of moores plans in its 
thursday editions 
moores wife shelley said he wasnt at his glen dale home and 
wasnt available to comment wednesday night 
his attorney william hundley didnt return a phone call to his 
washington dc office 
the prosecutor us attorney michael carey in charleston 
refused to comment as did the judge 
moore 68 pleaded guilty may 8 to extortion mail fraud tax 
fraud and obstruction of justice 
the threeterm republican governor is scheduled to be sentenced 
july 10 he faces up to 36 years in prison and 12 million in 
fines 
moore once a political powerhouse in west virginia admitted 
illegal acts during his 1984 campaign his 198589 term and his 
1988 reelection campaign 
he admitted to extorting more than 500000 from coal operator 
h paul kizer while he was in office in return for a 23 million 
refund from the states black lung fund which provides benefits to

unusual

coerced into entering the plea or that they were inadequately 
represented by their lawyers he said

killed in a flash flood last week 
gov richard celeste told mourners the flood demonstrated the 
power of nature and the resilience of the human spirit he offered 
a prayer for the victims 
we have learned again of your power sometimes its a dreadful 
power beyond our imagination celeste said but in our shock 
and pain and grief we learn of the power of the human family and 
we reach out share a hand and warm embrace 
the 45minute service was held at shadyside high schools 
football field under threatening skies 
earlier in the day authorities urged about 150 people to leave 
their homes in this eastern ohio village because of the threat of 
storms but the call for an evacuation was later lifted only about 
12 people had gone to a shelter set up at an elementary school 
volunteer barb geer said

dont understand how you cant understand it unless you go through 
it he said

the ohio river washing away houses cars and anything else in its 
path the dead have been found in debris along the creeks and in 
the river 
the national guard ohio department of transportation officials 
and volunteers have been working to clear the creek of debris that 
would cause runoff from a storm to back up and cause more flooding 
clearing efforts have been slow in some areas where obstructions

number of people reported missing since the flood twelve names 
remained on the list wednesday down from 60 listed as possibly 
missing the day after the storm

house democrats frustrated by a stalemate with 
president bush over budget cuts and taxes are starting to 
appropriate spending for next year beginning with 208 billion 
for energy and water projects 
ignoring the absence of an overall budget accord the house 
voted 35559 tuesday to raise by 350 million what bush would spend 
in fiscal 1991 to clean up the nations atomic weapons complex the 
house vote also would launch 25 water projects opposed by the 
administration 
what the house has done is to flaunt or doom the budget 
summit said rep bill frenzel rminn as several efforts to 
cut the spending were defeated this is something that is going 
to get this house in great trouble 
the measure is the first of 13 appropriation bills for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 to pass either the house or senate 
until tuesday congressional leaders had stalled action in hopes of 
reaching an overall budget agreement with the white house

this village in the pyrenees needs eight 
brides for eight bachelors but has decided it cant afford to pay 
50000 for them 
five years ago in an attempt to keep the village from dying 
the bachelors of plan advertised a threeday party to which young 
single women were invited 
the event attracted international attention became a yearly 
affair and led to more than 30 marriages nearly all the couples 
moved away plan still has eight bachelors looking for wives 
it also became very expensive and the village has decided to 
skip a year said miguel angel fumanal president of the plan 
bachelors association he said it does not have the 50000 needed 
to bring in women from across spain by bus pay their expenses and 
throw the party 
well take a sabbatical and use the time to think about 
what to do next year he said 
plan is a picturepostcard town nestled among snowcapped peaks 
above a rushing river 12 miles from the french border old stone 
houses line its narrow cobblestone streets 
there is not much for young people to do except look at the 
spectacular scenery or drink beer in the village bar on a recent 
evening there were eight men in the bar and no women 
the inspiration for the first party came to a similar crowd in 
the bar in january 1985 while watching the american movie 
westward the women on television the bachelors decided to do 
just what the frontiersmen did import women 
in the movie the goal was to create a new town the plan in 
plan whose population had declined from 300 to less than 200 was 
to save an old one 
the parties boosted morale said the rev jacinto brallans 
plans roman catholic priest who presided at the marriages of 
several couples who met at the annual fiestas young men who have 
to live alone in a little town like plan get discouraged 
brallans said similar problems could be found in many european 
villages where farm families had to decide whether to break up 
their small holdings or pass all the land on to the eldest son 
if the eldest gets it all which is often the case younger 
brothers and sisters move to the cities he said 
many people have left this town said jose prer a 
74yearold farmer who has spent his life in plan theres no 
work here 
something important was happening here with the annual 
party brallans said the people were fighting to survive 
when they put the ad in a newspaper in zaragoza the nearest big 
town plans bachelors thought few people would notice 
they were wrong the event was publicized as far away as china 
it attracted 100 eligible women who were brought to plan by bus 
from barcelona madrid and zaragoza and more than 1000 other 
people came to watch 
outside interest slackened after the first year however and 
the donations needed to finance it began drying up 
of the couples married as a result of the five annual parties 
two have remained in plan eight live in four neighboring towns of 
the gistau valley and the rest moved farther away brallans said 
benefits are visible a new pharmacy hotelrestaurant and 
beauty salon have opened in plan and brallans said the population 
had stabilized at about 200 
jose maria fantova a 35yearold bachelor feels optimistic 
hes building a market and intends to stay in the village 
the fiestas attracted enough tourists to fill the hotel in july 
and august and a ski resort might show the way to a brighter 
future for plan fantova said

when highly successful business people suddenly 
lose their magic touch often at what seems the apex of their 
careers you may find vanity plays a role in the drama 
vanity combined with financial leverage and economic cyclicality 
often drive their success the trio are the heroes of the ascent 
ironically they are also the villains of the decline 
you can find them at work in stocks bonds and commodities in 
las vegas and atlantic city in real estate merchandising 
banking politics they are eager supporters in the ascent savage 
enemies in the fall 
you can find two or all three in the major downfalls of business 
history in the savings and loan collapses in the bankruptcy of 
the hunt brothers who thought they could corner the silver market 
in ivan boesky the investor 
they are current in the affairs of william farley who tried to 
expand his textile empire before he had the money to pay for it 
and of robert campeau who became one of the worlds biggest 
retailers and then lost it all 
the three bad actors are especially prominent in building and 
real estate and are on stage in most real estate collapses they 
are visible and vocal in the affairs of several real estate gurus 
who rose from nothing and returned to it 
decades ago they helped bring down william zeckendorf one of 
the most famous real estate men of his time the man who assembled 
the land on which the united nations stands and today they are 
involved in donald trumps problems 
the scenario is deadly clear whether it evolves on the smallest 
of stages or the largest an example 
in the 1970s inflation raged those who kept savings in the 
bank saw them wither because interest rates earned were in the 
single digits while the buying power of money shrank at double 
digit rates 
while inflation shriveled the value of money it caused the 
prices of hard assets to soar the value of money in the bank 
deteriorated the value of money in real estate soared savvy 
people flocked to real estate 
bankers took notice not only did they lend money to building 
developers but they took a piece of the action themselves bankers 
sought out the more daring dramatic and successful developers and 
shoveled money at them 
inflation continued developers succeeded lenders lent how 
could you lose some developers believed they couldnt and some of 
the lenders tended to agree with them the borrowers borrowed more 
the lenders lent them more 
leverage became the name of the game the squeamish warned that 
it was dangerous to borrow so freely especially with interest 
rates rising but the daring ones were convinced they had mastered 
the magic formula 
then the economy began cooling and as it cooled the inflation 
rates began falling the jobless rate began rising people couldnt 
buy houses and apartments and they couldnt afford the high rents 
the game was over 
as the economy came plunging down into the recession of the 
early 1980s it toppled those who felt they could do not wrong who 
leveraged themselves who allowed their vanity to violate their own 
good judgment 
looking back almost every one of those involved in that debacle 
knew that the laws of good banking the principles of business and 
the economic cycle had not been revoked but they chose not to 
think about it 
instead their successes inflated their confidence and their 
confidence allowed them to borrow beyond reason in their clouded 
minds they knew it had to end someday but they chose instead to be 
guided by their vanity 
hadnt that vanity given them the courage to build empires why 
then should they not rely on it just once more just one more 
time they said while they sought to put a crown on their 
achievements

its all right there in the fine print nearly 
6 trillion worth of credit and insurance commitments held by the 
federal government potential liabilities that dwarf the savings 
and loan bailout 
every chance he gets richard g darman the administrations 
budget director tries to get people to pay attention to that 
accumulation of contingent liabilities he hasnt had a lot of 
success so far the commitments involved are arcane complex and 
almost invisible until something goes wrong 
but the price of guaranteed credit and federally backed 
insurance has been going up and not only in the savings and loan 
crisis darman says there should be tighter control and supervision 
of underwriting risks that now are outside the discipline of the 
federal budget system 
he also has suggested an overall ceiling on government loans 
guarantees and insurance the dollar value of those commitments has 
increased nearly sevenfold over the past 20 years the biggest 
single increase is in deposit insurance on accounts in banks 
savings and loans and credit unions now covered up to 100000 a 
deposit the total deposit insurance outstanding now runs to about 
3 trillion 
the credit and insurance programs have little visible impact on 
the budget which has made them politically alluring in congress 
where budgeted funds are hard to find as the government grapples 
with its chronic deficits 
there are loans and guarantees that benefit farmers retired 
workers students veterans home buyers small businesses and 
other groups in addition there are government sponsored 
enterprises created with federal backing to make it easier to get 
loans for houses farming and higher education 
those are broad and powerful constituencies 
no president and no congress would risk undoing the benefits 
they reap but the bush administration wants credit reform tighter 
supervision and a recognition of the liabilities the risks that 
werent acknowledged when the savings and loan crisis began to take 
shape 
in the administrations budget darman wrote that the purposes 
of federal credit support are generally worthy ones but there 
can be no denying that there is an enormous and increasing federal 
exposure approaching one trillion dollars in direct and federally 
guaranteed loans alone he said that is virtually certain to 
involve tens of billions of dollars in future claims against the 
government so are future claims against federal insurance programs 
darman says those costs will be manageable so long as they are 
recognized and handled on an orderly basis too little attention 
was paid in the past to the scope and scale of these commitments 
and often the governments potential exposure was understated or 
ignored darman said in his budget essay last winter 
ever since at congressional hearings in television appearances 
and in interviews darman has been trying to call all that to 
national attention so that hidden liabilities do not swell into 
staggering costs until it is too late to do anything except pay 
them 
while most of the guaranteed loans wont end up in default and 
most of the insurance wont lead to claims against the government 
federal losses have been increasing largely but not entirely 
because of the savings and loan crisis 
in 1989 there were 144 billion in bad loan losses compared 
with 37 billion in 1982 insurance costs totaled 672 billion in 
1989 almost all of that to cover losses at more than 400 failed 
savings and loans and banks and that was only a down payment on 
the sampl bailout 
there are other trouble signals 
the federal housing administration which insures home 
mortgages lowering the down payment and making them available to 
people who couldnt get loans otherwise has been losing money 
since 1988 for the first time in its 50 years facing the prospect 
of continuing losses that could bankrupt the governments mutual 
mortgage insurance fund by the end of the decade the 
administration has recommended tighter rules and higher fees for 
borrowers 
government insurance covers 1 trillion worth of pension 
benefits and while that fund has been running a deficit a supreme 
court decision on monday eased the problem the ruling broadened 
the power of the pension benefit guaranty corp to force employers 
to restore terminated pension plans instead of leaving the cost to 
the government insurance fund 
the fund still has a 1 billion deficit and its director told a 
house hearing last week that business failures could send that up 
sharply 
in each instance as sen jake garn rutah said of the fha 
mortgage insurance losses will eventually have to be covered by 
the federal government 
that means the taxpayers he said

the presbyterian church usa appears 
ready to turn the corner on one of the largest membership losses in 
the history of christianity by the next millennium according to a 
new threeyear study of the church 
the rev john mulder president of louisville presbyterian 
seminary and one of the directors of the study said a group of 
people are emerging within the church to find a middle ground 
between the battle lines set up by strident liberals and 
conservatives 
what were seeing in the 90s is this mobilization of the 
moderate middle mulder said i would look toward the middle or 
the late 90s as the point the presbyterian church would begin to 
reverse some of the losses or at least stabilize 
the presbyterian church which reached a high of about 44 
million in the mid60s lost more than 43000 members last year to 
fall to below 29 million the church adopted evangelism and church 
development as its two priority goals at its general assembly last 
year 
at the recent general assembly meeting here stated clerk james 
e andrews the denominations chief executive indicated the 
effort is starting to pay off 
declaring ours is a vital denomination he reported 
increases in adult and infant baptisms he also said professions of 
faith increased after years of steady decline a preliminary 
indication that our steady loss of membership can be reversed 
newly elected moderator price henderson gwynn iii of charlotte 
nc said the denomination could grow to 5 million members by the 
year 2000 as long as it stops the internal bickering 
if we shoot ourselves in the foot because of internecine 
warfare or denominational myopia we are going to have to answer 
for it he said 
the study entitled presbyterians in the 20th century a case 
study of american protestantism involved 55 different research 
projects done by 65 researchers mulder said the first volume of a 
projected sevenvolume series on the study was released last month 
the study was privately funded by the lilly endowment 
in an interview at the general assembly meeting mulder said 
demographics played a large role in the denominations decline the 
postwar baby boomers have delayed marriage and having children 
and are having fewer children overall 
but that doesnt fully explain the disproportionate losses 
endured by mainline churches he said 
he said the research showed many young people who grew up in 
mainline churches are not leaving for other churches but are 
giving up on organized religion mulder said the porous kinds 
of religious traditions in the churches makes it easy to join 
but its also easy to leave 
the study found an increasing pluralism in beliefs and moral 
behavior that puts the church at risk of losing a clear and 
welldefined identity mulder said 
in addition he said the church dealt itself some 
selfinflicted blows by reducing its support for new church 
development and campus ministry 
but mulder said there are hopeful signs within the denomination 
which has gone beyond a massive denial of membership trends to 
a growing awareness of the problem 
in the presbyterian church where surveys have shown most 
members take neither extreme coservative or liberal positions 
mulder said over the last two or three years groups such as 
presbyterians for renewal have developed that offer an alternative 
to the special interest groups that he said have sapped much of the 
churchs energies 
one of the things that i think is going on is the emergence of 
a moderate middle he said 
the development of a new statement of faith is another sign the 
church is trying to develop a better balance between spirituality 
and social witness and maintain its identity in a secular soceity 
he said 
i think the statement of faith is a reflection of the churchs 
ability even in the face of considerable diversity we are still 
capable of forming a unified statement of christian belief that is 
consistent with our tradition mulder said 
the pessimism with which he and others approached the research 
project has been replaced with a more optimistic outlook mulder 
said 
in the face of what are some obvious problems this is still 
a remarkably strong and vital church

brandon tartikoff the child prodigy of 
television is approaching middle age and so say some is his 
primetime schedule 
like an admonishing father the president of nbc entertainment 
recently accused upstart fox broadcasting co of pandering at 
nbcs annual convention for affiliated stations two weeks ago the 
41yearold former wunderkind admitted his proud peacock had 
strayed a bit last season with bombs such as hardball and 
baywatch 
nbc still is the no 1 network and tartikoff still is credited 
with bringing it from last to first place during his 10year 
tenure but things are not the same 
the accolades that once flowed like an open faucet have slowed 
to a drip adjectives like genius and brilliant no longer 
precede almost every mention of his name 
in the last two years he has been accused of playing it safe 
of introducing boring programs and relying too heavily on the 
handful of megahits including cheers and the cosby show 
that blasted nbc into first place five years ago after nearly three 
decades at the bottom 
tartikoff knows why this is 
the tired quotient has to do with columnists who are plain 
tired of having to write about nbcs primetime successes he 
says in his burbank office on the behemoth nbc studio lot there 
isnt an adjective you can squeeze out of a thesaurus that hasnt 
been applied to us 
he admits nbc has made mistakes but he doesnt want to go 
overboard i think there were probably one or two or three more 
mea culpas than should be allowed by law delivered at the recent 
affiliates convention tartikoff said 
the upcoming fall season will be different he promises nine 
new series will be introduced he is especially excited about 
fresh prince of bel air starring grammywinning rapper fresh 
prince the medical series signs of life brought to you by 
emmywinning hill street blues writer and producer jeffrey 
lewis and american dreamer starring robert urich and carol 
kane of taxi fame 
i feel like theres been a return to the kind of development 
that either got us into first place or kept us in first place 
tartikoff said as opposed to the kind of stuff we had last 
year 
in 1980 tartikoff became the youngest entertainment president 
in nbcs history following in the footsteps of mentors grant 
tinker and fred silverman seemingly he could do no wrong 
in a town full of executives with the depth of a puddle 
tartikoff is a nice guy he thanks you for accepting his call he 
doesnt wear armani suits call you babe or ask you to do lunch 
at le dome he does speak his mind however and over the years 
that has caused him a few problems 
a few years back he called fox the coat hanger network two 
weeks ago he was quoted as saying fox shows pander to the worst 
aspects of the american tv audience they assume people dont read 
every reference is to other tv shows they dont ask the audience 
to aspire to anything 
some tv columnists had a field day with that one tartikoff 
they reminded readers was the man who brought you manimal a 
show about a guy who could turn into a snake a panther or a wolf 
and a geraldo rivera special on satanism that included among other 
gruesome nuggets a segment on devil worshippers who skinned human 
babies 
but back to the fall 
with the cosby show beginning its seventh season in 
september or thereabouts cheers turning nine and the 
golden girls starting its sixth year nbc has some of the oldest 
shows on primetime television 
when the nielsen numbers came in for the 1989 fall season nbc 
was on top but it had won with the lowest primetime ratings in 
its history 
tartikoff struggles to rise above this nbc is the defending 
champ after all and no 1 is no 1 no matter how the deck is 
cut he has been doing this job far longer than counterparts bob 
iger at abc and jeff sagansky at cbs 
in fact no one in television history has been head of 
entertainment at one network longer than tartikoff 
but iger has stolen tartikoffs thunder most notably with the 
overwhelming success of americas funniest home videos and the 
critical acclaim of twin peaks 
fox has been equally blessed with its runaway hits the 
simpsons and married with children both of which made 
television history this week by breaking into nielsens top five 
i dont have a shadow of a doubt that well be continue to be 
the no 1 network tartikoff said theres nothing that i feel 
ashamed about we played a good game last year weve played better 
games but we still won the championship and no one else even came 
close

traditionally gold has been one of the most reliable ways to 
bet on inflation and thus protect the purchasing power of your 
money from increases in the cost of living 
so by superficial logic at least the price of gold should be 
mirroring some of the same worries that have prompted the fed to 
stick with an inflationfighting strategy licies of 
latein its credit po 
instead gold has fallen to its lowest levels in four years 
trading below 350 an ounce against slightly more than 400 just a 
few months ago 
for the many american savers and investors who keep a part of 
their nest eggs in precious metals investments as a bulwark against 
disaster this kind of experience has become familiar in recent 
years 
after flourishing in the inflationridden 1970s gold turned in 
a lackluster showing in the 80s as confidence revived in competing 
paper investments such as stocks and bonds the peak gold price of 
around 875 an ounce in early 1980 now seems long ago and far away 
in the eyes of many an analyst there is no immediate rebound in 
sight given my optimistic ijor political changes in the two biggest 
goldproducing nations the soviet union and south africa 
also periodic waves of selling have been reported from saudi 
arabia apparently prompted by a need for funds that oil revenues 
hasnt been able to meet 
the increase in the supplies of gold coming on the markets or 
potential supplies does not bode well for the price of gold in the 
near future says gray emerson cardiff in his advisory letter 
sound advice based in danville calif 
but even with all the obstacles seemingly confronting them the 
precious metals have by no means been given up for finished by 
everyone in the investment world 
i believe the decade of the 1990s is going to offer 
opportunities for tremendous profits in the precious metals just 
as in the 1970s asserts lawrence heim a portland ore 
investment advisor 
i keep saying that eventually there will be a panic into gold 
again i really do believe it will happen and it will reflect the 
outrageous amount of inflating money creation that has gone on 
over the past decade 
the huge annual deficits that have caused the national debt to 
reach 3 trillion have not yet shown up as a corresponding gold 
price rise 
along with a sharp rise in gold heim is forecasting an even 
bigger percentage increase in its poorer cousin silver 
of course it is a much different thing to speculate on 
potential swings in the precious metals markets than it is to buy 
and hold gold or silver as a hedge against trouble 
for people who turn to precious metals in this manner as a kind 
of insurance policy there may be good reason to be pleased if that 
investment never pays off

all the symptoms are there money worries 
bickering lack of trust poor communication and halfhearted 
threats of divorce 
after one year the marriage between boston university and 
chelseas schools is a little rocky 
the idea was to give the private university control of this 
failing school district with its high dropout rates low grades 
and even lower budgets bu would get the prestige of operating this 
unique and highprofile laboratory chelsea would benefit from bus 
educational and financial resources 
but after year one of the 10year program the universitys goal 
of stirring chelseas children as the public system could not 
is a long way off 
money still is short it took more than eight tense months for 
the teachers union to settle a contract with bu the experiment is 
being contested in the courts good intentions also have been 
tangled in the knot of advisory and oversight committees and in 
the conflicting interests of the aldermen school committee 
hispanic community groups and parents 
the biggest thing is getting through the mine fields of the 
state in financial chaos the city in chaos and all the petty 
bickering said peter greer bus dean of education and overseer 
of the management project 
bu installed diane lam as superintendent to engineer the 10year 
experiment and she uses the marriage metaphor 
hopefully it will be a love marriage that can develop 
trust she told the governors committee appointed to watch over 
the unusual relationship or it can be dissolved 
bu wants to remake the schools and attitudes about education 
in this workingclass city of 26000 people many from latin 
american and asia nearly onethird of the systems 3500 students 
come from families in which english is not the first language 
some programs were established this year notably alternative 
courses for kids with failing grades and afterschool programs in 
the elementary grades 
though 16yearold amy sandelin endured a sometimes tumultuous 
year under the new system shes eager for her senior year when 
she will be in the new renaissance school which will allow her to 
study what interests her most 
the arrival of bu sandelin said with a smile is really a 
good opportunity to do something with this school for a long time 
kids with potential they lost them now a lot of kids feel theres 
more opportunity 
other programs are being tried on a small scale limited only by 
a lack of money a literacy program for example teaches english 
to two generations at once by having parents read to their children 
bus aim to boost teachers low salaries and professional 
opportunities was a hardfought effort that seemed to take forever 
to resolve 
on june 13 the second to last day of school the teachers union 
finally accepted a contract that will increase their pay anywhere 
from 24 percent to 28 percent over three years the top salary for 
teachers with bachelors degrees is now 27813 with merit 
increases it will go up to 35620 
the contract also includes an advancement program for teachers 
who are not interested in the administrative route 
but the boldest most expensive part of bus plan to provide 
health nutrition and dental care for children from birth has 
gone nowhere 
greer blames bad times in massachusetts for a lack of money and 
commitment from big foundations efforts to raise 3 million have 
netted just 18 million in gifts and pledges the biggest chunk 
for computers and software 
the city now is being asked to give the schools a 19 million 
increase for the next school year over this years 12 million 
budget mostly for salaries and special education expenses that bu 
donations are not allowed to pay 
but money wont quell uncertainties among chelsea residents and 
among some teachers who feel the changes have come too fast 
as lorraine ruby an art teacher at chelsea for 27 years put it 
we know bu can really do good things here we want to make sure 
its substantive were not a media event were real lives here 
lam said much of this unease can be traced to the fact that 
its a new type of partnership so we have not had a road map of 
which direction to take change is always hard and it makes people 
anxious 
fiftyone chelsea residents and the chelsea teachers union have 
asked the state supreme court to declare the arrangement 
unconstitutional they say members of the chelsea school committee 
have lost their voices in school policy since the university began 
managing the school system a year ago 
in all other cities and towns the parents voters and school 
committees decide questions such as who will be superintendent or 
the high school principal said juan vega a plaintiff in 
chelsea top educators are terminated in secret no public 
discussion is allowed no reasons given this is disrespectful to 
the people of chelsea 
harold raynolds state commissioner of education once 
criticized the arrangement on those grounds the school committee 
he said had abdicated its elected duty to a bu management team 
but he notes happily that the school committee and the managers now 
meet monthly for a more cooperative effort 
it is a major success that they are still there after a year 
in operation said tom shannon executive director of the national 
association of school boards in alexandria va 
to look for results in the first year is asking too much 
said shannon whose organization represents the nations 15350 
school districts and is closely watching the chelsea project 
what chelsea will exemplify is what educators have known all 
the time the growing season of education is a long long time 
dont look at your watch look at your calendar

there is no mystery to the especially sharp 
decline in building activity the explanation is right there in the 
numbers on the record in the pattern of past economic cycles 
all of those indicate that the building business in its many 
variations has a long history of anticipating ups and downs of the 
economic cycle and of reacting more sharply than others to changes 
illustration when the economy in general weakens as now the 
situation already is an old story to homebuilders their downturn 
began months earlier and as in the past the impact on them is 
deeper than on other industries 
may housing starts fell to their lowest since the 1982 
recession dropping to an annual rate of 1207 million units a 
level reached after percentage declines of 14 in may 64 in april 
and 122 in march 
why should housing construction get the worst of downturns 
simply because it often gets the best of upturns when economic 
times get better they often get very much better in housing and 
when they get bad they get very bad 
conditions are poor now for many reasons but playing a 
prominent role is the inability of builders to obtain financing 
again as in the past when lenders become reluctant lenders they 
become especially so with builders 
the reason lies in the nature of building which is 
entrepreneurial and speculative the smallest and largest builders 
borrow heavily to begin their projects and all have the same grand 
hopes of immediate sale on completion 
too often lenders have seen builders produce a glut of product 
at the very time the economy is beginning to tip into a new down 
cycle too often they have been unable to collect their loans too 
often they have seen bankruptcies 
reflecting unique conditions loan officers are especially wary 
of making bad loans these days with regulators and their own 
boards looking over their shoulders high on their list of nonos 
therefore are builders 
while housing and real estate people have long complained about 
exaggerated impacts of economic policy which periodically pushes 
them into depression they are especially upset now 
two headlines in realtor news a weekly publication suggest the 
mood the first is unwarranted credit crunch unfairly hurting 
real estate the second theres money but will they lend 
it 
in a survey of 1142 members of the national association of home 
builders 60 percent said a credit crunch exists and that it is 
hurting them in spite of denials by bank regulators that a credit 
crackdown has been imposed 
whatever the cause the homebuilding industry once again has 
preceded other industries into recession and once again the depth 
of the decline in housing is deeper than elsewhere 
and because homebuilding has declined so much you might say the 
conditions are being produced that will lead to the next 
exaggerated cycle 
it goes like this because not enough houses were built during 
the downturn a shortage looms because of the downturn and because 
after all loans are what make profits for a bank lenders begin 
looking around for customers 
homebuilding leads the economic cycle whether up or down 
anticipating that the cycle will turn up builders rush to get 
their products on the market lenders are eager to help 
eventually another glut develops 
remember this when it does sometime in the future know that 
the rest of the economy soon will be headed down

when the saratoga performing arts 
center opened 25 years ago operators had a difficult time 
persuading rock and pop artists to play at the amphitheater 
no such problem now this granddaddy of summer amphitheaters can 
now pick and choose among the music business biggest names to fill 
out a schedule of more than 40 summer shows 
in the last decade outdoor amphitheaters have become a staple 
of the concert business only this year new outdoor arenas are 
opening near chicago and pittsburgh with cher hosting the 
inaugural shows in both places 
the shed circuit has resurrected dormant careers and given 
consumers such a huge array of choices that it has some industry 
leaders worried about overkill 
among dozens of artists on the road this summer are david bowie 
eric clapton the b52s sinead oconnor tears for fears james 
taylor jimmy buffett fleetwood mac tracy chapman bonnie raitt 
little feat and those summer perennials the beach boys 
i think it will be a good musical summer a good mix of 
styles said david hart who books acts at amphitheaters in 
detroit chicago and washington for the nederlander organization 
most amphitheaters are built the same way with a section of 
covered seats surrounded by an expanse of lawn for picnickers in 
saratoga for example there are 5300 seats protected from the 
weather but up to 25000 people can sprawl on the lawns 
their growing popularity coincided with the aging of the 60s 
generation woodstock nation still likes its rock n roll 
outdoors but with a lawn chair and wine instead of mud and drugs 
its more a part of the show to be outside sitting out on 
blankets enjoying yourself and enjoying the weather said 
buffett whos selling out sheds across the country this summer 
the weathers definitely part of the show 
amphitheaters have sprouted like mushrooms in recent years 
along with its pittsburgh shed the pace entertainment group has 
opened facilities in houston dallas atlanta nashville and 
memphis within the past five years 
its a natural setting for music said louis messina 
president of pace theyre built for music unlike an arena that 
is built for basketball and hockey 
from a business point of view musicians like the combination of 
covered and lawn seats in saratogas opening years their managers 
worried that a rainy night would wash out all their business until 
they realized that at least some patrons would be kept dry said 
herb chesbrough the arenas president 
the sheds with many booking acts that appeal heavily to young 
adult whites have helped keep alive the careers of 60s and 70s 
acts that otherwise might not do much business 
james taylor years from his latest hit is a summertime 
favorite so are the beach boys just as much annual fixtures in 
saratoga as the thoroughbred racehorses that trot through each 
august 
their audiences feel more comfortable in a place like this 
than they do in an arena chesbrough said if you took an 
artist like james taylor and put him in an indoor arena hed 
probably sell about half the tickets 
buffetts taken a band on the road during the summer for 16 or 
17 years now its reached the point where the margaritaville 
man rarely performs during the other three seasons 
even buffett whose songs have been absent from the top of the 
charts since the late 70s admits hes surprised at how well his 
concert tickets are selling this year 
it shocks me he said i figured i might have two or three 
more years and then reach a cap 
hes not alone in preferring to hit the road in the summer some 
industry experts are worried that the concert business is getting 
too reliant on the warm weather months 
because of the sheds touring has become a fourmonth business 
primarily said carl freed executive director of the north 
american concert promoters association its created a glut in 
the marketplace you have more acts than the public can pay to see 
at the same time therefore the ticket sales suffer for the 
borderline acts 
chesbrough said he doesnt mind having a lot of acts from which 
to choose however chesbrough who used to try and entice 
musicians into an area that was relatively unique now said hes 
worried that amphitheater operators will be fighting among 
themselves for acts 
a glut can be good news for consumers to be competitive 
promoters must specifically package together acts for the sheds 
ringo starr who went on the road last summer with an allstar band 
of musical vets is an example 
this year bonnie raitt is taking along john lee hooker the 
jeff healey band dr john and others on a blues extravaganza tour 
fleetwood mac is teaming with british popsters squeeze the b52s 
bring along upandcoming reggae star ziggy marley and rickie lee 
jones and lyle lovett join on an eclectic bill 
its too early to declare winners and losers for the summer 
privately promoters are especially bullish on the stevie ray 
vaughan and joe cocker double bill bowie the b52s the allman 
brothers and george thorogood kenny g and michael bolton and 
oconnor 
some promoters said they were worried that chapman australian 
rockers midnight oil and the fleetwood macsqueeze bill are some 
that could get lost in the shuffle 
other acts such as madonna paul mccartney and new kids on the 
block are touring stadiums this summer amphitheater operators say 
these bigname shows are more a help than a hindrance since they 
create interest in music

nine generations of cosmans six 
generations of clarkes and four generations of crists have worked 
the land of the hudson river valley sometimes their apple 
orchards have been bountiful sometimes they have not 
but generally they have kept their problems to themselves it 
is a measure of their fears for the future that they sought out 
reporters from the city to tour their farms and hear about their 
troubles 
the last two or three years apples have not made money 
said steve clarke from prospect hills orchard inc in milton 
consumers and farmers worry about chemicals farmers can get 
more money selling their land to developers than farming it 
competition from the northwest and abroad is squeezing their apples 
off store shelves and bad weather and pests of course never go 
away 
how do growers survive 
we go from year to year and look at the future and hope were 
going to be here larry cosman said at his mount airy farm in the 
hamlet of middle hope where he grows 250 acres of apple trees 
i think the odds are kind of against us in the sense that 
progress will prevail sooner or later and push out some of the 
farms he added later 
not that the farmers are railing against progress we brought 
you up here to show we dont have our heads in the sand said 
grower jeff crist 
farmers are adapting by getting closer to consumers like the 
pickyourown orchards at clarkes farm and with dwarf trees 
which can be planted more densely and pruned and picked more 
easily they also are starting sales organizations that market 
fruit from a group of farms and are selling directly to 
restaurants at farm markets and stands and abroad 
ten years ago it was enough to know what was going on in the 
confines of your orchard its not enough anymore said mike 
moriello of new paltz trying to be heard over joe porpiglias 
water dump which washes apples and sends them down to the waxer 
not all have adapted some have sold their land lot by lot 
its like theyre treading water said elizabeth ryan who 
owns a 35acre farm with her husband and is compiling oral 
histories of valley farmers 
in the 60s and 70s farmers sold their land but they sold 
it to farmers now they sell it to big real estate said 
porpiglia 60 as he looked out at farms that have been redeveloped 
for houses for sale signs are interspersed among the apple 
blossoms 
farmland preservation is fashionable but crists wife joy 
said that just saving land is not the point the emphasis needs 
to be on supporting and strengthening the farm business she said 
that means more research and development a good steady labor 
force and enough farmers so theres competition among businesses 
that support farms i dont see a lot of good active farms going 
out of business she said 
from the early 1800s growers in the hudson valley shipped many 
fruits by sloop south to new york city and points beyond including 
to south american countries now sending apples to the united states 
when larry cosman was a child wholesale buyers from new york 
city would travel the valley haggling with each farmer on his 
route 
in a 1938 booklet prepared for an apple blossom festival 
growers noted they had the best market in the world close at 
hand partly because city consumers cherished the fruits of 
upstate farms 
cosmans father sold happy bee apples with cheery 
oldfashioned stickers plastered on wooden boxes most went no 
farther than metropolitan new york 
in the 1930s ryan said there were 500 farms in ulster county 
on the hudsons western bank in 1990 there are fewer than 200 
family farms all along the valley from new york city to albany a 
140mile stretch 
in 1986 cosman 43 abandoned happy bee because he didnt have 
the volume to market his own label now his apples a dozen 
varieties from 40000 trees are hudson valley apples like his 
neighbors 
sometimes you talk about it and get a little choked up he 
said its a family name its part of you farming is not 
really a job its a lifestyle and most farmers live eat and 
breathe what theyre doing 
but the bottom line must prevail over sentiment its an 
international business cosman said and the hudson valley 
growers had to market their fruit together to compete with similar 
labels for michigan and washington state apples 
though exports remain a small slice of the us apple business 
13 million 42pound bushels in 1988 the cosmans sometimes export 
75 percent of a crop 
foreign climes seem very far away during a walk along latintown 
road in ulster county mcintosh and lesserknown types of apple 
trees spread out on all sides looking as if nothing could touch 
the serenity 
but alar did 
if you grow apples that changed your life forever ryan 
said 
on an emotional level it was a terrible upset all those 
guys in washington told us it was safe and we believed them we 
wanted to believe them said the cornelltrained pomologist or 
fruit specialist who did not use alar on her farm 
alar also known as daminozide is a growth regulator that 
slowed maturation and improved color and storage making it easier 
to manage harvests but even in february 1989 when the natural 
resources defense council issued its report linking alar and 
cancer few growers were using it said ulster county extension 
fruit expert warren smith 
nevertheless apple prices and sales fell growers still are 
trying to recover from losses estimated at 100 million 
like consumers cosman said farmers have a hard time figuring 
out which experts to believe but they respond to consumers and to 
costs moriello said and for chemicals the cost has gone up 30 
percent to 50 percent in recent years even though hes using less 
smith said all the valleys apple growers use integrated pest 
management a system that combines ecological nonchemical methods 
and natural predators with chemicals ideally fewer and fewer of 
them 
we have never recommended calendar spraying when other options 
are available he said would you take an aspirin if you didnt

never mind the 12 tanks helicopter antiaircraft guns and

sovietmade olive drab limousine with jump seats 
the car once belonged to kim il sung leader of north korea then 
and now the south korean army captured it during the korean war 
which began june 25 1950 with a north korean invasion and lasted 
37 months 
it is driven out of a closed garage several times each day 
visitors to the museum are allowed to take photographs climb 
inside examine the upholstery and even check out the engine

aeroflots resumption of service to 
indonesia in july is another sign of improving relations between 
the soviet union and southeast asia which were sour throughout the 
1980s 
flights between moscow and jakarta were halted in 1982 after two 
soviet diplomats and the head of the soviet airlines jakarta 
office were accused of spying and expelled 
malaysia had ousted three soviet diplomats for the same reason 
in 1981 singapore expelled a soviet diplomat and a shipyard 
technician in 1982 accusing both of espionage 
soviet warships and planes occupied former us bases in vietnam 
and military aid from moscow sustained vietnams occupation of 
cambodia 
the red army was fighting in afghanistan and posted along the 
border with china relations between the kremlin and japan were 
strained because the soviets still hold the kurile islands 
captured late in world war ii 
suspicions remained even after president mikhail s gorbachev 
promised in a speech at vladivostok in july 1986 that the soviet 
union would mend its ways in the region 
mochtar kusumaatmadja then indonesias foreign minister 
expressed the general attitude with this comment it is a good 
beginning but there is a long way to go 
old perceptions of the soviet union have been swept away by 
recent events however and abu hassan omar the current foreign 
minister announced a new policy in may 
he told the international affairs forum in kuala lumpur that 
gorbachevs reforms had changed moscows presence in the region 
from offensive to one of no particular threat 
some in southeast asia have been encouraged by the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan and its participation in diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the cambodian conflict particularly welcome was 
the promise of reduced soviet military presence in vietnam 
the soviets are already in the process of unilaterally drawing 
down their offensive capabilities in danang and cam ranh bay abu 
hassan said my assessment is that the soviet union will now be 
more inward looking and will require a peaceful and stable 
international environment to pursue reform and economic development 
at home 
earlier this month gorbachev and president roh taewoo of south 
korea met in san francisco 
diplomats said attitudes in the region began changing 
dramatically last year when gorbachev did not intervene to stop 
communist regimes from falling in eastern europe 
the soviet unions political image has improved dramatically 
but its quest for greater trade and investment has been less 
successful 
japan and the united states dominate commerce in the pacific 
basin the soviets also must overcome perceptions that they produce 
shoddy goods and pay slowly 
moscows application to join the united states japan canada 
australia new zealand and the european community as a dialogue 
partner with the association of southeast asian nations was 
rejected last year 
asean links brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines 
singapore and thailand to promote regional economic cooperation 
officials of the organization said the soviet union was told to 
apply again later when its economic presence in the region was 
stronger a soviet request to take part in the new and larger 
asiapacific economic cooperation forum brought the same response 
we look forward to the soviet union participating in the rapid 
growth of this region said prime minister lee kuan yew of 
singapore a stalwart anticommunist 
within asean western diplomats say the soviet union seeks the 
closest ties with president suhartos administration in indonesia 
also rigorously anticommunist 
indonesia has 178 million people and offers a large relatively 
unexploited market 
thirty years ago the late soviet leader nikita khrushchev also 
saw indonesia not vietnam as the key to the region 
suharto made what jakarta regards as a highly successful visit 
to moscow in september since then indonesian ports have been 
reopened to soviet shipping and restrictions have been eased on the 
entry of soviet citizens 
in january president mirza olim i ibragimov of the soviet 
republic of uzbekistan became the highest soviet official to visit 
in 25 years

standing about 20 feet tall on a platform in 
the louisiana superdome was a huge replica of an open bible 
the book was the cynosure of last weeks convention of southern 
baptists who perpetuated a leadership that insists on a singularly 
defined view of the contents 
avowing that view is the new criterion for job security among 
the thousands of staff members missionaries executives and 
professors of the nations largest protestant denomination 
the requirements elaborate details beyond any of the classic 
christian creeds specifying that acceptable belief for 
denominational personnel must include these spelledout 
affirmations 
that the worlds creation occurred as the bible recounts it 
that adam and eve were real individuals that all the biblically 
related miracles happened literally as described that moses wrote 
the first five books of the bible that all biblical narratives are 
historically flawless 
its the equivalent of a creed said the rev john lee 
taylor a gainesville ga pastor and of an expanded kind 
baptists historically have shunned creeds proclaiming no 
creed but the bible and emphasizing the soul competence of 
individuals to interpret scripture as they understand it but the 
new yardstick enjoins precise judgments 
its another example of the exclusivism being established in a 
denomination that historically has been open to diversity taylor 
added 
the new prescriptions were approved by a 1987 convention 
dominated by a fundamentalist majority that has wielded influence 
since 1979 and which this time increased its hegemony winning the 
powerful presidency for the 12th successive year 
that bloc rose to power over the 149millionmember 
denomination on the basis of politicalstyle organization and 
campaigning under the banner of biblical inerrancy and rightist 
social positions 
inerrancy is a relatively new term in christian annals 
meaning that the bible is totally free of error about science 
history geography biology religion and all other fields 
considering the typical baptist devotion to the bible any talk 
of threats to it is bound to set off alarm bells and that 
evidently is what happened from fundamentalist charges that 
denominational offices were infested with liberals downgrading 
the bible 
the canonading directed at seminary professors and various 
other staffers has brought out the troops 
they swelled annual conventions to enormous size with campaign 
buses and chartered planes bringing in the voters more than 
doubling the numbers attending before the infighting began a 
decade ago 
the affairs now involve vast multitudes kept under tight 
restraints from the rostrum this time a sea of 38478 
messengers the third highest yet next to 40987 in 1986 in 
atlanta and 45293 in 1985 in dallas 
worked up by fiery oratory about internal enemies of a 
perfect bible the gigantic gathering gave the heaviest flood 
of ballots yet to the fundamentalist platform electing the rev 
morris chapman of wichita falls texas as president by a majority 
of 58 percent 
chapman 49 a trim 6foot smoothly articulate man is 
personally gracious in manner but espouses a strict policy of 
insuring conformity of beliefs within the paramaters of the new 
specifications 
what we believe about the bible is a nonnegotiable he told 
a news conference saying he would appoint only those holding the 
defined beliefs 
the denominations president the most authoritative office in 
us christianity has appointive powers that control choice of 
trustees governing the denominations immense network of agencies 
and institutions 
ive never advocated any wholesale housecleaning chapman 
said adding that those out of line with requirements would be 
eliminated mostly by attrition retiring or impelled to resign 
he suggested those not holding inerrancy positions would 
find a denominational home more in line with their convictions 
most all southern baptists are theological conservatives but a 
moderate wing accepts both fundamentalist and other biblical 
approaches such as seeing some miracles as imagery their 
significance being in their meaning rather than in their literal 
occurrence 
the moderate candidate the rev daniel vestal 46 of atlantas 
suburban dunwoodie lost this time with the weakest showing yet in 
the decadelong battle getting only 42 percent of the vote 
but that still represents a lot of baptists in a denomination of 
nearly 15 million and what theyll do remained uncertain under the 
tightened demands for conformity and the fundamentalist sweep 
some moderates foresaw an erosion of support to national 
denominational operations and increased links to alternative 
groups such as the baptist alliance set up to resist 
fundamentalist ascendancy 
in any case for the present the multibilliondollar 
institution built up by southern baptists over 145 years of 
history now was firmly in the hands of one side and it saw no 
room for the others in denominational responsibilities 
a chief fundamentalist strategist the rev paige patterson of 
dallas an affable mildmannered man eyed the now fortified 
position of his forces and observed i think ill hang up my 
holster and ride off into the sunset

mark taynton was among the first americans to 
die in the korean war he was thrown into the breach against north 
korean invaders 
schuyler b cole was among the last the war had bogged down 
roughly along the same line where it started when soldiers died 
over map points named pork chop hill and heartbreak ridge 
leslie doyle rader was killed at inchon when the americans 
gained the offensive 
fellow marine william g windrich died a hero at the chosin 
reservoir after communist china entered the war his tombstone 
notes he won the medal of honor 
if the war didnt end with the clearcut results some wanted 
and if things arent perfect in korea today well nobody can fault 
these men 
yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white 
marble headstones at arlington national cemetery there is no patch 
of ground no monument of carved black granite for korean veterans 
only now 40 years later is a memorial in the works 
authorized by congress in 1986 it will adjoin the lincoln 
memorial across the reflecting pool from the vietnam memorial if 
11 million in private contributions can be raised by 1991 about 
62 million has been raised so far 
for the people who fought bled or died in korea its about 
time 
its an overdue thank you said retired col john fc 
kenney a member of the korean war veterans association and former 
executive director of the korean war memorial advisory board 
the nation owes some form of recognition to those who without 
all the fanfare of a war to save the world marched off quietly to 
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their 
country asked them to do so kenney said 
the memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers each 8 feet tall 
walking from a copse of trees toward an american flag there will 
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead 
we were the silent veterans of the forgotten war says frank 
kerr a boston public relations executive who fought with the 
marines at chosin those who died enobled that time and place it 
was like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasnt a ripple 
that forgotten war began june 25 1950 when north korean tanks 
clanked southward across the 38th parallel it ended july 27 1953 
not with a final peace but an armistice about 43000 us 
soldiers are still in korea serving as a trip wire in case the 
north invades again 
most americans get their images of the korean war from mash 
reruns 40 percent of the country is too young to remember it 
firsthand 
korea was a nasty war more artillery fell on it than was fired 
in all of world war ii in 37 months 54248 americans died 
33629 of them in combat the rest in accidents or from sickness 
in vietnam the us dead reached 58149 in more than 10 years of 
fighting 
there are 8177 mias and 389 unaccountedfor pows all of them 
presumed dead thirtyeight percent of american pows died in 
captivity 
korea was a harbinger almost all the ingredients of vietnam 
were present in korea east asia an undeclared limited war a 
conflict between northern communists and a southern republic and 
american war technology against a determined but illequipped foe 
but mostly korea was a war unlike any the american public ever 
had been asked to support americans watched with some fascination 
as the usled united nations troops were almost overrun then 
counterattacked all the way to north korea then were beaten back 
by hordes of chinese troops 
one year after the shooting started the lines stabilized at 
roughly the 38th parallel peace talks dragged on for two years 
and 45 percent of the casaulties came after the stalemate on the 
battlefield 
at first most americans in those communistconscious times 
approved but america soon was turned off by a nowin stagnant 
war there were no patriotic ditties by irving berlin but no 
antiwar songs either there were no parades but no draftcard 
burnings or kent states 
it fell off the front pages it just sort of petered out in a 
very negative way nobody wanted to think about this thing said 
historian clay blair author of korea the forgotten war 
when the war was over people went back to their jobs and 
didnt talk about it when your country asked you to do something 
you do it said dick adams former member of the 25th infantry 
division and now president of the korean war veterans association 
was korea worth it 
veterans say just ask anybody if theyd rather live in the 
north one of the last vestiges of ironclad stalinism or in the 
south a bustling industrial power that was host to the 1988 
olympic games 
my view is we accomplished our mission in full said gen 
richard stilwell who commanded ground forces in korea and now 
heads the effort to build the korean memorial korea was the 
cornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided the 
bulwark of what is happening in eastern europe 
it was a complete victory we did what we set out to do we 
stopped the communists it was worth every inch of it said 
william norris of waterford ny founder of the korean war 
veterans association 
the veterans group was formed in 1984 norris daughter wanted 
to do a school paper but couldnt find any library books on korea 
the place where her father fought and his buddies died 
it irritated me i started it so nobody would ever forget 
norris said 
the group already has remembered to remember it placed a 
granite meditation bench near arlingtons tomb of the unknown 
soldier on july 27 1987 
it is carved with this quote from herman wouk the beginning 
of the end of war lies in remembrance

vasiles problem illustrates those of the newly elected 
government it has i tomorrow they nherited one of eastern europes least 
efficient economies but cannot change the system radically without 
risking a loss of support from workers 
how important workers are to the government was illustrated june 
14 when tens of thousands poured into bucharest to show support 
after a day of antigovernment riots 
bluecollar workers about 40 percent of romanias labor force 
have benefited greatly from the revolution that began with the 
overthrow and execution of ceausescu in december 
factory employees went on strike to force communist managers 
out then elected their own new bosses 
of course they are nicer to us because if they arent we 
might fire them said alexandru 25 a laminator likaking a break at

worry about domestic economic 
turmoil and the global crisis of communism is causing authorities 
to get even tougher with dissidents and people they dont trust 
vietnamese and western sources report 
the crackdown has included arrests tightened surveillance and 
suppression of the only legal dissident group the club of former 
resistance fighters at least half a dozen foreigners have been 
detained since april and two americans accused of antigovernment 
activity were deported 
sources said conservatives appeared to have gained the upper 
hand over those in the communist party leadership who favor 
economic and other reforms 
there is a tremendous sense of insecurity in top party 
ranks said a source with access to many officials there is a 
tightening up and everybody is more cautious and afraid to say 
anything they dont acknowledge it but you can see it in their 
faces 
on june 16 hanoi radio said the interior ministry 
counterintelligence force and police in coordination with the 
armed forces had promptly cracked down on many troublemaking and 
sabotage activities 
security forces caught 30 persons violating vietnamese law and 
discovered over 200 foreigners entering the country illegally 
the radio reported 
it said they destroyed five underground reactionary 
organizations and captured tens of their members and seized 
publications with reactionary contents 
many people have taken advantage of international 
organizations investing in vietnam to infiltrate and spy according 
to the broadcast thirty of more than 100 enterprises involved in 
joint ventures with foreign companies were found to be operating 
illegally it said 
hanoi radio said the crackdown was connected with major 
anniversaries an apparent reference to the 15th anniversary april 
30 of victory in the vietnam war and the centenary may 19 of the 
birth of independence leader ho chi minh authorities feared 
protests on both days but none materialized 
sources say dissident activity in vietnam is minimal and the 
actions reflect paranoia over the possible loss of political 
and economic support from the soviet union and eastern europe 
another factor they said was the bold challenge by prodemocracy 
demonstrators last year in china 
a hanoi radio report may 23 claimed the cia had subverted 
eastern europe and was trying to do the same in vietnam by 
circulating leaflets and employing tourists overseas vietnamese 
minority ethnic groups and catholics 
many noncommunist nations halted aid to vietnam after its 
invasion of cambodia in december 1978 
washington also forbids commercial dealings but businessmen 
from other western countries have flocked to vietnam in the 
increasingly open climate of the past two years 
the crackdown appears focused on ho chi minh city a southern 
commercial center that formerly was saigon capital of south 
vietnam 
for the first time in numerous visits to vietnam in recent 
years a reporters papers were searched before his flight left by 
a uniformed man introduced as a cultural officer 
when asked the reason for the search the man merely chuckled a 
government employee who was to help the journalist through customs 
appeared nervous and left early 
two wellconnected sources who demanded anonymity said they 
believed the tightening was temporary and did not mean an end to 
doi moi the communist partys 3yearold economic 
renovation program they added however that it might last 
until a national party congress expected in mid1991 
most of those detained were either close to the party or members 
of it the sources said the hanoi radio report said some 
confused and utopian party members had aided the alleged cia 
sabotage campaign 
an early sign of trouble in the party was tran xuan bachs 
expulsion in march from the ruling politburo after he supported 
greater democracy 
security forces also feared the decentralization of the economy 
and some political affairs had increased public discontent the 
sources reported 
farmers demanding land reform marched in ho chi minh city last 
year it was the first known street demonstrations under communist 
rule 
students have held campus protests of poor conditions at the 
universities 
hundreds of people protested at the city hall demanding 
repayment of money they invested in a perfume company that used 
liberalized rules to create a pyramid scheme 
smuggling corruption and crime have become major issues 
authorities decided the presence of foreigners would complicate 
matters and tightened visa rules in late april a vietnamese 
official said privately 
western businessmen said officials who once pleaded for 
investment had slowed things down and were preoccupied with 
ideological matters 
in interviews with the associated press authorities said there 
were no mass arrests 
no more than 10 vietnamese were arrested with businessman mike 
morrow one of the americans deported said nguyen son vice 
chairman of the information and ideological department in ho chi 
minh city 
gen tran cong man vice president of the vietnamese journalists 
association said there have been no mass arrests but many 
people were warned 
morrow said his interrogators were convinced he was a spy and 
that the united states was trying to create a tiananmen in 
vietnam a reference to the beijing prodemocracy demonstrations 
crushed a year ago 
the american who was held for three weeks before deportation 
said those arrested with him included do trung hieu a respected 
intellectual who belongs to the communist party 
miriam hershberger an american teacher in the capital hanoi 
was deported june 5 for allegedly trying to incite student unrest 
both americans were considered sympathetic to the government as 
was chan tin one of two catholic priests detained in may and 
accused of preaching anticommunism like hieu he was a leader of 
wartime opposition to the usbacked government of south vietnam 
the club of former resistance fighters is made up of southern 
war heroes and revolutionaries who criticize the partys postwar 
performance but have not questioned its leading role 
in march the clubs two leaders were expelled apparently on 
orders from the authorities a source reported he said the club 
approved a resolution in january criticizing the government and 
demanding more political reform 
nguyen son the ho chi minh city party official denied the 
report he said the clubs executive board expelled the leaders 
after they wrote and distributed documents calling for protests 
against the government 
son said one of the men ta ba tang was under temporary 
detention and the other nguyen ho was at home he did not make 
clear whether ho was under restrictions 
a british journalist who reported the clubs actions after 
interviewing tang and other members was detained briefly and 
several of his vietnamese contacts were reported arrested

when soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
came to the united states and urged business leaders to invest in 
his country it was music to my ears said reynolds metals 
cos william o bourke 
were already where hes telling them they ought to be 
bourke said that ship has sailed 
more precisely the ship is a sled gliding across icy siberia 
where the richmondbased reynolds is a partner in a planned 200 
million aluminum foil manufacturing plant that could make reynolds 
wrap a household name in eastern europe 
the political changes that are shaking up the soviet bloc are 
creating vast business opportunities for american companies said 
bourke reynolds 63yearold chairman and chief executive officer 
but when bourke first came to reynolds in 1981 the company 
would have been hardpressed to jump at such a chance 
we went through the most painful experience a company can go 
through and thats one of shrinking hunkering down laying off a 
lot of people bourke said im sure it was in the minds of a 
lot of our young people as to whether or not there was any future 
in our industry or in our company 
a decade ago bourke asked himself similar questions passed over 
for the presidency of ford motor co he retired in 1980 to his 
albemarle county farm 
he tried to adjust as executive vice president of fords north 
american operations he had supervised 280000 employees as a 
farmer he directed a 120acre cattle and orchard operation with no 
one but a farm manager to take orders 
but after about 18 months reynolds chairman david p reynolds 
called me out of the blue one day and invited me to lunch 
bourke thought reynolds was going to offer him a seat on the 
companys board of directors 
i had no idea he was going to offer me a job he said 
reynolds who was 67 at the time wanted bourke to become 
executive vice president for operations thatll get your feet 
wet in a hell of a hurry he told bourke 
bourke drove back to his farm about an hour west of richmond in 
the foothills of the blue ridge mountains to talk to his wife 
elizabeth she advised him to take the job because youre getting 
to be a real pain around here the chainsmoking bourke recalled 
her saying 
bourke came aboard in october 1981 at a time when the company 
had a staggering debt load and periodically was shaken by surges in 
aluminum prices and demand in 1982 reynolds reported a 24 
million loss 
bourke set out to cut costs and pay off the debt a streamlining 
that meant hundreds of job losses 
thats a very painful difficult process and it went on here 
about 3 years he said 
he remembered going to a dinner party one night and being told 
youre probably the most hated man in richmond right now 
well thats difficult to hear bourke said i said im 
trying to save a company the people who are still with the company 
im sure will see the day when theyre thankful that weve done 
what weve done 
after the debt and operating costs were brought under control 
bourke elevated to chief executive officer in 1986 and chairman 
in 1988 looked to improve efficiency by upgrading operations with 
the latest technology he also looked at acquisitions to complement 
reynolds main consumer product the foodpackaging reynolds wrap 
aluminum foil 
he settled among other buys on presto products a maker of 
inhouse grocery store brands of plastic food wraps 
last year reynolds set a record 6 billion in revenue and 533 
million in earnings revenue has increased more than 50 percent 
over the past two years 
construction of the siberian manufacturing plant which will 
have a capacity of 47000 tons of foil a year is expected to begin 
next spring 
although reynolds will hold only a 135 percent stake in the 
plant it will supply the engineering and technical expertise to 
the six soviet organizations that will own 70 percent 
the joint venture should help give reynolds a competitive edge 
in eastern europe which has been steadily opening its doors to 
western goods amid striking political changes 
reynolds is also trying to boost industrial sales of aluminum 
primarily in automobiles 
once an auto industry insider bourke is critical of us 
carmakers for being slow to develop engines that use lightweight 
aluminum parts but he said the loss of cheap and plentiful 
gasoline along with competition from abroad have been generating 
big scale orders from detroit 
louis hannen a securities analyst who follows reynolds for 
wheat first securities inc in richmond said bourke has done a 
masterful job in turning around the company while boosting 
reynolds consumer line bourke lowered ingot production costs 
hannen said and now they can compete 
bourke said his objective is to make reynolds as good as or 
better than anybody else in everything we do 
finishing that objective will take about 10 more years and it 
will fall to his successors to complete the task bourke plans to 
retire in april 1992 
ive often said to our people that my legacy will be written 
after i leave not while im here bourke said just look at 
reynolds metals and how it performs through the balance of the 
90s then you can tell me whether i did a good job or not

a slump in us oil prices to twoyear lows has surprised 
analysts by its severity but they contend the weakness is only a 
shortterm blip and wont lead to much lower gasoline prices 
tuesdays close at 1565 for a 42gallon barrel of west texas 
intermediate crude oil is much lower than i thought it would 
go said maureen allyn chief economist at scudder stevens amp 
clark inc in new york 
but ms allyn and other analysts dont see a repeat of the oil 
market crash of the mid 1980s which saw prices drop below 10 a 
barrel most analysts are sticking with forecasts that predict the 
price of wti the benchmark us grade will average around 18 a 
barrel this year 
wti for july delivery lost 29 cents in tuesdays trading on the 
new york mercantile exchange and has fallen 193 in the last week 
the price hit a fouryear high at 2368 on jan 3 but has lost 
ground pretty steadily because of heavy production by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the posted price what refiners will pay for oil on the spot 
market has fallen from as high as 21 a barrel in early january to 
as low as 15 
we would have thought that it would not have fallen as far as 
it did said david lee smith energy analyst at eppler guerin 
and turner inc in dallas because of the slippage smith has 
dropped his estimate for the 1990 average price from about 19 a 
barrel to 18 
kent hance chairman of the energy industryregulating texas 
railroad commission predicted the price will slip to 15 a barrel 
by next months scheduled opec meeting 
thats not all bad news for us said hance opec does not 
do a good job in their meetings unless their backs are up against 
the wall 
i still stay by my prediction of 24 to 25abarrel oil 
within the next 24 months he said 
the cartel has said it wants world oil prices around 18 a 
barrel but members have flouted their own production limits 
designed to keep prices firm 
last week opec president sadek boussena warned that oil prices 
would collapse unless cartel members adhered to a may agreement 
limiting production to between 221 million and 226 million 
barrels of oil a day 
estimates of opec production generally range above 23 million 
barrels daily with several group members believed to be exceeding 
their quotas 
production also has been strong among some nonopec countries 
such as norway which announced over the weekend it would increase 
its output 
that will add production to the worldwide supply but were 
seeing lower production from the united states lower production 
from the soviet union so i think that the slide in oil prices is a 
shortterm event said john hilton analyst for argus research in 
new york 
hilton said he is holding by his prediction of 1850 for this 
years average but continued deterioration could change that 
outlook 
ms allyn said there is little to indicate a longterm price 
decline failure to invest in finding new reserves during the last 
decade when oil prices were weak means declining supply and 
rising prices she said 
in terms of the real things that will drive oil prices over 
the next three to five years as a consumer i would feel no sense 
of security she said 
you cant bring new stuff on properly at these prices theres 
no incentive 
while the price has fallen much lower than she expected ms 
allyn said she did not anticipate the slump would last long enough 
to change her forecast of a 1990 average price of about 18 
reaching about 20 next year 
hance said nonarab oil producers such as mexico and venezuela 
have been using oil earnings to prop up otherwise struggling 
economies and have done little to replace oil 
the result is going to be that were gong to see dramatic 
declines in supply by 1993 he said 
hilton said the most recent drop could translate into retail 
savings of about 4 cents per gallon of gasoline but ms allyn 
doubted the price cut would find its way to the pump 
trilby lundberg publisher of the lundberg survey in california 
said demand for gasoline in the prime summer driving season also 
should keep prices from falling much further

oil gushers continue to erupt in south texass pearsall field 
where horizontal drilling has turned a playedout area into a 
oilmans playground 
the newest discovery was announced tuesday by winn exploration 
co inc which said its latest well tested at a potential of 
19568 barrels of oil a day the average texas well produces just 
10 barrels a day 
the well is the second in three weeks to come in at startling 
numbers higher than any well recorded in the last 50 years of 
recordkeeping at the texas railroad commission meridian oil inc 
said on may 29 it had a well with a potential of 12254 barrels a 
day 
although far short of the 100000barrel spindletop gusher that 
started the texas oil industry in 1901 and the 200000barrel yates 
field finds in west texas in 1926 the latest wells are far above 
recent average finds 
recent wells are considered good producers at 100 to 200 barrels 
a day said kent hance chairman of the railroad commission which 
regulates the states petroleum industry 
the wells are in the austin chalk formation of south texas 
pearsall field whose fickle nature earned it the name heartbreak 
field 
all that changed last year when oryx energy co showed that 
horizontal drilling could produce high rates of success 
although oryx has drilled the most wells winn has had the best 
results 
in november winn drilled a well with a 5472barrel potential 
in december the company added one at 3600 barrels last week 
another started producing with a daily potential of 5388 barrels 
thats not too shabby said michael calley winn 
explorations vice president and general manager 
all the wells have been on the same 8891acre lease in zavala 
county about 60 miles southwest of san antonio 
wildcat oilman charlie winn said his latest find has produced 
35078 barrels of oil 
the state eventually will limit the wells output to about 1400 
barrels a day hance said other winn wells are easily meeting 
their allowables of about 1300 barrels a day he said 
with the allowable being less that well should produce a long 
time hance said 
texas has about 200000 wells producing between 100 barrels and 
200 barrels a day 
the austin chalk contains oil in vertical fractures narrowing 
the chance a traditional vertical well would strike crude with 
horizontal drilling wells take a 90degree turn a mile or more 
underground allowing the wells to tap into more than one fracture 
and increasing the chance of success 
while the horizontal wells have produced startling initial flow 
rates experts are unsure how long such rates can be sustained 
my personal opinion is that its still too early to tell 
said winn explorations calley 
there are about 100 horizontal wells producing in the austin 
chalk said railroad commission spokesman gary garrison 
weve just scratched the surface in that field hance said 
its going to be very interesting

persistent speculation that italian automaker 
fiat spa may link up with chrysler corp has helped pump up the 
us companys stock price 
talk about possible takeover bids for or stake purchases in 
chrysler has been gaining steam as the countrys no 3 automaker 
battles with shrinking market share slumping earnings and 
defections of topranked executives 
chrysler stock rose 112 on tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange to close at 1662 a share the stock rose 37 cents on 
monday despite an overall decline in the market 
chrysler confirmed it was in discussions with fiat but declined 
to give details 
people are buying on speculation spokesman tom houston said 
the italian automaker declined to comment on the rumors 
although an official at the companys turin headquarters called the 
reports purely journalistic hypotheses 
a hookup with fiat could provide chrysler broader access to 
european markets already penetrated by ford motor co and general 
motors corp 
the planned dropping of trade barriers within the 12nation 
european community in 1992 will create the worlds largest single 
car market earnings from their european operations have helped 
ford and gm weather the slump in the us auto market 
chrysler sold its european operations to frances peugeot a 
decade ago when it was on the brink of bankruptcy but has begun to 
export to europe modestly in recent years 
a chryslerfiat association also could provide a doorway for 
fiat back into the us market which it left in 1983 but fiat 
first would have to convince skeptical american consumers that its 
cars are of much higher quality than when the company left the us 
market analysts said 
fiat is italys largest automaker with a 60 percent market 
share it was the ninthlargest automaker in the world in 1988 
according to the latest figures available from the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association in detroit chrysler ranked seventh 
the companies already are involved in some component deals and 
chrysler markets fiats alfa romeo cars in north america 
some analysts questioned what fiat would gain from a full merger 
with chrysler a company facing severe financial pressure and no 
allnew car models until 1992 
i could see an equity investment but under a traditional 
definition of a merger i just cant see it analyst john kirnan 
of kidder peabody amp co in new york 
some reports in europe have speculated fiat may be willing to 
purchase up to 40 percent of chrysler the us company has about 
4 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand but 
confidence in its financial situation has been shaken lately 
chrysler reported an 80 percent drop in first quarter profits to 
71 million last week standard amp poors corp downgraded chrysler 
debt securities to its lowest investmentgrade level 
analysts said it would be easier for fiat and chrysler to form 
joint ventures on a projectbyproject basis than for them to make 
an equity agreement 
crossshareholding would certainly cement an alliance said 
analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service inc in new 
york but you certainly dont need cooperation like that to make 
any individual project go 
last week chrysler and the french automaker renault canceled a 
joint project to build a small sportutility vehicle in europe 
chrysler said the project was no longer economically attractive but 
said it would consider seeking another european partner 
chrysler also needs a subcompact to sell in the united states 
it stopped making its dodge omni and plymouth horizon in february 
company officials have said they are studying whether to design a 
new subcompact on their own or to associate with another automaker 
to build such a vehicle 
fiats relies heavily on small cars and there has been 
speculation about a possible tieup with chrysler to build a 
version of its tipo hatchback 
there also has been speculation about a link with mitsubishi 
motor corp of japan of which chrysler owns 121 percent 
chrysler operations also have been dented by the recent 
departures of its vice chairman gerald greenwald and 
international operations vice president michael hammes two other 
top executives have announced plans to step down

northwest airlines is considering expanding 
by buying part or all of another carrier chairman alfred checchi 
said 
checchi has mentioned previously that northwest would consider 
expanding by making acquisitions but his remarks tuesday were more 
direct 
its fair to say we have our eyes open and maybe our mouths a 
little bit open as we see what opportunities are there checchi 
said when asked whether any talks were under way 
he declined to specify possible targets 
checchi made the remarks at a news conference to introduce 
frederick b rentschler as northwests new president and chief 
executive officer 
rentschler was president and chief executive officer of 
chicagobased beatrice co where for the past three years he has 
been busy dismembering that company after it was purchased for 61 
billion in 1986 by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
conagra inc announced june 7 that it would buy beatrices 
remainingg businesses for 134 billion 
checchi said northwest intends to grow as the industry continues 
to consolidate he said the number of domestic carriers has fallen 
to 85 from 255 at the start of airline deregulation in the late 
1970s 
we are seeing i think some tremendous possibilities to 
expand the company outside of internal growth checchi said 
this is an industry that is in the midst of substantial change 
and we like to think we have assembled an aggressive team that will 
be able to take advantage of some of the opportunities being 
presented in the marketplace to us 
pan am recently said it would put its northeast shuttle service 
up for sale and donald trump has indicated he would consider bids 
for the shuttle service he bought from eastern airlines last year 
checchi said cash flows at northwest have exceeded expectations 
since he and other investors completed their 365 billion takeover 
of the airline last august he also said the carrier is 
substantially ahead on its repayment of takeover debt

motorola has earned a temporary reprieve allowing 
it to continue selling its popular computer chip but analysts say 
continuing legal battles over patent rights could shake customers 
confidence 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on tuesday 
granted the company a temporary stay of a federal judges ruling 
that would have forced it to pull the chip from the market 
motorola spokesman tim kellogg said the court is a special appeals 
court for patents in washington 
earlier tuesday us district judge lucius bunton had banned 
the production and sale of motorolas mc68030 microprocessor and 
hitachi ltds h8532 microprocessor 
the two companies once partners have been embroiled in a 
longstanding patent infringement battle over the microprocessor 
the device that performs computations in a computer 
some analysts said buntons decision would pose greater problems 
for motorola its chip has sold better than hitachis in this 
country garnering 17 percent of the market for 32bit 
microprocessors according to one analysts estimate 
its certainly going to shake the confidence of companies that 
have been designing with motorolas microprocessor all along 
said alice leeper associate director for dataquest a market 
research company based in san jose calif 
people who were considering doing a design based around the 
030 would certainly be thinking twice and possibly looking at an 
alternative product said ms leeper 
apple computer inc is one of the companies that relies heavily 
on the 68030 using it in a number of its macintosh computers 
apple spokeswoman yolanda davis said before the appeals court 
stay was issued that she did not expect buntons decision to have a 
material impact on the companys inventory 
we are confident the two parties are working to resolve this 
issue said ms davis 
analyst jack quinn said the judges order would pressure hitachi 
and motorola to settle the case indeed motorola said it would 
continue negotiating with hitachi to reach a settlement 
the main motivation that motorola has for settling is not the 
immediate economic impact but the confidence that customers in 
general have in their semiconductor suppliers said quinn a 
senior analyst with instat a market research company in 
scottsdale ariz 
the injunction could cause companies to reconsider designing 
products around chips that can be supplied by only one company he 
said 
ive got to believe this matter is going to be settled i 
cant believe that motorola and hitachi would stand by and see 
apple devastated quinn said 
jerry solovy an attorney for hitachi said the stay would allow 
both companies to present arguments on buntons injunction to the 
appeals court 
motorola based in schaumburg ill said the stay would allow 
it to continue to supply customers until a verdict is reached on 
its appeal of buntons ruling

charles h keating jr says he believes a 
federal judge will return his bankrupt lincoln savings and loan 
association to him but he promises to fight any adverse decision 
as long as he is alive 
i think well get it back keating told reporters tuesday 
after lawyers for both sides summarized their arguments for us 
district judge stanley sporkin 
keating is suing to overturn the governments april 1989 seizure 
of the irvine calif thrift 
i dont know if it will work out for me but we have at 
least gotten a trial and america has gotten a trial he said 
however if sporkin grants the governments motion to dismiss 
the suit keating said well be fighting until the day im dead 
i have no intention of being raped by the us government 
sporkin has conducted 30 days of hearings over six months he 
has about 1000 documents and hundreds of pages of court 
transcripts to review and gave no indication when he would rule 
the judge could uphold the seizure find it invalid or order a 
full trial on the matter he also could fashion some other 
solution including putting the thrift under court administration 
i guess its up to me im going to ponder it a little bit 
sporkin a former enforcement director for the securities and 
exchange commission told a packed courtroom 
keatings attorney ronald fein suggested that a ruling in the 
governments favor risks unraveling the entire sampl bailout program 
he said potential buyers of rescued thrifts wont trust the 
government if what he called the arbitrary and capricious takeover 
of lincoln is allowed to stand 
if the private sector cant rely on the government to apply 
the law in good faith rational businessmen are just not going 
to invest their money in these kinds of institutions fein said 
the government maintains that keating arranged for lincoln to 
book false profits through land and stock deals the profits in 
turn were improperly funneled to keatings arizona holding 
company american continental corp via a taxsharing agreement 
said attorney james murphy representing the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision 
the agreement provided that american continental would pay 
lincolns taxes but 95 million was transferred to the holding 
company before the taxes were due and the company went bankrupt 
before it paid the taxes murphy said the transactions amounted to 
a series of unrepaid interestfree loans he said 
american continental in 1988 promised the bank board it would 
inject 10 million in capital into its sampl but used the 
taxsharing agreement and a series of complex transactions so that 
lincolns money got put into lincoln murphy said 
that he said amounted to a pure case of fraud 
murphy noted that lincolns failure perhaps the nations 
costliest thrift collapse will cost taxpayers in excess of 15 
billion the government already has pumped in 12 billion just 
to keep it afloat he said 
separately keating is the target of a federal grand jury probe 
in los angeles and a defendant in a 13 billion civil fraud suit 
filed in arizona by federal regulators 
his case has attracted great attention because of keatings 
involvement with five senators who met with regulators on his 
behalf after accepting political contributions 
the five are sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz donald w riegle dmich john glenn dohio and john

congressional tax advisers are proposing a 
simplified deduction for interest that would mean a smaller 
writeoff on many home mortgages 
on the other hand the recommendation by the staff of the joint 
committee on taxation could result in restoration of at least part 
of the consumerinterest deduction which will expire at years end 
a simplified interest deduction was the most significant 
provision in a package of proposals by the joint committee for 
removing some of the complexity from federal tax law 
the house ways and means committee which has launched a new 
simplification effort released the proposals tuesday along with 
some from the treasury department and others from the ways and 
means staff 
at the least we will have hearings on the proposals in the 
fall said a ways and means aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity those hearings will help determine whether the committee 
will try to write a simplification bill 
members of congress dont like to tamper with the deduction for 
home mortgage interest which generally is considered as close to a 
sacred cow as can be found in the tax law about 25 million 
taxpayers claim the deduction which will cost the treasury about 
30 billion in forgone taxes this year 
the staff of the joint committee on taxation concluded that 
present law with its different rules for mortgages investment 
interest and consumer interest is too complicated 
the staff suggested three ways to simplify the law two of which 
would water down the mortgage deduction 
the law allows a full deduction of interest on a loan of up to 
1 million used to acquire a principal or second home and on 
homeequity loans of up to 100000 investment interest is 
generally deductible up to the limit of income earned on 
investments after this year no consumer interest including 
automobile loans and credit cards can be deducted 
the tax committee staff proposed these alternatives for writing 
off interest 
combine all nonbusiness interest including that for 
mortgages consumer debt and investment borrowing and deduct a set 
percentage of the total perhaps 75 percent 
deduct interest equal to net income on investments plus some 
additional dollar amount 
retain the current law for mortgage interest and allow a 
separate writeoff for other interest limited to net investment 
income the portion of other interest that could not be deducted in 
the first year because of the limitation could be carried over into 
future years 
the joint committee staff said any of the recommendations would 
minimize complexity of present law in addition the first option 
would remove the incentive for individuals to structure loans as 
homeequity debt in order to avoid the presentlaw limit on the 
deductibility of personal interest its report said

opec president sadek boussena is 
expected in saudi arabia sunday for consultations on overproduction 
by cartel member states amid fears of an oil price crash official 
sources said wednesday 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said 
that boussena will be arriving in the saudi summer capital of 
jiddah from iran as part of a tour of opec member states to seek 
action to help stabilize erratic oil prices 
ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries agreed in may to slash opec output by 14 million barrels 
per day to restore the cartels overall production to 22 million 
barrels in support of the 18abarrel reference price 
saudi arabia the dominant party in the cartel and also one of 
the member states that had been overproducing has cut back its 
excess output but other violators have not done so and oil prices 
have been sagging they are presently fluctuating in the range of 
15 a barrel 
boussena recently warned of an oil price crash if all opec 
members did not adhere to their individual production quotas the 
saudi monarch king fahd has also urged other opec members to 
adhere to their quotas in the interest of all 
a stream of editorials in the progovernment saudi media have 
since been lashing out at the production cheaters with the latest 
in the leading alriyadh warning that the resulting flooding of 
the market is creating chaos and an imbalance that will lead to 
a price crash 
none of the overproducers have been named by either the king or 
the papers united arab emirates oil minister mana saeed otaiba on 
a recent visit to the kingdom has been pledging commitment but the 
uae on principle insists on producing at a selfimposed quota 
almost double the 1095 million barrel per day which opec has 
prescribed for it 
fahd has also said in a recent press interview that he saw the 
time ripe for a longterm agreement that would ensure a high 
degree of stability for opec and the world economy 
the saudi kings statements have been followed by renewed talk 
in some opec capitals particularly kuwait of the 2yearold 
proposal by venezuelan president carlos andres perez for an opec 
summit to discuss a fresh longterm policy for the cartel amid a 
developing upsurge in world demand for opec oil 
the sources said the oil ministers of saudi arabia kuwait 
united arab emirates qatar oman and bahrain members of the 
sixnation gulf cooperation council alliance will be meeting in 
jiddah next week to discuss various developments related to the oil 
situation 
the meeting would be held once boussena had completed his trip 
through the gulf region the sources said

a swellingdoor problem on general motors corps 
new saturn model has been fixed and the first marketable car should 
roll off a tennessee assembly line later this summer a saturn 
spokeswoman said today 
the detroit free press reported today that the problem would 
delay the scheduled start of production at the plant in spring 
hill tenn but spokeswoman laurie kay denied that this morning 
we had a preproduction problem with the door material that 
already has been corrected she said 
gm chairman roger smith said as recently as may 25 that he still 
was counting on driving the first production model of the saturn 
car off the assembly line before he retires july 31 
our plans still anticipate that would occur prior to his 
retirement kay said today adding however he has told us 
that he will not drive the car until the saturn team has told him 
that the vehicles highquality standards have been met 
the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that its 
possible that the car wont be ready before july 31 
smiths 9year tenure as gm chairman has been marked by 
controversy and declining market share a success with saturn would 
reinvigorate his claim for longterm automotive greatness 
saturn is a 3billion gm project aimed at marketing a car to 
sell for less than 12000 targeted specifically for importcar 
owners or likely import buyers 
much of the technology going into building the car is new to the 
auto industry including the injection molding process for making 
large body parts including the doors 
kay acknowledged that testing showed doors expanded under high 
temperatures but she declined to give any details the free press 
said the swelling was so bad that doors wouldnt close 
she said the problem stemmed from the material used in making 
the doors rather than the injection molding process which has been 
used in the past for parts no larger than bumpers 
saturn is not experiencing any more preproduction problems 
than normally encountered with the startup of an allnew vehicle 
kay said 
saturn is due to arrive in dealer showrooms on schedule this 
fall she said the free press quoted a source as saying its 
going to be a photo finish theres no doubt in my mind

a federal judge has ruled that thousands 
of decendants of an early texas resident have no claim to a share 
of the spindletop oilfield fortune or the estimated 200 billion 
worth of oil pumped from it since the lucas gusher spurted in 1901 
us district judge howell cobbs ruling came in the latest of a 
long series of lawsuits brought by wouldbe heirs against oil 
companies 
it was a summary judgment in favor of amoco production inc 
mobil oil corp phillips petroleum co texaco inc and chevron 
inc in a suit filed by four relatives who claimed kinship to 
pelham humphries and asked for 200 billion in oil gas and mineral 
rights from the companies 
the suit was filed in february in tennessee by the four 
relatives who sought to have their case declared a class action 
suit on behalf of numerous other heirs the case was transferred to 
beaumont 
this court desperately desires that the ghost of pelham 
humphries will no longer haunt the halls of the united states court 
system cobb wrote in his opinion the pelham humphries 
litigation is over requiescat in pace rest in peace 
brown peregoy a tennessee resident representing 3000 members 
of the humphries heirs trust association contended pelham 
humphries received a grant to the spindletop property from the 
mexican government in 1835 and left no will 
the judge said in his ruling however that humphries conveyed 
the grant to william inglish whose heirs conveyed it to william 
mcfaddin in 1883 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals held in favor of the oil 
companies in a trilogy of humphries claims litigated in the 1950s 
and 1960s the appellate court last ruled on a humphries suit in 
1968 and found the humphries heirs have no title in the league 
of land cobb said 
the judge will hold hearings later to determine if he will order 
the plaintiffs to pay legal fees for the defendants because of 
claim by the defendants that the suit was brought on which issues 
which have been tried before 
lawyer max wilson said he believes his clients have a legitimate 
claim 
we knew we had an uphill battle wilson said we took a 
long look at it and really felt like we had an inside chance of 
doing something with this thing 
peregoy 52 a retired pipe superintendent who devoted nine 
years to researching the suit said thousands of wouldbe heirs 
want their day in court 
we feel like its unconstitutional that these people have not 
had their say he said

the toyotas on american roads and the sonys 
in american rec rooms may soon be joined by fujis in american 
lunchboxes a japanesebred apple that seems to be the fruit of 
the future 
growers say japanese bud wood grafted onto trees in the central 
washington apple belt produces an apple that is crisper tastier 
and more durable than red delicious the industry standard since 
the 1920s 
the fujis also are bringing much higher wholesale prices not a 
minor consideration after three consecutive years of poor prices 
that have caused many growers to reassess the heartshaped red 
delicious 
there will be more change in the apple industry in the state 
of washington in the next 10 years than in the last 30 said 
brooke peterson a washington state university tree fruit extension 
agent in yakima county 
he likened washington apple growers who produce 60 percent of 
the nations crop to us automakers who were so big and so 
successful for so long that they failed to respond to the 
japanese challenge 
all of a sudden they are nipping us in the heels he said 
as a result growers must produce a better and more diversified 
product he said currently 70 percent of washingtons apple crop 
is red delicious 
were in a revolution in supplying the public with an apple 
more satisfactory to their needs said grady auvil a legendary 
grower from orondo who pioneered washington production of the tangy 
granny smith a decade ago 
auvil 84 and still out in his columbia river orchard every day 
is planting only fujis on his 500 acres now 
twenty to 30 percent of the time the red delicious arrives to 
consumers in poor condition auvil said 
the fuji first bred in japan 35 years ago has a longer shelf 
life and shrivels on the outside before it softens inside auvil 
said too often consumers complain of biting into a goodlooking 
red delicious that is mealy 
tastes in apples change just as tastes in clothing music or 
other products change some growers say where consumers once 
clamored for bright red colors and the heart shape now they are 
demanding better taste 
the oblongshaped fuji has dull red stripes over a 
greenishyellow base 
red delicious apples cover more than 120000 of the states 
160000 acres of apple orchards trees take several years to bear 
fruit so it will be some time before a flood of fujis hits 
supermarkets said chuck st john a spokesman for the washington 
apple commission 
he also said it is much too early to write off the red 
delicious it is not an inherently bad apple otherwise consumers 
wouldnt buy it he said we can grow red delicious and golden 
delicious better than they can be grown almost anyplace else in the 
world 
the red delicious first was produced in a midwest orchard in 
1870 and was transported to washington soon after by 1915 the 
state was the nations leading apple producer 
but growers are struggling two seasons ago the crop was 
severely damaged by excessive heat and last years sales and 
prices were hurt by the alar scare this year the record crop of 
78 million 42pound boxes of eating apples has been bringing prices 
beneath the cost of production 
where boxes of red delicious sell for about 10 per box 
wholesale fujis sell for up to 40 said jeff main of the market 
news service in yakima 
market news service does not officially record fuji prices 
because there are so few available he said but it is likely that 
will change in the next three or four years he said 
the fuji craze is reminiscent of the rush to plant granny smiths 
a decade ago that tart apple now accounts for 55 percent of the 
states crop 
when granny smiths debuted they too brought much higher 
prices now they are bringing about 15 per box still better than 
red delicious 
auvil predicts red delicious will go the way of the winesap in 
the next 30 years and will be replaced by the fuji 
it is the one sweet apple you can always deliver with good 
quality if it starts the trip in good quality he said

telecommunications inc has proposed a union with 
nbctv that would make the cable giant a national network affiliate 
and allow it to deliver nbc programming to communities that lack 
hometown channels 
this would serve the local issue more profoundly than any 
other business arrangement we can think of tci vice president 
robert thomson said tuesday 
nationwide there might be thousands of small towns served by 
tci that if this were allowed we would have the economic power to 
have a hometown channel he said 
the network is evaulating the proposal nbc spokesman richard 
cutting said wednesday he had no further comment tci released the 
proposal tuesday 
under the proposal the denverbased tci would create a string 
of nbc stations in small communities that lack the money to become 
network affiliates 
the cable company would bracket nbc programming such as the 
cosby show and la law with locally produced news and 
sports shows where economically feasible john malone tci 
president said in a letter to nbc president robert wright 
in the letter malone said tci would comply with the same terms 
that an nbc affiliate must adhere to but would not require an 
affiliate fee from the network in exchange for the use of nbcs 
signal 
the firm also would continue to comply with federal 
communication commission regulations requiring that cable companies 
carry regional networks 
tci would earn revenues by selling local advertising time on nbc 
shows it also could add cable subscribers by offering a new local 
channel 
it would be a winwin situation local advertisers would have 
a local channel to advertise on local subscribers would have a 
channel that emphasized local news sports and current events 
thomson said and the local cable operator would hopefully have 
better penetration in that community 
a stumbling block to carrying out the proposal are network 
contracts that give existing nbc affiliates exclusive rights in 
regional broadcast markets 
thomson said tci approached nbc because of its 23 percent market 
share which leads all broadcast networks in contrast each of the 
most popular cable networks cnn and espn has a 2 percent share 
nbc a majority owner of the cnbc consumer cable channel is 
also participating in a proposed direct broadcast venture called 
sky cable that will beam more than 100 channels to owners of small 
home satellite dishes 
john redden an analyst with the connecticutbased moran amp 
associates inc said the proposal would open the local programming 
door to tci 
nbc would benefit because it would get its signal extended and 
become more entrenched in that community he said 
tci has about 85 million subscribers nationwide

pathe communications corps planned buyout 
of mgmunited artists may fall apart because a major backer says 
pathe cant rely on borrowed funds and must come up with millions 
in equity 
time warner inc is insisting that pathe must arrange 600 
million in equity 450 million of that itself toward the 12 
billion bid for mgmua following guidelines of an april financing 
agreement 
pathes ability to fund the acquisition is now in serious doubt 
and the company will almost certainly need an extension on a 
saturday deadline 
under the april agreement time warner would loan 650 million 
toward the purchase with pathe contributing the rest in return 
for the loan time warner would receive distribution rights to the 
huge united artists film library as well as future pathe and mgmua 
movies including rocky v 
pathe officials said earlier this month that most of its share 
of the cost would come from loans asset sales and possible resale 
of some mgmua stock 
though time warner officials initially seemed to approve of the 
plan they later feared that pathe was taking on too much debt 
money would come from companies affiliated with pathe said 
pathe spokesman craig parsons and therefore should not be called 
loans 
were paying the money back in shares of stock so this is 
not a loan in the conventional sense he said it could be 
considered equity 
parsons also said pathe had already put down 200 million in 
capital as a down payment

down the goodwill of one of torontobased campeaus us retail 
divisions federated department stores inc federated and its 
sister retailing company allied stores corp are operating under 
us bankruptcy court supervision

104 billion from its department stores supermarkets and real 
estate operations in the 12 months ended jan 31 1990 that 
compares with 87 billion for 1988

defer certain interest payments until next year the company has

grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in 
active trading wednesday on the chicago board of trade as crop 
damage concerns continued to guide the market 
trading of corn futures were particularly volatile as prices 
surged on reports of flooded fields in several key producing states 
the surge in prices ignited a selloff by professionals and 
commercial houses looking for profits said william biedermann an 
analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
the people who bought into the market on monday had more than 
a dime in profits biedermann said of the sellers thats a 
heck of a profit to make 
he said reports of extensive damage to crops in some areas of 
the midwest continue to cause concern on the market 
thousands of acres are reported under water in nebraska and 
heavy rains in iowa have reportedly damaged 340000 crop acres in 
that state 
analysts say the crops in some areas must be replanted 
soybean prices also were buoyed by concern that soybean yield 
could be adversely affected by heavy rains reports that farmers in 
south america were not marketing their bean crop in hopes for 
higher prices also helped boost soybean futures 
wheat futures were helped by strong export demand as well as 
indications of further yield reductions in the midwest soft red 
winter wheat crop due to excessive moisture 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 334 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
lower to 1 cent higher with july at 285 a bushel oats were

in the failure of republic bank for savings officials said

philip shunk faces a maximum penalty of 3 million in fines and 
up to 65 years in prison linda shunk faces up to 30 years in 
prison and a 125 million in fine 
todays indictment is further proof that we are determined to 
pursue allegations of financial fraud in the savings and loan 
industry until we have punished those who have profited illegally 
at the expense of the american taxpayer attorney general dick 
thornburg said in a statement 
federal regulators were appointed two years ago to take over 
republic which reportedly had a deficit of 123 million said 
us attorney george l phillips

and linda shunk was named executive vice president and chief 
financial officer both served on republics board of directors

general motors corp has fixed the problem of a 
swelling door on its new saturn model and the first marketable car 
should roll off a tennessee assembly line on schedule this summer 
the company said wednesday 
officials from gm and its wholly owned subsidiary saturn corp 
have refused to say exactly when job 1 will be assembled but 
gm chairman roger smith has said he expects to drive the first car 
off the assembly line before he retires july 31 
our plans still anticipate that would occur prior to his 
retirement saturn spokeswoman laurie kay said wednesday 
saturn is a 3 billion project to build a car with a base price 
of less than 12000 to compete directly with those made by 
japanese companies about twothirds of the project cost is tied up 
in the spring hill tenn manufacturing complex 
kay acknowledged the cars plastic door panels swelled in high 
temperatures a problem traced to materials she refused to 
disclose the severity of the swelling but said saturn remains on 
schedule 
saturn is not experiencing any more preproduction problems 
than normally encountered with the startup of an allnew vehicle 
kay said 
much of the saturn cars body panels will be made of plastics 
the panels will be formed in a process called injection molding 
which until now has been used in making automotive parts no larger 
than a bumper 
gm has said repeatedly it plans to begin commercial production 
this summer with the vehicles first arriving in dealerships this 
fall the automaker wont say exactly when production startup is 
scheduled at the factory south of nashville 
the company already has assembled some saturn cars to test 
manufacturing equipment and processes those cars which do not 
have vehicle identification numbers will be used in crash tests 
and other research and training programs

the white house and congressional democrats 
drawing their political swords for an electionyear battle are 
bluntly blaming each other for the multibilliondollar savings and 
loan scandal 
but president bush said today he wants to stay out of that 
debate 
what im trying to do is not respond to individuals and to 
simply keep moving forward on this process bush told a news 
conference in huntsville ala 
the white house went on the offensive tuesday daring democrats 
to try to turn the crisis into a campaign issue 
there are a lot of battles that can be fought on this turf 
and were ready white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
warned he said the democrats have a big role in the collapse 
of the savings and loan industry 
returning the fire democrats accused the white house of moving 
sluggishly against those who looted thrift institutions 
a spark seemed to be ignited there and i think more important 
than continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively 
with the congress in trying to get this mess solved bush said 
pointing to 10 years of republican rule in the white house sen 
tim wirth dcolo questioned who ran the government during 
this decade of mismanagement and negligence 
sen bob kerrey dneb who was singled out for attack by the 
white house called fitzwater the meanspirited little 
spokesman and accused him of trying to intimidate democrats into 
silence 
referring to another sensitive political issue sen david 
pryor dark said maybe mr fitzwater has been so busy the 
last two or three weeks protecting us from the flag burners that he 
forgot to do his homework on the history of the last decade 
in an apparent attempt to blunt criticism that his 
administration is not doing enough to prosecute sampl crime 
president bush is scheduled on friday to address the nations 93 
us attorneys attorney general dick thornburgh summoned the top 
federal prosecutors to the meeting at the justice department said 
spokesman dan eramian 
the charges and countercharges did not shed any new light on 
the sampl scandal but put it into sharp focus as a key issue for the 
fall elections 
estimates of how much it will cost taxpayers to clean up the 
industry range anywhere from 130 billion to 500 billion and more 
there were these other sampl developments tuesday 
rep frank annunzio dill demanded that federal regulators 
spell out their charges against president bushs son neil in the 
1 billion collapse of the silverado banking savings and loan 
association of denver 
the office of thrift supervision has brought administrative 
charges against neil bush a former director of silverado but has 
not publicly outlined its case no law or regulation prevents the 
agency from revealing the charges annunzio said at a hearing by 
the house banking committee neil bush has denied any wrongdoing 
charles h keating jr predicted that a federal judge will give 
him back his lincoln savings and loan association seized by the 
government in april 1989 in perhaps the nations costliest sampl 
collapse lawyers for keating and the government summarized final 
arguments in the case tuesday before us district judge stanley 
sporkin 
fitzwaters attack against democrats was notable both for the 
sharpness of his words and his willingness to point fingers 
take a look at jim wright and tony coelho and mr kerrey and 
some of his nebraska accounts and don riegle and deconcini take a 
look at all of them fitzwater said i dont think you hear any 
serious analysis of this problem that doesnt point to freddy st 
germain and the changes that were made in the banking laws back at 
that point 
wright the former house speaker and coelho the former house 
assistant democratic leader and a principal democratic fundraiser 
resigned last year amid questions of ethical impropriety 
riegle and deconcini are among five legislators being 
investigated by the senate ethics committee for allegedly 
intervening with federal regulators after accepting political 
contributions from keating 
fernand st germain was chairman of the house banking committee 
during the adoption of a bill cosponsored by sen jake garn 
rutah to overhaul the sampl industry fitzwater did not elaborate 
on his remarks about kerrey 
asked if he would say if republicans were at fault for the 
crisis fitzwater replied no he said neil bush was not 
involved in any sampl scandal 
on capitol hill pryor said congress fault was one of 
negligence in not requiring regulators in the last years of the 
reagan administration to take liedetector tests they simply 
were not telling us the truth the truth was that the sampl crisis 
was here it was happening and we were not being told the truth 
he said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas applauded fitzwater 
and said he hopes he keeps it up the president doesnt have to 
take it lying down just because some member of congress attacks 
dole said 
as for blame for the crisis dole said in the final analysis 
it lies everywhere

crude oil prices continued to slide wednesday 
remaining at levels not seen since late 1988 amid ongoing concerns 
about oversupply 
the futures price of west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil for july delivery tumbled 35 cents to 
settle at 1530 a 42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange other contract months also fell 
the last time crude traded in that range was in november 1988 
according to energy analysts 
the july contract had fallen 29 cents on tuesday and 68 cents 
monday 
market watchers said the drop was due partly to the fact that 
the july contract was set to expire on wednesday but they said 
continued concern about overproduction among the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries was also a big factor 
theres concern that opec is not willing to take steps to 
shore up the market said peter beutel an assistant director of 
the energy group at elders futures inc 
a report released late tuesday by the american petroleum 
institute also didnt help api said inventory levels of crude oil 
an important factor in pricing fell 12 million barrels last week 
to 3844 billion barrels 
but analysts said the drop was slight and therefore not enough 
to lift prices 
they the figures were not bad but they were not good enough 
to turn things around said beutel 
the drop in crude oil wednesday did help other protroleum 
products as traders used some of the proceeds from crude sales to 
buy unleaded gasoline or heating oil 
on the new york merc the july contract for wholesale unleaded 
gasoline settled up 055 cent to 6047 cents a gallon after 
tumbling 164 cents tuesday largely on profittaking 
wholesale home heating oil for july delivery settled 021 cent 
higher at 4764 cents a gallon on the exchange after losing 043 
cent on tuesday 
in natural gas trading the july contract closed at 1510 per 
1000 cubic feet down from 1536 tuesday

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co said wednesday it 
planned to recapitalize its rjr nabisco inc an indication the 
giant company will not be broken up and eventually will return to 
public ownership 
under the tentative plan kohlberg kravis would retire a large 
part of the 6 billion in junk bonds it used to buy the food and 
tobacco company in a record 2453 billion buyout last year 
kohlberg kravis also would issue preferred stock convertible 
into common stock in rjr nabisco 
by retiring some of its old junk bonds which have fallen in 
value during recent months kohlberg kravis would avoid having to 
pay a sharply higher interest rate on some of the securities next 
year 
the sale of stock under the plan also would counter any notions 
that kohlberg kravis plans to systematically dismantle rjr nabisco 
as it did after it bought the consumer products conglomerate 
beatrice co in 1985 
beatrice once owned such wellknown businesses as the avis car 
rental company tropicana juice products hunt and wesson foods 
samsonite luggage swift meats playtex personal products and 
culligan water softeners 
between its 61 billion acquisition of beatrice in 1985 and 
this month when the conglomerates remaining food operations were 
sold kohlberg kravis divested the company piece by piece 
some of the businesses fetched prices of over 1 billion 
kohlberg kravis and its investors ended up reaping a fat 50 percent 
return on their original equity investment 
rjr nabisco also has a variety of food lines and a separate 
tobacco business but analysts say that while beatrice was ripe for 
an unbundling of its disparate businesses rjr nabisco is not 
beatrice had this and that a lot of things that didnt make 
sense to have together anyway said jack maxwell an analyst who 
follows rjr nabisco for wheat first securities inc in richmond 
va 
rjr nabisco has product lines that conceivably could be pared 
but maxwell said he doubted kohlberg kravis would begin unloading 
food divisions and you cant sell bits and pieces of the tobacco 
business very well 
since its buyout rjr has divested 566 billion in assets to 
pare its debt load which now stands at 22 billion its del monte 
canned foods and fresh fruit businesses and some of its foreign 
holdings were among those sold 
but said maxwell theyve sold pretty much what they want to 
sell 
in its announcement wednesday rjr nabisco said kohlberg kravis 
would invest an additional 17 billion in the company as part of 
the recapitalization another move that points away from a breakup 
of the company 
analysts see rjr nabisco returning to public ownership 
beginning at some point in the next few years that is the route 
taken by another kohlberg kravis holding safeway stores inc 
after safeway went private in a 1986 leveraged buyout the 
supermarket company began hammering away at its debt and 
streamlined its operations this past february 3 years after the 
buyout the company announced a modest initial offering of 10 
million shares 
rjr nabisco said it was negotiating new loans with banks as part 
of the recapitalization plan the company said it expected to begin 
enacting the plan by the end of july 
the recapitalization is intended to take off the market some of 
rjr nabiscos junk bonds that have declined in value during recent 
months a buyback of the bonds would allow kohlberg kravis to 
sidestep provisions requiring the firm to guarantee the price of 
the bonds by next april 
the plan is likely to lower the return for kohlberg kravis and 
its investors but without a recapitalization rjr nabisco would 
end up paying a higher interest rate on the bonds 
rjr nabisco bonds rose sharply wednesday on word of the 
recapitalization gaining as much as 625 per 100 in face value 
kohlberg kravis investors mostly are large pension funds that 
generally do not have an active voice in the management of the 
companies they own including rjr nabisco officials of several 
funds declined to comment on what theyd like to see happen to rjr 
nabisco 
but several said they were satisfied with the management of 
their investments 
david weig executive director of the washington state 
investment board said he was absolutely happy with the 
management at rjr nabisco and with kohlberg kravis 
oregon state pension officials also said they were happy we 
have had excellent returns from these kinds of investments said 
sheryl wilson executive director of the states retirement funds

energy futures prices were mixed in trading wednesday on the new 
york mercantile exchange as crude oil futures continued their 
plunge in a market plagued by oversupply 
on other markets grain and soybean prices were mixed precious 
metals were higher copper declined and livestock and pork futures 
were mixed 
heavy selling of the expiring july contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil weighed on the 
energy market analysts said 
however gasoline and heating oil prices rose 
the decline in crude prices came in the wake of american 
petroleum institute figures out tuesday showing us crude 
inventories last week declined by 12 million barrels to 3844 
million but despite the decline crude stocks remain 443 million 
barrels above last years level analysts said 
gasoline stocks declined to 2166 million barrels from 217 
million 
there is too much pumped crude for the refineries to handle 
said james fiedler an analyst with ed amp f man international 
futures inc in new york 
it stocks didnt build overnight and it will take time for 
the refineries to work through it 
there was some uncertainty in the market due to a shakeup in the 
kuwaiti government that resulted in the removal of longtime oil 
minister sheikh ali khalifa alsabah 
named as oil minister was rashid salim alameeri sheikh ali 
khalifa was named finance minister 
west texas intermediate crude settled 35 cents lower to 14 cents 
higher with the july contract at 1530 a pound heating oil was 
03 cent to 21 cent higher with july at 4764 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 05 cent lower to 61 cent higher with july 
at 6047 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the chicago board 
of trade as crop damage concerns continued to guide the market 
trading of corn futures were particularly volatile as prices 
surged on reports of flooded fields in several key producing states 
the surge in prices ignited a selloff by professionals and 
commercial houses looking for profits said william biedermann an 
analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
the people who bought into the market on monday had more than 
a dime in profits biedermann said of the sellers thats a 
heck of a profit to make 
thousands of acres are reported under water in nebraska and 
heavy rains in iowa have reportedly damaged 340000 crop acres in 
that state 
analysts say the crops in some areas must be replanted 
soybean prices also were buoyed by concern that soybean yield 
could be adversely affected by heavy rains reports that farmers in 
south america were not marketing their bean crop in hopes for 
higher prices also helped boost soybean futures 
wheat futures were helped by strong export demand as well as 
indications of further yield reductions in the midwest soft red 
winter wheat crop due to excessive moisture 
wheat was unchanged to 3 cents higher with july at 334 a 
bushel corn was a 2 cent lower to 1 cent higher with july at 
285 a bushel oats were a cent to 1 cent lower wtih july at 
140 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with july 
at 598 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
cattle futures were lower on concerns the fed cattle supplies 
will increase during the summer and reduce cash prices 
pork futures were higher on perceptions that the recent drops in 
prices were overdone 
live cattle were 18 cent to 70 cent lower with june at 7665 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 07 cent to 52 cent lower with 
august at 8530 cents a pound hogs were 25 cent lower to 33 cent 
higher with june at 6050 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
130 cents lower to 70 cent higher with july at 6340 cents a 
pound 
precious metals futures climbed on the new yorks commodity 
exchange although there was little news to stimulate the market 
analysts said 
gold was 1 to 140 higher with june at 35050 a troy ounce 
silver was 14 cents to 17 cents higher wtih june at 4832 a troy 
ounce 
copper futures declined sharply on the comex on the perception 
that recent price gains were overdone 
also weighing on copper prices was a report from the federal 
reserve bank that points to a slowdown in the us economy and a 
decline in construction increased stocks in comex and london 
metals exchangeapproved warehouses also helped push prices lower 
copper prices were 185 cents to 415 cents lower with june at

in washington on friday said thornburgh offered impressive 
numbers on the sampl fraud cases being pursued adding i expect 
well see plenty more

and see that they are you know brought to responsibility for what 
theyve done he said 
meanwhile the house voted 4201 wednesday to provide the

arizona and bob kerrey of nebraska former house speaker jim wright 
of texas former rep tony coelho of california and former house 
banking committee chairman fernand j st germain of rhode island 
what he fitzwater did was appropriate bush said but 
what im trying to do is not respond to individuals and to simply 
keep moving forward on this process 
bush conceded that a spark seemed to be ignited there by 
fitzwaters remarks but added i think more important than 
continuing to pour fuel on the spark is to work cooperatively with 
the congress in trying to get this mess solved 
democratic criticism of bushs management of the sampl bailout has 
been growing since last month when the administration said 
congress would have to provide a second bailout of 30 billion to 
50 billion later this year 
meanwhile an organization affiliated with consumer activist 
ralph nader issued a report criticizing the administrations 
anemic efforts to prosecute sampl fraud 
the report by public citizens congress watch estimated that 
the governments civil and criminal actions have recovered only 
300 million in sampl losses thats less than 2 percent of the 163 
billion in losses attributed to fraud among the 440 sampls seized by 
the government since early last year the group said 
the bush administrations efforts to pursue and punish sampl 
fraud have been anemic at best irresponsible at worst said 
sherry ettleson an attorney who prepared a 23page report on the 
issue for the group 
the nader organization faulted the administration for spending 
only an additional 50 million on pursuing thrift crime when 
congress had authorized spending of up to 75 million the 
administration has responded that congress eventually appropriated 
only 50 million and officials are spending that amount 
it said the justice department is pursuing 891 cases actively 
compared with a backlog of 6993 cases yet the department has 
added fewer than half the 425 additional agents requested by the 
fbi and only 118 of the 231 assistant us attorneys requested by 
the departments field offices the report said 
based on the record thus far there is little evidence that 
the bush administration is committed to catching and punishing 
whitecollar criminals who largely caused the worst financial 
scandal in us history ettleson wrote 
the group recommended that the administration spend more on 
pursuing fraud turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who 
aided sampl executives in committing fraud and drop its support of 
proposed legislation that would remove the threat of triple damages 
from civil racketeering suits 
it said congress should enact legislation that would permit 
whistleblowers to bring suit against alleged sampl criminals on 
behalf of the government and share in the damages if fraud is found 
to have occurred

the sale of one of the remaining four will be announced by the 
end of the month usx said it is taking the other three off the 
market the four packages are in eastern texas western texas 
oklahoma and california

them said greg drahuschak of butcher amp singer in pittsburgh 
if you sell your house but no one at the party meets your 
price tag theres a point where you say no im just not

bills that would crack down on penny stock 
fraud and increase the authority of the securities and exchange 
commission to seek fines and halt alleged wrongdoing cleared a 
house panel wednesday 
the penny stock reform act and the securities law enforcement 
remedies act passed a subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee by voice vote and now are subject to consideration by the 
full committee 
the remedies act would give the sec the power to issue cease 
and desist orders against suspected wrongdoers without having to 
go to court first 
unlike many other federal regulatory agencies like the federal 
trade commission the sec does not have the authority to halt 
alleged illegal activity without a court order 
the penny stock bill would give the sec power to bar crooked 
promoters and consultants from selling highly speculative stocks 
which usually sell for a dollar or less 
penny stocks lowpriced and often risky securities are traded 
over the counter rather than on a stock exchange because most 
information about them comes from the brokers who sell them 
investments in penny stocks which typically are used to finance 
new or small companies are considered chancey at best 
penny stocks are not in themselves illegal but a 1989 study by 
the north american securities administrators association a 
washingtonbased organization of state investment regulators 
claimed that american investors lost about 2 billion a year in 
penny stock scams 
for most of the last decade the unscrupulous brokers and 
promoters in the penny stock market have preyed on unsuspecting 
investors in a cloudy atmosphere of regulatory neglect and public 
ignorance said rep edward j markey chairman of the finance 
and telecommunications subcommittee markey introduced the bill in 
april with the subcommittees ranking republican matthew j 
rinaldo of new jersey 
the version passed by the subcommittee differed from the 
original bill however which would have required all penny stocks 
to be listed on an automated stock price quotation system the 
amended version only requires the sec to facilitate at the 
earliest feasible time an automated quote system 
the new version also watered down original restrictions on 
socalled blank check investments which seek customers money 
without a specific business plan or purpose and blind pool 
penny stocks which seek mergers and acquisitions in a specific 
industry or line of business 
rather than an outright ban the amended version would require 
the sec to adopt rules calling for improved disclosure of 
information about companies selling penny stocks to the public

motorola inc plans to establish the 
first global satellitebased cellular phone system at a cost of up 
to 2 billion according to a report published wednesday 
the system would require the launching of a network of 
loworbiting satellites that would extend cellular services into 
remote areas of the united states and around the world the chicago 
tribune reported 
the system would be used by international travelers and 
residents of remote areas of the united states where it would not 
be economical to build landbased transmitters of cellular signals 
analysts said the systems cost could total 1 billion to 2 
billion 
telephone calls to motorola officials seeking comment were not 
returned wednesday motorola officials have scheduled a briefing on 
tuesday in new york to unveil the system 
industry sources say it would involve launching about 70 small 
satellites to carry telephone signals around the world and would 
be operating by the mid1990s approval by the federal 
communications commission would be required 
john pemberton an analyst with gartner group inc a research 
firm in stamford conn said the system would represent a major 
change in cellular communications technology 
pemberton said he believes motorola is planning a system that 
will use a groundbased and satellite system 
he said as the user moves from an area covered by the ground 
system to a more remote area the satellite system would take over 
without the user noticing any change in voice or data transmission 
quality 
the tribune reported that motorola is finalizing agreements with 
a number of companies capable of launching its satellites among 
them washington dcbased orbital sciences corp 
the company uses its pegasus rocket to launch small playloads 
into orbit from airplanes 
with the satellite system motorola would move into an area 
currently dominated by telephone companies 
pemberton said american telephone amp telegraph co is one company 
in particular that could be hurt by motorolas move 
he said motorola moved up an announcement of its plans for a 
satellite system from later this year to get a jump on competitors 
and to have it established as the standard for the industry 
reportedly other communications companies also are moving into 
global cellular telephone technology 
atampt reportedly has teamed up with washingtonbased geostar 
corp to develop a system similar to the one being planned by 
motorola 
the fcc already has licensed american mobile satellite corp to 
launch and operate a mobile communications system for the united 
states said ruth pritchardkelly a company spokeswoman 
officials of american mobile say the company has plans to launch 
its first satellite a geostationary unit in 1993 to provide voice 
and data communications to mobile telephone users in this country 
schaumburg illbased motorola is the worlds biggest supplier 
of cellular phone systems and mobile and portable phones 
pemberton said the companys system would stimulate sales of 
motorola cellular telephone equipment

a getty petroleum corp subsidiary and one of 
its executives were accused wednesday of conspiring with two 
customers to evade payment on 946000 in federal gasoline excise 
taxes 
getty terminals corp which distributes gasoline in the 
northeast and one of its managers william rea were named in the 
fourcount indictment returned by a federal grand jury in new york 
the justice department said the indictment was part of a 
continuing investigation into what officials called the evasion of 
an estimated 1 billion a year in federal fuel excise taxes by 
gasoline wholesalers 
the indictment charged that getty terminals and rea then the 
supply and trading manager conspired with the owners of two new 
york city gasoline wholesale distributorships to evade payment of 
the excise taxes 
john pabone owner of j amp j petroleum inc and john quock 
owner of tun yung oil corp were also accused in the indictment of 
participating in the scheme the two wholesalers are accused of 
agreeing to share in the proceeds of the unpaid taxes 
getty terminals and rea now a getty vice president were 
accused of filing false invoices to disguise the sales of 104 
million gallons of gasoline as taxfree transactions to evade 
payment of 946000 in excise gases 
tun yung had registered with the internal revenue service as a 
producer and was therefore eligible to purchase gasoline from getty 
terminals without paying excise taxes 
but getty and tun yung were required to pay excise taxes of 9 
cents for each gallon of gasoline sold to jampj according to the 
indictment 
the indictment charged that getty terminals had agreed to 
disguise sales to jampj as taxfree sales to tun yung 
getty terminals said in a statement that it collected and 
remitted all taxes it was required to collect 
getty terminals has absolutely no motive to refrain from 
collecting taxes inasmuch as all taxes collected are remitted to 
the irs in fact getty pays in excess of 200 million in taxes 
each year the statement said 
the company also defended rea saying it has the highest 
regard for his integrity honesty and competence the statement 
said he had volunteered for and passed a lie detector test 
if convicted getty terminals could be fined up to 2 million 
each of the three individuals could be sentenced to up to 20 years 
in prison and fined 1 million if convicted 
in a separate indictment returned by the same grand jury two 
brothers who own wholesale fuel companies in westchester county 
ny were charged with participating in a complicated scheme to 
purchase untaxed gasoline 
richard kennon and his brother robert kennon were charged with 
conspiracy to defraud the government and participating in the 
filing of false excise tax returns 
the kennons operate jenny oil corp oil city enterprises inc 
and mount vernon energy terminals inc the charges against each of 
the kennons carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and 
fines totaling 550000

ameritech and bell atlantic corp sought court 
permission wednesday to carry phone traffic to new zealand 
following their recent agreement to buy that countrys phone 
company for 24 billion 
the two regional phone companies which were spun off from the 
old bell system in 1984 are prohibited by a federal consent decree 
from carrying calls to or from the united states 
ameritech and bell atlantic said they were asking us district 
judge harold greene who oversaw the bell system breakup for a 
waiver from the consent decree provisions 
if greene does not grant their request the companies would have 
to form another company to carry the international traffic said 
hyde tucker president and chief executive officer of bell atlantic 
international 
he said it would cost millions to perform such a 
reorganization 
thomas p hester ameritech vice president and general counsel 
said he believed greene would grant the waiver 
similar relief was previously granted by the court to pacific 
telesis another of the bell companies subject to the decree when 
pacific purchased an interest in a foreign overseas cable 
venture hester said in a statement 
tucker said the ameritechbell atlantic request was less 
problematic because the new zealand company handles traffic jointly 
with us carriers and wont be competing with us companies 
us carriers compete among themselves at the us end and the 
new zealand telephone company does not seek authority to enter that 
competition tucker said it only asks authority to continue to 
carry its own end of the calls 
ameritech and bell atlantic announced june 14 that they and two 
new zealand companies fay richwhite holdings ltd and freightways 
holdings ltd will purchase new zealands stateowned phone 
system under the plan the two american companies will reduce 
their combined stake to 499 percent eventually but will remain as 
controlling shareholders

the slump in the defense industry hit the 
pentagons two biggest contractors again wednesday with mcdonnell 
douglas corp announcing plans for major layoffs and general 
dynamics corp getting its credit rating cut 
mcdonnell douglas the nations biggest defense contractor 
announced plans to eliminate at least 700 million a year from its 
cost structure including laying off a substantial number of 
its 127000 workers worldwide 
the hard reality is that we must begin immediately to take 
further strong actions to reduce our costs said john f 
mcdonnell chairman and chief executive 
mcdonnell said the costcutting plan should be in place by early 
august with immediate steps being taken on overtime travel new 
hiring consultants advertising and support activities 
we have done a lot to downsize the defense cutbacks including 
bringing aerospace work to st louis from long beach said 
company spokesman jim reed despite that were going to have to 
reduce our size to improve profitability 
officals declined to reveal the number of planned layoffs which 
will be made within the next few months st louis television 
stations quoted unnamed company sources as saying the cuts could be 
up to 10 percent of mcdonnell douglas workforce 
also on wednesday moodys investor services inc dropped its 
credit ratings two notches for general dynamics nations second 
biggest defense contractor 
both companies are headquartered in st louis 
moodys dropped general dynamics senior bonds from a2 to baa1 
and the companys subordinated debt from a3 to baa2 because of the 
sagging conditions in the defense industry 
the ratings put the companys bonds into the bottom category of 
investment grade issues 
general dynamics makes f16 fighter jets for the air force m1 
tanks for the army and ssn688 submarines for the navy it also 
owns cessna aircraft co and makes a launch rocket used to put 
satellites into orbit 
moodys said it believes that the manufacturers of defense 
platforms planes tanks submarines will be the most severely 
affected by reduced defense spending 
defense secretary dick cheney is proposing a 25 percent cut in 
the nations military spending wich would retire six active duty 
army divisions 111 navy ships and 11 air force tactical fighter 
wings 
fred pastore associate director of the high technology group at 
moodys said another reason for the credit rating downgrade was 
the companys decreased amount of readily available cash 
general dynamics spokesman pete connolly said the company was 
disappointed with the downgrade but he said we feel we have 
both a strong balance sheet and a strong balance of business which 
will sustain us through this period 
in new york industry analyst paul nisbet of prudentialbache 
said the mcdonnell douglas layoffs should not be regarded as a sign 
the company which has a hefty backlog of commercial aircraft 
orders is in trouble 
it would stand to reason with the likelihood of somewhat lower 
activity on several of their military programs said nisbet 
the companys probably going to have a 20 percent increase in 
sales next year primarily because of increase in commercial 
aircraft 
mcdonnell douglas which has 10 plants in the united states 
reported sales of 1458 billion last year compared with 144 
billion in 1988 
were projecting them at 162 billion this year over 18 
billion in 1991 and to 20 billion by 1992 nisbet said 
theyve got a wealth of business with over 50 billion in 
backlog 
the layoffs represent just a shift in business from what 
predominantly was a military market in the 80s to a predominantly 
commercial market in the 90s nisbet said theyre just having 
trouble digesting it 
douglas aircraft in long beach its production behind schedule 
on the c17 cargo plane has lost 306 million the past 15 months 
to trim its costs the company has begun cutting 7000 jobs mostly 
white collar at its plants in long beach and nearby torrance 
calif 
mcdonnell douglas programs that would be affected by cheneys 
proposed cuts include the harpoon and tomahawk missiles and the 
f15 and fa18 jet fighters employees were informed of layoffs on 
wednesday by closedcircuit television

hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated 
outside a giant lumber mill wednesday and 44 were arrested in a 
redwood summer protest of logging that they say endangers 
californias ancient forests 
about 350 protesters environmentalists and a sprinkling of labor 
union activists demonstrated at the coastal louisiana pacific mill 
as part of a summer of protests planned by the militant earth 
first environmental coalition 
about 250 miles to the southeast in the sierra nevada range a 
group of loggers was fired on wednesday by gunmen with 
semiautomatic rifles but no one was hit and authorities didnt 
draw a connection with the demonstration on the coast 
redwood summer organizers hope activists from around the country 
will converge on northern californias redwood country to protest 
logging of ancient trees in an environmentalists reprise of the 
1964 freedom summer civil rights demonstrations in mississippi 
they demand an end to what they say is excessive clearcut logging 
and cutting of virgin redwood trees 
mainstream environmental groups including the sierra club have 
shunned the plans and disavow the tactics of earth first followers 
of the looselyorganized group advocate what they call direct 
action to protect the environment including standing between 
loggers and trees 
the group renounced its old practice of driving spikes into tree 
trunks to make them useless as lumber after sawmill workers were 
hurt by the spikes 
wednesdays demonstration was the first in the redwood country 
of northern californias coast range though a previous redwood 
summer rally was held in sacramento 
the protest outside the plant 275 miles north of san francisco 
was largely peaceful except for namecalling between demonstrators 
and plant workers or passing drivers 
after several hours a contingent of protesters marched onto 
company property and approached officers in what they called a 
planned act of civil disobedience 
fortyfour of them were arrested most for trespassing said 
humboldt county deputy sheriff leona mendenhall most were issued 
citations and released 
as the demonstrators gathered at the mill gate and across the 
street on coastal sand dunes police said members of the greenpeace 
environmental group in a small boat tried to approach a louisiana 
pacific freighter that was being loaded at the companys dock 
authorities ordered the boat away according to a police 
dispatcher no arrests were reported 
at one point a dozen humboldt county sheriffs deputies were 
called out to head off a confrontation between the demonstrators 
and plant workers who staged a procompany rally during their 
lunch break there were heated exchanges of epithets 
duane plant a lumber worker who carried a sign urging a stop to 
environmental terrorists said louisiana pacifics logging 
practices were proper 
they scare me plant said of the radical environmentalists 
i am afraid of getting hurt i am afraid of my kids getting hurt 
i cant believe theyre not violent 
demonstrator david solnit 26 a carpenter from san francisco 
said logging practices must be changed 
weve got to save whats left of the forests solnit said 
they louisiana pacific officials are acting like outlaws and we 
need to take direct action 
in an apparently unrelated incident in the sierra county two or 
three people with semiautomatic rifles fired up to 300 rounds at a 
group of loggers wednesday said sheriffs dispatcher fred burns 
nobody was hurt and two people were arrested burns said adding 
that it appeared the gunmen were trying to scare the loggers rather 
than injure them 
i think with 300 rounds they could have hit someone if they 
wanted to burns said but thats a presumption 
fears of violence escalated in recent weeks after a bomb went 
off in a car carrying earth first leaders judy bari and darryl 
cherney earth first members say the two were targets of a bomber 
but police have booked bari and cherney on investigation of 
illegally transporting explosives 
on tuesday more than 100 earth first followers camped in the 
woods near remote honeydew a twohour drive south and spent most 
of the day huddled in nonviolence training sessions

pathe communications corp 
continues to negotiate financing for its 12 billion offer for 
mgmua communications co but seems unlikely to complete the deal 
by a saturday deadline 
mgmua officials were discussing extending the deadline for the 
20ashare tender offer spokesman scott tagliarino said 
wednesday he noted that pathe so far has fulfilled its obligations 
to mgmua including delivering 200 million in down payments 
pathe headed by italian financier giancarlo parretti has 
extended its offer several times past its original close date of 
april 30 
saturday is the latest possible deadline under the agreement 
between parretti and mgmuas controlling shareholder kirk 
kerkorian further extensions would require an allnew agreement 
tagliarino said 
pathes problems are with its chief backer time warner inc 
which has agreed to loan pathe 650 million of the purchase price 
time warner has insisted that the remaining 600 million must 
not come from borrowed funds and that pathe put up 450 million of 
that equity itself 
so far parrettis proposed patchwork of loans through european 
affiliates of pathe has failed to meet time warners criteria 
attorneys for both companies continued to negotiate wednesday 
even pathes 200 million in down payments were made with 
borrowed funds time warner spokeswoman marilyn harris said 
the 200 million is not equity its a loan ms harris said 
according to its agreement with pathe mgmua could pocket the 
200 million if the deal falls apart in return for issuing 10 
million new shares of common stock to parretti pathe also has 
guaranteed mgmua 75 million in fees for distributing pathe films 
in exchange for providing financing time warner would get a 
lien on the united artists movie library distribution rights to 
that library and distribution rights to future pathe and mgmua 
releases 
pathe spokesman craig parsons said discussions with time warner 
include whether the 200 million down payment is equity an even 
bigger issue is a proposed 368 million loan from parrettis 
luxembourgbased holding company comfinance sa which in turn 
was to raise the money from a variety of asset sales and borrowings 
pathe plans to repay comfinance in shares of stock thereby 
converting the loan to equity parsons said 
time warner also is concerned whether the loans and asset sales 
to finance the comfinance loan will materialize as billed 
for example in a security and exchange commission filing last 
week pathe said an affiliate would sell a 27 percent stake in a 
milan bank for 525 million to centro nord commissionaria a 
financial company however the financial times a british 
newspaper quoted centro nords president as saying no such deal 
had been agreed upon 
meanwhile wednesday parretti aides said he will battle a french 
decision to block his efforts to acquire all of pathe cinema a 
major french movie and tv producer with a 400film library and a 
chain of about 400 theaters pathe cinema is unrelated to pathe 
communications 
parretti asked the european community commission in brussels to 
overturn french finance minister pierre beregovoys decision to 
block the purchase of pathe cinema he said the decision was 
arbitrary and an abuse of power 
parretti already owns 48 percent of pathe cinema

a delaware court has ruled that the royal 
dutchshell group violated disclosure rules in its 57 billion 
buyout of minority shareholders in the former shell oil co five 
years ago 
the court of chancery in new castle county delaware ruled in 
favor of a group of minority shareholders who had sued over the 
terms of the buyout 
tuesdays ruling did not determine how much the former owners of 
15 million shares of shell stock should be awarded said houston 
attorney ken mcneil who represented the plaintiffs 
the judge asked both sides to submit recommendations on the 
award but did not set a date for a hearing on the matter 
the violation occurred because the defendant failed to 
disclose the existence of oil and gas reserves having a value of 
approximately 1 billion the court ruling said 
the class action lawsuit was filed by the former shell minority 
shareholders against shell petroleum inc the royal dutchshell 
subsidiary that bought out shell oils minority shareholders in 
june 1985 
the anglodutch oil giant had owned 694 percent of shell oil 
it initially offered 55 a share for the remainder raised the bid 
to 58 and finally agreed to pay an extra 2 a share to settle a 
lawsuit by some minority shareholders 
the delaware trial was limited to the issue of whether adequate 
disclosure was made in materials sent to the former shell 
stockholders advising them of their option to accept the royal 
dutchshell offer or seek an appraisal of the fair value of their 
shares mcneil said 
hr hutchins a spokesman for houstonbased shell said the 
company was disappointed with the courts decision 
the court based its decision on an inadvertent error which 
left out about 8 percent of the discounted future net cash flow 
from estimated oil and gas reserves hutchins said 
the discounted cash flow analysis is soft data because it is 
based on numerous assumptions and estimates in view of the 
voluminous information that was furnished to the shareholders we 
believe they could readily have made an informed decision with 
respect to the 1985 merger proposal 
in a separate proceeding the same delaware court is determining 
the appraisal value of the shell oil stock for former owners of 1 
million shares who rejected the 60ashare offer these former 
owners have claimed the shares were worth up to 110 each

two ancient greek coins fetching more than a 
half million dollars each were among the record breakers tuesday at 
an auction of the highly touted coin and antique collections of the 
onetime billionaire hunt brothers 
the auction also saw the rare ides of march coin struck by 
brutus to commemorate the assassination of julius caesar in 44 
bc sell for 99000 
the items sold tuesday the first in a series of hunt auctions 
brought a total of just over 20 million far more than the 
presale estimate of 12 million 
a greek vase painted with a battle scene sold for a record 176 
million 
the 18inch vase circa 510 bc is black with red figures 
painted on it depicting the death of kyknos in battle with 
hercules it was reconstructed from a fragment signed by 
euphronius one of the most important ancient greek artists said 
sothebys david redden an expert in the field 
the buyer was identified only as a european dealer 
two silver greek coins became the most expensive ever sold at 
auction 
the decadrachm of agrigentum dating from 410 bc sold for 
572000 followed by another decadrachm circa 465 bc for 
528000 
the second coin had held the previous auction record having 
fetched 272000 in 1974 
all prices include the auction houses 10 percent commission 
the first coin sold tuesday is one of eight known specimens of 
its kind sothebys said it shows an eagle and four horses being 
driven by sun god helios on one side and two eagles perched over a 
dead hare on the other 
the other has the head of the goddess athena on one side and an 
owl on the other 
nelson bunker and william herbert hunt heirs to an oil fortune 
lost more than 15 billion speculating in the silver market a 
decade ago 
the dallas businessmen emerged from bankruptcy court protection 
earlier this year under a reorganization plan that called for them 
to sell off their antique collections and some personal possessions 
the new york auction has attracted collectors from around the 
world and was one of several planned in the coming year involving 
the hunt estates 
r carter pate trustee in charge of liquidating nelson bunker 
hunts estate said before tuesdays auction that he expected all 
of the asset sales to raise between 20 and 25 million 
most of the money will go to the internal revenue service the 
largest creditor in the brothers bankruptcy cases 
this weeks sale likely will be the most spectacular of the 
auctions because of the strength of the collection he said
