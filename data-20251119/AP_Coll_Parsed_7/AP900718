a barge leaving an exxon refinery struck a 
docked barge wednesday and spilled about 37000 gallons of oil 
closing the spillplagued arthur kill waterway officials said 
at least half the oil escaped into the kill before booms could 
be set up said rick fulton a spokesman for the new jersey 
department of environmental protection 
the barge interstate 53 owned by maritrans operating partners 
lp of philadelphia was emptied by workers at the bayway refinery 
to stop the leaking said howard hile the companys vice president 
for operations and contingency management 
hile said the 21milliongallon capacity barge was nearly full 
when it struck the other vessel but only a 200000gallon tank in 
the interstate 53 ruptured coast guard petty officer jodi 
hoffmaster said the second barge did not spring a leak 
hile said the company is trying to determine how the accident 
happened 
exxon officials did not return telephone calls 
there were no injuries said linden police lt calvin kleinhans 
fulton said booms had been placed around the port of elizabeth 
as well as the tanker the refinery the rahway river pralls 
island and pralls creek 
the spill is the fifth major spill this year in the arthur kill 
which separates new jersey and new yorks staten island and the 
nearby kill van kull 
a coast guard report on the jan 1 pipeline break that spilled 
567000 gallons of oil into the arthurt kill found that exxon co 
employees routinely ignored procedures for preventing oil spills at 
the plants bayway refinery 
the report also concluded the pipeline probably had been dented 
before the spill by dredging equipment which weakened it and 
eventually caused the rupture coast guard cmdr philip chase said 
wednesday 
the final report on the spill the worst in new york harbor 
history indicated refinery workers ignored alarms that oil was 
leaking from the pipeline said chase executive officer of the 
coast guard marine inspection office in new york 
contrary to exxon service manuals the practice was to reset 
the system when leak alarms shut it down because of a history of 
false alarms said chase that contributed to the spills spread 
because it delayed authorities response he said

soviet citizens are more willing than 
often perceived to accept a freemarket economy according to a 
survey released wednesday by a team of soviet and american 
researchers 
a yale university economist robert shiller joined with a 
soviet economist and a soviet sociologist to conduct a telephone 
survey of about 360 people each in new york and moscow 
the results released at a national bureau of economic research 
conference in cambridge mass indicate some surprising 
similarities in economic attitudes shiller said 
the soviets repeatedly answered in line with americans on 
questions about fairness in regards to free markets he said 
the theory that the soviet public is not ready to accept a 
free market economy because it is not fair is nowhere indicated 
in our survey yet this supposed obstacle is often cited by soviet 
academicians and government officials as a reason not to initiate 
such a system he said 
shiller with soviet scientists maxim boycko and vladimir 
korobov asked their subjects 36 questions aimed at probing 
attitudes on capitalist institutions 
americans and soviets gave almost identical answers to questions 
relating to such things as saving a portion of their annual 
incomes obtaining direct compensation for their work and accepting 
price fluctuations in the market caused by supply and demand 
soviets appeared slightly more supportive of grassroots 
enterprises than the americans 
thirtyseven percent of the soviets said they would invest in a 
risky business started by a group of friends compared with 33 
percent of the americans surveyed 
the survey conducted in may in both cities found the americans 
and the soviets differed widely on their willingness to risk 
unemployment 
seventysix percent of the americans said they would trade job 
security for a big raise and 49 percent of the soviets said they 
would do the same 
five percent of the soviets polled said they would charge a 
friend interest on a loan compared with 27 percent of the 
americans who said they would 
soviets were more suspicious of the wealthy 
about 54 percent of the moscow residents surveyed agreed that 
people who try to make a lot of money will often turn out to be 
not very honest compared with 37 percent of the americans

appeals on tuesday turned down inmate steven goodwins request for 
an order requiring officials to help him impregnate his wife

the threejudge appellate panel said that granting the request

and could prompt female prisoners to demand that they be allowed to 
have babies behind bars 
according to the bureaus artificial insemination policy 
statement if the bureau were forced to allow male prisoners to 
procreate whatever the means it would have to confer a 
corresponding benefit to its female prisoners said judge frank 
j magill 
magill of fargo nd was joined by senior us district judge 
william hanson of des moines iowa in a dissenting opinion judge 
theodore mcmillian of st louis said requests such as goodwins 
should be decided case by case 
goodwins attorney ronald l kuby denounced the ruling as a 
perversion of the constitution 
goodwin 34 is an inmate at the federal prison in springfield 
mo he wants prison officials to provide a container for his semen 
which would be rushed to his 30yearold wife 
goodwin formerly of cedar hill is eligible for parole on sept

european barriers may be tumbling down 
but theres little hope of ending the 16year division of cyprus 
the mediterranean islands division dates from a july 20 1974 
turkish invasion whose anniversary comes amid an upsurge in 
political tension between the turkish and greek communities 
the support of all concerned is now necessary if were to 
prevent the situation from worsening un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar told the security council this month 
catherine lalumiere secretarygeneral of the council of europe 
said the situation was a gangrene threatening europe 
after viewing the concrete wall that splits nicosia the 
capital into turkish and greek sectors she declared early this 
month its inconceivable that in todays europe such a barrier 
still exists 
the turks invaded cyprus five days after a coup by militant 
rightwing greek cypriots that was intended to unite the island 
with greece the president archbishop makarios had to flee for 
his life 
by midaugust 40000 turkish troops had occupied the northern 
third of the island 40 miles off turkeys southern coast 
some 200000 greek cypriots fled south about 40000 turkish 
cypriots moved north 
ethnic tension in the country had increased after cyprus gained 
its independence from britain in 1960 following a fiveyear 
campaign by guerrillas who supported union with greece 
for the 120000 turkish cypriots who make up 18 percent of the 
islands population the invasion anniversary is a time to 
celebrate their liberation from greek cypriot domination 
they declared their northern enclave a breakaway republic in 
1983 but only turkey recognizes it 
in the south many of the 580000 greek cypriots plan 
demonstrations against the occupation of the north branded illegal 
by the united nations some refugees are agitating to return to 
their former homes in the north 
in recent years thousands have attempted to cross the 120mile 
dividing green line that runs from famagusta in the southeast 
to morphou bay in the northwest that touched off clashes with 
turkish cypriot troops 
the line is patrolled by a 2120man un peacekeeping force 
originally deployed in cyprus in 1964 to quell intercommunal 
bloodletting in which hundreds of people were killed 
unsponsored talks between president george vassiliou the 
greek cypriot leader and rauf denktash president of the breakaway 
turkish cypriot state broke down in march 
denktash demanded recognition of the turkish cypriots right to 
selfdetermination vassiliou said that was tantamount to 
recognizing the breakaway state 
communal rivalry sharpened earlier this month when vassilious 
government applied for membership of the european community for the 
whole island 
an infuriated denktash declared the application invalid without 
turs golf courses

luzon island early wednesday and more bodies were found two days 
after a devastating earthquake the death toll topped 300

already hampered by lack of equipment and training to cope with a 
natural disaster of such magnitude

academy located there to help him rescue his wife 
sir we want to help you but what can we do how can we with 
our bare hands a cadet responded

hundreds of the citys 120000 residents have fled their homes and 
pitched tents in the citys park or are living in their cars 
eightytwo people are known to have been killed in baguio and 
hundreds are feared missing 
food and fuel supplies in the city were reportedly running low

months later hoovers private mourning dissolved in public triumph 
over the news that federal agents had gunned down his nemesis 
gangster john dillinger outside a chicago movie theater

the special prosecutor investigating former 
housing secretary samuel r pierce jr is now authorized to probe 
consultants and developers who dealt with the scandalridden 
department of housing and urban development 
arlin m adams the independent counsel appointed march 1 to 
investigate pierces administration o the moderate rehabilitation 
program was given the expanded authority tuesday by a special 
court that oversees his work 
the court issued an order empowering adams to investigate 
pierces handling of two other programs from 1984 through 1988 
urban development action grants or udag and the secretarys 
discretionary fund for technical assistance and special projects 
besides pierce and other hud officials adams was given 
authority to fully investigate and prosecute all government 
officials or other persons and entities who dealt with those 
programs 
the order was issued by the independent counsel division of the 
us court of appeals which appoints and supervises the work of 
special prosecutors 
the court appointed adams on march 1 to investigate allegations 
that pierce and top aides illegally showed political favoritism in 
the award of rent subsidies and tax benefits available under the 
moderate rehabilitation program 
the expanded mandate not only adds two other programs to the 
prosecutors agenda but authorizes him to investigate and prosecute 
any beneficiaries of political favoritism from those hud programs 
from 1984 through 1988 
the courts order means that adams and his staff could spend 
several years combing through records of the hud programs for 
evidence of improper lobbying ethics law violations or conflict of 
interest 
the addition of the udag and discretionary fund to adams 
mandate was sought may 25 by attorney general dick thornburgh who 
referred allegations by former deputy assistant hud secretary 
dubois l gilliam 
gilliam testified before the house government operations housing 
and employment subcommittee that politics played an important part 
in the award of udag and discretionary grants 
gilliam who is serving an 18month prison term for manipulating 
the award of a grant and accepting 8000 in illegal gratuities 
testified that on a number of occasions pierce ordered him to 
intervene for politically connected developers 
pierce has denied any wrongdoing but gilliam testified that 
among other things he was ordered to award a 56 million udag 
grant to a florida development because pierces former executive 
assistant lance h wilson was a private consultant for the 
project 
gilliam testified that he was ordered to intervene for projects 
in nashville cleveland and miami because they were supported by 
influential republicans 
gilliam is cooperating with adams investigation under a grant 
of immunity from prosecution according to sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in its lengthy investigation the house subcommittee heard 
testimony from republican consultants and lobbyists who helped 
clients get hud grants 
these included james watt interior secretary in the reagan 
administration and paul manafort a top campaign strategist for 
president bush 
watt said he met with pierce to help developers win 28 million 
worth of moderate rehabilitation program subsidies for a suburban 
baltimore project 
manafort a partner in the political consulting firm of black 
manafort stone amp kelly acknowledged that he engaged in 
influence peddling and that his firm charged 326000 to help 
developers win hud backing for a new jersey project

the governments official poverty line 
underestimates the number of americans that actually live in 
poverty a report by two advocacy groups said today 
based on polls asking how much money people need to avoid 
poverty the groups concluded in a report that 45 million people 
actually live in poverty in the united states more than the 32 
million that fall beneath the federal poverty line 
the report was based on four gallup polls of 3511 people 
between july and october of last year it was released by the 
center on budget and policy priorities which studies policies 
affecting the poor and the families usa foundation an advocacy 
group for the elderly 
their report concluded that the nations poor are more likely to 
be white older and better educated than it would appear using the 
federal governments more conservative definition of poverty 
it said there are 53 percent more poor whites 88 percent more 
elderly and 48 percent more higher educated people living in 
poverty than government figures show 
the government poverty line is based on an arbitrary arcane 
and outdated formula intended to serve the needs of bureaucrats and 
politicians said ron pollack executive director of families usa 
the groups said their polls asked how much weekly income each 
respondent would set as a poverty line for a family of four the 
average income given by respondents was 15017 the governments 
official poverty line for a family of four including two children 
is 12092 based on 1988 figures the groups said there is a 
separate lower poverty line for the elderly 
the report said 13 percent of americans are said to be poor by 
the governments figures but 18 percent are poor by the reports

two 1970s arms control treaties signed during 
the depths of the cold war are finally coming before the senate for 
ratification their importance overshadowed by rapidly improving 
eastwest relations 
the two agreements the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 
1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty are finally on a fast 
track for approval because of verification steps agreed to on june 
1 by president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
opening a senate foreign relations committee hearing on the 
treaties on tuesday chairman claiborne pell dri said he 
regretted the dawdling that held up what he termed modest 
controls on nuclear testing 
the treaties which limit the size of nuclear weapons tests and 
the use of nuclear charges for peaceful purposes lag far behind 
current arms control discussions that contemplate massive 
reductions in each sides nuclear arsenals 
since they were signed the treaties ran into delays first 
during the carter administration which sought a more comprehensive 
ban on nuclear testing and then during the reagan administration 
which had misgivings over us ability to prevent soviet cheating 
government witnesses suggested that the new verification 
protocols agreed to by bush and gorbachev during their washington 
summit allowing onsite monitoring by both sides could be 
important as a model for the more sweeping start agreement in the 
final stages of negotiation 
the protocols virtually ensure that the two treaties will be 
approved for ratification by the senate before the current session 
of congress ends this year 
the ttb treaty places a limit of 150 kilotons on the size of 
weapons tests and provides detailed standards for the tests to 
ensure that explosions can be measured accurately the pnet places 
identical limits on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes such as 
seismic exploration or excavation 
when the pnet was negotiated nuclear explosions were believed 
to have potential for digging canals or building dams but test 
results have been disappointing and environmental concerns have 
largely eclipsed the idea now the treaty is important mostly as a 
way of ensuring that large weapons tests are not carried out under 
the guise of peaceful explosions 
the verification protocols came about because while both sides 
had agreed to abide by the 150 kiloton limit the united states 
believed the soviets had violated that ceiling as many as 24 times 
and sought more accurate monitoring methods 
the protocols provide what state department negotiator c paul 
robinson called unprecedented onsite and incountry verification 
measures that give each side the right to establish three seismic 
monitoring stations in the others territory 
soviet sites are in newport wash tulsa okla and in the 
south dakota black hills the us monitoring sites are in the ural 
mountains near moscow and in siberia 
robinson said that while the us goal remains the total 
elimination of nuclear testing it will be years before that can 
become a reality 
testing supports nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons support a 
peaceful world a stable world robinson said until we find 
another formula we have to preserve that posture in the best way 
we know how

west virginians can fight the war on 
drugs by filling out a coupon under a state police program hailed 
as the new wave in citizen crimefighting 
but civil libertarians warned that the program under which 
tips can be mailed or phoned in anonymously will create a society 
in which people spy on each other 
this kind of program will not make us drugfree it will just 
make us unfree said bob obrien spokesman for the american 
civil liberties union 
the statewide program announced monday encourages residents to 
fill out coupons giving the name and address of suspected drug 
users or dealers the address of suspicious activity or the license 
plates of cars in suspected drug areas the coupon includes a 
tollfree number and the address of state police headquarters 
the coupons will be available at state police offices and will 
be carried by troopers in their cruisers trooper ric robinson 
said they will also be passed out at the state fair in august he 
said 
its the first time that its been done in recent memory on a 
statewide basis said severin sorensen deputy director of the 
chiefs of police national drug task force in washington its a 
new wave in terms of citizen involvement 
the postcard is an encouraging idea i havent heard of any 
other state or local police handing out those said gerald 
arenberg executive director of the national association of chiefs 
of police which represents about 10000 federal state county and 
local law enforcement agencies in the united states 
the program was adapted from one started by a newspaper in mingo 
county authorities received nearly 700 replies after the 
williamson daily news printed coupons on its own and invited people 
to mail them to state police 
last month federal state and local authorities arrested 46 
people in mingo county as a result of the coupon tips wally 
warden editor of the williamson newspaper said six people have 
been convicted so far 
some of the newspaper coupons contained comments such as 
enough is enough god bless you and anyone else who is 
stopping drugs and yes ive had enough of drugs floating 
around 
state police blame drugs for an increase in violent crime 
robinson said the number of murders in west virginia rose to 121 
last year from 93 in 1988 and armed robberies rose to 793 from 644 
its the wrong way to fight the drug war obrien said the 
idea it creates a paranoid atmosphere just the way it was in 
germany in the 30s and 40s when people were encouraged to spy on 
their neighbors 
robinson said residents will only get the ball rolling 
we dont expect the public to do the investigations for us 
he said you supply us with the names well do the 
investigation 
tipsters are not compensated and disclosure of their name and 
address is optional obrien said that gives participants false 
hope of anonymity 
if the state police issues a search warrant on the basis of 
one of these coupons then the person at trial has the right to 
confront his accuser under the sixth and 14th amendments obrien 
said 
last year newspapers in clinton iowa and milford conn 
started similar coupon campaigns asking readers to anonymously list 
the names of anyone they suspect of using or selling drugs 
law enforcement agencies in florida illinois iowa kansas 
kentucky ohio oklahoma tennessee and texas have contacted the 
williamson newspaper for information about the program warden said

the man accused of killing actress rebecca 
schaeffer says hes sorry but still loves her a year after she was 
gunned down at her apartment building a newspaper reported today 
i really feel kind of guilty about all thats happened my 
feelings for her were uncontrollable robert john bardo told the 
oregonian i was a fan of hers and i may have carried it too 
far 
bardo spoke to the newspaper by telephone from the los angeles 
county jail psychiatric ward it marked the first time he has 
spoken with reporters since his arrest last julyhe has pleaded 
innocent 
the 20yearold high school dropout from tucson ariz told the 
newspaper his obsession with schaeffer began in 1986 with a fan 
letter after he saw her costar in the television comedy my 
sister sam 
bardo said his infatuation with schaeffer dominated his life 
he videotaped every episode of my sister sam he clipped and 
kept photographs of her he wrote countless fan letters he 
composed musical lyrics about a fantasy relationship 
i loved her and i still do bardo said 
but he never met her 
schaeffer 21 died of a gunshot wound to the chest after 
answering the security door at the entrance to her apartment 
building on july 18 1989 
for her parents danna and benson schaeffer of portland today 
marks the date their family became the innocent victims of what 
they call bardos sick fantasy 
a judge in los angeles has ordered bardo to stand trial but 
repeated motions by his attorneys have slowed the process his next 
court appearance is scheduled for aug 2 to determine whether the 
prosecutor will be allowed to seek the death penalty 
in the year since their daughters death the schaeffers have 
become active in campaigning against handguns and have lent their 
support to legislation to protect addresses listed in official 
records 
police and prosecutors say bardo paid a tucson private detective 
250 to find schaeffers address when he arrived in los angeles 
they say bardo stalked the actress neighborhood for nearly four 
hours 
they claim he rang her doorbell and stood to one side when she 
answered the door he allegedly leaped out and shot her at 
pointblank range she died a short time later 
the schaeffers initially declined to participate in a story 
involving an interview with bardo and strongly objected to the 
oregonians plans to publish the story they eventually agreed to 
be quoted with strong reservations 
he feels sorry about it danna schaeffer asked the 
magnitude of the evil he committed against our family doesnt even 
match up to those tepid remarks i think his comments are utterly 
meaningless we dont even want to dignify his remarks with a 
comment 
bardo was arrested in tucson the day after the shooting as he 
ran in and out of traffic on an interstate highway 
i thought i owed it to rebecca to kill myself after what had 
happened bardo said 
bardo would not answer when asked directly if he shot and killed 
schaeffer 
i am sorry thats shes gone but i cant say anything 
directly about the case because that could be incriminating to 
me he said 
schaeffers friends and family took out a fullpage 
advertisement tuesday in the entertainment trade paper variety to 
commemorate the anniversary of her death

a nationwide poll released today indicates 
that one of five americans would like to see a ban on the use of 
agricultural chemicals 
dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau federation 
said the poll of 1000 adults showed that the public is 
reasonable on food safety issues and that only 21 percent favored 
a ban on farm chemicals 
nearly 80 percent said farmers should reduce the use of 
chemicals or continue at current levels 
kleckner said most of the survey results were encouraging while 
some were disconcerting for example 79 percent of those 
polled said they believed farmers are adopting new methods to 
reduce chemical usage but 73 percent thought farmers use more 
chemicals than necessary to boost profits 
this apparent contradiction we believe is due to the fact 
that the public has heard about the progress farmers are making 
the farm bureau president said at the same time the public is 
susceptible to negative suggestions if you ask people whether 
something is wrong they tend to say yes 
also kleckner said the public has some misconceptions about 
modern agriculture half of those surveyed said most farmers dont 
work and live on their farms 
if the public is thinking about corporate farms its 
mistaken he said only 3 percent of all farms are owned by 
corporations if the public is thinking about absentee ownership 
its wrong about that too the amount of farmland owned by 
absentee owners totals about 36 percent of all acreage 
kleckner also announced a new program to tell people about food 
safety threefourths of those surveyed said farmers should educate 
consumers and speak out on food safety issues 
the farm bureaus program todays farmers and ranchers 
professionals from the ground up will begin this summer at 
state and county fairs where members will speak with people about 
farming and food safety 
the survey was conducted for the federation by market facts 
inc on june 2224 officials said it has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 31 percent

beneficiaries who dont get results when they 
telephone social securitys tollfree number may have to way a long 
time before receiving a promised followup call from a local 
office congressional auditors say 
in fact a report by the general accounting office concluded 
that social security failed to follow through on callbacks in 42 
percent of one type of case in other kinds of calls checked by the 
congressional investigative agency beneficiaries were called back 
in as many as 97 percent of cases 
it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the social 
security 800 area code system is not a working number or at 
least that it is not working very well said rep andy jacobs 
jr dind chairman of the house ways and means social security 
subcommittee 
since last oct 1 a social security beneficiary has been unable 
to call a local office of the agency with a question or problem 
instead the first call must be made to the tollfree number 
8002345772 
jacobs whose subcommittee has voted to require social security 
to bring back local phone service said tuesday that the gao survey 
indicates the new system is not delivering the promised higher 
level of service 
its said that access is the goal of lobbyists jacobs 
said for social security participants access to their local 
offices should be more than just a goal it should be a handy 
reality 
he said 800number operators lack training and expertise to 
answer nonroutine calls although it is now far easier to get 
through to the 800 number than it was earlier this year jacobs 
said a caller still will get a busy signal 35 percent of the time 
social security administration spokesman frank battistelli said 
the agency had not been given a copy of the gao report and thus 
would not comment on the findings he said however that at least 
80 percent of problems or questions posed in calls to the 800 
number are settled on the spot without the need of any callback or 
referral to a field office 
even after repeated unsuccessful attempts to get back to a 
caller social security offices do not let a case slip through 
the cracks battistelli said we then send a letter asking the 
caller to get back in touch with us 
social security expects to receive as many as 70 million calls 
this year gao estimated that only about 5 percent require 
referrals 
gao acknowledged the difficulty in trying to get back to a 
caller in carrying out its survey the agency said its workers 
were unable to make contact in five tries with many of those who 
had called the 800 number

a new round of tests found that drivers and 
frontseat passengers of the 1990 isuzu trooper ii and ford club 
wagon likely would suffer head injuries in a collision the 
government says 
head injuries are possible but the risk is less for drivers of 
the 1990 isuzu amigo chevrolet s10 blazer chevrolet s10 pickup 
bmw 325i and volkswagen passat the national highway traffic safety 
administration said tuesday 
the agency tested the vehicles by driving them headon into a 
fixed barrier creating the same conditions as a frontal collision 
between two identical vehicles driving at 35 miles per hour the 
conditions also are equivalent to a car moving at 70 mph striking 
an identical parked car 
test results apply only to occupants using seat belts and in 
certain cars air bags the tests are conducted using dummies that 
represent an averagesized adult male 
according to the nhtsa index a score of 750 or lower means head 
injury is unlikely 7501250 means head injury is possible and 
anything higher means head injury is likely 
a separate scale records the possibility of chest injury which 
is considered likely when the score tops 60 
the lower the numbers the lower the potential for injury but 
for purposes of comparison vehicles have to be of the same type 
and weigh within 500 pounds of each other 
the trooper a multipurpose vehicle weighing 4302 pounds had a 
score of 1564 for the driver and 1952 for the frontseat 
passenger the club wagon weighing 5710 pounds scored 2613 for 
the driver and 1896 for the passenger

marion barry twice snorted cocaine at the 
democratic national convention in 1988 one of his longtime friends 
says as the prosecution prepares to rest its case against the mayor 
mayor barry stopped by my hotel in atlanta twice during the 
july 1988 convention and we used cocaine both times doris 
crenshaw told the jury tuesday in the fifth week of testimony at 
the mayors drug and perjury trial 
crenshaw testified she and barry snorted or smoked the drug 
maybe 15 times over a fiveyear span ending last fall at her 
home in washington and at five hotels around the city 
crenshaw a former aide in the carter white house is the 10th 
friend of barrys to testify to alleged cocaine use by the mayor 
two others said they saw him smoke marijuana 
barry led the district of columbias delegation to the 1988 
democratic convention 
the prosecutions last witness an fbi agent was expected to 
testify briefly today about telephone records involving the 
socalled ramada inn episode in which barry repeatedly visited the 
hotel room of charles lewis now a convicted cocaine dealer lewis 
testified that he and barry smoked crack at the ramada on four 
occasions in december 1988 
when the government rests its case barrys lawyers say they 
intend to seek a judgment of acquittal a routine move midway 
through major criminal trials 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy said his motion will focus on 
the conspiracy charge accusing the mayor of joining with friends to 
possess cocaine and then covering it up from authorities 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson will rule on mundys 
motion 
in addition to conspiracy barry is accused of 10 misdemeanor 
counts of cocaine possession and three felony counts of lying to a 
federal grand jury 
mundy said the defense plans to present 12 to 14 witnesses and 
that his case will last at least through monday 
he said he plans to delve into whether lewis who testified 
against barry is receiving any reward money from the government 
lewis and an fbi agent discussed the subject as soon as lewis 
agreed to cooperate with the government last year the lawyer said 
earlier tuesday a longtime barry friend bettye smith 
testified that she started giving cocaine to the mayor in 1983 and 
last provided it to him a week or two before his arrest jan 18 in 
an fbi sting operation 
smith was brought to washington in the custody of deputy us 
marshals after trying to avoid testifying suffering from stress 
she checked in last week to a psychiatric hospital in chattanooga

president bush the republicans 60 million 
money man is back to campaigning after a months absence but 
what a month it saw the president reverse his 1988 no new 
taxes pledge and the savings and loan scandal move closer to his 
doorstep 
those issues along with new signs of sluggishness in the 
economy loom as overriding political issues today as the president 
resumes his whirlwind fundraising efforts for republican 
candidates after time off for western power summits in london and 
houston 
the presidents first stop is california where republican sen 
pete wilson is locked in a tight race for governor with democrat 
dianne feinstein 
bushs visit comes two days after mcdonnell douglas corp said 
in los angeles it would eliminate as many as 17000 jobs a side 
effect of recent cuts in pentagon spending that cant help wilsons 
candidacy 
after attending the dedication of the nixon library in yorba 
linda and a gop fundraiser in anaheim bush will help boost gop 
candidacies in idaho montana and wyoming he returns to washington 
on friday 
next week he campaigns for republican candidates in 
philadelphia and new york city 
a former chairman of the republican national committee bush has 
been a traveling cash register for gop candidates as of late june 
bush had raised a record 588 million for republican campaigns 
25 million of it in 1989 and the rest this year 
so far about 40 political events are on the presidents 
schedule and the list keeps growing you can call it 
unprecedented said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
bushs fundraising prowess may be phenomenal but its not 
clear how well it can be translated into votes especially in 
bucking a wellestablished trend that sees parties occupying the 
white house lose congressional seats during midterm elections 
and while a new gallup poll shows bushs acceptance level at an 
enviable 63 percent it is down sharply from the 80 percent level 
that he enjoyed after last winters panama invasion 
many republicans are nervous with bushs abandonment of his no 
new taxes pledge and with democratic efforts to blame the sampl 
crisis on them particularly with the recent attention given the 
role of bushs son neil in the collapse of a denver savings and 
loan 
ed rollins a leading gop strategist told a republican meeting 
in chicago last week that it was the democrats who sold out the 
taxpayers on sampls he urged republicans to regain the offensive 
on both the sampl and the tax issues 
even speechwriter peggy noonan who put read my lips no new 
taxes on george bushs tongue had some fresh but unsolicited 
advice for the president on that very subject 
people are becoming newly resensitized to taxes from new 
jersey to california theyre starting to get clobbered again 
she said in chicago last week 
she suggested bush might want to consider pushing away from 
the bargaining table stand up acknowledge whats happening 
declare that an impasse has been reached and tell the democrats 
im taking it to the people 
and quoting former president reagan for whom she also wrote 
speeches ms noonan added sometimes you only make progress in a 
negotiation when you end it 
that seemed to be the ast thing on bushs own mind when he told 
magazine publishers tuesday that the time for game playing is 
over and that it would take both higher taxes and deeper spending 
cuts to ease the federal deficit 
bush said he was prepared to take a campaign for a 
deficitcutting compromise to the public as soon as one can be 
struck with the democraticcontrolled congress 
bushs last political trip was in midjune before his sea 
change on taxes it was also before the fourth of july 
congressional recess when many lawmakers went home and found that 
voters were outraged that taxpayers were expected to foot the bill 
for the collapse of the savings and loan industry 
senators returned to washington and voted 991 to give grand 
new powers to federal investigators and prosecutors to crack down 
on sampl crimes 
meanwhile bush planned to campaign on and on and on 
i dont think that was ever in doubt said b jay cooper a 
spokesman for the republican national committee its the way the 
man is hes available to do anything and everything that makes 
sense

the social security disability system already 
overburdened is soon to be swamped with at least 280000 old cases 
that must be reprocessed as the result of a court decision 
officials say 
the senate special committee on aging heard administrators and 
beneficiaries describe problems tuesday with the social security 
disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi 
program 
in 1989 more than 4 million disabled people their spouses and 
children got benefits through ssdi which requires that 
beneficiaries not work its ssi counterpart which had 3 million 
disabled beneficiaries is specifically targeted at lowincome 
people 
but the system is in dire need of reform said committee 
chairman david pryor dark and ranking republican member john 
heinz rpa 
one of the biggest problems may be the impact on the system of a 
ruling by the supreme court last february that voided a government 
regulation that gave children seeking benefits less protection than 
adults 
the decision in the classaction case of sullivan vs zebley 
will force officials nationwide to reevaluate more than 280000 
benefit denials going back to at least 1983 
we currently lack the resources that we expect to be required 
by the new zebley workload pennsylvania state disability 
administrator howard thorkelson told the aging committee 
deputy social security commissioner louis enoff said the 
administration is bracing for the added workload 
as soon as can assess what the cost will be on zebley we will 
be asking for additional monies enoff said he said he could not 
estimate how much that will be government lawyers are still 
haggling with plaintiffs attorneys over exactly how many cases 
must be reviewed under the decision 
the social security administration is charged with the 
delicate balancing act of protecting scarce trust funds while 
ensuring that the disabled swiftly receive benefits pryor the 
committee chairman said sadly it is failing on both ends 
at one end pryor said 60 percent of all initially denied cases 
are reversed on appeal by administrative law judges meaning 
lengthy delays for beneficiaries 
at the other he said social security has periodically missed 
filing required continued disability reviews designed to stop 
paying beneficiaries who have recovered from disabilities 
in a telephone interview spokesman frank battistelli said the 
agency had slowed but not stopped the disability reviews because 
of budget constraints 
he said the agency could resume its former pace if it fully 
receives its 1991 budget request of 800 million for the 
statebased agencies that handle claims 
enoff defended the 60 percent reversal rate by the law judges 
saying that disability determinations are not an exact science 
individuals conditions change over time and different 
outcomes at succeeding steps in the appeals process are inevitable 
to some extent enoff said 
staff shortages have meant waits of two to six hours for the 
people seeking disability interviews in the jamaica district office 
in new york city said claims representative harry p behret 
the senate hearing featured the use of a live satellite feed so 
that rita hartley 63 could testify from her fort smith ark 
home 
with her dog barking in the background she told the panel that 
she almost starved to death while waiting several years for 
approval of her disability benefits she suffers from lupus 
arthritis and back problems

ever since william j bennett became president 
bushs top aide in the war on drugs last year he has been 
chastised by democrats as too concerned with law enforcement 
uncaring about drug treatment and education 
bennett who pushed huge spending hikes for both treatment and 
education says he is not going to take that any more particularly 
since the democraticrun house appropriations committee slashed the 
administrations demandreduction proposal in the fiscal 1991 
budget 
the move was cheap dishonest and sneaky the national drug 
policy director said tuesday in an interview bill bennett will 
take no more guff from these guys on his commitment to the drug 
war 
according to an analysis provided by bennetts office the 170 
billion measure covering budgets for the labor education and 
health and human services departments next year includes a 21 
million increase in funds for drug demand reduction however the 
administration wanted a 252 million boost 
the spending measure received bipartisan approval from the 
appropriations committee last thursday with no nays heard from 
republican members it is expected to come before the full house 
for a vote thursday 
the conventional rap on us is that were too much for law 
enforcement bennett said for a year now we have been flogged 
for this now they cut our damned budget proposal on the demand 
side who are these clowns 
rep neal smith diowa who sits on the appropriations 
subcommittee that drew up the drug budget said bennett is way 
premature in complaining about money for fiscal 1991 which 
begins oct 1 
its not unusual to have numbers vary a great deal from where 
they start smith said citing the numerous legislative 
contortions appropriations bills go through before they become 
reality 
up to this point hes always gotten more money than he 
requested smith said of bennett if it comes sept 30 and he 
doesnt get more money than he requested then ill be surprised 
smith said one problem with increasing the amounts for education 
and treatment quickly is that some programs are not prepared to 
handle the money 
the analysis by bennetts office breaks down the bush proposals 
and the appropriations committees bill covering the drug demand 
reduction programs 
the administration had sought a 100 million increase in the 
drug portion of the alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
administration block grants mostly for treatment from 4773 
million to 5773 million the house bill provides for no increase 
at all bennetts office said this will result in a cut below 
current levels because it provides no inflation increase 
bush proposed increasing treatment improvement grants by 46 
million to a total of 855 million the house bill adds 104 
million 
the administration sought to increase office of substance abuse 
prevention community partnership grants by 522 million for a 
total of 1017 million but the house bill cuts that to a 105 
million increase 
bush proposed increasing by 54 million the drugfree schools 
and communities program of block grants and related projects for a 
new total of 5933 million the house bill cuts the request by 
543 million 
the 170 billion laboreducationhhs measure passed by the 
appropriations committee represents a 173 billion hike over 1990 
spending it is 42 billion larger than bush had requested 
this wasnt an attack of fiscal responsibility bennett 
said they want to spend lots of money but not on drugs 
some programs slated to get increased funds are aimed at the 
same people as those helped by antidrug programs such as 
compensatory education and student assistance for the 
disadvantaged said a congressional source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
they can be called effective antidrugabuse programs the 
source said they dont have to be labeled drugs in order to be 
a drug program

poland says it is now satisfied that a united

the four world war ii allies virtually assures that the two 
germanys will be one by years end 
foreign ministers from the seven countries decided tuesday that 
the allies will pull out of berlin and give up other occupational 
powers held since 1945 once a reunified germany signs a treaty 
guaranteeing the current borders 
we are very happy with the results polish foreign minister 
krzysztof skubiszewski told reporters after tuesdays talks the 
border has been confirmed 
the polish diplomats meeting with his counterparts from the two 
german states and the united states france britain and the soviet 
union came a day after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
cleared the last great remaining obstacle to german unity by 
endorsing its membership in the nato alliance 
in tuesdays talks the germans agreed to give up any claim to 
territory absorbed by poland at the end of world war ii and to make 
that commitment part of the new germanys constitution 
a treaty to be signed by the new germany and warsaw shortly 
after unification will accept the border the allies set in 1945 
between poland and what later became east germany 
the bonn government also agreed on tuesday to talks with poland 
this summer designed to assure warsaw that its contracts with east 
germany will be fulfilled after unification 
the talks could result in german assistance to polands shaky 
economy gorbachev ended his public reservations about german 
reunification after the bonn government promised financial 
assistance as well as a limit on the troop strength of the future 
german military 
all agree that a unified germany will consist of the federal 
republic of germany the german democratic republic and berlin no 
more no less secretary of state james a baker iii told a joint 
news conference held by the foreign ministers after their meeting 
today will go down in history as the day in which the polish 
border has been settled to the satisfaction of our polish 
friends said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
tuesdays talks were held in an international conference center 
yards from the arch of triumph the napoleonic monument under which 
the troops of nazi germany marched in victory 50 years ago last 
month 
a senior us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said germany will give up any claim to land now held by poland 
and will state it has no territorial claim to any other nations 
land 
poland which lost 6 million people in world war ii had been 
concerned that its powerful neighbor once again would start eying 
polish territory about onethird of todays poland was part of 
prewar germany awarded to the poles to compensate for territories 
annexed by the soviet union 
the virtually simultaneous acts of german unification and 
concluding a border treaty with poland will be followed by full 
german sovereignty with the americans soviets british and french 
giving up all occupational powers 
another result of the successful third round of the 
twoplusfour talks to which poland was added on the issue of 
its borders is the increased likelihood of a 35nation summit in 
paris in november however the united states has insisted on 
completion of a treaty beforehand to reduce us and soviet troops 
tanks and other nonnuclear weapons in europe 
those talks are being held in vienna between nato and the warsaw 
pact 
on monday in the soviet region of stavropol gorbachev and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany agreed that the army of a 
united germany would be limited to 370000 troops the two germanys 
now have about 600000 men under arms with 480000 in west germany 
the soviet union and west germany also agreed to begin 
negotiations on the full withdrawal of soviet soldiers from what is 
now east german territory the 380000 soldiers should be pulled 
out in three to four years 
west germany the richest nation in europe is expected to 
increase trade with moscow it has already backed a 3 billion bank 
loan to the soviet union and pushed its allies for a comprehensive 
plan to bail out gorbachevs crumbling economy 
allgerman elections are scheduled for dec 2

the drug enforcement administration says 
cautious optimism is appropriate in the war against cocaine as 
traffickers face shortages nationwide sometimes even asking 
undercover agents to supply the drug 
cocaine prices are high purity is down and trafficking 
organizations seem to be in such disarray that coca growers in 
south america cant get enough for their crops to make a living 
ron caffrey the deas deputy assistant administrator for 
operations said tuesday 
however caffrey added to the senate judiciary committee we 
have not deluded ourselves into thinking that the cocaine threat 
has subsided this could well be a temporary situation 
committee chairman sen joseph r biden jr who shared with 
caffrey the belief that the news was worthy of cautious 
optimism also stressed the need to remain vigilant 
in my view we are entering the most critical phase of the war 
on drugs a phase in which some policymakers may suggest that we 
declare victory and go home biden ddel said that would be 
a tragic mistake in my opinion 
caffrey reported some victories in the war on drugs 
cocaine prices have reached their highest level since mid1985 
he said even though they remain far below the 5500065000 
price per kilogram 22 pounds of 1982 in addition purity levels 
have dropped the combination of high price and low purity 
generally indicates a shortage 
outside the hearing room caffrey said theres plenty of that 
cocaine down in the source nations such as colombia but its not 
getting here for whatever reasons stockpiling the seizures that 
have been made 
law enforcement efforts here and abroad have disrupted the major 
cocaine cartels the havoc wreaked on those organizations has left 
many coca growers in peru and bolivia without buyers willing to pay 
the 30 per 100 pounds of leaf that is their breakeven point 
caffrey said 
dramatic increases in wholesale prices were found in los 
angeles new york city and houston in the texas city the price 
rose from a range of 11000 to 21000 per kilo last december to 
20000 to 30000 in june 
increases were less notable in chicago where the low price 
remained 19000 and the high price increased from 25000 to 
32000 and miami where the price only inched up from 16000 to 
22000 in december to 17500 to 23000 in june caffrey said 
meanwhile the purity of kilos decreased from 90 percent two 
years ago to 74 percent in june and the purity of streetbuy grams 
dropped from 70 percent in 1988 to 55 percent last month the dea 
reported 
an unreleased survey of all 19 domestic dea field offices found 
the trend toward increased prices and decreased purity was almost 
nationwide caffrey said outside the hearing room 
florida is a little bit different in the sense that yeah 
prices have gone up since last year at this time but i would say 
that it is still fairly stable caffrey said that he said 
would indicate to us that at least in florida there is a fair 
amount of wholesale cocaine available 
the dea had been unwilling to say there was a shortage or any 
nationwide trend until tuesday even though some of the numbers 
were reported publicly last month and national drug policy director 
william j bennett hailed them as indicative of a shortage 
caffrey said the dea had been unwilling to say more in june 
because it had only anecdotal reporting on checking further 
with the field offices he said the agency found some drug 
traffickers were so in need of cocaine that they were asking 
undercover agents to provide the drug 
normally when we do our undercover work we go out and we buy 
drugs at certain prices that are quoted to us caffrey said 
when the market starts to dry up a little bit suddenly people 
are asking us to sell them drugs and then sting operations occur

an audience doesnt go to the bolshoi ballets 
ivan the terrible for history it goes first for drama second 
for dancing 
the companys first performance here of the 1975 ballet set to 
music composed by prokofiev for eisensteins film ivan the 
terrible was tuesday night at the new york state theater 
choreographer yuri grigorovich has hinged his story on domestic 
drama a triangle ivan danced by aleksandr vetrov chooses a 
wife anastasia lyudmila semenyaka from assembled maidens 
prince kurbsky gedeminas taranda loves her out of frustration 
he leads the rich boyars who resent ivans rule against the czar 
grigorovich gives ivan and his bride three romantic duets in 
the final duet in which anastasia returns after her death to 
console ivan semenyaka was ethereal 
the choreographer doesnt give prince kurbsky enough emotion in 
what he dances just after ivan has chosen his bride but he makes 
up for it later giving kurbsky great emotion when anastasia is 
being poisoned by the boyars and great athleticism in a chase scene 
grigorovich choreographs most effectively for groups of people 
dramatically filling the stage peasants boyars armies preparing 
for battle women whirling scythes as symbols of death 
the very effective staging designed by simon virsaladze at 
first looked like three silos the center one farther back than the 
others there was only a small space for dancing in front of them 
the three walls turned out to be cloth seen through when 
lighted a certain way and easily pulled out of sight ivans 
throne was behind the center one it would go into shadow while 
dancers filled the stage from the two other walls 
ivan the terrible isnt smooth and elegant its on the 
heavyhanded dour side but the company is excellent and 
grigorovichs story is engrossing and its interesting to attend a 
ballet that hasnt been dulled by overexposure 
the bolshoi is starting a sevencity american tour in new york

twentythree endangered gray whales 
that washed up on the trinity islands probably died of natural 
causes and no tissue samples will be taken federal officials say 
environmentalists wanted the carcasses tested to determine 
whether they ingested oil from the exxon valdez oil spill in nearby 
prince william sound 
we have no reason to think at this point that its anything 
other than natural mortality steve zimmerman of the national 
marine fisheries service in juneau said tuesday 
you have a large group of animals that have migrated all the 
way from their feeding area in the bering sea last fall down to 
baja california which is several thousand miles and then 
back again zimmerman said any that are physiologically weak 
are going to have problems toward the end of that long migration 
zimmerman said the number of carcasses found on the islands in 
the gulf of alaska was high but the whales could have died of old 
age parasites genetic defects marginal feeding and exhaustion 
among other possibilities 
environmentalists expressed concern because gray whales feed on 
the oceans bottom where weathered oil would sink and accumulate 
in sediments 
grays are the first ones to get nailed if there are tar balls 
on the bottom said cindy lowry alaska director of the 
greenpeace environmental group 
she urged federal officials to take stomach samples as well as 
tissue samples this is an endangered species they should be 
taking it seriously thats too many whales dying in the same 
place 
biologists from the fisheries service and the university of 
alaska fairbanks landed on tugidak island about 20 miles south 
of kodiak on sunday and monday to examine 14 whales spotted there 
nine whales were sighted from the air on nearby sitkinak island 
but scientists werent able to look at them zimmerman said 
of the 14 whales on tugidak one apparently was the victim of a 
killer whale he said two whales apparently had been dead since 
last year one of the 14 was a calf or yearling 
most were between 35 and 40 feet long which is fairly average 
zimmerman said 
there wasnt much else to tell they were dead for a long 
time he said the whales are far enough gone were not really 
sure what the tissues would have shown anyway 
the agency hopes to increase its surveillance of the area next 
summer he said 
randall weiner executive director of the environmental law firm 
trustees for alaska said he was surprised samples werent taken 
given the large quantities of oil spilled in prince william 
sound oil should not be excluded as a cause of death he said 
the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into the sound in march 1989 the nations largest spill 
currents carried it southwest into the gulf of alaska 
this summer is the second straight for whale dieoffs on the 
islands a few residents have spotted what they believe are more 
carcasses than usual washing ashore since the spill 
zimmerman disagreed saying the number of carcasses may be near 
average before the oil spill he said nobody monitored the island 
for carcasses 
a few tissue samples were taken from dead whales on the trinity 
islands last year but few have been tested because of a backlog of 
oilspill samples he said 
the few samples that have been tested show no connection between 
the oil and the whale deaths zimmerman said

rare turtles and oil drillers stand in the way 
of a canadian gas pipeline project sought by six northeastern 
states as a solution to their energy drought 
a consortium of utilities hopes to win the federal energy 
regulatory commissions backing next week for the 3644mile 
iroquois natural gas pipeline the line is designed to pump 
cleanburning fuel from canada to the energyhungry northeast 
but first the 583 million project must overcome an array of 
opponents from rival oil drillers to environmentalists to pop 
psychologist dr joyce brothers 
at a daylong ferc hearing tuesday the opponents contended the 
gas isnt needed that the project is environmentally damaging and 
in brothers case that it will harm an endangered turtle 
species and uproot an important archaeological site on her 
property which lies on the pipeline route 
i have very sensitive historically sensitive material on my 
property brothers said after the hearing referring to her 
271acre estate in the hudson valley town of dover ny 
the documents on the case include photographs taken by brothers 
of the bog turtle listed as endangered in new york state she also 
says that before the pipeline route is approved ferc should 
investigate initial findings of prehistoric pottery 
the pipeline project also has vocal backers including govs 
michael s dukakis of massachusetts and mario cuomo of new york 
massachusetts department of public utilities commissioner susan 
tierney said that even if the pipeline is completed by oct 31 
1991 as planned new england still will have room for growth in 
its energy supply 
not only are the volumes to be supplied by iroquois needed but 
there is a need for more said tierney without the pipeline she 
said new england will have to continue to have high reliance on 
expensive energy supplements 
the plan by the iroquois gas transmission system would supply 
the natural gas equivalent of 30 million barrels of oil per year to 
massachusetts connecticut rhode island new york and new jersey 
the pipeline would run from the st lawrence river through wooded 
areas along highways and rail lines under rivers and through back 
yards in upstate new york western connecticut and under long 
island sound to south commack ny on long island 
mark seifert of the independent petroleum association of america 
complained of an anticompetitive rate structure that could 
cause a death spiral for the domestic pipeline systems 
a key issue was whether ferc should make a final decision next 
week or call for a series of evidentiary hearings that would give 
opponents more time to block the project iroquois backers said 
they want an immediate decision

president bush is expressing pride in the role 
the united states has played in spurring democracy in eastern 
europe and suggesting it can be the catalyst for change in south 
africa 
bush spoke by telephone tuesday with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
afterward commended the exceptional qualities of leadership 
both exhibited in clearing the way for a unified germany to join 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
the president was meeting with a hispanic group today and later 
holding a budget negotiating session with congressional leaders 
before heading off to california on a threeday western trip 
he will attend thursdays dedication of the nixon presidential 
library in yorba linda calif raise money for republican 
candidates in california idaho and montana and attend a frontier 
days celebration in cheyenne wyo 
in a questionandanswer session with members of the magazine 
publishers of america bush said the nearly 169 billion deficit 
now projected for fiscal 1991 was disturbing 
the time for game playing is over he said adding he will 
prod congressional leaders to forge a budget in the next couple 
of weeks 
im very serious about it and i will stay with them as long as 
is required to get a sound deal he said 
bush spent 40 minutes on the phone with gorbachev after a 
halfhour conversation with kohl 
he gave gorbachev a personal report on both the nato and western 
economic summits and congratulated the soviet leader on the support 
gorbachev won at the contentious communist party congress in moscow 
i must say i take pride in the way europe is moving into this 
new era of freedom its a goal that we americans have long worked 
to achieve the president told the magazine executives 
on south africa bush said it was important for south african 
president fw de klerk to visit the white house now that african 
national congress leader nelson mandela has completed his trip 
it will be somewhat controversial said bush but he called 
de klerk a new kind of leader in south africa 
he said the united states will not ease its economic sanctions 
against south africa until there is more progress in 
dismantling the apartheid system of racial segregation 
i think more than any of the european countries we can be 
catalytic we were not a colonial power and we are united in our 
opposition to apartheid bush said those ingredients make our 
country uniquely able to serve as a catalyst between the various 
factors in south africa and thats what i want to try to do 
bush also met separately with neil kinnock the british labor 
party leader who heads the opposition to the thatcher government 
and a bipartisan delegation of 11 members of the japanese diet or

the federal governments plan that it would 
allow indian tribes to open offreservation gaming houses met 
resistance by some western governors 
under proposed guidelines announced tuesday by us interior 
secretary manuel lujan jr tribes would have to prove they 
explored other modes of developing their economies before they 
would be allowed to buy nonreservation land for gambling purposes 
he said tribes would be barred from buying outofstate land 
so we dont have a whole chain of bingo parlors owned by a single 
tribe throughout the country 
lujan who outlined the guidelines at the annual western 
governors association meeting said governors would have the final 
say on tribal requests to purchase offreservation land for gaming 
sites 
north dakota gov george sinner said he would not approve such a 
request and gov roy romer of colorado said tribes should be 
subject to state gambling laws 
i dont think that we want islands of gambling or anything 
else outside the reservations sinner said 
he said indian gaming parlors would have an unfair advantage 
over nonindian establishments since tribes are not subject to 
state gambling laws including those limiting the size of bets 
i think it is an outrage where we are getting to a place where 
the people of a state cannot make its own decisions about gaming 
romer said i am very uncomfortable with the direction the 
federal government is going with these new regulations 
lujan said the regulations are needed to ensure proper 
management of tribes that want to establish gaming operations in an 
attempt to pump life into tribal economies 
montana gov stan stephens said federal indian policies are 
creating an apartheid nation in the united states 
the time has come in this country when the federal government 
needs to reevaluate its entire relationship with native 
americans stephens said most of these programs are abject 
failures on reservations all across this country 
lujan asked about stephens comments by reporters said 
governors must remember that indian tribes are sovereign nations 
and must be treated as such 
i dont see a comparison of south africa with the indian 
reservations he said the laws of the state do not apply 
within an indian reservation anymore than the laws of north dakota 
apply in canada or in south dakota so they are different

installing a donutshaped device on the 
outside of the hubble space telescope is one idea that nasa 
scientists are discussing to partially correct the instruments 
focusing flaw 
officials said tuesday that a donut could be installed by 
spacewalking astronauts to partially close the eye of hubble this 
would sharpen the telescope focus slightly but could present other 
problems nasa experts said 
meanwhile james beggs the nasa administrator during the era 
that the hubble space telescope was being built testifies before 
congress today for the first time since it was discovered that the 
15 billion telescope is seriously flawed 
beggs who headed the space agency from 1981 to 1986 is 
expected to be questioned about tests that were conducted on the 
space telescope when the instrument was being assembled during the 
early 1980s 
the hubble was discovered last month to have a basic focusing 
flaw in its two main mirror optics this causes it to see the 
universe as a blur instead of the sharp crisp images of distant 
stars that the space agency had claimed it would see 
the new york times reported today that nasa has a backup mirror 
for the hubble that could have been used to replace the telescopes 
mirror if testing had been performed on the ground to find the 
focusing flaw the times quoted experts as saying they believed the 
backup mirror now in storage could have been optically superior 
to the one that was used 
ed weiler chief scientist for the hubble project said tuesday 
that the blurry vision of the telescope could be slightly improved 
if spacewalking astronauts were to place a device that would narrow 
the lightgathering opening of the instrument 
weiler said it would be like putting a donut on the outside of 
the tube with light going through the donut hole this would 
restrict the light entering the aperture and improve the focus he 
said however the improvement would only be by a factor of two 
or three and would reduce the amount of light seen by the 
telescope 
the hubble still would not focus as crisply as scientists had 
expected he said adding that there also was a risk of making 
things even worse 
i dont think the scientists would want to take that risk for 
a factor of two or three improvement he said 
in congressional hearings today beggs was appearing before a 
subcommittee chaired by sen barbara mikulski dmd 
as nasa administrator beggs was in charge when the hubble 
mirrors were being made engineers have said hubbles problems 
originated with a mistake in the mirror manufacturing process and 
that the error could have been detected with proper testing 
in a report published in space business news an industry trade 
journal beggs said the air force had a facility that could have 
detected the hubble flaw but that nasa was not permitted to use 
the facility for tests 
mikulski who chairs the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
independent agencies such as nasa has said she is outraged about 
the hubble mistake she ordered the hearings to find out what went 
wrong 
appearing with beggs were richard truly the current nasa 
administrator lennard fisk the space agencys top scientist and 
william lenoir nasas director of space flight 
for fisk it was to be the fourth appearance before a 
congressional committee since the hubble problem was discovered he 
has twice testified before another senate subcommittee and once 
before a house committee 
truly has been quizzed several times by congress about hubble 
and also about hydrogen leaks discovered in two space shuttles the 
leaks caused the shuttle fleet to be grounded 
in a news conference on tuesday lenoir said the source of the 
leaks had been found and that shuttle flights could resume as early 
as next month

a defense department request is delaying 
shipment of an industrial metalcasting furnace from a new jersey 
manufacturer to the iraqi government 
customs service spokesman david hoover said tuesday that the 
office of defense technology security administration had asked his 
agency to detain the furnace but he and john konfala of the 
pentagon agency declined further comment 
all we can do as a furnacebuilding company is to follow the 
laws that the government has laid down raymond j roberts 
president of consarc corp of rancocas nj said in a telephone 
interview we dont have access to the intelligence sources that 
the government has 
he said consarc received government approval more than a year 
ago to sell iraq a type of furnace that can cast titanium a 
lightweight metal the iraqis said they need to produce artificial 
limbs 
titanium also can be used for weapons production 
british and american officials have seized other iraqbound 
cargoes this year saying the shipments were for military use 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they expected a decision by friday on whether to permit the 
consarc export 
roberts said consarc which sells about 20 million of 
industrial furnaces each year to customers worldwide followed us 
rules to the letter in arranging the sale 
he said iraqs ministry of industry and minerals said it had a 
great need for artificial hip and knee joints for people injured 
during the gulf war with iran 
the commerce department told the company more than a year ago 
that there would be no problem with the sale roberts said 
however customs officials delayed the furnace when it reached 
the dock in philadelphia on june 26 
im totally confused roberts said 
john thomas a commerce department spokesman said the export 
administration act prohibited him from discussing any information 
about specific cases or companies 
roberts said he knew of only two other furnaces like the furnace 
stopped at philadelphia one produced by another us firm to make 
pumps for the chemical industry and another produced in west 
germany for making implants 
he declined to reveal the purchase price of the impounded 
furnace for commercial reasons but said consarc would be able 
to find another customer 
consarcs british sister operation produced other types of 
furnaces for iraq that were used in the heat treatment of metals 
roberts said

the earthquake that shook the philippines this 
week was heavily populated luzon islands third most severe ever 
recorded the us geological survey says 
mondays disastrous quake north of manila recorded at 77 on 
the richter scale was the strongest in the philippines since the 
1976 earthquake of 79 magnitude and tidal wave that claimed up to 
8000 lives off the coast of mindanao the survey said tuesday 
after checking records at its national earthquake information 
center in colorado 
the philippines located on what seismologists call the 
pacific ring of fire encircling the ocean has had 30 
significant earthquakes in the 14 years since the mindanao 
disaster an average of more than two annually said waverly 
person chief of the centers monitoring unit he defined a 
significant quake as one that registers at least 65 magnitude or 
causes casualties or heavy damage 
mondays quake was the third strongest on record for luzon 
exceeded only by one of an estimated magnitude of 78 on dec 14 
1901 near lucena southeast of manila and one estimated at 79 on 
aug 15 1897 off luzons northwest coast the center said 
the latest philippine earthquake had the same magnitude of 77 
as the june 20 shocks that killed up to 50000 people in iran it 
noted that was the deadliest earthquake since one in northeast 
china in july 1976 with a death toll estimated at from 246000 to 
700000 the survey said 
the pacific ring of fire includes the san andreas fault and 
mount st helens in the western united states and numerous 
volcanoes said the geological survey its scientists believe 
mondays luzon quake occurred on a fault similar to the san andreas 
fault in which the two sides of the fault slide horizontally past 
each other

in an elegant house in the best section of 
the city a doctor from a prestigious hospital connected his wife 
two children and himself to intravenous tubes hung from picture 
hooks on the wall and killed them all 
a suicide note left by dr anthony paul 49 at his office and 
at the house referred to financial difficulty and to the medical 
problems of his wife melanie 47 and daughter medhina 17 
police said 
mrs paul had severe arthritis and medhina severe brain damage 
according to the note which was several pages long 
a copy of the note was discovered tuesday morning at the fox 
chase cancer center where paul had worked for 15 years said 
spokesman eric rosenthal officials there called police who broke 
into the threestory house 
the bodies were found in a secondfloor master bedroom iv 
solution bags were hung from picture hooks and iv tubes were in 
the arms of each victim police said 
the bodies of the daughter and the son rajiva 12 were on 
mattresses on the floor mrs pauls body was on a bed and pauls 
body was slumped on the floor detective lt thomas quinn said all 
four were in bedclothes he said 
the iv bags were not labeled and their contents were not 
immediately known quinn said autopsies were expected today 
police said the deaths occurred sometime after 7 pm monday 
paul had been at work monday there was no sign of a struggle 
quinn said 
this was one of those issues of human existence that those of 
us who are left dont really understand said dr robert comis 
vice president for medical science at the cancer center 
he was a gentle man someone who was respected by his 
colleagues he was appreciated by his patients and we are all 
saddened and astonished by what happened 
paul was a gastroenterologist specializing in cancer treatment 
rosenthal said he said pauls wife was a psychiatrist but no 
longer had an active practice 
the whole institution is shocked those who are closest to him 
are devastated rosenthal said 
the suicide note spoke of the doctors despair police said 
he decided to take the family with him quinn said he 
indicated he didnt want to leave his son as a ward of the state 
comis said pauls wife was often sick and his daughter was 
nonfunctional for her whole life 
there was no explanation for why he would kill his son comis 
said 
the son was apparently a very bright child thats the great 
tragedy in addition to the whole thing comis said the issue 
of the boy is something that i personally cant reconcile but its 
done 
the white stucco and stone house with an ivycovered lawn is on 
a corner lot surrounded by high hedges and mature trees the home 
bought for 267000 in 1985 had about 10 bedrooms police said 
i think he got involved in issues relating to his family to 
the exclusion of everything else comis said when it came to 
what had to be done it had to include all the members of his 
family

czechoslovakias new ambassador to the united 
states has an early form of leukemia and is trying to decide 
whether to remain in this country for treatment or return to her 
own 
its not that we dont have good doctors at home ambassador 
rita klimova told the washington post but we dont have the 
ability to protect patients from infection that requires a high 
degree of sophistication in the hospitals 
the ambassador who assumed her diplomatic post five months ago 
said her government will pay her medical bills but she is 
concerned about finances and does not want to run up a big bill 
the paper reported in todays editions that the ambassador said 
her decision on whether to stay in the united states will depend on 
finding treatment that fits in with someones research plans

a federal inspector general says flaws in the 
food and drug administrations regulation of medical devices may 
allow unsafe products on the market 
health and human services inspector richard kusserow told a 
house panel tuesday that investigations by his staff suggest the 
fdas regulatory system may prevent the agency from detecting 
device problems early and acting promptly 
kusserow said the problems with the medical device approval 
process parallel what we encountered in our extensive reviews of 
the generic drug division which turned up evidence that generic 
drug companies had cheated on tests required to win fda approval 
and bribed fda officials 
although our findings here are similar we have no evidence of 
these vulnerabilities manifesting themselves in any detected 
criminal wrongdoing kusserow told the house energy and commerce 
health subcommittee 
the inspector general said that in addition to needing more 
internal controls over the approval system the fda also needs 
stronger authority to remove defective devices from the marketplace

a judge says he wants more 
testimony from a us army officer whose information led to arrests 
in the slayings of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter last year 
judge ricardo zamora said tuesday that he told the foreign 
ministry to ask the us embassy to allow maj eric buckland a 
us military adviser to speak on the november attack at central 
american university 
buckland has already given a deposition to the court that led to 
the arrest of col guillermo benavides at the time director of a 
military school near the university as well as three salvadoran 
lieutenants and four enlisted men 
a fifth enlisted man also wanted has escaped 
however zamora told reporters he wanted additional testimony 
from buckland it was not immediately clear whether buckland would 
comply 
failure of the rightist government of president alfredo 
cristiani to move more quickly against human rights abuses has 
angered members of the us congress which provides millions in 
aid to el salvador every year 
armed men in military uniforms roused the jesuits and the two 
women from their beds at their central american university campus 
home on the night of nov 16 and shot them to death 
the jesuits had long been accused by rightist elements of 
sympathizing with leftist guerrillas waging a decadeold war for 
power 
the assassinations occurred at the height of a furious monthlong 
rebel offensive in the capital and the area was under a 
dusktodawn curfew and military control at the time 
according to bucklands deposition col carlos armando aviles 
a key witness in the case informed him that benavides had 
confessed to him that he took part in the slayings 
aviles denied this when he appeared before the court 
lt col carlos camilo hernandez the military schools deputy 
director has been charged with covering up the crimes and was to 
appear before the court today he is alleged to have destroyed the 
school logbooks and other evidence the logbooks would have shown 
who left and entered the building at the time

spokeswoman for the museum of natural science in houston

septentrionalis and the official state mammal of texas was first 
discovered in 1955 by a houston teacher and her teenage son as the 
two amateur fossil collectors poked around the mud banks of brays 
bayou

found but only two fairly complete skeletons found in north 
america of the armadillo one in florida and one here ms falk 
said

progesterone suppositories the most common 
treatment for premenstrual syndrome is not significantly effective 
for the condition that afflicts up to 7 million american women 
says a study published today 
premenstrual symptoms were not significantly improved by 
progesterone compared with placebo in any measure used in the 
study researchers said in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
the study by scientists at the university of pennsylvania was 
the largest to look at progesterone treatment of pms it included 
168 women who reported various symptoms including irritability 
mood swings and breast tenderness 
women in the 1988 study received vaginal suppositories 
containing progesterone for two months followed or preceded by two 
months of treatment with a placebo 
progesterone suppositories are the most common medical treatment 
for pms lead researcher ellen freeman said tuesday in a telephone 
interview they must be prescribed by a doctor she said 
while a few women reported some improvement with progesterone 
alone the number was not statistically significant ms freeman 
said 
fortyfour percent of 121 women who completed the study reported 
a decrease of 50 percent or more in pms symptoms but because all 
the women had received both progesterone and a placebo researchers 
said the improvement could not be attributed to the hormone 
why did those women improve we can only speculate said ms 
freeman of the universitys department of obstetrics and 
gynecology 
they may have improved because they were getting a lot of good 
medical attention and they felt supported they felt understood 
she said 
ms freeman said the study should not be construed as an 
endorsement of the view that pms is a bogus disorder the problem 
is real she said 
in an accompanying editorial dr howard j osofsky of louisiana 
state university medical center said the study pointed out in the 
most convincing manner to date the lack of substantiation of 
beneficial effects of progesterone treatment for pms 
he urged with ms freeman that more research be done and said 
previous studies have questioned progesterones benefit in treating 
pms 
osofsky said a 1985 study of 23 women found progesterone 
administered orally helped alleviate pms symptoms ms freeman said 
her group plans to study the effects of oral doses on a larger 
group of women 
mollie kane spokeswoman for the national womens health network 
in washington said the study supports her groups belief that 
progesterone therapy for pms has not been adequately tested 
we feel that its not good to be giving a drug like 
progesterone to women on a large scale when its not been 
proven effective ms kane said 
we very strongly advocate more research she said

two top editors of the southern baptist 
conventions press agency were fired after they refused to resign 
in a dispute over coverage of the nations largest protestant 
denomination 
the denominations executive committee voted tuesday to fire 
baptist press editor alvin c shackleford and news director dan 
martin 
shackleford said they were not given exact reasons for the 
dismissals although he believed the denominations ruling 
fundamentalists felt they were biased against the majority view 
a statement announcing the firings from committee chairman sam 
w pace of lawton okla was read without elaboration by ernest e 
mosley executive vice president of the committee 
committee members refused to comment saying only that pace had 
ordered them to refrain from discussing the matter outside the 
session which was closed to the public some committee members had 
charged baptist press with showing a bias toward the denominations 
moderate wing 
later tuesday nashville attorney jeffrey mobley announced the 
formation of a new independent press agency to be called 
associated baptist press 
it will not seek sponsorship or affiliation with the southern 
baptist convention mobley said it will be a standalone news 
agency that will report on issues to people interested in southern 
baptist affairs 
shackleford 58 worked at baptist press for 3 years martin 
51 had worked there for nearly a decade 
about 200 of the editors supporters stood outside singing 
amazing grace and other hymns during the vote to fire 
shackleford and martin 
the last thing the revolutionaries whove taken over the 
palace want is a free press martin told reporters i think we 
were fired because they want their own minister of information 
the 44yearold baptist press sends stories and press releases 
to about 400 clients including 38 independent southern baptist 
weekly newspapers 
the executive committee didnt say whether replacements had been 
hired it gave the two editors seven months severance pay and 
benefits 
the terminations mark the latest skirmish between 
fundamentalists who have held sway for a dozen years and 
moderates who claim their role in the denominations 
decisionmaking process has been steadily undermined 
in a prepared statement announcing plans for the new press 
agency mobley said the firings lead to no other conclusion than 
baptist press will cease to be a fair and balanced news service 
reporting the business and events of the southern baptist 
convention 
asked whether the new agency which he said would be in limited 
operation in august would hire the editors fired by the 
convention mobley said hiring staff would be a job for the 
directors who have not yet been named 
the southern baptist convention headquartered in nashville has 
149 million members

the minnesota twins became the first team in 
baseball history to turn two triple plays in a game they lost 
anyway 
the recordbreaking feats came tuesday night against the boston 
red sox both triple plays went from third baseman gary gaetti to 
second baseman al newman to first baseman kent hrbek 
its never happened in 120 years or whatever said red sox 
infielder jody reed who hit into one of the triple plays we 
were the first its like landing on the moon 
to set up the first triple play minnesota pitcher scott 
erickson loaded the bases in the fourth inning on a walk to wade 
boggs a double by reed and a walk to carlos quintana 
then tom brunansky hit a sharp grounder to gaetti who stepped 
on third for the first out he threw to newman forcing quintana 
newman then threw to hrbek beating brunansky by a full stride 
gaetti said he sensed brunansky a slow runner might hit into a 
triple play and even said so to boggs 
i said wade youre going to see a 543 triple play right 
here gaetti said i dont think he believed me 
in the eighth reliever john candelaria gave up a double to tim 
naehring to lead off the inning then walked boggs reed hit a 
onehopper to gaetti who stepped on third to force naehring then 
relayed to newman forcing boggs newman then threw to hrbek 
beating reed by a full stride 
but not even the two triple plays helped the twins in the end 
boston won 10 
i cant believe it newman said after the second one i 
figured its destiny weve got to win

nbc held the ratings crown for a ninth 
consecutive week but its margin of victory was shrinking cbs 
boosted by baseballs allstar game was second by a tenth of a 
rating point 
the american league beat the national league 20 in the 
midseason classic in a game distinguished by nine hits nine walks 
and an episode of rescue 911 broadcast during a 68minute rain 
delay in the seventh inning 
the game averaged an 185 rating and a 33 share according to 
ratings released tuesday by the ac nielsen co a rating point 
represents 921000 households a share is the percentage of all tv 
sets in use tuned to a show in its time period 
the allstar game was cbs first showcase event in the networks 
11 billion deal with major league baseball and 17 million 
households tuned in 
its 185 rating was fractionally higher than nbcs 182 rating 
last year the best allstar ratings in recent years were the 205 
ratings and 36 shares abc won in 1988 and nbc in 85 
overall nbc narrowly won the week of july 9 its ninth 
consecutive weekly ratings victory and its 40th in the past 43 
weeks with a 98 rating and a 19 share cbs was onetenth of a 
rating point back at 97 and a 19 share 
abc came in third at 91 with an 18 share the fox broadcasting 
co had a 62 rating and a 12 share 
the numbers are very close all over the place said analyst 
david marans of the j walter thompson advertising agency among 
adults 25 to 54 it was a virtual tie for the three networks you 
cant get closer than that 
a rerun of nbcs cheers was the toprated entertainment 
show in second place with a 162 average foxs the simpsons 
was third at 145 
rounding out the top 10 were fourthranked the cosby show 
with a 144 rating no 5 roseanne at 140 nbcs sunday 
night movie the canadian miniseries love amp hate a marriage 
made in hell was no 6 at 139 
nbcs a different world and the allstar pregame show tied 
for seventh at 136 cbs designing women was ninth at 133 and 
60 minutes was tenth with a 132 rating 
demographically the fox weblet continues to attract viewers 
in advertisers prime demographic groups 
among adults 18 to 34 fox had three of the top five shows 
marans said the simpsons was no 1 married with children 
was three and in living color was four even though fox is still 
not available in about 10 percent of the country 
the preview of prime time pets cbs pet show finished 19th 
but the show itself debuted at a disappointing 60th place the 
networks northern exposure came in 46th holding its own 
against primetime live and a repeat of la law marans 
said 
nbcs quantum leap experimental fiveweeknight showing of 
reruns of the timetravel drama in late june has paid off in the 
past week quantum leap was first among all key demographics in 
its time period he said 
nbc which plans to move the show to 8 pm friday in its fall 
schedule has to be pleased with its performance marans said 
another nbc experiment the friday night repeats of the early 
80s series bret maverick with james garner and yellow 
rose with cybil shepherd and sam elliott has been less 
successful he said 
yellow rose was 64th and bret maverick was 57th 
those episodes originally aired when nbc was in last place 
marans said their premise must be that not that many people saw 
them or remembered them its an interesting idea considering the 
high cost of programming

nasa will try and repair atlantis 
leaky fuel line at the launch pad in an attempt to get that shuttle 
and columbia off the ground in the next two months 
the chances of that happening are small however and the space 
agency expects it will have to settle for one launch prior to 
discoverys flight with the sunprobing ulysses satellite in 
october said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
nonetheless he said this should demonstrate we are alive and 
well and healthy that we have a robust process that behaved as it 
should have that gets flights off in a timely fashion when its 
safe 
not only do we see the light at the end of the tunnel but i 
believe we are out of the tunnel lenoir said tuesday 
not since the 1986 challenger disaster which killed seven 
astronauts has the space agency been hit by so much criticism at 
issue are the shuttle leaks which had grounded the entire fleet 
and mirror imperfections on the hubble space telescope that make it 
impossible to focus clearly 
president bush on tuesday expressed confidence in the space 
agency and its administrator richard truly the day before the 
administration ordered a review by outside experts of the nations 
longterm space goals 
the national aeronautics and space administration is under no 
pressure to rush into flight lenoir said 
were all motivated i would say more so than pressured to 
find whats wrong to fix it and go fly and thats exactly what we 
have done he said were not hurrying to do it but on the 
other hand were not going to take a year off and study it to 
death either 
atlantis would be the next shuttle to fly provided its hydrogen 
leak can be corrected at the pad engineers believe the leak is 
somewhere around a flange on the external tank side of a 
17inchdiameter valve the valve is in a pipe that carries fuel 
from the tank to the main engines 
if the flanges seal is not cracked workers will tighten the 48 
bolts in that area lenoir said a third tanking test will be 
conducted next week to see if that was enough to resolve the 
problem 
atlantis leak was discovered during the first tanking test june 
29 which prompted nasa to ground all three shuttles columbias 
leak was detected during fueling for a may 30 launch attempt 
we will take our best shot at everything we can do on the 
pad lenoir said if that fails and we still have the leak 
honestly thats what we expect to be the case we roll back to 
the hangar lenoir said 
columbia consequently would be moved from the hangar back to the 
launch pad for an early september liftoff with the astro 
observatory lenoir said 
if atlantis does not have to go back to the hangar nasa will 
attempt to launch that shuttle with a classified defense department 
payload around august 10 or 12 lenoir said columbia would follow 
around sept 10 to 14 
in either case discoverys flight with the ulysses satellite 
will remain on schedule lenoir said discovery must lift off 
between oct 5 and 23 because of earths alignment with the sun and 
jupiter or else the mission must wait 13 months 
whichever flight does not precede the ulysses mission 
immediately will follow it lenoir said 
its too soon to say what kind of an impact the delays will have 
on the shuttle flight schedule over the next few years 
we want to make sure we have a realistic schedule and if that 
requires the domino effect going farther than were happy with 
thats just whats going to turn out lenoir said

an israeli historian today welcomed polands 
decision to lower the official death toll at the auschwitzbirkenau 
death camp from 4 million to under 2 million and acknowledge that 
most of the victims were jews 
its a positive change that the poles decided not to play 
politics with the victims anymore said shmuel krakowski head of 
the archives at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem 
krakowski said that until recently poland had clung to the 
higher figure of 4 million victims including more than 1 million 
nonjews to back claims that poles and other gentiles suffered as 
much as jews at the hands of the nazis 
revised findings by the auschwitz state museum said the number 
of victims in the nazi death camp in southern poland actually was 
11 million to 15 million the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
reported tuesday 
of that number at least 960000 were jews 
the report cited by gazeta wyborcza is to be published next year 
by the state museum and yad vashem memorial the paper said plaques 
carrying the inflated death toll have been removed from a memorial 
at the camp the largest built by the nazis 
krakowski said the revised figures were in line with yad vashem 
estimates that fewer than 2 million people were killed in 
auschwitzbirkenau among them up to 90 percent jews 
we always knew and published the right number he said 
the poles didnt want to correct theirs until now because of 
political considerations 
krakowski said because yad vashem had always stuck to the lower 
figure the new death toll out of poland did not affect the total 
of 6 million jews who perished in the nazi holocaust 
of the 6 million just under 4 million were gassed to death in 
nazi death camps the largest of which were located in 
nazioccupied poland including auschwitzbirkenau treblinka and 
majdanek 
krakowski said the figure of 4 million victims at 
auschwitzbirkenau alone was first mentioned by rudolf hoess the 
death camp commander during his trial in poland after world war ii 
the figure was also cited by a soviet commission that came to 
the camp in february 1945 one week after its liberation it later 
submitted its findings to the nuremberg war crimes trials 
based on the numbering of inmates letters linked to transports 
and statistical lists made in jewish ghettos the number of victims 
that can be documented is 11 million about 90 percent of whom 
were jewish franciszek piper head of the auschwitz state museums 
history department said in an interview with gazeta wyborcza 
poland has pressed the soviets since the 1970s to grant 
historians access to world war ii camp records which were packed 
up and taken to the soviet union soon after the liberation piper 
said 
the ministry of culture of polands new solidarityled 
government has appointed a committee to review the state of the 
auschwitzbirkenau memorial and museum 
the review wants not only to repair the physical deterioration 
of the camps but to correct exhibits dating from the 1950s that 
the ministry says distort history by concealing the main reason the 
camps existed was to exterminate jews

to their apprehension

the states highest court said a proposed tax on 
services is constitutional clearing the way for gov michael s 
dukakis today to sign a 13 billion tax increase 
in a 43 advisory opinion tuesday the supreme judicial court 
rejected arguments that the massachusetts constitution allows a tax 
on commodities but not services 
the court said the word commodities is not limited to tangible 
personal property 
the tax increase bill approved earlier this month by the 
legislature would expand the 5 percent sales tax to 594 business 
services including legal fees athletic club memberships and even 
fortune tellers 
this decision is about change its about the future of tax 
policy in massachusetts said state sen patricia mcgovern we 
can shift the burden from middle and lower class people to people 
of great means the wealthy 
after months of grappling with the states financial and 
economic woes dukakis said the tax package should help restore 
fiscal stability to massachusetts 
opponents said they will continue to fight the measure 
massachusetts ended its last fiscal year with a more than 1 
billion deficit proponents of the tax plan said the state needs 
more money to pay off that debt and help balance the proposed 
budget for the current fiscal year 
the tax bill included an income tax increase and a 
10centagallon boost in the gasoline tax to raise about 19 
billion annually after the first year when 13 billion would be 
raised the expanded sales tax would raise about 500 million of 
the total each year 
lawyers were among the strongest opponents of the plan saying 
it would intrude on attorneyclient privilege by turning them into 
tax collectors 
business leaders argued the bill would significantly boost the 
operating costs of companies that purchase accounting engineering 
and electricity services among others they said it could lead to 
layoffs and higher prices for consumers 
house minority leader steven pierce said the tax plan would be 
a serious economic blow to the state 
you dont jump start the economy with a dead battery said 
pierce a republican gubernatorial candidate 
another gop gubernatorial candidate william weld said the 
issue was not the constitutionality of a services tax but its 
wisdom 
this tax will cost the massachusetts economy far more than it 
will bring in in revenue weld said 
but james braude executive director of the tax equity alliance 
of massachusetts a taxpayer group said the services tax would put 
some of the increased tax burden on businesses instead of working 
people 
it is good news for the average taxpayer braude said of the 
courts decision 
the state is expected to create certain exemptions for small 
businesses and also address the tax on commercial use of energy 
the bill would exempt the first 20000 in bills for legal 
architectural accounting and engineering services 
among the other services that would be subject to the sales tax 
would be outofstate telephone calls photographic services 
general repairs for businesses and landscaping over 100

the city fire department has filed two 
codeviolation summonses against managers of the empire state 
building claiming defects in an alarm system slowed firefighters 
response to a blaze that injured 38 people 
the exact amount of time firefighters lost in getting to 
mondays fire at the 102story landmark was not clear said john 
mulligan a fire department spokesman 
one summons filed tuesday charged that the 59yearold 
buildings alarm system failed to flash word of the fire to a 
central alarm station which would have notified the fire 
department he said 
the second summons mulligan said charged that the buildings 
fire safety director who was supposed to brief arriving 
firefighters was nowhere to be found when the first fire companies 
arrived in the lobby of the building 
each summons for alleged violations of the citys 
administrative code is punishable by fines of 500 to 10000 
they must be responded to by sept 6 in manhattan criminal court 
mulligan said 
the buildings alarm system operated by afa protective systems 
inc of manhattan had not been connected to afas central alarm 
station which normally would have flashed the alarm to the fire 
department he said 
instead the department was notified by telephone it was not 
clear who made the call mulligan said 
a spokesman for howard rubenstein associates which represents 
the building management helmsleyspear inc said the fire was 
spotted before it could set off alarms 
the spokesman who did not want his named used said a member of 
the buildings fire response team was notified of the fire went to 
the floor to check it out saw the smoke and pulled the fire alarm 
in response to the second summons the building spokesman said 
the person who discovered the smoke was the fire safety director 
he pulled the alarm and went down the 51 floors to be present when 
firefighters arrived 
the building has very clearly demonstrated that there was an 
effective response an appropriate evacuation and there is computer 
documentation to underscore that he said 
fire alarms sounded on only two floors during the blaze because 
the system is designed to avoid panic in the skyscraper where 
10000 people work fire commissioner carlos rivera said 
most of the people who work in the building had gone for the 
day about 1000 people including tourists were evacuated by 
stairways and elevators mulligan said 
rivera said despite limited alarms and a public address system 
that failed after an initial announcement people were never in 
any serious danger 
the fire broke out in offices on the 51st floor exactly 
halfway up the tower that for decades was the worlds tallest 
building and still symbolizes new york to millions around the world 
chief fire marshal john stickevers said investigators had not 
found the cause but were leaning toward an electrical fire he 
said there were no suspicious circumstances 
gary lewi a spokesman for the building management said the 
alarm system worked as intended it goes off only on the fire floor 
and the floor above so as not to induce panic he said 
charles guigno manager of the building and engineering 
director albert goffe said that system is in accordance with fire 
department regulations 
thirtyfour firefighters and four civilians were injured in what 
rivera called an extremely difficult fire because of the intense 
heat and intense smoke 
except for a few open or boardedup windows and some smoke and 
water damage on floors above and below the burned area the 
building operated normally tuesday said robert udowitz a 
spokesmen for the managers

the countrys highest court has set severe 
penalties including the death penalty for people who deal in 
pornographic materials 
items considered pornographic include audio and video tapes 
records books and magazines playing cards and photographs and 
pictures describing sexual behavior or directly depicting 
licentious images official media reported 
the regulation announced monday by the supreme peoples court 
is the latest in the campaign launched last fall against the six 
evils pornography prostitution gambling feudal superstition 
abducting and trafficking women and children and drugs 
lin zhu vice president of the supreme peoples court said that 
artistic and literary works that have some obscene content 
paintings depicting the beauty of the human body and materials on 
medicine and natural science would not be considered pornographic 
lins comment was one of the first to give some guidance on what 
will be considered pornographic there is no legal definition of 
pornography and in china anything showing a naked body or even 
kissing can be regarded as obscene 
the new regulation stipulates that punishment for the production 
of trafficking in transporting or smuggling of pornographic 
materials will range from jail terms including life imprisonment 
to death the reports said 
the regulation applies for example to those found producing 
more than five to 10 videotapes 10 to 20 cassette tapes 10 to 20 
playing cards or books and 50 to 100 photographs or pictures 
however it does not clarify what penalty would be applied 
in a separate commentary the official xinhua news agency hailed 
the bold move to stamp out pornography 
it noted that the rampancy of pornographic matierals has 
been a major factor in the rise of juvenile crime in china last 
year 290000 juveniles were sentenced up 36 percent from the 
previous year the commentary said 
sixty percent of sexrelated crimes committed by juveniles can 
be traced to the influence of pornography it said 
since china launched its antipornography drive in august more 
than 1100 people involved in more than 700 cases have been tried 
and tens of millions of pornographic books and videotapes 
confiscated xinhua said 
last fall the evening news was filled with nightly reports 
showing mountains of books and videotapes going up in flames 
several thousand centers for producing and selling pornographic 
materials have also been destroyed xinhua said 
after the communists came to power in 1949 pornography and 
prostitution were virtually eliminated but they have made a 
comeback during the past decade as china has opened its doors

borderline high blood pressure often ignored by 
doctors can increase the chance of heart attack researchers said 
in a study released today 
i think what we can conclude from this study is that a 
condition that clinical practicioners tend to ignore can really 
lead to much more serious problems said the lead researcher dr 
stevo julius chief of the division of hypertension at the 
university of michigan 
results of the study were published in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
health records of nearly 1000 people in tecumseh mich 
between the ages of 18 and 38 were examined for high blood pressure 
since childhood of those studied 124 had borderline high blood 
pressure and also displayed slight damage to heart and blood 
vessels 
doctors long have held that high blood pressure or 
hypertension damages vital organs and can lead to heart attacks 
kidney failure and strokes but the new study is the first 
indication that borderline high blood pressure also can cause organ 
damage 
the report suggests that doctors need to reexamine the way they 
treat patients with borderline high blood pressure julius said in 
a telephone interview tuesday from ann arbor mich 
today the practice is to wait until a patient already has 
developed hypertension and then treat it with drugs julius 
said but high blood pressure is really only part of the 
problem 
julius said doctors need to prescribe exercise and dieting for 
people with borderline high blood pressure who also are overweight 
another symptom that usually precedes heart problems 
these people who we tend to disregard seem to have other 
problems as well he said we need to look at ways to treat 
them without committing these people to pills

the government released convicted anticastro 
terrorist orlando bosch to virtual house arrest and said he would 
be deported if a host country can be found 
among strict conditions the justice department imposed on bosch 
in exchange for his release tuesday was that he keep a log of 
everyone he comes into contact with and have his telephone 
monitored 
bosch said he would speak with whoever wanted to talk to him 
during the three miserable hours a day the 14point agreement 
allowed him to leave his house 
despite what he called his unfair imprisonment in the united 
states the cuban exile many in miami consider a hero said he 
wasnt bitter 
i love this country he said it is one of the greatest 
countries 
bosch called the conditions of his release ridiculous and 
said he would get around the demand to keep a visitors log by 
hanging a banner on his door telling callers to go away because 
there are no informants living here 
bosch 63 has spent the past 14 years in prison in venezuela 
and at the federal metropolitan correctional center outside miami 
boschs attorney hank adorno refused to discuss details of the 
agreement but took pains to say his client abandoned his violent 
opposition to the government of fidel castro 
he has renounced terrorism in any form whatsoever as a means 
of political action and as a means to free cuba from communism 
adorno said 
bosch said that in his long history of fighting for the freedom 
of cuba the government of the united states has built up a 
voluminous file against me titled terrorist 
nonetheless the government of the united states has never 
wanted to go into the depths of that file to understand that my 
persistence my insistence and even my intransigence are the 
product of a past a sinful past wherein the sovereignty and the 
freedom of my country were put in the balance and the right to 
belligerence was sacrificed in order to liberate cuba from its 
tyrannous oppressors he said 
an earlier agreement to free bosch fell through last week when 
he refused to keep a log of all visitors saying it would make him 
an informant 
justice department spokesman dan eramian in washington said 
bosch was released because he had renounced violence and said there 
had been no changes in the governments conditions 
the other conditions allow bosch to leave his home only between 
11 am and 2 pm he must wear a monitoring device allow 
unannounced searches of his home and must avoid any contact with 
militant anticastro groups 
bosch was convicted of the 1968 homemade bazooka attack on a 
polish freighter in the port of miami after serving his sentence 
he violated parole by leaving the country without permission 
venezuelan authorities later arrested him for allegedly 
masterminding the bombing of a cuban airliner in 1976 killing all 
73 aboard they held him for 11 years but failed twice to convict 
him and finally freed him to return to the united states 
bosch was arrested on his arrival in miami as an excludable 
or undesirable alien the ins released a report linking him to 
rightwing terrorist groups responsible for 50 bombings in miami 
new york and latin america 
government attorneys told a federal judge this year they tried 
to deport bosch to 31 countries but all refused cuba demanded 
bosch be returned for trial but us officials dismissed that 
possibility 
legally hes still excludable and if we can find a country to 
deport him to we will do so except for cuba eramian said

manfred totzauer senior trader at citibank in frankfurt said 
greenspans testimony before the senate banking committee will be a 
key indicator of the dollars next movements 
if he mentions inflation and puts weight on that then i can 
imagine the dollar will go higher but if he should put more weight 
on things like the economy and the banking situation and hints at 
further reduction in us interest rates then i think well see a 
lower dollar totzauer said 
a trader with a major us bank in milan thought greenspan would 
be cautious regarding statements on interest rate movements 
in my view following last weeks adjustment in the federal 
funds rate hes going to say interest rates should stay where they 
are for the time being were not seeing the signals from the 
economy that they should move lower the trader said

two environmental activists injured in a 
pipe bomb blast two months ago will not be charged in the 
explosion prosecutors said 
this takes a big weight off my shoulders earth first 
activist judi bari said after alameda county prosecutors announced 
tuesday that charges will not be filed against bari and darryl 
cherney in the car bombing 
were not filing charges our decision is based on the 
evidence presented and we determined its insufficient to obtain a 
conviction alameda county deputy district attorney chris 
carpenter said 
carpenter declined to elaborate on the evidence 
however mike roselle a founder of the radical environmental 
group said he understood one reason for not filing charges was 
that nails used to construct the homemade bomb did not match those 
found at the home of one of the injured activists 
defense lawyers for bari and cherney said the decision not to 
charge the pair exonerates their clients of wrongdoing in 
connection with the may 24 explosion in oakland 
i cant speak for the prosecutors but we view their action as 
confirmation of judi and darryls innocence said douglas 
horngrad a lawyer for cherney 
bari and cherney have contended that the car bomb blast on may 
24 was in retaliation for their work in organizing redwood 
summer protests against the lumber industry 
however they were arrested for investigation of explosives 
possession and transportation because police suspected they were 
carrying a device that went off accidentally 
from the moment the bomb went off under judis seat the 
oakland police department launched an investigation directed at 
them solely because they are political activists according to a 
joint statement issued by horngrad and susan jordan a lawyer for 
bari 
bari who suffered a broken pelvis in the explosion was 
released from oaklands highland hospital last week but continues 
to be treated at an undisclosed medical facility a hospital 
spokeswoman said tuesday 
although authorities have not publicly identified any other 
suspects oakland homicide lieutenant mike sims said the 
investigation will continue 
no one has been cleared and we havent excluded anyone sims

two cosmonauts who walked in space to fix their 
spacecraft had to use an emergency hatch to reenter the mir space 
station when the normal hatch failed to close completely soviet 
media reported today 
the two anatoly solovyev and alexander balandin spent seven 
hours outside the spacecraft tuesday repairing thermal insulation 
that had partially ripped apart and threatened to interfere with 
their safe return to earth tass said 
the official news agency said the crew after leaving the space 
station inspected the torn insulation on the soyuz tm9 capsule 
and with the help of metal clamps fixed the two loose shield 
fragments 
when the repair work was finished the cosmonauts faced a new 
problem the outer door to the entrance chamber would not close 
preventing them from achieving the hermetical seal needed to open 
the inner door 
tass said solovyev and balandin entered through a hatch in one 
of the space stations two scientific modules they sealed it 
hermetically and took off their space suits the news agency said 
the entire operation took about two hours longer than scheduled 
tass said ground controllers expressed confidence there would be 
no problems when the two cosmonauts return to earth on aug 9 
according to the results we have gotten so far we can 
almost definitely state that it the thermal insulation problem 
will not affect the landing said flight controller vladimir a 
solovyev in an interview from the baikonur space center in soviet 
central asia 
the report by the flight controller who is a former cosmonaut 
was broadcast live tuesday night by the evening news program vremya 
the program showed a fuzzy picture of the soyuz spacecraft with 
what appeared to be flapping thermal insulation part of the 
insulation has been flapping uselessly for months soviet officials 
extended the cosmonauts stay in space so they could make the 
repairs they had been scheduled to return july 30 after nearly six 
months in space 
the emergency repairs were the latest in a series of problems in 
the soviet unions manned space program which for decades has been 
a source of national pride for the past two years the program has 
been plagued by docking equipment malfunctions cosmonaut errors 
and budget cuts 
the damage probably occurred during the soyuz capsules launch 
feb 11 when a ground rescue structure apparently scratched the 
thermal blanket according to deputy flight director viktor blagov 
soviet officials have minimized the danger saying the capsule 
could withstand such damage to its thermal blanket the newspaper 
izvestia reported 
no one is concerned here it is an abnormal situation but 
controllable said vsyeva latyshev a spokesman at the soviet 
mission control center in kaliningrad north of moscow he spoke in 
a telephone interview 
but james oberg an american specialist on the soviet space 
program said that although the cosmonauts managed to climb back 
into mir safely the hatch problem could complicate future 
spacewalks 
the general crisis was not fully resolved oberg author of 
several books on the soviet space program said in a telephone 
interview wednesday from his texas home

the government today imposed direct 
federal rule in kashmir where indian security forces are battling 
to put down a rebellion by moslem separatists 
the action follows the killing tuesday of at least 29 moslem 
militants by indian security forces 
in the pakistani capital of islamabad meanwhile india and 
pakistan opened negotiations today aimed at repairing relations 
threatened by the rebellion in the disputed northern region 
relations between pakistan and india worsened in january when 
indian soldiers cracked down on moslem militants in kashmir who are 
seeking independence from india or union with pakistan at least 
792 people have been killed in kashmir since then india has 
accused pakistan of arming and training the militants a charge 
pakistan has denied 
before direct federal rule was imposed today on jammukashmir 
state it was administered temporarily by a governor a federal 
representative since jan 18 the announcement of federal rule 
reflected the belief that jammukashmir state was too unstable to 
be run by an elected local government 
on tuesday at least 29 militants were killed by indian security 
forces in kashmir the moslemdominated northern part of 
jammukashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign 
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules said 
21 militants were killed in a battle with the border security force 
in poonch 400 miles northwest of new delhi hours later in the 
same area troops killed eight militants who slipped across the 
border from pakistan said the officials 
the guards also arrested four militants and seized 14 automatic 
rifles two machine guns and two rocket launchers the officials 
said 
indian officials maintain that kashmiri militants regularly 
cross over to pakistan through the border and return by the same 
route after reciving arms training pakistan denies it is training 
or helping the militants but calls the separatist struggle a fight 
for selfdetermination 
india and pakistan have fought two previous wars over kashmir 
in 1948 and 1965 both were won by india 
about 65 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are 
moslems making it indias only moslem majority state nationwide 
moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people hindus 
make up 82 percent of the population 
kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with pakistan an 
islamic country but they have recently been fighting for total 
independence and the status of a neutral country

feuding shiite moslem militias fought with 
artillery and rockets in the south today at times hitting a plo 
force that had wedged between them in a bid to halt the fighting 
the 3dayold battle has left 63 people dead police said 
plo officials said their fighters would attack the 
iranianbacked hezbollah if it did not withdraw from the strategic 
hilltop village of jarjou which hezbollah seized from the rival 
shiite amal militia on tuesday 
the deployment of the 600member palestine liberation 
organization force tuesday placed it close to israels security 
zone in southern lebanon and has raised fears that the israeli 
army also will intervene 
hezbollah or party of god and the more secular 
syrianbacked amal ignored a call by the red cross for a sixhour 
truce so casualties littering the battle zone could be evacuated 
by police count 63 people have been killed and 218 wounded 
since monday when hezbollah attacked amals main stronghold in 
jarjou 
it is the fiercest clash in six months between amal and 
hezbollah they have been fighting on and off for three years for 
control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect more than 1100 people have been killed and more than 3350 
wounded in the inconclusive conflict 
zeid wehbe plo chief yasser arafats representative in lebanon 
said today that the palestinian force would enter jarjou if 
hezbollah did not withdraw from it within 24 hours 
hezbollah said tuesday that it would confront the plo and a 
party official warned that the palestinian deployment would trigger 
largescale violence 
the palestinians formed a 4milelong buffer between amal and 
hezbollah in the villages of sarba houmine and arab saleem west 
and south of jarjou 
the plo force drawn mainly from arafats mainstream fatah 
faction moved in after hezbollah fighters overran jarjou 10 miles 
southeast of the port city of sidon 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said todays clashes centered on a hill separating 
hezbollahheld jarjou from amal positions in arab saleem 
amal fighters were shelling the hill with rockets howitzers and 
mortars in an apparent effort to prevent hezbollah from 
controlling it he said hezbollah pounded arab saleem two miles 
south of jarjou in the panhandle of the socalled apple province 
police said shells were crashing around the plo forces 
headquarters in a mansion at the eastern edge of the village 
the plo wants to prevent hezbollah from gaining a badly needed 
coastal outlet while its supply lines through the syriancontrolled 
bekaa valley in eastern lebanon remain vulnerable 
the plo also does not want its reviving strength in the region 
or bases near sidon threatened by hezbollah 
lebanese leaders and newspapers said today that the plos 
intervention could provoke an israeli thrust into southern lebanon 
communist party leader george hawi said the current 
developments are expected to invite israeli intervention at a time 
when israel is looking for a pretext to strike at the plo and 
reestablish control over south lebanon 
israeli warplanes flew repeated reconnaissance missions over the 
embattled region on tuesday after the plo deployed 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to crush the plo which had 
become a virtual statewithinastate in lebanon arafats 
guerrillas were forced to evacuate the south and beirut 
but the plo has sent back at least 5000 guerrillas into the 
refugee camps around sidon the regions provincial capital 25 
miles south of beirut

prominent black government officials are 
puppets for an elite group of powerful white men said james h 
meredith a black civil rights pioneer who now works for 
conservative us sen jesse helms 
meredith a special assistant to the republican and the first 
black to attend the university of mississippi said tuesday 15 
white men pull the strings for many black leaders including the 
chairman of the democratic party the mayor of any city city 
councilmen in most cases in the big cities any high level position 
in city government 
he said he knew the names of the 15 men but refused to divulge 
them 
helms is being challenged in his reelection bid by democrat 
harvey gantt the black former mayor of charlotte 
meredith who was wounded during a freedom march in mississippi 
in 1965 has become in recent years a harsh critic of the 
civilrights establishment he has said a liberal elite wants 
to keep blacks in a secondclass position under the pretext of 
helping them 
when we went to mississippi my enemy was the white 
supremacists my enemy now is the white liberal he said earlier 
this year 
on monday meredith issued a news release printed on helms 
senate stationery announcing that many of the 3000 delegates who 
attended an naacp convention last weekend in los angeles are 
involved in drug use crime and immoral activities meredith stood 
by the allegation tuesday 
he also charged a cadre of white men control american black 
leaders 
the truth of the matter is that the liberal elite with 
knowledge and full thought on the part of the black elite have 
deliberately set up a phenomenon as part of their political power 
control of taking a handful of selected blacks giving them high 
rewards and using them to control the black population meredith 
said 
helms stood by his aide tuesday despite protests by leading 
black officials 
we call on sen jesse helms to disavow this statement and 
to take appropriate disciplinary action against mr meredith 
said benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people 
in a statement helms said it is his right to express his 
opinion and i would think the press would respect that even if he 
does not espouse the liberal ideas the press supports 
helms said he did not authorize merediths release but his only 
fault with his assistant was using senate stationery and free 
mailing privileges 
hooks refused to respond to merediths charges 
it would serve no useful purpose to address such ludicrous 
accusations from one who has obviously lost touch with reality 
hooks said 
meredith also accused black leaders and especially those in 
the leadership of the naacp and the democratic party of not 
caring 
i bet you there were not 10 people in that naacp convention 
who lived near the black community he said three thousand 
people dont have the right to sell the interest of 30 million 
people

iraqs foreign minister today accused 
neighboring kuwait of violating iraqs border and stealing 24 
billion worth of its oil 
the accusation by foreign minister tareq aziz marked a sharp 
escalation in baghdads campaign against fellow opec members who 
have been producing more oil than allowed by the oil cartels 
quotas kuwait and the united arab emirates have been the main 
targets of the iraqi campaign 
kuwait today dispatched officials to other arab nations to seek 
support 
azizs comment came in a letter to arab league secretarygeneral 
chadli klibi it was read over official radio and television 
stations 
despite our sincere efforts to continue our brotherly dialogue 
with them the kuwaiti officials are attempting to harm iraq and 
weaken it in a premeditated and deliberate way the letter 
declared 
in kuwait city the emirates capital the crown prince and 
prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah called the 
75member national council to a special session to discuss the 
iraqi allegations during the iraniraq war kuwait was one of 
iraqs staunchest allies 
the kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed later flew 
to saudi arabia to discuss the iraqi accusation and said he would 
visit other members of the sixnation gulf cooperation council to 
seek support the council groups saudi arabia kuwait qatar 
bahrain oman and the united arab emirates 
other top kuwaiti officials will visit egypt sudan djibouti 
somalia syria jordan and lebanon libya tunisia algeria 
morocco and mauritania the official kuwait news agency reported 
the collapse of oil prices blamed largely on the 
overproduction has cost iraq billions of dollars in lost revenue 
at a time when it is financially strapped because of the 198088 
war with iran 
its foreign debt runs at an estimated 6070 billion including 
30 billion provided mainly by kuwait and saudi arabia during the 
persian gulf war 
aziz warned that the alleged kuwaiti encroachment in southern 
iraq was tantamount to military aggression he did not say whether 
iraq would retaliate 
aziz claimed kuwait has set up military posts and drilled oil 
wells in iraqs southern rumaila field and has pumped 24 billion 
worth of oil since 1980 aziz said baghdad now expects kuwait to 
pay iraq that amount 
he said the iraqis have compiled a record of alleged kuwaiti 
encroachments along the 80mile border 
aziz accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of undermining 
arab unity by cheating on the quotas set by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries to bolster prices he called it a 
premeditated and deliberate plan to weaken iraq and undermine its 
economy and security 
this is a shortsighted selfish and dangerous view which 
causes great harm not only to iraq but to the whole arab nation 
aziz said president saddam hussein also criticized the two nations 
over the same issue tuesday 
kuwait has a quota of 15 million barrels a day but in recent 
months has been producing as much as 19 million barrels a day 
the united arab emirates has produced as much as 21 million 
barrels a day in recent months more than double its quota of 109 
million barrels a day 
this has helped drive prices down from the opec benchmark of 18 
a barrel to below 14 in recent weeks the iraqi president said a 
1 fall in the price of a barrel of crude costs iraq 1 billion a 
year he said iraq has lost 14 billion because of the price slump

asked south korea to send an economic delegation to moscow

establishment of diplomatic ties 
the soviet request was made in a letter to president roh taewoo 
also today a member of south koreas leading internationally 
acclaimed musical family said the group has been invited to perform 
in communist north korea and will go if the seoul government 
approves 
presidential spokesman lee soojung said the south korean 
delegation would leave for the soviet union next month 
gorbachevs letter dated july 6 and received monday was in 
response to an earlier letter from roh offering to send a 
highlevel delegation to moscow to discuss the normalization of 
relations between the two countries 
roh and gorbachev met in san francisco last month and agreed in 
principle to establish diplomatic relations between their once 
hostile countries the soviet union is an ally of south koreas 
rival communist north korea 
south korea has been eager to open formal relations with the 
soviet union in an effort to isolate communist north korea and 
increase its motivation to ease tensions on the divided korean 
peninsula 
a leading south korean newspaper the joongang daily news said 
this week that the soviet union is using seouls desire for 
normalization of relations to press for economic aid quoting 
unidentified government sources the paper said the soviet union is 
requesting a 15 billion economic package from south korea 
including a 5 billion loan 
the korean peninsula was divided into north korea and south 
korea in 1945

york and london have also been invited to perform in north koreas 
capital pyongyang the family said 
no date has been suggested for a visit to the north and the 
south korean government has not been formally asked for approval 
but a source close to the family said it should be considered 
timely that the three chungs will be together in south korea at the 
end of august 
south korean musicians have performed in north korea only once 
in the last four decades that was in 1985 and there have been no 
cultural or people exchanges since

a senate committee today approved a 125 
million bill aimed at improving math and science education for 
schoolchildren and increasing the number of persons seeking 
advanced degrees in the subjects 
the senate labor and human resources committee voted unanimously 
for the excellence in math science and engineering education act 
of 1990 that chairman edward kennedy dmass described as a 
down payment on the nations future 
i believe this bill is an excellent start on improving the 
nations mathscience education said kennedy pointing to the 
national education goal of making american students first in the 
world in math and science by the year 2000 
upgrading elementarysecondary education training graduate 
level scientists and engineers and increasing the participation of 
women and minorities are all central issues that urgently need our 
attention he said 
committee statistics showed that fourfifths of elementary 
school mathematics teachers are not fully qualified to teach math 
and twothirds of elementary school science teachers are not fully 
qualified to teach science 
a third of american high schools offer no physics course and 
many others offer no chemistry course us high school seniors 
ranked ninth in advanced physics in a survey of 13 countries and 
11th in advanced chemistry american students were last in advanced 
biology a study showed 
at the college level statistics showed less than 1 percent of 
last years freshman class planned to major in math compared with 
4 percent 20 years ago currently only 5 percent of us 
undergraduates earn bachelor of science degrees compared to 20 
percent in japan and 37 percent in germany 
in us graduate schools 50 percent of the engineering 
doctorate degrees are earned by foreign students 
the legislation estimated to cost 125 million in 1991 would 
create a national clearinghouse to collect and distribute 
instructional and program materials in science mathematics and 
technology it now goes to the full senate 
regional education programs also would be authorized under the 
bill as well as the mathscience teacher corps and a science 
scholars program the national science foundation would be allowed 
to double its graduate fellowship program and a traineeship program 
would be established so that graduate schools that do not currently 
have a large number of graduate fellows can attract highly talented 
students

a cuban court convicted 11 human rights 
activists of counterrevolutionary crimes today and meted out 
sentences ranging from three to 15 years the official cuban news 
agency prensa latina reported 
the convictions came one day after us officials in cuba 
protested the police beating and arrest of a man who entered the 
us diplomatic post in havana it was not immediately clear 
whether the man sought to join a dozen cubans seeking asylum in 
foreign compounds 
the sentences were announced early today after a 15hour trial 
before a provincial court prensa latina said in a dispatch 
monitored in mexico city 
it said the crimes ranged from terrorism and rebellion to having 
contacts with us officials in cuba 
the defendants were identified as members of prohuman rights 
youth a group organized in 1989 prensa latina said they were also 
linked to the outlawed prohuman rights party 
prensa latina said the defendants had planned to steal 
explosives to blow up the national library and the cuban institute 
of radio and television 
the agency said luis enrique linacero ivelise camejo jose luis 
martinez miguel fernandez and juan carlos sierra were sentenced to 
15 years in prison it said francisco rosado was sentenced to 10 
years and ares nasco and guillermo campos were given eightyear 
terms maria garcia moises vialart and guillermo santos were 
placed under house arrest for three years prensa latina said 
the incident tuesday at the us interests section of the swiss 
embassy occurred just eight days after small groups of cuban 
asylumseekers first began taking refuge in embassies 
twelve cubans voluntarily abandoned the czechoslovak embassy on 
monday and prensa latina said they would be allowed to go home 
after questioning 
the agency also quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying 
fidel castros communist government would never yield to pressure 
or blackmail by people seeking to leave the island 
the incidents at the embassies have attracted attention because 
similar moves by asylumseekers in east german embassies last year 
helped precipitate the fall of the hardline communist government 
in that country albania which like cuba has refused to adopt 
democratic reforms recently allowed hundreds of people who entered 
embassies in its capital to leave for new lives in the west 
in washington state department spokesman david denny said he 
did not know whether the appearance of the man tuesday morning at 
the us interests section was connected with the other cases of 
asylumseeking 
while he was on interests section grounds but before he could 
enter the building he was seized beaten and taken away by cuban 
police who entered us diplomatic property said denny 
us diplomats protested the action to the cuban foreign 
ministry he said 
the united states and cuba have had no formal diplomatic 
relations since 1960 each has designated another country to be its 
formal representative in the others capital switzerland in havana 
and czechoslovakia in washington 
officials and news reports said three cuban asylumseekers who 
took refuge last week remained at the spanish embassy four were at 
the italian ambassadors residence and five cubans were in the 
apartment of czechoslovak charge daffaires jan doemoek 
an official at the italian foreign ministry in rome said today 
that italy does not expect cuba to allow the four to leave the 
country but does expect guarantees for their safety 
the cuban foreign ministry said in the statement carried by 
prensa latina that the 12 cubans who left the czechoslovak embassy 
on monday would not face prosecution it also indicated they would 
not be allowed to leave cuba 
cuba and czechoslovakia were close allies until last falls 
democratic upheaval toppled pragues hardline communist leaders

public schools should be declared 
commercialfree zones to protect children from the increasing 
prevalence of advertising disguised as educational materials a 
consumer group says 
in a study consumers union warned tuesday that many purported 
teaching aids donated by businesses contain pitches for those 
businesses products some of the comeons are direct others 
surreptitious it said 
schools often acquiesce to the handouts because they cant 
afford to buy unbiased new materials the report said students 
fall victim it charged because they are unlikely to question 
advertising disguised as schoolwork 
the result schools are becoming heavily sponsored by 
corporations marketing products the report said theyre 
selling the kids entrusted to them to any bidder 
the study also criticized other forms of advertising aimed at 
children including ads in childrens magazines that are disguised 
as editorial copy the use of celebrities to promote products ads 
camouflaged as entertainment and licensing deals that put popular 
symbols on a vast array of products 
interest in the issue of advertising in schools was heightened 
last year by the advent of channel one a video news program for 
pupils that includes commercials schools receive the program and 
viewing equipment free 
the report called channel one the tip of the iceberg and 
listed examples of selfpromotion in corporatesupplied teaching 
materials it said such materials reach more than 20 million 
students a year although it did not estimate what proportion 
include advertising 
one example was the polaroid education program which the 
report said mentions polaroid in every lesson and assignment 
another was a good nutrition program from chef boyardee that 
names its products in all recipes and just encourages kids to 
eat pizza no nutrition education 
polaroid spokesman harry johnson said its program was designed 
by educators to use instant photos as a teaching tool for 
example by having children take pictures and write about them the 
aim is to teach kids he said although the program does make a 
profit through camera and film sales 
theres no question that it is out of our marketing division 
and we have no embarrassment about that johnson said 
obviously it is a market to which we sell 
at american home products owner of the chef boyardee brand 
spokeswoman linda mulrenan said she wanted to see the report before 
commenting 
among other issues it raised the report criticized childrens 
shopping clubs kids voluntarily join and usually pay for a 
vehicle that will do little more than advertise to them 
regularly it said 
it suggested that children join such clubs because they like 
the idea of belonging to generally it said children are not 
sophisticated enough to spot hidden advertising or to reject goods 
that are overpriced poorly made or of little use 
advertising to kids should be designed to respect their 
special nature their openness inexperience and vulnerability to 
peer pressure said charlotte baecher a consumers union official 
the report proposed designating schools as commercialfree 
zones having childrens magazines refuse ads disguised as 
editorial matter improving regulation of childrens shopping clubs 
and banning liquor and tobacco companies from paying to place their 
products in movies 
consumers union publishes consumer reports magazine and a 
similar publication for children zillions neither accepts ads

commuters raced through the hollywood freeway 
today over part of a subway tunnel that was devastated by a blaze 
officials say they may have to excavate the site to find what 
sparked the fire 
the state department of transportation opened three out of four 
southbound lanes tuesday afternoon and the five northbound lanes 
opened earlier tuesday the last lane will probably remain closed 
for several days because it was closest to the metro rail tunnel 
that burned and collapsed last week said margie tiritilli a 
caltrans spokeswoman 
we have to be sure the workers are safe she said 
vibrations from the traffic could cause crumbling its still a 
little unstable 
the 1mile section of us 101 remains closed to large trucks 
tiritilli said california highway patrol officers were stationed 
to enforce the rule 
meanwhile investigators with the district attorneys office and 
the city fire department said they may have to excavate a 100foot 
collapsed section of the tunnel to determine the cause of fridays 
fire 
the metro rail tunnels prime contractor john tutor said 
tuesday that repairs would cost between 500000 and 1 million and 
delay completion of the structure by 60 to 90 days the original 
deadline was sept 16

new york yankees owner george steinbrenner told 
the baseball commissioner he paid a gambler 40000 because he 
feared the man would harm him or his family a newpaper reported 
today 
the national sports newspaper quoting from a transcript of 
steinbrenners hearing with commissioner fay vincent on july 56 
said steinbrenner also feared gambler howard spira would reveal 
information about two employees who stole from the team and on 
alleged gambling habits of former yankee player manager and 
general manager lou piniella who now manages the cincinnati reds 
the newspaper said vincent repeatedly chastised steinbrenner for 
failing to contact either legal authorities or the commissioners 
office depite his avowed fear of spira and his concern about making 
a payment to a known gambler against the advice of his own legal 
advisers 
steinbrenner said he gave spira the money to get out of town 
spiras lawyer david s greenfield said today that 
steinbrenners account was unbelievable this guy changes the 
story about what happened more often than he changes managers 
greenfield said 
vincent said tuesday he would cof an amfm radio said jason 
richards of the ohiobased radio association defending airwave 
rights or radar 
james baxter head of the national motorists association in 
dane wis which defends radar detectors and opposes the 55 
mileperhour speed limit said the petition is part of an effort 
to get all radar detectors banned 
tom donohue president of the american trucking associations 
which represents 4500 truck companies said his group backs police 
efforts to catch speeding truckers and opposes radar detectors 
the only reason youd want to have one in a truck is to drive 
faster than you ought to said donohue 
steve campbell a former louisiana state trooper who is now 
safety director for the trucking group said all major truck 
companies have policies against radar detectors although 
independent operators may be using them 
we want to get all the bad guys off the highways because they 
make it bad for our good guys campbell said 
chuck hurley of the insurance institute for highway safety said 
opponents of the detectors have little hope of an allout ban but 
believe the bush administration might support a ban for commercial 
vehicles under statutes that allow the federal government to 
regulate equipment on interstate trucks 
we think there is a much more enlightened attitude on the 
part of transportation secretary samuel skinner and other 
officials he said 
also signing the petition were the advocates for highway and 
auto safety public citizen and the national association of 
governors highway safety representatives hurley said the 
inclusion of state safety officials should overcome any 
administration view that detector bans should be left to the states 
the reagan administration turned down a similar petition in 
1988 citing that argument 
hurley acknowledged that there is no study linking detectors 
directly to accidents but he pointed to studies tying speed to 
highway deaths and a new institute survey finding that truckers 
using radar detectors are more likely than those without detectors 
to drive faster than 70 mph 
the study was based on the use of a new detector that can 
identify vehicles using the units 
the institutes checks of highways in seven states showed usage 
of detectors by tractortrailer trucks ranging from 37 percent in 
virginia where detectors are outlawed to 52 percent in delaware 
other results included 38 percent in maryland and new york 40 
percent for connecticut where they also are outlawed 41 percent 
in new jersey and 46 percent in pennsylvania 
all of the surveyed states have a 55 mph speed limit for trucks

the presidents of west germany and 
czechoslovakia will meet with kurt waldheim on july 26 ending four 
years of virtual isolation for the austrian head of state from 
foreign leaders officials said today 
cypriot president georgios vassiliou has been the only western 
head of state to officially visit the austrian president who has 
been shunned by foreign officials for concealing his past as a 
german intelligence officer in world war ii the meeting with 
vassiliou occurred early in july 
president richard von weizsaecker of west germany and his 
czechoslovak counterpart vaclav havel will see waldheim during 
the opening of the annual salzburg festival said kurt skalnik 
waldheims spokesman 
havel comes to salzburg as a writer and private person to 
act as keynote speaker at the festivals opening ceremony a 
festival organizer said 
havels arrival had been in doubt the prague daily lidove 
noviny reported today he would refrain from the trip to austria 
but the czechoslovak state news agency ctk said the report was 
incorrect it quoted havels press spokesman as saying the 
president would visit salzburg as planned 
both skalnik and a presidential spokesman in bonn said von 
weizsaecker and waldheim were expected to meet on the occasion 
waldheim a former un secretarygeneral came under fire at 
home and abroad for initially concealing his wartime service in 
yugoslavia and greece as an intelligence officer serving with the 
invading army of nazi germany 
an international commission of historians in a report issued in 
february 1987 did not confirm allegations waldheim was implicated 
in war crimes but said he must have known about wartime atrocities 
committed by his unit 
waldheim has consistently denied any wrongdoing he has insisted 
the charges made by the world jewish congress and other 
international critics were designed to prevent his election as 
president and later to force him to resign 
the vienna daily die presse reported von weizsaecker and havel 
will travel by helicopter to salzburg from bayreuth where they 
will attend the music festival associated with the composer richard 
wagner

prime minister margaret thatcher in a letter made 
public today said that even though the united states has broken 
off direct contact with the plo it has urged britain to maintain 
ties with the group 
we do not think it would be wise to break off our contacts 
with the plo indeed the americans have urged us to maintain 
them mrs thatcher said in a letter to british jewish leaders 
the united states suspended its dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization after it failed to explicitly condemn a 
palestinian raid on an israeli beach in may 
the president of the board of deputies of british jews had urged 
mrs thatcher to do the same the group made public the letter she

sudan struggling to fight a huge budget 
deficit and move toward a market economy said today it will lay 
off about 50000 government workers within a month 
the move which will reduce the government work force by 10 
percent is part of a threeyear economic reform program launched 
last month 
the package included increases of up to 50 percent in the prices 
of commodities including gasoline tea and cigarettes 
sudans economic woes have been compounded by a 7yearold civil 
war that is costing the government an estimated 1 million a day 
the country owes about 13 billion to foreign creditors 
in 1986 the international monetary fund declared sudan 
ineligible for further loans at the time it was 220 million in 
arrears to the imf 
sudan has since tried to get back into the imfs good graces 
through belttightening reforms including the new economic 
program but the government insists the reforms are not due to 
international pressure 
finance and economic planning minister abdelrahim hamdi said 
the layoffs of government workers will save about 130 million a 
year 
he told a meeting of government economic experts that the 
workers to be laid off will come from all government ministries 
except public health education and security 
he said the government also was considering plans to encourage 
early retirement and leaves without pay

another codefendant of former panamanian leader 
manuel noriega was in custody today after panamanian authorities 
extradited him to face drugtrafficking charges 
amet paredes son of former top panamanian military official and 
noriega rival gen ruben dario paredes arrived tuesday in miami 
but federal authorities refused to release further details 
paredes attorney joel rosenthal said his client turned 
himself over to drug enforcement administration officials in panama 
on tuesday morning 
basically its time to get this thing behind him one way or 
another rosenthal said 
a february 1988 indictment alleges that paredes smuggled cocaine 
from panama to the united states and arranged protection for other 
drug trafficking activities with noriega if convicted on all 
counts he faces 95 years in prison and 1025000 in fines 
amet is the seventh defendant arrested in the noriega case one 
has pleaded guilty and the others including noriega are awaiting 
trial 
noriega surrendered jan 4 to the us force that invaded panama 
and is being held on charges of accepting 46 million in bribes 
from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a way 
station for usbound cocaine 
published reports in march said federal authorities were trying 
to negotiate with paredes father for testimony against noriega 
and were offering a plea bargain for the son but the us 
attorneys office refused comment 
rosenthal did not deny negotiations had taken place but said 
there was no plea bargain and that his client would plead innocent 
rosenthal said paredes had been living at home until he turned 
himself in tuesday asked why us authorities had not arrested 
paredes in the seven months since the us invasion of panama 
rosenthal said ask the dea 
dea spokesman john fernandes said that by policy the federal 
government refuses any comment on the noriega case 
in 1983 the elder paredes attempted to become the leader of 
panama but noriega derailed the effort by withholding the 
militarys support 
according to the indictment amet paredes used his connections 
with noriega and another man cesar rodriguez to obtain protection 
for drug shipments to the united states 
rodriguez and amets brother ruben dario paredesjimenez were 
killed outside medellin colombia in 1986 the two men were trying 
to make arrangements with the medellin cartel to acquire a load of 
cocaine the government says

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
july 15 
from the providence ri sunday journal on the economic summit 
for years the united states canada and some other big food 
exporters have battled to get europeans to reduce or eliminate the 
web of tariffs export subsidies price supports and other 
protections that maintain the jobs of millions of their small and 
inefficient but politically powerful farmers 
the european communitys agricultural system costs europeans as 
much as 100 billion a year and seriously distorts world trade 
but it is politically almost sacrosanct a kind of fortress 
europe 
leaders at the allied summit in houston agreed more clearly 
than ever before that agriculture subsidies and other protections 
should be phased out especially important is that for the first 
time europeans specifically promised to reduce their price 
supports export subsidies and tariffs and all the participants 
said they would go to a common instrument of measure which should 
make it easier to reduce and regulate agricultural protectionism 
 
the first world including europe desperately wants these 
changes and the fact that europeans have just now agreed to 
specific revisions in agricultural policies is no coincidence for 
without a major reduction in agricultural protectionism 
international trade negotiations may very easily collapse 
the houston summit may have well be seen as a major step toward 
draining the ec wine lake tearing down its cheese mountain and 
creating the groundwork for a prosperous decade

philadelphia daily news on the federal death penalty 
if you ever need an idea reduced to absolute idiocy run it 
through the united states congress 
the honorables have been reading polls showing that americans 
care very little about government even about thievery on the 
grandest scale ever 
the polls also show theres only one thing we care about we are 
frustrated and want to act on that frustration so we want to 
execute somebody anybody 
the honorables tacked the death penalty onto virtually 
everything thats illegal the socalled omnibus crime law should 
lead to wholesale slaughter unseen since the romans dragged 
unfortunates into lion cages for the entertainment of the populace 
dont fear a veto death fans george bush has never been a man 
to let principles stand in the way of a few cheap votes this could 
mean many cheap votes 
he may even pull the switch to open the annual execution

long beach calif presstelegram on the senates anticrime 
bill 
whats so bad about the senates omnibus crime bill mainly that 
it proposes to fight crime with symbols and halfsteps and 
temporary twitches it bans for example the sale or manufacture 
of nine kinds of semiautomatic weapons for three years language 
that is touted as a major defeat for the national rifle 
association but a temporary ban must be only a temporary 
solution and in any event the senate list is too short 
some provisions are indisputably laudable one specifically 
targets the crooks behind the sampl crisis another provides 
scholarships for students who will agree to work in law enforcement 
for four years after graduating from college another provides 900 
million in extra funds for state and local law enforcement 
agencies 
to control crime effectively you must control more than nine 
kinds of semiautomatics you must control all weapons especially 
their sale and ownership

the record hackensack nj on mayor marion barry 
no matter how many witnesses the defense calls in the monthold 
drug and perjury trial of mayor marion barry of washington dc 
it will be hard to erase the images called to mind with the 
devastating testimony of prosecution witnesses the mayor taking 
drugs in hotel rooms restaurants and private homes the mayor 
having drugs delivered to his office the mayor of the nations 
capital at the mercy of a devouring addiction that went on for 
years 
maybe barry was too far gone to help himself long before he 
ended up in a hotel room surrounded by federal agents the question 
really isnt whether the governments sting operation was 
justified the question is why all these socalled friends of the 
mayor didnt help him sooner he didnt need their drugs he needed

charleston wva daily mail on prosecuting prominent black 
politicians 
naacp director benjamin hooks has called for an end to what he 
labels a campaign of harassment and selective prosecution of 
prominent black politicians including washington dc mayor 
marion barry 
he cites a list of investigations of other black leaders 
including los angeles mayor tom bradley new york mayor david 
dinkins and rep william gray of pennsylvania 
it would be nice to think that no elected officials black or 
white would go astray but the odds are that some will no matter 
what race color or sex they are there are plenty of white 
officials who have been investigated and found guilty of wrongdoing 
in making his charge hooks shows no evidence that black leaders 
are being singled out for scrutiny there probably is an argument 
that prosecutors like to go after big names and certainly being the 
mayor of new york los angeles or washington dc constitutes 
being a celebrity 
however that in itself shows progress in civil rights these 
black leaders were chosen by a racially mixed population there was 
a day when that wouldnt have happened 
there is a responsibility that goes with holding high government 
positions some leaders live up to what is expected and others 
dont indeed there is a long list of successful black politicians 
but when hooks makes a racial issue out of those few who falter 
he tends to detract from the many other blacks who have entered 
politics and succeeded

theres not been much good news for the national aeronautics and

after getting over the shock of the challenger disaster it 
appeared that the agency was again a going concern but nasa is now 
coming under political fire and experiencing a loss of public 
trust it certainly cannot afford either 
something is basically amiss at the space agency and more

a federal government study concludes that an occasional 
inflight nap helps pilots to cope with the tensions of landing 
after a long hop on first thought this seems a trifle disquieting 
no one relishes the idea of the pilot sawing wood up there in the 
cockpit of a jetliner trundling 300 people through the sky 
reflection suggests that maybe its not so bad after all 
encouraging the pilot to catch 40 winks now and again to keep his 
brain alert and his reflexes sharp one consideration does come to 
mind call it a caveat addressed to the cabin crew dont take 
your naps all at the same time boys leave someone awake to mind

neglectful actually response by washington to the aids outbreak 
has been unprecedented billions of dollars have been spent for 
treatment research and testing 
this year alone 169 billion has been requested which far 
exceeds budgets of other diseases claiming many times more lives as 
aids expenditures since 1981 when the disease was first 
identified have been huge and hugely disproportionate aids has 
killed 83000 americans in nine years heart disease kills that 
many every six weeks 
aids victims deserve care and treatment but it is hard to see 
from where they derive the claim to be first in line ahead of 
those dying of leukemia and breast cancer and stroke for the

for 11 days 4700 delegates to the soviet communist party 
congress met the party leader and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev has been catching it from all sides 
these communist party meetings used to be behind closed doors 
they have become much more interesting to americans now that 
theyre open to the worlds press soviet politicians are speaking 
out and soviet people are arguing and squabbling just about like 
everybody else 
as the party meeting began criticism against gorbachev came 
from those who oppose his reforms the old party hacks gave him 
unshirted hell and it began to appear that he was going to be 
dumped 
then gorbachev was reelected general secretary by an easy 
3to1 margin the party was intact again one reason being there 
was no real challenger to gorbachev and no alternative to the 
communist party which has tightly ruled the country since 1917 or 
so it seemed 
then came boris yeltsins bombshell yeltsin the onetime 
gorbachev protege and former politburo member who gorbachev fired 
as moscow party leader three years ago 
yeltsin announced he was quitting the communist party he 
said he no longer could be guided by the party alone i must obey 
the will of the people 
gorbachev wed say continues to live dangerously walking a 
tight rope between change and stability how will it all turn out

again soviet president mikhail gorbachev seems almost to be 
preparing the way as in his lifting of the partys grip on the 
staterun media the state of the communist party is such that 
its not even a certainty it can survive thus being deprived of 
such an important propaganda tool

moving beyond the need for more reform what the party congress and

president george bush is not in the habit of asking china to 
eliminate its more serious human rights abuses so he probably 
wont like the bill sponsored by senate majority leader george 
mitchell that would tie human rights to the continuance of 
mostfavorednation status for china 
the president appears determined to ignore how badly misguided 
are the current us policies toward the government of china 
despite ample evidence of chinas brutal human rights record its 
arms sales to the khmer rouge in cambodia and its refusal to allow 
free emigration by defending the mostfavorednation status for 
china the president betrays the courageous beijing protesters who 
sought democracy and tells the world that the united states places 
economics above human rights

reduced wind gave firefighters in eastern oregon a boost in 
battling forest fires and better weather today helped their 
counterparts in idaho hold the line against blazes there 
the largest blaze in oregon was the 1060acre corral basin fire 
22 miles southwest of john day but officials were confident of 
stopping it 
its been a lucky day for us we were really worried the 
erratic winds would whip up the fire but they died down and 
actually helped us in spots heidi bigler of the us forest 
service said tuesday 
forests also burned in montana and washington state and a new 
small fire was reported in yellowstone national park more than 100 
fires continued in the vast interior of alaska but fires in utah 
were reduced to hot spots 
the corral basin fire was 60 percent contained with fewer spot 
fires than monday when gusty wind sent flames shooting nearly 150 
feet into the air bigler said the blaze was burning in forests of 
lodgepole and ponderosa pine and spruce mixed with meadows in steep 
terrain 
the grass is still green so the spread has been from treetop 
to treetop and hasnt really affected efforts on the ground 
bigler said 
about 800 firefighters were assigned to the blaze 
in the rugged backcountry of westcentral idaho hundreds of 
firefighters dug in today as fire bosses tried to take advantage of 
improving weather conditions 
after windwhipped flames obliterated fire lines early tuesday 
crews managed to hold their own against the wildfire over night 
it looks like it laid down pretty well and theres a little 
more humidity today boise national forest spokesman ken kiser 
said 
the nightly mapping flight with infrared cameras showed no 
growth in the fire that nearly quadrupled in size 24 hours earlier 
driven by high temperatures low humidity and gusting winds 
the blaze was started by a lightning strike sunday 
about 75 mostly small fires started last week by lightning 
continue to burn this week in oregon and washington said ralph 
satterberg of the northwest interagency coordination center in 
portland 
the largest fire in washington state was the 900acre 
yellowjacket fire in a remote area of the gifford pinchot national 
forest satterberg said 
in montana more than 1000 firefighters remained on the fire 
line as officials try to minimize damage from the gird point fire 
to a scenic mountain roadway between hamilton and philipsburg 
the wind slackened tuesday after more than quadrupling the size 
of the fire the day before and by evening the 2500acre fire had 
slowed considerably said bitterroot national forest fire 
information officer bill rockwell 
elsewhere while nearly a week of rain in alaskas interior gave 
firefighters a needed break the return of warm and dry conditions 
had state and federal lands officials warily watching the weather 
despite the rain 115 fires continued to burn in alaska down 
from a high of more than 200 last week said sue mitchell a 
spokeswoman for the federal bureau of land management 
in utah firefighters remained on the scene of a brush fire in 
the foothills of the oquirrh mountains today in case winds 
rekindled a 1500acre blaze that previously threatened homes in 
the area 
basically everything has been taken care of all were doing 
is keeping crews there to monitor and watch for any hot spots that 
might flare up in the wind we just want to be sure it doesnt 
rekindle said assistant salt lake county fire chief john corak

czechoslovak embassies are 
spyfree but have been so only since june 30 deputy foreign 
minister lubos dobrovsky said wednesday 
dobrovsky reacting to reports that two czechoslovaks were 
expelled from the netherlands earlier this year for trying to get 
nato documents said all czechoslovak missions were free of 
intelligence agents as of the end of last month 
under the communists east european countries used their 
missions as espionage centers dobrovsky said the situation was the 
same in czechoslovakia but one of the first acts of foreign 
minister jiri dienstbier was the decision to recall all those 
officials 
the recalls were gradual but nondiplomatic activities 
were stopped immediately dobrovsky stressed 
now there are only employees of foreign ministry at our 
embassies he said 
he did not go into details on the activities of the two 
czechoslovaks removed from the netherlands but said their 
departure was a czechoslovak decision and was not prompted by a 
dutch request 
a dutch foreign ministry spokeswoman said earlier this week that 
one of the diplomats left early this year and the other in early 
june after their recall was requested by the dutch government

president bush met with republican senators 
today and gave his backing to a new gop proposal that would avoid 
quotas in a major civil rights bill against job discrimination the 
lawmakers said 
the president wants to sign a bill and he wants us to work it 
out said sen john c danforth an author of the proposed 
compromise 
danforth said bush has supported his plan but he refused to 
give specifics 
bush met with senate minority leader bob dole danforth and 
sens arlen specter of pennsylvania and james jeffords of vermont 
in an effort to rekindle the negotiations with democrats led by 
sen edward kennedy dmass and civil rights leaders 
the whole message here was do it get it done if there is 
any possible way to work out an agreement for a bill that the 
president can sign we are supposed to do that said danforth 
on tuesday the white house renewed a veto threat against the 
kennedy civil rights bill unless it is shorn of what bush regards 
as quotas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush in a speech before the national council of la raza told 
the hispanic group we renew the fight for a civil rights bill 
today i need your help to make the changes needed to ensure a bill 
that does not result in quotas 
quoting frederick douglasss words from 1871 that equality of 
numbers has nothing to do with equality of attainment bush said 
we all know quotas arent right theyre not fair they divide 
society instead of bringing people together 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
specter told reporters our instructions from the president 
were to go back to work and solve the problem and we are determined 
to do that 
he said all sides agree on the need to overturn last years 
supreme court ruling in the wards cove case that narrowed 
protection against job bias and to return to the earlier supreme 
court interpretation that had prevailed since 1971 
bush has said the kennedy bill would force employers to resort 
to jobhiring quotas to protect themselves against discrimination 
suits by disgruntled workers 
the heart of the dispute is over defining when business 
necessity justifies hiring practices that may result in low numbers 
of minority workers 
the senate after a bitter debate thursday voted 6238 earlier 
to limit debate on the civil rights bills that brought an angry 
reaction from dole who said republicans were being muzzled the 
two sides later returned to the bargaining table 
white house chief of staff john sununu scurried to capitol hill 
tuesday night for talks with kennedy and others that stretched past 
midnight but failed to produce a compromise 
sununu complained tuesday that kennedy had reneged on a deal 
struck with the administration last week kennedy denied they had 
signed off on a deal 
provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in 
the workplace to punitive damages for victims of intentional 
discrimination 
most controversial has been a provision that would make it 
easier to bring a court challenge to any company with an employee 
work force that does not mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the 
local labor pool 
a company then would have to prove that its hiring practices 
were justified by business necessity that would overcome the most 
controversial of five 1989 supreme court rulings on job bias 
addressed by the bill 
the high court in a case involving a salmon cannery in alaska 
ruled that it was up to the plaintiffs to prove the practices were 
not motivated by business necessity 
critics including the administration and business groups say 
the bill would encourage employers to use hiring quotas to avoid 
being sued

a prostitute quoted in newsweek as saying 
she continued selling sex despite being infected with aids was 
released from jail after prosecutors chose not to pursue attempted 
murder charges 
end of case said a public defender donald greenberg after 
his client linda kean was freed tuesday 
kean 36 was ordered released after admitting in municipal 
court to violating probation in a prostitution case under a plea 
bargain she was sentenced to 23 days in jail with credit for time 
already served 
kean who didnt appear at the hearing had been jailed in lieu 
of 1500 bail since her june 25 arrest in oakland 
the arrest came after she was featured in a newsweek article on 
aids the article included a picture of the selfconfessed heroin 
addict posed provocatively against a lamppost the caption quoted 
kean as saying she contracted the aids virus from contaminated 
needles but continued to sell sex 
she has denied the comments but after she was released she told 
a reporter she made up the story about being infected with the aids 
virus 
i was dope sick kean told the tribune of oakland what 
did you want me to do i needed the money 
a newsweek spokeswoman today confirmed that kean was given 60 
despite a magazine policy of not paying for stories the magazine 
has stood by the story 
in this case after the photo was shot the subject was given 
60 karen wheeler said in a statement from new york 
immediately after this was discovered by the top editors they 
reminded all concerned of the magazines commitment to that 
policy 
from the start prosecutors were reluctant to pursue attempted 
murder charges against kean who said she now plans to move to los 
angeles 
we never really wanted the attempted murder case but it 
kind of got laid at our doorsteps said deputy alameda county 
district attorney james casey for one thing its always nice to 
have a victim and we just didnt 
greenberg said even if police keep bringing cases like this i 
dont think were going to see any attempted murder charges filed 
against any aids infected prostitutes unless there are some 
bizarre set of facts 
oakland police had pushed the case by asking a judge to force 
kean to take a test for the aids virus 
the case renewed debate over a california law that requires aids 
testing of prostitutes as a condition of probation 
alameda county health officials have criticized the law which 
took effect last year but has not been enforced here san 
franciscos municipal court began enforcing the law on tuesday 
this is a wrongful use of a medical test said dr robert 
benjamin director of the communicable disease division of the 
alameda county health department its punitive rather than being 
preventative or educational 
under the law if prostitutes on probation test positive for the 
aids virus and are later arrested for prostitution they may be 
charged with a felony and face several years in prison if convicted 
usually prostitution is a misdemeanor that can bring jail time 
if there are prior convictions 
the policy is discriminatory as well benjamin said if 
the goal is to stop the spread of aids shouldnt we be testing the 
johns too they could be spreading aids even easier than the 
prostitutes

fierce battles raged wednesday in the 
south between rival shiite moslem factions and the plo warned it 
will evict the proiranian hezbollah from a hilltop village unless 
it withdraws in 24 hours 
police said at least 64 shiites have been killed and 218 wounded 
in three days of fighting between the fundamentalist hezbollah or 
party of god and the more secular amal backed by syria 
six palestine liberation organization guerrillas were wounded by 
hezbollah fire on a palestinian force that intervened to halt the 
intrashiite bloodbath a police spokesman said 
the palestinian deployment in the disputed region placed yasser 
arafats guerrillas close to israels selfproclaimed security 
zone and raised fears of israeli reprisals 
the shiite factions ignored a red cross appeal for a ceasefire 
to remove the bodies in the apple province shells exploded all day 
near the hilltop village of jarjou shrouding the wooded slopes 
with smoke and fire 
the 600member plo force moved in tuesday after hezbollah 
overran jarjou stripping amal of a major stronghold 
on wednesday zeid wehbe arafats representative in lebanon 
gave hezbollah 24 hours to withdraw from the village or we will 
find ourselves obliged to enter jarjou by our means 
he said the intervention ordered by arafat enjoys the 
blessing and support of all the arabs wehbe spoke in the 
southern provincial capital of sidon 10 miles northwest of jarjou 
hezbollah had rejected the palestinian deployment and 
threatened to confront the plo a hezbollah official warned that 
the plo move would lead to largescale violence 
hezbollah and amal shelled each other over the plo force 
manning a 4milelong buffer that stretches from sarba to arab 
saleem just south of jarjou 
the shiite factions fired howitzers mortars and multibarreled 
rocket launchers that fire 32 rounds a minute 
the fighting is the fiercest in six months between the two 
factions which have been battling on and off for three years for 
control of lebanons 12 million shiites the shiite make up the 
countrys largest sect 
so far 1112 people have been killed and 3369 wounded in the 
inconclusive conflict 
scores of cars packed with children mattresses and suitcases 
could be seen speeding out of the region 
ali hujeij said he was taking his wife and four children to 
stay with relatives in sidon until this is over 
we dont care who controls what just let them stop the 
shelling hujeij said 
the communist party leader george hawi warned the current 
developments are expected to invite israeli intervention at a time 
when israel is looking for a pretext to strike at the plo and 
reestablish control over south lebanon 
we call on the warring factions to stop fighting in light of 
the prevailing serious situation and we plead with our brothers in 
the plo not to get involved further and realize that their 
deployment could lead to israeli repercussions 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to crush the plo arafats 
guerrillas were forced to evacuate the south and beirut 
at least 5000 plo guerrillas have returned into the refugee 
camps around sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
israeli warplanes flew reconnaissance missions over the 
embattled region tuesday after the plo deployed 
on monday israels air force commander maj gen avihu binnun 
said he may launch a preemptive strike to eliminate reported 
palestinian preparations for air attacks on the jewish state 
i would advise all those who threaten us like abul abbas and 
his friends to guard their training bases and sources of equipment 
and to think well before using such threats binnun said 
the palestine liberation front led by mohammed abbas also 
known as abul abbas carried out an abortive seaborne raid on 
israel on may 30 president bush suspended an 18monthold dialogue 
with the plo when arafat stalled on meeting washingtons demand for 
expelling abbas from the plos ruling executive committee

take a notorious mass murderer add references 
to a greek tragedy and the 1970s television show hawaii fiveo 
throw in a little twin peaks surrealism and you have the 
makings of a very strange evening 
the manson family by john moran is billed as a music 
drama but it has no formal plot 
it premiered tuesday night at the lincoln centers alice tully 
hall and was to be repeated wednesday 
the multimedia theater piece takes off from but does not 
exactly depict the august 1969 murders of actress sharon tate and 
six other people by members of charles mansons cult family 
images flash across screens behind and besides the performers 
a monotonous animation of the center line of a road quick gruesome 
still shots of bodies drenched in red light a hippie bed of 
flowers above cryptic words appear sometimes pertaining to the 
scene below here is a manson girl and sometimes not its a 
train dad 
the piece is scored by 25yearold moran who studied with 
composer philip glass the actors sing speak and pantomime amidst 
the shifting backdrops and quirky music 
moran and director bob mcgrath 35 compared the manson murders 
to the bacchae the fifthcentury bc greek drama in which the 
god dionysus leads the women of thebes in frenzied and deadly 
religious rites 
the manson family isnt subtle about drawing the connection 
the investigator is called steve pentheus after euripides 
pentheus dionysus antagonist 
the character is also steve mcgarrett from hawaii five0 
played by mk harris he is a stunning lookalike of a young jack 
lord 
pentheus also is a stentorian version of kyle mclachlans 
special agent cooper on twin peaks saying things like to be 
respectful of reality is to be law enforcement and well 
welcome to reality you druggedout hippie 
manson played by daniel harnett harangues his family of 
spacy women in a highpitched voice that recalls the real mansons 
his babble is somehow believable in the stonedout context that 
its delivered but ridiculous if excerpted 
at one point a young manson is sentenced by a florida judge 
wearing boxer shorts at another during the tate murder trial he 
lunges at the judge a scene that is repeated over and over and 
over and over 
the theater piece is performed by the ridge theater company as 
part of the lincoln centers serious fun series

the blood thinner warfarin significantly reduces 
the risk of heart attacks and death in people who survived an 
initial heart attack a study concludes 
the research conducted in norway found that the drug reduced 
the risk of death by 24 percent and the risk of subsequent heart 
attacks by 34 percent 
since the study began seven years ago doctors who treat heart 
attack patients have begun widely prescribing aspirin which does 
essentially the same thing no one knows for sure which is better 
personally i would recommend warfarin because i find it more 
effective than aspirin said dr pal smith who directed the 
study however he noted that no headtohead comparisons of the 
two medicines has been conducted 
the latest study was conducted at ulleval university hospital in 
oslo and published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
in the study 1214 people were randomly assigned to take either 
warfarin or placebos starting about a month after their heart 
attacks 
one concern of warfarin is that it might trigger bleeding 
including one form of stroke the study found that this was rare 
fewer than 1 percent of the patients experienced seriously bleeding 
each year 
strokes can result from either blood clots or uncontrolled 
bleeding inside the head overall those getting warfarin suffered 
55 percent fewer strokes however there were four fatal bleeding 
strokes all of them in people getting warfarin 
warfarin is sold as duponts coumadin brand as well as in 
generic form treatment costs between 10 and 15 per month 
besides its medical uses warfarin is a common ingredient in rat 
poison

an era in which even the size of a kitchen 
knife was once decided by foreign military powers is coming to an 
end in berlin the last occupied city of world war ii 
the soviet unions agreement to gradually remove its troops from 
east germany and allow a united germany to join nato effectively 
eliminates the last major barriers to unification 
it also marks the virtual end of the control the four world war 
ii allies the united states britain france and the soviet union 
have exerted over germany since they conquered and divided it 
four decades ago 
nowhere is the influence of the war more evident than in berlin 
which could become the capital of a unified germany but still is 
technically under military occupation 
the four powers have said they will relinquish their rights to 
berlin immediately upon unification which is expected in early 
december 
while west germany was shaped into a democracy and east germany 
became a model of sovietstyle communism the capital of the old 
german empire was given special status under the four powers 
agreement after the war 
britain france and the united states remain the supreme 
authority in west berlin and can if necessary control the 
telephone and mail services and police department 
west berlin is governed by a senate that must clear matters 
concerning security foreign affairs and police questions with the 
allies in practice the allies have permitted city authorities to 
govern virtually on their own for many years 
hundreds of west berlin ordinances enacted by the allies after 
world war ii are still on the books but most of these laws are not 
enforced 
an allied committee advised by the city has been meeting for 
the past six years to throw out many of the outmoded laws 
last year it repealed the alliedordered death penalty that had 
been on the books in west berlin west germany has never had 
capital punishment 
in the mid1980s the committee repealed a law that forbid west 
berliners from owning kitchen knives longer than 12 inches 
another relic from the postwar years when household knives were 
regarded as potential weapons 
as an enclave city 110 miles inside east german territory west 
berlin is linked to the west by air corridors and autobahns 
the four powers still control the airways to berlin and only 
their airlines can fly to the city even the west german airline 
lufthansa cannot land in berlin but this will change once the 
city becomes part of a unified germany 
west berliners are exempt from serving in the west german armed 
forces and young men will likely become eligible for the draft 
once the city passes into the german government sphere this would 
effectively end west berlins popularity as a haven for draft 
dodgers from west germany 
the allies postwar rights can still occasionally rankle 
the berliner morgenpost newspaper reported tuesday that the 
allies had rejected a local government proposal to require visas 
for east europeans who now can travel freely to west berlin 
but biddy brett rooks spokeswoman for the british military 
government called the report absolutely false and said the 
allies had made no decision on the visa requirement 
ansgar voessing a spokesman for the christian democrat 
delegation in the city senate said east bloc residents need a visa 
to go to west germany but none to travel to west berlin 
he cited that as an example of how the four powers agreement has 
led to a clear inequality in laws 
east berlin was named the capital of communist east germany an 
action never recognized by the western allies 
in east berlin the soviet union exercised little direct 
administrative control over the city because of the ironfisted 
rule of its surrogate east germanys communist government and the 
presence of 380000 soviet troops in east germany 
the mayor had no power whatsoever his sole function was to 
follow party directives said klaus haetzel spokesman for the 
east berlin city council 
the west german democratic constitution is as much a product of 
the allies as the status of berlin its system of 11 states the 
nations laws against extremism were all drafted by the victors 
in the long term the only vestige of the war after german 
unification would be the allied troops and their nuclear arsenals 
stationed in the country under the nato alliance 
now that the soviets have agreed to end their military presence 
on german territory in three or four years the western allies may 
be asked to withdraw some of their troops and weapons from west 
germany 
demands for the removal of nato nuclear weapons in west germany 
could be the next step according to klaus becher a foreign policy 
analyst in bonn 
the west german populace favors the removal of nuclear 
weapons at least offensive weapons becher said almost all 
political forces in germany are especially sensitive to this

troops from a us base 
arrived with cranes and a field hospital a day after mondays 
earthquake highlighting the cooperation and friction between the 
united states and the philippines 
many filipinos said the us relief effort shows the benefit of 
having american troops based in the philippines other people 
including most senators have demanded the bases close saying the 
philippines must wean itself from its dependency on its superpower 
ally 
next month us and philippine officials are scheduled to resume 
talks on extending the lease on the six us bases home to 40000 
american servicemen civilians and dependents the current lease 
expires in september 1991 
after the earthquake us troops arrived in cabanatuan city 
one of the hardesthit areas with equipment and trained engineers 
before they arrived rescue efforts were conducted by volunteers 
who had little more than jackhammers and their hands to move tons 
of debris 
on wednesday the us embassy said it was flying in an 
earthquake expert and fiber optic gear to enable rescuers to see if 
anyone remained alive beneath the rubble of the collapsed buildings 
the really ironic thing is when the quake struck the 
first people the radio stations thought of were the americans with 
their helicopters commentator luis beltran wrote in the manila 
standard 
the fact remains that the americans were the first to arrive 
and that they spelled the difference between life and death for 
the victims beltran said 
but critics said this reliance inhibits national development by 
fostering a colonial mentality where filipinos look up to the 
americans and down to themselves 
the government again had to send an sos to clark and subic for 
the much needed equipment to prevent an even higher toll of 
casualties columnist alvin capino wrote in the daily globe 
newspaper clark is a us air force base and subic is the main 
us naval base in the philippines 
socorro diokno chairman of the antibases coalition said 
just like any child who will ultimately move out of his parents 
home and live his own life we filipinos need to live our own lives 
too if in the process we stumble and fall then we just have to 
get up and heal our bruises 
the philippines often relies on us resources during disasters 
military planes from clark and the cubi point naval air station 
often fly maritime search and rescue missions 
air force meteorologists share information with the philippine 
weather service on approaching typhoons about 20 of them strike 
this island nation every year 
for many philippine nationalists the first step in achieving 
what they call genuine independence will be to close the bases 
regardless of the price 
but in cabanatuan city 60 miles north of manila american 
troops working with philippine volunteers made the difference 
between life and death for many victims 
the teams rescued 137 people most of them trapped under the 
ruins of the philippine christian college 
before the soldiers arrived with cranes and a field hospital and 
engineers the rescue operation seemed disorganizad led mainly by 
untrained volunteers 
when they tried to drill into the massive concrete slabs of 
debris survivors cried out that the effort was only shifting 
rubble onto them 
once the troops arrived most residents watched the rescue 
operation unable to offer help 
now its certain one man said the bases are here to 
stay 
others in the crowd nodded in agreement

strong aftershocks jolted 
earthquakedevastated areas in the north today as crews worked to 
clear a road in this hardhit mountain resort more bodies were dug 
out raising the death toll to 376 
the number of dead was expected to rise sharply in baguio where 
hundreds of people were believed still trapped in rubble because of 
a lack of heavy equipment and emergency training 
the city was cut off by landslides in mondays quake 
president corazon aquino flew in today to assess the damage 
she ordered officials to give top priority to clearing the roads 
so medicine food and heavy equipment could be brought in she also 
ordered city schools closed for a month 
at baguios hyatt hotel which collapsed in the earthquake 
clarita gonzales tearfully called out with a megaphone for her 
5yearold daughter trapped in the rubble with her nanny 
if you are still alive please tap mrs gonzales sobbed 
on tuesday mrs aquino declared a state of emergency throughout 
the quakestricken area north of manila on the archipelago nations 
main island luzon 
two aftershocks early today measured 63 and 58 on the richter 
scale according to the us geological service in golden colo 
two more were reported later but precise readings were not 
immediately available 
no new damage was reported 
figures compiled by the office of civil defense and the red 
cross showed 360 people were killed and 773 injured from mondays 
earthquake which registered 77 on the richter scale 
in addition the philex mining corp reported 16 people were 
also killed at its residential compound in benguet province but 
they were not included in the official tallies the company said 13 
of the dead were children 
officials said at least 82 of the fatalities died in baguio 
where four luxury hotels and 23 other buildings were severely 
damaged 
but presidential press secretary tomas gomez said mrs aquino 
was told that 142 people died in baguio including two americans 
one south korean a taiwanese and a chinese he gave no names 
us officials could not confirm the report but said an official 
of the us agency for international development was missing about 
1500 americans live in the town 
one baguio funeral director filemon relis said his mortuary 
alone received nearly 70 bodies of quake victims bodies covered 
with blankets were lying outside his funeral parlor there was no 
room inside 
mondays quake the strongest to strike the philippines in 14 
years damaged baguios airport and triggered landslides which 
blocked the four highways leading to the resort 
highway crews used bulldozers and dynamite today to clear some 
of the dozens of landslides blocking one of the roads to baguio 
officials said they hoped to clear the debris later today so that 
muchneeded supplies including cranes food and medicine could 
reach the city 
the city of 120000 people had no electricity and was running 
out of food only one service station was open and gasoline was 
being rationed 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said a 14member 
military search and rescue team arrived today from andrews air 
force base near washington dc and would travel by helicopter to 
baguio to join the search 
he said about 20 people injured in baguio and cabanatuan city 
were flown to a us military hospital at clark air base more than 
50 people were killed in cabanatuan city 60 miles north of manila 
when a sixstory school collapsed 
japan sent doctors nurses and 180000 in relief supplies and 
canada thailand switzerland singapore australia and south korea 
also sent assistance 
in dagupan where 20 people died firetrucks began delivering 
drinking water to 31 outlying villages whose water lines were 
destroyed by the quake 
officials in the city of more than 100000 inhabitants 100 
miles north of manila said it also was without electricity and 
that food and drinking water were running low 
dagupans business district sank one to two yards during 
mondays quake and mud and sea water were seeping out through 
fissures in the street 
col bienvenido liclican spokesman for the military rescue 
team appealed over manila radio stations for tools blood plasma 
medicine and doctors to care for the injured 
mondays quake was the worst to strike the philippines since 
1976 when a quake measuring 78 on the richter scale killed 8000 
people 
the scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65

topeka correspondent lew ferguson was a personal 
friend of dr karl menninger and a member of menningers 
gingersnap club that met weekly on thursdays for lunch with the 
famed psychiatrist at his office 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no one matched dr karl menninger for 
breadth of interests concern for humankind and obsession to leave 
the world better than he found it 
few matched his intellect or his ability to apply a friendly 
needle when he wanted to make a point 
his causes were many humane treatment of those society must 
incarcerate for their wrongs eradication of child and wife abuse 
handgun control saving the planet from mans seeming penchant to 
destroy it the plight of native americans and caring for the 
mentally ill 
he also was driven to make others think and his thirst for 
knowledge was unquenchable 
his desire to learn was the main reason he started a weekly 
luncheon gathering with a few close friends it was called the 
gingersnap club because one of its charter members andy gray 
always brought a bag of fresh gingersnap cookies dr karl as he 
was known insisted everyone eat at least one before lunch 
he liked to call himself a writin man a carryover from his 
teenage days as a fledgling reporter for the old topeka daily 
capital and liked to talk current events with newsmen 
if he liked you he was lavish in his praise if he didnt like 
you you became a nonentity 
he tended toward hyperbole in autographing sparks his 1973 
book he wrote this description a writin man friend of 
mine who has helped many unknown helpless ones without credit or 
reward except the appreciation of some readers such as karl a 
menninger 
invitees to the thursday luncheon meetings included favored 
politicians and state officials if they had transgressed in his 
judgment he let them know it subtly yet pointedly 
one such guest was rep jim slattery rkan whose visit was 
illtimed it followed slatterys vote with the national rifle 
association on a gun control bill before congress 
dr karl said nothing about the vote during lunch but near the 
end quietly rose from his chair crossed the room and picked up a 
framed poster comparing the number of gunrelated deaths in the 
united states and other western countries it emphasized the fact 
the us total exceeded 9000 a year 
menninger leaned the poster against a wall directly in front of 
slattery not needing to say a word 
after slattery somewhat sheepishly tried to explain how he 
wanted to avoid a controversy with gun control opponents dr karl 
looked at him and said thats all right jim we still love you 
even if you vote wrong sometimes

police figured out the motive in the case of 
the missing manhole covers and today they arrested two suspects 
some of the more than 185 purloined covers turned up at a scrap 
metals yard tuesday and today police arrested two men who showed 
up at the same yard with another truckload 
detective bob readheimer said the men and their truck matched 
the description of suspects spotted earlier lifting a manhole cover 
in santa monica they drove to the right place at the right 
time he said 
some of the castiron covers ranging in weight from 50 pounds to 
200 pounds were buried in truckloads of higher grade iron sold to 
the downtown metal center to fetch a higher price said center 
manager robert kelman 
the manhole covers are pretty flat so they can hide them 
well kelman said tuesday basically they just used them to 
weigh down the load 
the discovery of los angeles city manhole covers in piles of old 
pipes truck bodies and reinforcement bars solved the biggest 
mystery in the disappearance of some 30 manhole covers a day since 
early last week what use were the things 
since the covers by themselves were only worth 150 each at 
scrap yards police and city officials could not figure out why 
anyone would bother trying to steal the heavy unwieldy covers 
the thief was dubbed manhole man but police didnt know 
whether a single person or a gang of thieves was responsible 
most of the covers reported stolen were 2foot diameter cast 
iron covers placed over sidewalk storm drains but the metals 
center received even larger middleoftheroad covers officials 
were worried a pedestrian could fall into the 2foot holes but so 
far no injuries have been reported

in a sharp break with the past the 
soviet union and hungary have accepted natos offer to establish 
diplomatic ties with the western military alliance officials said 
wednesday 
the decisions the first by warsaw pact nations came less 
than two weeks after president bush and other nato leaders extended 
the hand of friendship to their former adversaries in eastern 
europe 
hungarian prime minister jozsef antall announced his 
governments plans after paying a visit to the headquarters of the 
north atlantic treaty organization the first by a leader of a 
warsaw pact nation 
with this the official resumption of contacts has taken 
place he told reporters 
later nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner just back from a 
trip to moscow said the soviet union also intended to set up 
diplomatic exchanges 
the soviet union and hungary are the first two countries with 
which we are establishing a form of diplomatic contact said nato 
spokesman robin stafford 
nato had not yet created a system for accrediting diplomats to 
the alliance he said no nations outside the 16 members have 
official status 
antall who met for nearly an hour with woerner said he had 
asked that hungarys ambassador to belgium also be accredited in 
the future to nato 
we agreed that if the soviet union and hungary wish to make 
any contact this is the way to do it through the ambassador 
who is accredited to belgium at the moment stafford said 
earlier this month bush and the other nato leaders wound up a 
critical summit in london by pledging to reduce their conventional 
and nuclear defenses in europe and reassuring the east of their 
peaceful intentions 
they also invited soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to 
address a nato meeting and suggested moscow and other governments 
in easter europe establish regular diplomatic liaison with nato 
this will make it possible for us to share with them our 
thinking and deliberations in this historic period of change the 
leaders said in their final statement 
woerner who talked to gorbachev on saturday in moscow said 
gorbachev did not give a date for his visit but he clearly 
accepted the invitation 
it was the first time in the 41year history of the western 
alliance that its top official had traveled to the soviet union 
i think we opened the doors for a new era of cooperation 
woerner said 
i explained to the soviet leadership we wanted to have a 
sincere partnership in the future not only with them but with 
all countries of central and eastern europe he said 
antalls visit symbolized the new turn in relations he said 
the hungarian leader said he supported the atlantic idea a 
reference to the political links drawing together the united states 
and canada with nations in europe 
two world wars and a cold war have proved that europe and 
north america are inseparable antall said in brief remarks in 
the main lobby of the alliance headquarters 
he said nato should form a basis for european security and 
this is not directed against the soviet union 
the soviet union must just as much be part of the european 
security system as should the united states of america he said 
antall invited woerner to travel to budapest in november 
hungarys parliament voted overwhelmingly last month to withdraw 
from the eastern military alliance by the end of 1991 antall made 
no mention of those plans 
in december soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
became the first foreign minister of a warsaw pact nation to visit 
nato the foreign ministers of hungary poland czechoslovakia and 
east germany have since visited

if the food and drug administration is made an 
independent agency its work and the coordination of the 
governments health programs will suffer the secretary of health 
and human services said wednesday 
secretary louis sullivan said the fda should remain under the 
umbrella of his department because its activities are intertwined 
with those of other health agencies he manages 
i believe very strongly that this kind of interaction 
would be disrupted and it would be to the detriment not only to 
the fda but also to our citizens in having a comprehensive 
coordinated health program sullivan told the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee 
but rep ron wyden dore said cutting fda loose from the 
bureaucracy of the massive cabinet department would distance the 
agency from political battles within the white house and make the 
agency more responsive 
the suggestion that fda be removed from the health and human 
services department is being talked about more on capitol hill 
where the agency has been under criticism for its handling of the 
generic drug scandal 
the agency is now bogged down in muck wyden said the fda 
doesnt have the resources or authority to protect the public 
subcommittee members questioned sullivan for more than two hours 
about what they consider to be major problems at fda including 
tardiness in drafting regulations to implement laws passed by 
congress and weaknesses in the agencys control over approvals of 
drugs and medical devices 
sullivan assured panel members that he is putting the fdas 
house in order restructuring its management and adding resources 
in the wake of the generic drug fraud and corruption scandal 
the subcommittee pioneered the investigation of the generic drug 
industry that has resulted in 13 criminal convictions of former fda 
employees and drug company officials more than 100 drugs have been 
removed from the market many by companies that cheated on tests 
required for fda approval 
while the pace of approvals of generic drugs dropped sharply 
during the last year while the generic drug division reorganized 
approvals should begin increasing within months sullivan said 
we still have much work to do at fda sullivan said adding 
that the generic drug approval process is still not what it 
should be but he said the slowdown in approvals was necessary 
to assure the safety of generic drugs 
sullivan announced the appointment of an fda ombudsman to 
resolve grievances in the drugapproval process he also said he is 
adding 80 people to the fdas current 15person force of criminal 
investigators the department also has proposed legislation to 
bolster fdas authority over drug companies 
i believe our response in this crisis has been vigorous 
responsible and credible he said 
but rep john dingell dmich said he was concerned that the 
agencys continuing paralysis would hurt the business of honest 
generic drug companies 
the generic drug program is a program in crisis because of 
caution and inertia at hhs and a statusquo leadership dingell 
said hhs efforts to reform fda management problems and provide 
direction have been tepid at best

the government announced wednesday it 
will lift a quartercenturyold state of emergency next week 
because of easing regional tensions and political harmony at home 
the announcement followed repeated demands by church student 
labor and human rights groups for an end to the emergency powers 
it was the latest move toward democratic reform in subsaharan 
africa where traditional oneparty rule and broad government 
powers have come under increasing attack 
we are really overjoyed said nicholas ndebele head of the 
roman catholic justice and peace commission in harare now our 
people are going to experience real independence real freedom 
we are sure normal laws will suffice he said 
the state of emergency enforced by four different governments 
since its introduction by white minority leader ian smith in 1965 
was scheduled for renewal by the 150seat house of assembly next 
week 
however the home affairs minister moven mahachi told 
legislators that the government and security services no longer 
felt the emergency powers were necessary mahachi said the 
government will lift the emergency at midnight july 25 
since the two main rival political parties merged in december 
1987 zimbabwe had enjoyed peaceful conditions that mahachi called 
the best for a long time in the history of this country 
zimbabwe was often criticized for keeping its own emergency laws 
while denouncing the state of emergency in neighboring south 
africa on june 7 south african president fw de klerk ended four 
years of emergency rule in all but one province natal where 
factional violence has cost more than 3000 lives 
zimbabwe often cited the threat of destabilization from south 
africa as a reason for its state of emergency but mahachi told 
legislators that conditions in south africa had changed following 
reforms by de klerk 
in zimbabwe the emergency was frequently invoked to allow for 
the detention without trial of political opponents and alleged 
subversives 
church groups said these provisions of the emergency were 
frequently abused 
the emergency also gave the authorities the power to impose 
price controls seize assets owned by enemies of the state and 
intervene in labor disputes 
the emergency was used in recent months to declare a wave of 
strikes illegal in june a nationwide strike by disgruntled 
teachers was outlawed under the emergency laws and more than 1000 
strikers were fired 
since the former british colony of rhodesia became independent 
zimbabwe in 1980 the emergency has been renewed by a parliamentary 
vote every six months 
in the past the government also had cited crossborder raids by 
rebels fighting to overthrow the government in neighboring 
mozambique and the activities of armed dissidents in zimbabwes 
western province of matabeleland as reasons for keeping emergency 
laws 
mahachi said incursions by mozambique national resistance rebels 
were now under control and zimbabwe hoped current peace talks 
between the rebels and the mozambican government would succeed 
the state of emergency was first introduced by smith to crack 
down on black nationalists it remained in force during a 
sevenyear guerrilla war waged by the black nationalists against 
smiths white minority government 
a coalition of smith and moderate black leaders kept the 
emergency laws as did british governor lord christopher soames in 
the months before independence 
soames headed a temporary british administration that oversaw a 
ceasefire in the guerrilla war and independence elections the 
elections swept mugabes zimbabwe african national union patriotic 
front party to power

the us policy shift on cambodia 
improves the prospects for a negotiated peace settlement but also 
could fuel the fighting in a land that has known only war for 20 
years 
the us decision to withdraw recognition of the cambodian 
resistance isolates the khmer rouge one of three factions in the 
coalition even further and likely will harden the groups 
determination to win the war 
the coalition of the khmer rouge and the guerrilla forces of 
prince norodom sihanouk and son sann recently made its biggest 
gains of the war against the vietnamesebacked government seizing 
hundreds of cambodian villages 
but in paris on wednesday us secretary of state james a 
baker iii announced the united states was changing its policy to 
withdraw recognition of the guerrillas and open a new dialogue with 
vietnam on the cambodian war 
bakers announcement reflected a growing conviction within the 
us administration that the khmer rouge forces dominate the 
resistance coalition and are on the verge of taking over cambodia 
the dramatic aboutface also comes after a shift in superpower 
relations with the united states and soviet union declaring their 
decadeslong cold war at an end vietnam is moscows main asian 
ally and chinas chief rival in the region at the same time 
uschinese relations have chilled in the past year following 
beijings harsh crackdown on its democracy movement in june 1989 
for years negotiations on ending the cambodian war have been 
hampered because the united states and the resistance coalitions 
other key backers china and the noncommunist southeast asian 
nations had no dialogue on the subject with vietnam 
the united states has no diplomatic ties with vietnam and 
contact between the two countries has been limited to talks on 
refugees accounting for missing american soldiers and other 
humanitarian issues 
vietnamese officials have stressed in recent interviews with the 
associated press that they would try to create a climate conducive 
to establishing diplomatic ties with washington such ties are seen 
as crucial to vietnams economic development and attempts to break 
out of its international isolation 
the us shift meets vietnams demand for a halt to recognition 
of the guerrillas it raises the possibility vietnam will return 
the favor by using its influence on phnom penh to pressure the hun 
sen government to agree to a peace settlement 
phnom penh already is under heavy pressure because of the 
guerrilla battlefield victories internal dissent and a drastic 
reduction in aid from the soviet union and eastern europe 
the resistance coalition which the united states helped 
noncommunist southeast asian nations create in 1982 is dominated 
by the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge is blamed for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians during its rule of the country from 1975 to 
late 1978 when vietnam invaded and installed the hun sen 
government 
the us shift brings the country into agreement with nations 
such as australia and some members of the european community which 
already had adopted antikhmer rouge policies 
the us shift also should be welcomed in phnom penh which has 
adamantly rejected any significant khmer rouge role in the 
countrys future 
phnom penhs official news agency spk said wednesday that in a 
talk this week with former us ambassador john gunther dean prime 
minister hun sen laid stress on measures to prevent the return of 
the genocidal pol pot clique pol pot led the khmer rouge during 
the groups bloody rule 
sihanouk the leader of the guerrilla coalition says he hates 
the khmer rouge but joined forces with the group because of its 
military punch 
the us shift may prompt some initial anger from sihanouk but 
also could allow him gracefully to disentangle himself from the 
khmer rouge and pursue a greater range of negotiating options 
however sihanouk and the third guerrilla coalition leader 
former prime minister son sann have often said that freezing the 
khmer rouge out of a peace settlement could strengthen the groups 
resolve to take power on the battlefield 
it is better to have the khmer rouge in the settlement than to 
have to fight them in the jungles a western relief official once 
remarked to an associated press correspondent 
son sann recently insisted that the khmer rouge be represented 
on a supreme national council that sihanouk and hun sen agreed 
to form in order to arrange a truce 
the effort to arrange a truce appears to be failing largely 
because the khmer rouge felt it was not treated with respect in 
peace talks last month in tokyo as a result it has boycotted the 
sihanoukhun sen agreement 
whatever the us position china has not reduced its support 
for the khmer rouge which includes large arms shipments 
last month talks between china and vietnam collapsed because 
both countries refused to back off their support for their allies 
in cambodia

secretary of state james a baker iii on wednesday 
gave the soviet union an outline of the areas in which the bush 
administration is ready to offer technical help 
a senior us official said that includes technical assistance 
banking and taxadministration techniques and housing construction 
advice 
baker made the offer in a meeting with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze at the us ambassadors residence 
the official who insisted on anonymity disclosed the us 
offer on bakers flight home 
president bush has ruled out direct us assistance to the shaky 
soviet economy unless three conditions are met 
these are the adoption of freemarket procedures a decrease in 
spending on the soviet military and less involvement with countries 
accused of promoting regional unrest such as cuba 
baker gave the printed outline to shevardnadze the official 
said the soviet foreign minister is expected to respond when the 
two next meet aug 1 in irkutsk siberia 
on another subject the official said the soviet foreign minister 
responded favorably to a proposal by baker to establish contact 
with some of president gorbachevs sharpest critics 
he had no problem with that the official said of 
shevardnadzes reaction 
but shevardnadze told baker the idea of political opposition is 
only beginning to be understood in the soviet union 
he said there are younger people who are emerging right now 
who are quite serious the official said

in other developments a bomb probably planted by rightwing 
extremists exploded outside a building just minutes after a protest 
against military conscription was moved to another site police 
said wednesday 
the blast late tuesday in the southeast city of east london 
damaged a wall in the building where the end conscription campaign 
was to have held a meeting but there were no reports of injuries 
police said 
the meeting had been moved because more people than expected had 
attended 
police said no group had claimed responsibility for the blast 
but it was probably the work of rightwing white extremists opposed 
to government plans to abolish apartheid and share political power 
with the black majority 
rightwing groups have claimed responsibility for a series of 
bombings in recent weeks

controversy raging over art in much of 
the country centers on obscenity but on the hightech mit campus 
the argument is whether a big hairy thing is thoughtprovoking or 
just an eyesore 
cambridge artist mags harries proposed using hair from students 
of all backgrounds to create the fourpronged hat of a shaman or 
tribal magician from lapland 
the work of human hair woven onto a form was commissioned last 
year to hang in an atrium of the stratton student center on the 
massachusetts institute of technology campus 
i was trying to think of ways that students could involve 
themselves harries said little did i know 
students balked last spring when they got wind that the hairy 
hat was destined to hang in the center next to a cafeteria 
word got out that a giant hairball was going to be hung in the 
atrium said katy kline director of mits list visual arts 
center opposition arose 
several hundred students opposed to the 70000 construction met 
with administrators signed petitions and penned letters to the 
student newspaper 
people said this is revolting its dirty i dont want it 
near my food its like what my cat vomits up said mark 
roberts 24 a graduate student in technology and policy studies 
pranksters in april even placed a fully functional 8footlong 
slide rule in the spot where the hat was supposed to hang 
the display is on hold but the debate goes on 
harries says she chose the shaman hat as a subject because the 
shaman was an observer of nature and an early scientist 
opponents say it would be a brooding dark mark on a spot where 
open space and light abound they also worry that the hair would be 
unsanitary so close to a cafeteria 
we dont know about having all that dead organic matter 
hanging in the atrium said george madrid 20 a computer science 
major 
but they can hang it in the faculty club 
art placed in a student union students say should be fun and 
uplifting not confrontational and repellent 
the big objection is that it conjures up horrific images and 
the student center isnt the place for it said andrew greene

functional 
supporters say the hairy hat is a challenging work

roberts 
art that pleases everyone is deadly he added if it 
doesnt have some prickles in it then theres something wrong with 
it 
nationally controversy erupted recently over photographs by the 
late robert mapplethorpe and works by other artists that some 
consider obscene but most people at mit agree thats not the point 
here 
this has to do with public art says ellen t harris

this and if the art is public who is that public and who gets to 
choose that art 
the issue will be taken up again in the fall university

stirred is valuable 
and even mits computer whizzes and physics geniuses admit the 
issue is not one with easy answers

while richard nixon was on the west coast to 
open his presidential library actor jim cooke did what he could 
here wednesday to revive the reputation of another maligned 
president calvin coolidge 
he brought his oneman show more than two words to the 
national archives auditorium to repeat the wit and words of a chief 
executive who is usually pictured as possessing little of either 
the shows title comes from a coolidge story perhaps apocryphal 
oh mr coolidge a dinner partner is said to have gushed to 
a president known for his taciturn tendencies ive made a five 
dollar bet that i can get more than two words out of you 
said he to her you lose 
cooke 53 like coolidge a flinty vermonter tried to hide his 
dismay when he was reminded in an interview that history has not 
been kind to coolidge 
samuel eliot morison in his oxford history of the american 
people said this of the man who served as president for six 
years during the tumultuous 1920s 
a mean thinlipped little man a respectable mediocrity he 
lived parsimoniously but admired men of wealth and his political 
principles were those current in 1902 people thought coolidge 
brighter than he was because he seldom said anything 
mrs coolidge was a handsome and gracious lady without whom 
the formal parties at the white house would have been unbearably 
grim she helped this dour abstemious and unimaginative figure to 
become one of the most popular american presidents 
cooke flinched when reminded 
he said maybe historians had been so enamored of franklin d 
roosevelt that they got into the habit of denigrating anyone who 
came before him 
maybe it was the maddog midday heat that brought them in but a 
lunchtime audience of washingtonians spent an hour with cooke and 
coolidge by coincidence the performance occurred on the same day 
that nixon another former president with a rotten reputation was 
in yorba linda calif for a ceremony opening his presidential 
library to the public 
cooke recited lines from coolidges twiceweekly news 
conferences from his speeches from his autobiography first 
serialized in cosmopolitan magazine in 1933 and from his letters 
to his father always signed your son calvin coolidge 
coolidge cooke said later delivered his humor deadpan almost 
with a scowl so effectively that people didnt know he was joking 
at a news conference talking about retirement and twitting his 
reputation for parsimony he said i would like to report that 
there is no foundation to the rumor that i have been offered an 
opportunity to teach a course in thrift at scotlands university of 
aberdeen 
and hidden deep within a paragraph of his autobiography the 
pressure to speak is constant and intolerable however i resisted 
most of it 
i have found in the course of a long public career said 
coolidge and recited cooke that the things i did not say never 
hurt me 
for the occasion cooke wore a starched highcollared shirt a 
tight doublebreasted suit and highlace shoes 
he used to teach theater at bostons emerson college has done 
coolidge 40 or 50 times over the last five years and hopes to do it 
in each of the 48 states in the union when coolidge was in the 
white house 
ive come to like him a lot said cooke he also likes what 
coolidges son john 83 said coolidgelike when he took in 
cookes first performance in coolidges hometown plymouth vt 
i thought he did quite well 
after the show fran wells who came here in 1939 and worked for 
the old war production board and for the federal trade commission 
and the postal service hurried up to cooke and said i have to 
tell you i have a better opinion of that man 
coolidge might have frowned cooke beamed

two spacewalking cosmonauts had to use an 
emergency hatch to reenter their spacecraft because their normal 
porthole malfunctioned and their life support supplies were running 
out soviet media said wednesday 
the incident which soviet television called lifethreatening 
occurred while anatoly solovyev and alexander balandin were trying 
to fix thermal insulation on the outside of their spacecraft 
it was the latest in a series of problems plaguing the 
cosmonauts sixmonth mission 
despite the danger the cosmonauts joked about it afterward 
solovyev quipped that flight controllers need to put road signs 
there on the outside of the huge craft soviet televisions 
evening news program vremya said 
midnight emergency in outer space was the headline of a 
frontpage story in wednesdays izvestia newspaper the article 
raised the possibility human error could be behind the hatch 
problem and that the cosmonauts might have to take another 
spacewalk for more repairs before they can return to earth safely 
was there a threat to the crews lives yes there was 
vremya said 
a us specialist on the soviet space program said the hatch 
problem may prevent solovyev the 42yearold flight commander and 
balandin the 36yearold engineer from taking another spacewalk 
the soviet unions manned space program which for decades has 
been a source of national pride has been plagued the past two 
years by equipment malfunctions mistakes by cosmonauts and budget 
cuts 
the cosmonauts on tuesday left mir the space station orbiting 
for four years to fix thermal insulation around the capsule they 
must use to return to earth 
nearly half the insulation on the soyuz tm9 capsule which is 
docked to mir has peeled off news reports have said 
after repairing some of the damaged insulation the cosmonauts 
who were working without tethers or hoses connected to the ship 
encountered the hatch problem 
during their return to the spaceship the crew experienced 
unexpected difficulties radio moscow said the cosmonauts 
failed to shut the door of the entrance chamber and had to make use 
of an emergency door to enter the station 
james oberg author of several books on the soviet space 
program said although the cosmonauts managed to climb back into 
mir safely the hatch problem could complicate future spacewalks 
the general crisis was not fully resolved oberg said in a 
telephone interview wednesday from his texas home 
he said the cosmonauts may be unable to take another spacewalk 
because equipment needed to recharge their spacesuits with air and 
other vital supplies is now inaccessible in the damaged airlock 
soviet officials at the soviet mission control center in 
kaliningrad north of moscow tried to minimize the problem 
no one is concerned here it is an abnormal situation but 
controllable vsyeva latyshev a center spokesman said in a 
telephone interview 
izvestia said it took solovyev and balandin three hours to reach 
their damaged capsule after crawling out of mir and scampering 
along its outer skin using fasteners like mountain climbers they 
managed to fold part of the damaged insulation using clamps but 
another damaged piece wouldnt budge 
radio moscow reported the cosmonauts determined the insulation 
which protects the capsule while in space was damaged during 
launch of the soyuz on feb 11 the thermal blanket flapping 
uselessly in space for months could have interfered with the 
cosmonauts safe return to earth 
izvestia said life support resources of the cosmonauts 
spacesuits approached their sixhour limit 
they were running so low on air that they had to feed their 
spacesuits outside the ship izvestia reported apparently drawing 
oxygen from the vessel 
in their rush the cosmonauts apparently did not remove their 
ladders from the outside izvestia reported it said ground 
controllers cannot rule out that solovyev and balandin will 
have to take another spacewalk in the next few days it did not say 
whether the walk would be needed to remove the ladders or to repair 
the balky hatch 
the malfunctioning hatch is on kvant2 a module attached to 
mir and must be closed so the cosmonauts can pressurize the 
chamber 
the cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one end 
of the airlock that leads to the troublesome outside hatch that 
airlock apparently contains equipment they use for their spacewalks 
on tuesday the spacemen were unable to close the hatch after 
they entered the airlock either because of the rush tiredness or 
some other unknown reason izvestia said 
tass said solovyev and balandin had to reenter through another 
hatch on kvant2 that leads into a compartment for scientific 
equipment 
the repairs and reentry took seven hours about two hours 
longer than scheduled 
latyshev said ground controllers planned to bring the two 
cosmonauts home in the soyuz capsule as scheduled aug 9 
a replacement crew for mir is to be launched aug 1

oil companies exploring in the beaufort and 
chukchi seas north of alaska won exemption wednesday from a federal 
law protecting whales and seals from even accidental harm 
the ruling by the national marine fisheries service allows each 
company involved in oil and gas drilling or seismic exploration to 
apply for letters of authorization allowing what is called a take 
of marine mammals incidental to exploration 
the rule published wednesday in the federal register will be 
in effect for five years although the authorization letters will 
have to be renewed each year the exemption stems from 1986 
amendments to the marine mammals protection act and the endangered 
species act 
the alaska eskimo whaling commission plans to file suit in 
federal court to block the ruling said lynn sutcliffe a lawyer in 
washington for the commission 
the industry cant be authorized willynilly to go out and do 
what they want sutcliffe said no one knows how much that 
harassment will disrupt the reproductive cycle or end up killing 
whales 
he said alaska natives who are allowed to take 41 bowhead 
whales each year to maintain their traditional culture fear that 
oil exploration during the sensitive migration months could disrupt 
the hunt or lead to international pressure for a lower whaling 
quota 
until now the oil companies have had to restrict their 
explorations while whales were migrating through the beaufort and 
chukchi seas because they were prohibited from even incidental 
harassment of the affected species 
sutcliffe said the commission would continue negotiations with 
the oil industry for a negotiated settlement of the dispute while 
pursuing court action as well 
besides the bowhead species covered by the ruling are the gray 
whale beluga whale bearded seal ringed seal and spotted seal 
margaret lorenz a spokeswoman for the national marine fisheries 
service said oil companies will be required to have a program to 
monitor any effects of their activity on the whales and other 
marine mammals and also a plan of cooperation with the native 
communities involved in the whale hunt 
wednesdays ruling authorized by the marine mammal protection 
act of 1972 was requested in february 1988 by the oil companies 
amoco chevron exxon shell unocal and western geophysical co of 
america arco alaska inc joined the petition in january 1990 
the national marine fisheries service an agency of the commerce 
department held public hearings in washington and in barrow 
alaska and prepared an environmental assessment that found there 
would be no significant impact on the populations of marine mammals

san francisco has begun enforcing a state 
law that requires convicted prostitutes be tested for aids despite 
concerns that the law violates confidentiality rights 
under the 1989 law which san francisco municipal court began 
enforcing tuesday anyone convicted of prostitution or solicitation 
must be tested for the hiv virus and receive counseling 
if they test positive and are arrested again for prostitution or 
solicitation the usual misdemeanor charge may be upgraded to a 
felony increasing the sentence if convicted 
many judges and health officials are concerned that the 
requirements violate confidentiality rights and discriminate 
against defendants who test positive 
the concern is if a person is designated with aids and that 
information leaks out how is it going to affect that person in 
everyday life in housing in employment said judge ronald 
quidachay assistant presiding municipal court judge 
according to the law the defendants and the court will be 
notified of the test results the court will tell the department of 
justice which defendants tested positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
those who refuse to be tested could be jailed until they submit 
when it approved the law the state legislature left it up to 
local governments to design and enforce testing programs

a republican lawmaker urged president bush on 
wednesday to press for an international middle east peace 
conference sponsored only by the united states and the soviet union 
israel has always objected to an international conference that 
would be sponsored by the five superpowers so sen arlen specter 
rpa said he suggested that the united states call for an 
conference convened only by the united states and the soviet union 
with the five it would be 4to1 against israel specter 
said at one time prime minister shamir agreed with an 
international conference and it is my thinking that its worth 
going back to pursue that 
specter said bush indicated the idea was worth exploring but 
raised the question as to whether israel would go along with it 
specter and senate minority leader bob dole rkan met with 
bush to discuss ways of defusing the rising tensions in the middle 
east inflamed in part by iraqi president saddam husseins threat 
to use chemical weapons against israeli if israel attacks iraq 
what we are searching for from iraq is a clearcut statement 
of no first strike specter told reporters afterward 
specter said he and dole would meet next week with national 
security adviser brent scowcroft and his deputy robert gates

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told 
congress on wednesday the central bank is ready to push interest 
rates lower to keep the country out of a recession once 
policymakers agree on a deficit reduction package 
but the head of the central bank tempered his pledge by 
insisting that he sees no signs of a recession he also indicated 
the federal reserve is not contemplating any immediate followup to 
a small credit easing move it made last friday 
testifying on the federal reserves midyear assessment of the 
economy greenspan found himself caught between the opposing forces 
of a sluggish economy and still high inflationary pressures 
on the one hand he wanted to provide support for the budget 
negotiations between the administration and congress by allaying 
fears that a tax increase and big cuts in spending could topple the 
country into a recession 
the administration is counting on the fed to lower interest 
rates to stimulate economic growth as a way of offsetting the 
adverse effects of higher taxes and spending cuts 
shortly before greenspan testified the labor department 
reported that consumer prices shot up 05 percent in june and so 
far this year inflation has been rising at an annual rate of 59 
percent far higher than the central bank would like to see 
greenspan sought to play down the june inflation report 
contending it was the result of temporary factors and not an 
indication that inflation was taking off again 
while generally agreeing with that assessment private 
economists said that the fed could not give any sign that it was 
relaxing its guard against inflation for fear of spooking financial 
markets 
greenspan is walking a tightrope inflation is not going away 
but the fed clearly wants to support the budget negotiations 
said david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill 
in delivering the feds economic report wednesday greenspan 
said that a major cut in the budget is unquestionably the right 
thing to do he said the latest efforts by congress and the 
administration to come to grips with the problem had been 
enormously heartening to all who are concerned about the longrun 
health of the us economy 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater welcomed 
greenspans comments saying it was helpful just in knowing that 
others see the goal of this process the same as we do which is to 
get interest rates down and to keep the economy growing 
while greenspan said that the specific details of any fed 
response to a deficitreduction package would depend on economic 
conditions at the time he left no doubt that the central bank 
would move to offset any adverse effects on growth from spending 
cuts and tax increases during a period of sluggish growth 
i can only offer the assurance that the federal reserve will 
act as it has in the past to endeavor to keep the economic 
expansion on track greenspan said 
the administration has been complaining for months that the fed 
has been overly concerned about inflationary pressures and was 
keeping interest rates so high that economic growth was being 
slowed to dangerously low levels 
the fed took a modest step toward easing last friday it 
supplied enough additional cash to the banking system to push a key 
interest rate the federal funds rate down from 825 percent to 8 
percent the first decline since last december 
the drop in this rate which banks charge each other for 
overnight loans triggered a big rally on wall street pushing the 
stock market to record highs as investors expressed the hope that 
further rate declines would be forthcoming the market fell back 
somewhat wednesday 
in his testimony greenspan confirmed that the fed had eased 
slightly last week saying the action was taken to offset the 
effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans 
while refusing to characterize the situation as a fullscale 
credit crunch greenspan did say that the tougher loan policies 
were beginning to have very real unwelcome effects on economic 
growth 
based on greenspans comments wednesday many analysts predicted 
that the fed would push the federal funds rate down by another 025 
percentage point perhaps by labor day if congress and the 
administration have agreed on the outlines of a package cutting the 
deficit by 50 billion to 60 billion by that time 
in the feds economic forecast the central bank showed a 
willingness to tolerate lower economic growth than the 
administration 
the administrations revised economic forecast on monday put 
growth as measured by the gross national product at 22 percent 
this year increasing to 29 percent in 1991 the feds forecast 
projected slower growth of between 15 percent and 2 percent this 
year and between 175 percent and 25 percent in 1991 
in assessing current developments greenspan said the 
likelihood of a nearterm recession seems low in part because 
businesses have been working hard to keep their inventories in line 
with sales trends 
he said the country had an economy which is not on the edge of 
either falling apart into a recession or about to take on highly 
inflationary characteristics

in new jersey at least trash is sacred 
the states highest court despite a us supreme court ruling 
in the other direction says police need a search warrant to 
rummage through someones garbage cans even those at the curb 
garbage reveals much that is personal the state supreme 
court said tuesday 
supreme courts in about a dozen other states have agreed with 
the us supreme court that garbage is part of the public domain 
rubbish said the new jersey court joining only hawaii in 
requiring warrants before the law may get within arms length of a 
persons trash 
undoubtedly many would be upset to see a neighbor or stranger 
sifting through their garbage perusing their discarded mail 
reading their bank statements looking at their empty 
pharmaceutical bottles and checking receipts to see what 
videotapes they rent the court said over the objections of 
law enforcement officials 
garbage which new jersey produces at the rate of 10 million 
tons a year should remain private from the meddling of the

a federal judge criticized us immigration 
officials for underhanded tactics to deny asylum to haitians 
us district judge eugene spellman issued the opinion tuesday 
in the case of haitian immigrant noel molaire who had filed suit 
saying he was deprived of his rights during an immigration appeals 
hearing that ended with a deportation order against him 
spellman found the immigration and naturalization service had 
never told molaire about free legal services available to him 
spellman also said the immigration judge did not explain to molaire 
the purpose of his asylum hearing 
ins has routinely engaged in underhanded tactics in dealing 
with haitians seeking asylum in this country and has singled them 
out for special discriminatory treatment the judge wrote 
repeatedly this court and other federal courts have found that 
ins has engaged in illegal practices and policies with respect to 
haitians 
spellman whose 1981 decision resulted in the freeing of 2000 
haitians pending their immigration status hearings ordered a new 
hearing for molaire 
cheryl little attorney for the haitian refugee center here 
hailed the decision as another victory for those who complain that 
haitians are being subjected to tougher immigration standards than 
are other refugees 
haitian activists have complained bitterly that cubans and 
nicaraguans have been welcomed in miami and other parts of the 
united states while haitians are intercepted at sea and either 
returned to haiti or held at detention centers 
we have never asked that they change the law with respect to 
the haitians ms little said wednesday we have only asked 
that they enforce the laws on the books this decision tells them 
that they have to follow the law 
she said her office has several similar cases in federal court 
and will bring spellmans decision to their attention 
but she added that federal courts have often ruled for haitians 
before 
our track record in federal court is pretty darn good because 
the judges are usually outraged when they learn the extent to which 
the haitians rights are violated she said but we dont have 
the resources to go into federal court on every case 
in washington ins spokesman duke austin emphasized that 
spellmans decision applied to immigration judges who are employed 
by the justice department not the ins 
the justice department did not immediately return calls from the 
associated press 
austin did take issue with spellmans broad condemnation of the 
ins 
the question of discrimination against haitians has been 
litigated to the supreme court of the united states and in no 
forum was it found that there was discrimination against 
haitians austin said

operators of the longdelayed seabrook 
nuclear power plant prepared wednesday for its first fullpower 
operation with work unaffected by an accident in which a plant 
employee was slightly injured 
fullpower operation could come as early as thursday morning 
but it could be another day after that too so theres kind of a 
wide window spokesman david scanzoni said 
the 66 billion 1150megawatt plant has been conducting tests 
and gradually increasing power since receiving its federal license 
in march it was operating at 75 percent power wednesday 
scanzoni said the worker was injured when an inchthick 
inspection window on a highpressure steam tank shattered 
fragments of glass flew about 12 feet cutting his face and 
striking one eye 
the worker whose name was not released did not require 
stitches and suffered only a slight eye injury scanzoni said he 
said the worker was treated by plant medics and at exeter hospital 
but returned to the plant to drive his car home 
the window 18 inches by one inch was one of two in a tank 
filled with steam at about 1000 pounds per square inch of 
pressure scanzoni said he said the blown window released a 
quick puff of nonradioactive steam before the tank was 
automatically isolated 
scanzoni said the window would be replaced wednesday 
the tank on the plants nonnuclear side is one of four that 
collects steam after it has driven turbines to generate 
electricity the spent steam is condensed to be recycled through 
steam generators to drive the turbines again

it seemed an unlikely scene in 
a palestinian village local leaders were exchanging cordial words 
with the defense minister of israels new rightwing government 
but moshe arens aims to make such meetings commonplace 
arens is trying to reduce friction between with the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied territories while at the same time 
providing increased security for 70000 jewish settlers living in 
their midst 
its a balancing act and arens knows it 
shortly after his friendly visit with palestinian leaders in 
dura a village of 14000 people he was with jewish settlers in 
kiryat arba a fenced israeli enclave overlooking the arab town of 
hebron 
in the background is the constant concern that a single violent 
incident could reignite the 31monthold palestinian uprising and 
further unsettle israels relations with the united states 
arens a former foreign minister is sensitive to the damage 
done to israels public image abroad by the long violent uprising 
a senior defnse official said 
he believes a more sympathetic international attitude plus 
calm in the occupied lands could open the way to israels 
proposed palestinian elections followed by talks on autonomy 
so arens has embarked on a series of confidencebuilding 
gestures he released more than 400 prisoners began a gradual 
reopening of palestinian universities closed during the uprising 
eased some travel restrictions for elderly palestinians and held 
meetings like the one in dura 
this is one in a series of visits that i hold with the 
purpose of learning hearing and making my opinions heard the 
effort is to stop the circle of violence and reach agreement about 
peace the defense minister said after meeting with abdel fata 
dudein the israeliappointed mayor of dura 
another change is in the priorities of the army 
he ordered troops redeployed along main roads in the occupied 
lands to protect settlers against stone throwers at the same time 
army sources say troops are not going as often into refugee camps 
and small villages in an effort to disengage 
arens seeks cessation of degrading treatment and superfluous 
friction with the security forces a pinpoint method without 
need for collective punishment according to ron benishai 
military commentator for the hebrew daily yediot ahronot 
arabs already have noticed a difference in troop behavior they 
say soldiers are not as prone to force removal of outlawed 
palestinian flags or the painting over of antiisraeli slogans 
they are even willing to ignore stonethrowing palestinian youths 
last week in palestine square the center of occupied gaza city 
a palestinian journalist watched a group of youths hurling rocks 
and empty bottles at soldiers from the distance of about 30 yards 
the soldiers totally ignored the youths it was amazing 
the journalist said 
during a recent visit to the rafah refugee camp in gaza ap 
reporters saw palestinian flags and slogans but were told troops 
have not entered rafah during daytime for the past month 
we have no particular interest in keeping high concentration 
of israeli troops in the territories arens said in dura if we 
can bring about a process whereby we can decrease the military 
presence while at the same time also bring about a reduction of 
violence then that is certainly a policy i intend to pursue 
a clear result is the reduction in casualties not a single 
palestinian has died in a stonethrowing clash since june 25 
arens already has had some disappointments however and many 
palestinians are skeptical of his motives 
after arens met with three palestinian mayors last month two of 
them announced theyd told the defense miniser israel would have to 
talk to the plo thats exactly what israel wants to avoid 
in rafah a 19yearold activist named subhi abu dahi was asked 
about israels new policy 
arens only wants to improve the image of israel in the world 
when he achieves this he will go back to the old ways the 
teenager replied

defense secretary dick cheney said wednesday 
that the soviet union had begun the process of reducing the size 
of its military but predicted moscow would hold fast to its 
nuclear weapons capability even in the face of economic crisis 
thats what makes them a superpower and they wont give it 
up he told a group of journalists 
cheney was asked if the united states was still no 1 in the 
world 
we are no 1 were now enjoying the fruits of years of 
effort he said at a luncheon at the american enterprise 
institute there is only one true superpower left in the world i 
would argue its the united states 
soviet military retrenchment is one of several conditions 
imposed by bush before the united states will consider sending 
direct aid to help moscows ravaged economy cheney said the united 
states accepts the estimate that 25 percent of the soviet economy 
has been utilized for military spending 
he said the soviet economy is so weak that high rates of 
military spending are no longer sustainable 
the united states cheney said already has noted reductions in 
soviet military spending for tank production and general 
procurement he said the soviets were scrapping old naval units 
and parking old military hardware 
cheney said europe would be relatively free of soviet troops 
by 1995 that he said will radically alter our own force 
deployment in europe which is to say it would decline 
mikhail gorbachevs decision to drop his opposition to a unified 
germany in nato removed the last roadblock to getting two arms 
agreements he said gorbachev and president bush have pledged to 
conclude a conventional forces agreement and a ussoviet 
strategic arms treaty 
cheney noted that the soviets are on a timetable to pull troops 
out of hungary and czechoslovakia by the end of 1991 and agreed 
earlier this week to abandon its positions in east germany by 1994 
that would leave soviet troops only in poland and cheney said he 
assumed there also would be a pullout agreement covering poland 
asked about gorbachev cheney said he thought the soviet 
president had been in big trouble this spring but was 
strengthened by the washington summit with bush the nato summit in 
london and the communist party congress that just ended in moscow 
ive watched the guy with absolute fascination cheney said 
hes like the guy you see in the logrolling contests in the 
northwest he has this amazing ability to stay on top of the log

the waters where perrys nineship squadron defeated six british 
ships during the war of 1812 
the replica contains 42 pieces of perrys flagship mostly 
metal but those parts make up just 20 percent of the presentday 
niagra it is owned by the state of pennsylvania which paid part 
of the 38 million restoration cost and plans to spend 5 million 
on a dock and museum

where a crew of 30 handled the ships 15 sails and executed turns 
on placid waters near presque isle state park

the bush administration said wednesday it 
opposes senate legislation aimed at fostering airline competition 
by increasing use of four hevaily used airports and by banning the 
sale of takeoff and landing rights 
we oppose its enactment for a variety of practical reasons 
assistant transportation secretary jeffrey n shane told the 
aviation subcommittee of the senate committee on commerce science 
and transportation 
the ban on sales of takeoff and landing slots in the bill 
would restrict competition instead of enhancing it by making it 
harder for new operators to compete he said 
a takeoff or landing slot at a busy time can command up to 1 
million in intercompany trading critics say small airlines are 
shut out now because they find the price too high at many 
airports one airline controls most of the slots 
legislation backed by the subcommittee chairman sen wendell h 
ford dky would lift the highdensity rule at kennedy 
international and laguardia airports in new york ohare 
international in chicago and washington national and make slots 
available to new companies in those markets 
getting rid of the highdensity rule does not mean that 
thousands more flights will be going into these airports every 
day said ford it does mean that traffic will no longer be 
constrained by artificial numbers and entry for new carriers will 
no longer be blocked 
the 21yearold rule has limited the number of flights per hour 
to manage traffic flow and in washington to curb noise the limit 
varies from airport to airport 
the justification for the rule today is largely the same as in 
1969 said shane controllers could safely handle traffic but 
could not guarantee that flights would take off and land on time 
laguardia is the worst us airport for delayed flights 
followed immediately by ohare and kennedy is ranked fourth shane 
said those airports have 30 percent of all air traffic delays in 
the country even though they account for only 4 percent of total 
operations 
further operations at those airports would add to delays 
elsewhere by causing connecting flights to fall behind schedule 
he added 
although national is not as troublesome any substantial 
increase in jet operations could quickly increase the number of 
operating delays to an unacceptable level shane said 
the air transport association of america which represents 22 
scheduled air carriers supports the proposed legislation but said 
its two members operating shuttle service in boston new york and 
washington oppose the change 
officers of pan am and trump shuttle say ending the rule would 
make reliable scheduling impossible for their heavily used hourly 
flights

deactivate a buried cache of world war ii artillery shells 
the men belonged to a special unit assigned to help dispose of 
more than 2660 german shells found this month along a roadway 
outside epervans in eastcentral france 
investigators said the plastic explosives were to be used to 
destroy the latest batch of shells extracted from the site which 
is south of dijon it was not immediately known what caused the 
plastic explosives to detonate

hospitalized he was reported in good condition

spains historically warm relations with 
cuba its former colony are souring as cubans seek refuge in 
foreign embassies on the island that madrid once called its pearl 
of the caribbean 
but diplomatic sources say spain wants to keep communications 
open with cuba despite the increasingly bitter exchanges between 
cuban officials and spains foreign minister francisco fernandez 
ordonez 
on wednesday spain recalled its ambassador to cuba in the 
latest friction between the two countries 
it made the move after the communist government of cuba issued a 
statement calling fernandez ordonez an anxious colonial 
administrator it said he was guilty of historical amnesia 
paternalism and scandalous ignorance 
cubas was reacting to remarks by the foreign minister earlier 
wednesday referring to the role played in the collapse of 
communist governments in eastern europe last fall by asylumseekers 
at western embassies there fernandez ordonez indicated to 
reporters castro knew he risked the demise of his own government if 
he opened cubas doors to all who want to leave 
an editorial comic strip wednesday in the leading daily el 
pais showed castro calling fernandez ordonez irresponsible and 
the foreign minister turning the other cheek and offering asylum to 
castro whenever you need it 
many spaniards believe cuba will inevitably undergo a transition 
to democracy the strip suggested that spain could eventually play 
a mediating role 
in a sign of displeasure over castros threat to ship all the 
islands undesirables to european economic community countries 
spain has canceled a meeting of the spanishcuban commission on 
economic and industrial cooperation 
spain is cubas leading western supplier of goods and after the 
soviet union its leading creditor cuba owes it 800 million900 
million 
according to the economy ministry much of the debt dates to the 
rightwing authoritarian government of gen francisco franco who 
maintained close ties with castro despite their ideological 
differences 
spain ruled cuba as a colony from the 16th century to 1898 
castros father came from northwestern spain and castro still has 
relatives there 
castro made his threat saturday following criticism from 
european economic community nations they said cuba should respect 
international conventions governing the inviolability of embassies 
and the right to asylum 
the spanish foreign ministrys reaction was lowkey when three 
cubans sought refuge in the spanish embassy in havana last week 
after another group of cubans had entered the czechoslovak embassy 
officials said spain would not force the cubans to leave and would 
try to negotiate their departure 
when armed cuban police stormed the spanish embassy on friday in 
pursuit of a fourth cuban seeking refuge and dragged him away the 
ministry protested and got backing from the european nations 
another cuban sought refuge in the spanish embassy on wednesday 
bringing to four the number of cubans inside the mission the 
spanish news agency efe reported from cubas capital 
that would bring to at least 13 the total number of cuban 
asylumseekers in the havana embassies or residences of 
czechoslovakia spain and italy 
fernandez ordonez told a parliamentary commission wednesday that 
spain would continue to offer refuge to all cubans seeking asylum 
and would keep on negotiating with patience and firmness 
cubas communist party ideology chief carlos aldana criticized 
fernandez ordonez on tuesday in a conversation with foreign 
reporters in cuba saying cuba would never negotiate over the fate 
of the cubans seeking refuge in foreign embassies 
the spanish government is going to have to raise its operating 
budget for its havana embassy to feed them the refugeseekers for 
an indefinite period of time he said he added if european 
economic community nations are so eager to receive cuban 
asylumseekers the government would be happy to draw up an 
agreement to make this possible 
castro aldana and official cuban government statements refer to 
the asylumseekers as troublemakers and social misfits

the army on wednesday reaffirmed plans to ship 
several hundred tons of us chemical weapons from storage sites in 
west germany to a pacific atoll for destruction in incinerators now 
being tested 
to meet federal environmental requirements the army had 
considered several alternatives including leaving the chemical 
weapons in germany or moving them to the united states for 
destruction at incinerators now on the drawing boards 
in announcing its decision to stick to its original plan for 
destroying the chemical agents on johnston island the army said 
the operation is expected to have minimal public health safety 
and environmental effects on johnson island and the pacific area 
the island is about 700 miles southwest of hawaii 
the army began testing the 240 million johnston atoll chemical 
agent disposal system on june 30 it halted the tests on the same 
day after encountering what army officials called minor problems 
testing resumed last weekend 
the plant is expected to start fullscale operations in 1992 
congress ordered the army in 1985 to destroy its arsenal of 
older chemical weapons including those in west germany by 1997 
the size of the stockpile is classified but is believed to be about 
30000 tons 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreed 
at their meeting in washington in early june to reduce their 
nations stockpiles of chemical weapons by 80 percent over the next 
decade

two senators proposed an expansion in the 
nations educational exchange program wednesday so american 
students can learn more about the new democracies budding 
throughout the world 
democratic sens david boren of oklahoma and claiborne pell of 
rhode island introduced a bill that in four years would send 200 
million to offer 5000 scholarships to american students and 
another 5000 to foreign students interested in a twoway 
educational exchange program 
the new program would focus on countries currently 
underrepresented by the united states such as the soviet union and 
areas in eastern europe said pell chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee 
pell who was instrumental in doubling the exchange programs 
between from 1981 to 1985 said the time has come for another 
quantum leap in our exchange programs with the end of the cold 
war 
the program pell said helps to open minds of future leaders 
and pointed to alexander yakolev soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs architect for perestroika who spent a year in the 
united states in the late 1950s on the fulbright program 
our isolationist approach to education has rendered us 
woefully ignorant of the international community in which we 
live agreed boren and that ignorance severely limits our 
ability to enter into global exchange 
boren said all japanese high school students speak fluent 
english mainly because they are required to take six years of it 
to graduate in comparison 2100 of 1 percent of american students 
studied japanese in the united states fewer than 25 percent of 
american high school students study a foreign language 
more than 10 times as many foreigners study in the united states 
as americans study in foreign countries in 1988 356000 foreign 
students studied in america with more than 50 percent from asia 
in the same year only 33000 american students studied abroad for 
a semester or more almost 50 percent went to great britain west 
germany and france 
the us information agency would administer the program 
providing the 10000 exchange scholarships by 1994 the bill would 
authorize 50 million in fiscal 1991 adding 50 million increases 
each year through 1994

andrew young made overtures to white leaders 
wednesday as he began his uphill battle to become the first black 
governor of georgia after a disappointing secondplace finish in 
the first round of the primary 
young stepped up his attacks on opponent lt gov zell miller 
who led the fiveman primary field tuesday he said miller was 
temperamentally unfit to be governor 
miller said his campaign was nearly broke and called on young 
to abide by a new state law that puts a 3500 cap on individual 
campaign contributions young said he would ignore the law which 
wont take effect until it is approved by the us justice 
department 
the exchange appeared to fulfill both candidates forecasts that 
the gentlemanly veneer of the campaign was likely to be marred by 
the scuffling of elbows and bare knuckles in the campaign for the 
aug 7 runoff 
nearly complete returns from tuesdays voting 2417 of 2446 
precincts showed miller with 424750 votes or 41 percent to 
youngs 297137 or 29 percent 
political analysts were skeptical that young could overcome 
millers lead a candidate with over 40 percent of the first 
primary vote and leading his closest rival by more than 5 
percentage points will never lose the runoff said merle black 
professor of political science at emory university and an authority 
on southern politics 
can young pull of a victory black was asked 
naw he said hes a goner 
state sen roy barnes who finished third with 215128 or 21 
percent of the vote has refused to endorse either of his former 
rivals 
but barnes played down speculation that his conservative 
supporters would bolt to the republican party in november and 
support nominee johnny isakson isakson a state representative 
won 65 percent of the votes in the gop primary easily defeating 
three challengers 
young told reporters wednesday morning that he placed calls to 
barnes and other white democratic leaders including state house 
speaker tom murphy us sen sam nunn and former sen herman 
talmadge hoping to enlist their support 
he said he had not specifically asked for endorsements and that 
none were offered 
young used his news conference to repeat a theme that he 
unveiled monday that miller wont be able to deliver on a promise 
to allow georgians to vote on legalizing a state lottery because he 
cant get along with legislators 
despite serving 16 years as georgias lieutenant governor 
miller still lacks the ability to convince his own colleagues in 
the legislature that the voters of georgia demand the right to vote 
on this issue young said 
on the other hand i have a record as a negotiator and i 
think i have the leadership skills to get that lottery vote out of

the deep resonant voice so familiar 
to generations of americans booms through the tiny room 
accompanied by the mournful whistle of a train in the background 
i never thought of being the president of the united states 
says the recorded richard nixon my goal was to become a railroad 
engineer 
but president he did become the most controversial one of his 
century 
now admirers or detractors will be able to visit his first home 
the bed in which he was born the high chair where he sat and the 
piano he played 
the guide to the 900foot square house built by his father from 
a kit is nixon himself 
the living room was the center of our life his voice tells 
the visitor the parents discussed current events at dinner 
soliciting in turn the opinions of the four nixon boys richard 
donald harold and edward all the names of british kings 
my father believed that no one was too young to have an 
opinion nixon says 
nixon was born in his parents bedroom the only one in the 
house on jan 9 1913 then the view was of citrus groves now 
the nineacre site is in the midst of urban sprawl as easy to pass 
by as the real estate office across the street and its hastily 
erected sign welcome us presidents 
the architects worked to recall the pastoral feel of the area in 
nixons youth by ordering 44 citrus trees planted near the 
reflecting pool which separates the library from the birthplace 
nixon slept with his brothers in two beds in a room upstairs 
reaching it by a stairway two feet wide the furnishings were 
sparse along one wall a small niche served as a study desk 
while the library fairly crackles with the controversies that 
shaped nixons political career the house is a reminder of a 
simpler past outside the front door is a plaque erected by his 
neighbors we are proud of our native son a man who has spared 
nothing of himself to help build a great nation 
on the bed is a coverlet the visitor is assured it is the one 
on which nixon was born bearing the date 1837 the crown upright 
piano has sheet music nixon used as he learned to play there is 
the violin he played and the clarinet on which he tootled 
his mothers bible is on a dresser over the bed are two 
pictures inside a frame made by the young nixon in the living room 
is a composite picture of the nixon sons 
the sewing room more of a closet has a singer sewing machine 
and a basket filled with knitting and a box of jp coats thread 
the kitchen has a st clair stove and an ice chest 
nixons narrative talks of his mothers baking prowess her 
specialty was angel food cake and he winds up by referring to 
the modest nature of the home 
his familys time spent in that house he said made up in 
love for what it lacked in size

a government spokesman reacted strongly wednesday 
to bush administration plans to open a dialogue with communist 
party opponents telling us officials not to offer opponents 
encouragement or assistance 
the warning came amid new defections from the ruling party 
seven prominent soviet parliamentarians announced that they were 
following the lead of reformers such as boris n yeltsin who quit 
the party last week 
and editor vitaly korotich of the glasnost weekly ogonyok said 
his newspaper will announce thursday it was severing ties with the 
communist party which publishes the magazine 
secretary of state james a baker iii said monday he thought it 
would be appropriate for the bush administration to touch base 
with the soviet opposition as it has with the opposition in other 
countries in eastern europe 
organizations in the united states have given millions of 
dollars to the cause of the noncommunist opposition movement in 
poland 
although it is not clear yet whether such assistance would be 
given to opposition groups in the soviet union arkady maslennikov 
a spokesman for president mikhail s gorbachev clearly drew the 
line at aid 
i think the limit is if you meet people and discuss whatever 
matters you wish that is your business maslennikov said at a 
briefing 
but if it is a kind of encouragement or assistance like 
to some other countries poland and so on that will be 
interference in the internal affairs of the soviet union and would 
hardly be tolerated 
i think to finance in any form political forces that are 
striving to come to power would be quite immoral from the point of 
view of international relations illegal from the point of view of 
international law 
its one thing when you donate money for charity business to 
fight disease or to help people in need say after earthquake or 
any other disaster and another thing when you are financing 
political forces he said 
maslennikov said bakers comments about opening a dialogue with 
radical reformers who quit the party last week cannot but raise 
questions and bewilderment 
baker had said it wasnt clear whether yeltsin and the others 
who quit the party are going to develop any kind of multiparty 
democracy 
we dont know yet if that is going to happen baker said in 
paris after a meeting on german unification if it does happen 
we ought to approach it as we have in other countries 
as central and eastern european states have broken with moscow 
baker said the bush administration has established a dialogue with 
opposition groups that showed democratic traits 
we have taken care to touch base with the opposition to make 
sure that we understand where the opposition is coming from that 
they understand where we are coming from and i dont think thats 
inappropriate just because its the soviet union he said 
yeltsin president of the russian republic said he could not 
stay in the communist party at a time when a multiparty system is 
emerging moscow mayor gavriil popov and leningrad mayor anatoly 
sobchak also quit the party 
the latest to quit were parliamentarians sergei stankevich a 
leader of the democratic platform bloc in the communist party 
vladimir tikhonov a leader of the cooperative small business 
movement environmentalist alexei yablokov journalist valentin 
logunov scientist yuri ryzhov economist alexei yemelyanov and 
factory manager mikhail bocharov 
korotich whose magazine is known for its hardhitting criticism 
of the bureaucracy said wednesday night ogonyok would publish a 
historic announcement thursday 
tomorrow our magazine will publish a decree on the separation 
of party and state he said announcing the break from the party 
ogonyok is published by pravda the newspaper of the party 
central committee it was not clear whether the party would 
continue to publish the magazine 
bocharov announced he was quitting the party on sunday at a huge 
anticommunist rally outside the kremlin 
the seven legislators said they were quitting to facilitate 
the process of democratizing the country 
gorbachev said last week he has nothing but contempt for 
prominent communists who left the party

logging would be banned across half of the 
oldgrowth forests currently unprotected in the pacific northwest 
a total of more than 27 million acres under a bill introduced on 
wednesday 
it is hypocritical for our nations leaders to dictate that 
other countries stop destroying the fragile ecosystems of rain 
forests when we are destroying the fragile ecosystems of our 
ancient forests said rep bruce vento dminn author of the 
bill 
vento chairman of the interior subcommittee on national parks 
and public lands said the measure represents a longterm solution 
to the northwests timber supply crisis as a bitter controversy 
rages over protection of the rare northern spotted owl 
the fish and wildlife service declared the owl a threatened 
species on june 22 a panel of government scientists led by forest 
service biologist jack ward thomas said in april that the owl is on 
the road to extinction unless logging stops on 3 million acres of 
oldgrowth forests currently open to timber harvests 
the government estimates such vast set asides would reduce 
harvests on federal lands in the region by nearly 50 percent at a 
cost of more than 20000 timber jobs 
thomas testifying before another house panel on wednesday said 
experts on the owl tried without success for six months to develop 
a different strategy to protect the endangered bird a new 
government timber task force is now trying to do that same job in 
six weeks 
vento who listed interior committee chairman morris udall 
dariz as a cosponsor of the bill was sharply critical of 
president bushs failure to provide substantive proposals to make 
good on his promise to strike a balance between the needs of the 
owl and the northwests timber industry 
rep jim mcdermott dwash was the sole northwest lawmaker to 
announce his support for the bill on wednesday 
the bill helps shift the focus of debate from protection of 
one species the spotted owl to protection of the old growth 
ecosystems that support owls and other species it also recognizes 
the need to reduce timber sales to sustainable levels mcdermott 
said 
ventos bill also includes a number of provisions for economic 
relief to the northwest in the form of technical assistance to 
modernize mills improve wood utilization techniques develop more 
efficient harvesting methods and accelerate reforestation 
he also proposed special programs to build recreational and 
facilities and trails implement new forestry techniques and 
enhance new wildlife habitat and watersheds he said the 
combination of such efforts eventually could add as much as 10000 
jobs and 2 billion board feet in timber harvests to the region 
the proposed ancient forest act of 1990 will receive a hearing 
before ventos subcommittee on tuesday 
in all it would create a 63 million acre ancient forest 
reserve system on 17 national forests and six bureau of land 
management districts across oregon washington and northern 
california all but 27 million acres of that land already is off 
limits to logging as national parks wilderness areas and other 
areas set aside under current forest management plans enacted by 
the forest service and blm 
the boundaries of the system would be designated within three 
years by the forest service and blm after receiving recommendations 
from a newly proposed ancient forest scientific committee

a judge wednesday refused to order 3yearold 
twins to undergo tests that would determine if they could donate 
bone marrow to their leukemiastricken halfbrother 
the childrens father had asked the court to force the twins to 
have the blood tests and donate bone marrow if they are compatible 
donors tamas bosze argued that bonemarrow transplantation is the 
only hope for his 12yearold son jeanpierre 
but circuit judge monica reynolds sided with the twins mother 
who said the tests would be an invasion of privacy 
it is the finding of this court that an order forcing the 
twins to submit to a blood test and possibly to a bone marrow 
harvesting at a later date would be an invasion of their 
constitutional rights of privacy ms reynolds said in a written 
ruling 
the plight of jeanpierre boszes son by another woman 
evokes sympathy from all whove heard the story but the court 
has no authority to grant plaintiffs motion the judge said 
to subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions against the 
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased 
child is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or 
anyone else she said 
bosze said he would appeal the ruling 
nancy curran the twins mother and boszes former girlfriend 
was not in court ms curran has sole custody of the twins a boy 
and a girl 
im still hoping shes going to change her mind said bosze 
jeanpierres physician dr jong j kwon said the potential to 
save the boys life outweighs the slight risks including pain 
possible anemia or infection involved in testing and then 
extracting bone marrow 
jeanpierre who was diagnosed with leukemia in 1989 lives with 
his father and attends school but his condition is not improving 
and he must undergo several doses of chemotherapy a week said 
kwon of lutheran general hospital in suburban park ridge 
even though hes a very strong boy he is sometimes wishing to 
give up kwon said 
the boys parents and other family members are not compatible 
donors 
publicity about the case prompted hundreds of people to offer to 
donate bone marrow and so far four potential donors may have 
similar typing with jeanpierre kwon said

former nasa administrator james beggs said 
wednesday that the manufacturer of the flawed hubble space 
telescope mirrors was certified by the air force and that the space 
agency was assured the work would be properly tested 
beggs nasa administrator from 1981 to 1986 said that perkin 
elmer the danbury conn company that made the mirrors had done 
similar work in the past for the defense department of and the air 
force had assured the agency the work would be done properly on 
hubble 
nasa had every right to expect the contractor to grind that 
lens to the right figure prescription beggs told a senate 
appropriations subcommittee we had been assured that the perkin 
elmer people were competent he said noting that their work had 
been certified by the air force 
beggs said perkin elmer was chosen for the hubble job because 
they had done this many times in the past 
perkin elmer now hughes danbury optical inc has been 
identified in published reports as a major contractor in the 
manufacture of spy satellites optics it has been paid about 451 
million for its work on the hubble telescope 
because of national security considerations beggs said nasa 
agreed to put only a limited number of supervisors in the perkin 
elmer plant while the hubble mirrors were being made 
he said that the nasa work in the perkin elmer plant was split 
into different parts of the facility and that access to some areas 
by nasa supervisors was limited 
nasa was put in the position of not having as much visibility 
of the project as it normally does said beggs it was a very 
awkward way to do it 
but in an apparent reference to the air force beggs said we 
were assured by a lot of sources that adequate oversight was in 
place to make sure the mirrors were made and tested properly 
the hubble space telescope built at a cost of 15 billion was 
discovered last month to be incapable of focusing as planned nasa 
said it appears that an error was made in the manufacture of the 
94inch primary mirror although the mirror cannot be replaced in 
the orbiting telescope nasa plans to fix the problem starting in 
1993 when the space shuttle will be used to install instruments in 
hubble that have optics that will correct the focus flaw 
beggs became nasa administrator after the mirrors had been 
ground and polished but before they had been coated the final 
step in their manufacture 
he testified that he was concerned about the hubble work and 
went to the perkin elmer plant in danbury where he was assured then 
that proper tests would be run to check the accuracy of the mirrors 
the former administrator said nasa officials discussed a final 
test of the hubble after the mirrors were installed in the 
telescope but decided it was not necessary 
we were assured that it an assembled test would not yield 
anything that was not determined by tests of the individual 
mirrors said beggs 
nasa has come under criticism by some in congress for not 
conducting a fullyassembled test of the hubble telescope nasa 
engineers have said that such a test would have cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars because a special facility would have had to be 
built to protect the telescope from contamination 
beggs testimony was before the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on independent agencies chaired by sen barbara a 
mikulski dmd

fresh from giving the new usbacked 
government a political drubbing the sandinistas have taken charge 
of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the nicaraguan revolution 
july 19 is a national holiday but the party will be pure 
sandinista 
banners redandblack party flags and sandinista posters were 
being trucked over to a downtown plaza wednesday 
workers were nailing together the platform where dancers and 
musicians will entertain thursday and former president daniel 
ortega will speak 
ortega intent on capitalizing on his partys most recent 
political victory has been behaving as though he were still in 
office presiding at public rallies inaugurating water pipes and 
roads and speaking at induction ceremonies for new sandinista 
militants 
barricada the party newspaper has been feasting on the partys 
apparent resurgence it has been running a banner at the top of its 
front page proclaiming the revolution continues not one step 
back 
stronger and more defiant than at any time since losing the feb 
25 elections the sandinistas have been exhibiting their superb 
knack for organization 
neighborhood parties complete with clowns musical groups and 
speeches have preceded thursdays big bash by the sandinistas the 
only organized public event marking the 1979 fall of the somoza 
family dictatorship 
its not their holiday said zoila lara an antisandinista 
domestic worker if everybody hadnt helped them in 1979 they 
wouldnt have done anything 
the new government has limited itself to declaring july 19 a 
national holiday commemorating the nicaraguan peoples triumph 
over the somoza dictatorship an undeniable fact of the unity of 
all social political and economic sectors of nicaragua 
the sandinistas quickly consolidated their power after the 
revolution ousted dictator anastasio somoza and held onto it until 
voters rejected them for a conservative prous coalition 
the sandinistas have waged a campaign of labor unrest since the 
april 25 inauguration of president violeta barrios de chamorro that 
has forced her to make broad concessions 
the last strike stopped just shy of civil war between sandinista 
sympathizers and government supporters it ended when the 
government agreed to negotiate even before sandinistamanned 
barricades reminiscent of the 1979 revolution had come down in 
managua the capital 
the 10day sandinistaled strike was settled with an agreement 
that grants hefty wage hikes to government employees pledges no 
mass firings of public sector workers and puts some key elements of 
the new adminstrations plan to return nicaragua to a freemarket 
economy on hold 
the sandinistas hailed the settlement as a victory mrs 
chamorro said it had prevented bloodshed and unrest the business 
community and some leaders of the governing coalition said it had 
set back the new administrations economic recovery program 
a week after the strikes end work crews were still replacing 
paving stones uprooted for the barricades and traffic was jammed at 
key intersections 
the sandinista celebration will be held at what the leftist 
party still calls the plaza of the revolution despite the fact that 
mrs chamorros government has changed its name to the 
prerevolutionary plaza of the republic

abortion was an important issue in the 1989 
new jersey and virginia governors races but people did not 
necessarily base their votes on that issue according to an 
academic study released wednesday 
the eagleton institute of politics a unit of rutgers university 
in new brunswick nj based its conclusions on an analysis of the 
1989 gubernatorial and legislative races in those two states 
the gubernatorial races were won by prochoice democrats james 
florio in new jersey and douglas wilder in virginia they ran in 
the first statewide races after the supreme courts webster 
decision gave states more authority to restrict abortions 
the study said one out of five new jersey voters and two out of 
five virginia voters mentioned abortion as particularly important 
to them in the governors race 
voters say abortion is an important issue but that doesnt 
guarantee that they will base their votes on it said ruth b 
mandel a professor at the institute and one of the studys 
authors someone has to make them see how pulling the lever for a 
particular candidate can affect abortion policy 
the authors said there was a greater level of interest and 
awareness among virginia voters on the abortion debate than among 
new jersey voters they attributed that to wilders greater use of 
the abortion issue in campaign advertising 
the study said that in both states more voters identified 
themselves as prochoice than as prolife 
the polling found that 54 percent of new jersey respondents gave 
consistent prochoice answers supporting abortion rights while 24 
percent gave consistent prolife answers opposing abortion the 
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 35 percentage points 
in virginia the comparable prochoice figure was 44 percent 
and the prolife figure was 30 percent 
the study was based on preelection telephone polling of 4400 
registered voters and postelection interviews with candidates and 
abortion activists in the two states

france ordered an investigation wednesday following 
charges that french police were part of an arms smuggling operation 
that brought in weapons from lebanon as diplomatic mail and sold 
them to local criminals 
interior minister pierre joxe directed that security be 
investigated at french diplomatic missions in a widening probe of 
armstrafficking by police serving as embassy guards in beirut the 
lebanese capital 
investigators meanwhile rounded up more police officers and 
civilians suspected of smuggling arms from lebanon since 1986 
lebanon a former french mandate has been embroiled in civil war 
for more than 15 years 
police officials disclosed few details about the probe which 
was revealed to the public tuesday 
newspapers quoted various sources as suggesting the smuggling 
operation could have involved dozens of police officers assigned as 
embassy guards in lebanon 
investigators believe the ring made millions by purchasing 
handguns assault rifles and grenade launchers from lebananese 
militiamen 
the arms reportedly were resold to french criminals including a 
gang that specialized in armored car robberies one holdup with 
assault rifles left two security guards dead in marseille in march 
the parisian daily liberation said at least one usmade 
stinger missile may have been among the consignments the 
shoulderfired weapon can down lowflying aircraft 
two officers wanted for questioning presently serve at the 
french embassy in washington said a police source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a third is a police brigadier at the beirut embassy two 
officers already charged with arms trafficking identified him as 
the rings main organizer 
the brigadier was expected to arrive in marseille this week to 
appear before judge patrick ardit his identity was not disclosed 
nor were those of some others said to be involved 
on wednesday several police from a 90member unit recently 
returned from lebanon were taken into custody and their homes 
searched an unregistered handgun was found 
in bandol on the french riviera five people including three 
municipal employees were arrested three were released after 
handguns they apparently purchased from the ring were confiscated 
a police search at the villa of an officer in etiolles south of 
paris turned up three rocket launchers handguns and much 
ammunition police said the rocket launchers were of a type used in 
attacks on armored cars 
the french news agency agence francepresse said the home 
belonged to the brigadier 
in mulhouse investigators seized 15 assault rifles 
machinepistols and handguns in dawn raids the parents brother 
and two colleagues of riot policemen patrick schaller were taken 
into custody for questioning his mother was released later 
police found 200000 francs 36230 and 18 weapons believed to 
originate in beirut at schallers house tuesday including assault 
rifles and machinepistols 
ardit charged schaller and fellow officer pierre bessonat with 
criminal conspiracy and armstrafficking tuesday 
former riot officer philippe nino who is serving a prison 
sentence for heading a cartheft ring said the two belonged to the 
ring nino has also been charged with armstrafficking 
nino and schaller served as embassy guards in beirut the 
missions security team normally comprises 100 to 150 men serving 
tours of duty ranging from three months to three years 
nino said the weapons were purchased from militiamen or dealers 
then shipped via cyprus to france in moving crates belonging to 
embassy security staff the crates classified as diplomatic mail 
were not searched by customs hundreds of weapons are believed to 
have entered france this way 
according to investigators a usmade m16 rifle bought for 
360 in beirut could bring eight times that amount in the french 
underworld

guerrilla leaders said wednesday the 
us decision to withdraw its recognition of the cambodian rebels 
will force the guerrillas closer to china and strengthen the khmer 
rouge 
vietnams ambassador to the united nations hailed the decision 
as a positive step that could eventually lead to the 
normalization of relations with the united states 
vietnam supports the cambodian government in its war against the 
tripartite resistance coalition dominated by the communist khmer 
rouge 
in the future to survive to go on fighting we will have to 
accept more aid from china prince norodom ranariddh son of 
resistance coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk said ranariddh 
is also commander of his fathers noncommunist army which is 
allied with the khmer rouge 
he said if the united states suspends the 7 million in aid it 
gives the noncommunist guerrillas china would give the guerrillas 
twice that amount in compensation 
i dont like any blackmail but i want to let you know that

states he said 
it is up to you do you want to push us closer to china the 
khmer rouge dont depend on the united states they depend on 
china he said 
wednesday secretary of state james a baker iii announced in 
paris that the united states was withdrawing recognition of the 
guerrillas in an effort to isolate the khmer rouge he also said 
the united states would open a dialogue with vietnam 
the change was prompted by fears of a resurgence of the khmer 
rouge which is the strongest faction in the tripartite rebel 
coalition and has after 11 years of civil war scored a string of 
recent battlefield victories

thousands of cambodians during a fouryear reign of terror that 
ended with vietnams 1978 invasion

faction said wednesday in paris he hoped the resistance coalition 
could hold an emergency meeting as soon as possible in bangkok or 
paris to discuss the us shift

vietnams un ambassador in new york trinh xuan lang hailed 
the us decision saying it represents progress in uscambodia 
policy this decision is late but positive 
the danger of the return of khmer rouge leader pol pot is 
real and imminent and therefore we welcome all efforts aimed at 
preventing the return of pol pot to power the vietnamese 
ambassador said 
vietnam has long demanded the united states drop diplomatic 
recognition of the guerrilla coalition 
china the main supporter of the khmer rouge had no immediate 
response to the us announcement 
the sixnation association of southeast asian nations which has 
supported the coalition will formulate a common response at its 
meeting next week in indonesia thai government spokesman suvit

the prosecution concluded its drug and perjury 
case against mayor marion barry on wednesday and the judge quickly 
rejected most of the defenses motions for acquittal of the 14 
charges 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson said he would 
rule thursday on whether to acquit the mayor on three misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charges including the one arising from an fbi 
sting operation at a local hotel and a misdemeanor cocaine 
conspiracy charge 
barrys attorney r kenneth mundy argued that witnesses who 
testified concerning those charges could not confirm the dates on 
which the government alleged crimes took place prosecutors said 
the witnesses estimated closely enough 
in concluding a case in which they portrayed barry as a city 
leader distracted constantly by illegal involvement with drugs 
prosecutors questioned a city police detective who has spent months 
compiling records of barrys telephone logs 
the detective james pawlik testified that more than 2000 
calls were placed from marion barrys car phone over a fouryear 
span to homes or businesses of friends who have admitted or been 
accused of drug involvement with barry 
the list covered calls beginning in early 1986 to 10 people 
who have testified or been accused in other witnesses testimony 
of supplying drugs to barry using drugs with him and seeing him 
use them district of columbia detective james pawlik said 
his testimony came as prosecutors neared an end to their 
monthlong case in which they have portrayed the mayor as a regular 
drug user who lied to cover up illegal narcotics activity r 
kenneth mundy barrys attorney has promised lots of surprises 
from the dozen defense witnesses he plans to call 
on crossexamination mundy attempted to put the calls into 
context by getting pawlik to testify that barry made at least 
20000 car telephone calls during the period for which the records 
were examined 
pawlik also testified that the records do not make clear that it 
was barry who actually placed the calls or in cases when calls 
were placed to a business whether barry was speaking to witnesses 
who have testified against him 
the detective said the records did not include local calls made 
from barrys home and there were also four months in 1986 for 
which the telephone company could not produce records for barrys 
car telephone the detective testified 
pawlik told the court that barry made 358 calls to former model 
rasheeda moore 573 to former girlfriend theresa southerland and 
508 to another woman bettye smith 
moore who cooperated with the jan 18 fbi sting operation that 
led to barrys arrest has testified that she used drugs with him 
over 100 times 
southerland has testified that she used drugs repeatedly with 
barry and smith who described the mayor as a close personal 
friend made similar statements in court tuesday 
the telephone records also show that barry made 243 calls to 
restaurateur hassan mohammadi and 148 calls to local attorney lloyd 
moore mohammadi has testified that he and barry used cocaine 
marijuana and opium together and moore also outlined a history of 
cocaine use with barry 
pawlik also said barry had made several calls to the washington 
hotel room of charles lewis in december 1988 lewis now a 
convicted drug dealer testified that he and the mayor smoked crack 
cocaine repeatedly during that month 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
the judge responding to a defense request that all the charges 
be dismissed refused in regard to the three perjury charges and 
eight of the possession charges he said he would deliberate on 
charges involving the testimony of bettye smith and doris crenshaw 
the judge also reserved judgment on mundys request that the 
possession charge resulting from the sting operation be dropped 
because of what the defense called illegal entrapment 
mundy argued that charges stemming from crenshaw and smiths 
allegations about using drugs with the mayor should be dismissed 
because neither could remember the precise dates that the 
government listed in its indictment 
assistant us attorney richard roberts argued that each 
provided enough details to satisfy the legal requirements of the 
on or about reference included with each date listed in the 
indictment 
mundy reviewed his argument that barry was entrapped the night 
he was arrested at the vista hotel but roberts insisted that 
testimony in the case revealed barry had a predisposition to use 
drugs before he was arrested 
robert mance another of barrys attorneys argued that the 
mayor should be acquitted on the conspiracy charge saying the 
government failed to prove that the mayor headed a single 
conspiracy assistant us attorney judith retchin argued that 
barry was the only one who had contact with every government 
witness

the justice department said wednesday it was 
changing the system for granting asylum to foreigners who fear 
persecution in their native lands 
the regulations will ensure that those who seek the 
protection of this country encounter a fair and sensitive legal 
process attorney general dick thornburgh said in announcing the 
reform 
asylum requests currently are handled at immigration and 
naturalization service district offices by examiners who handle 
many kinds of immigration and visa applications under the reform 
which will be effective oct 1 asylum requests will be handled by 
specialists in washington 
the ins will designate between 70 and 90 examiners who will be 
trained in international law and in conditions existing around the 
world so they may better decide upon asylum requests commissioner 
gene mcnary said at a news conference 
he said the ins also would open a documentation center that will 
have updated reports on conditions in various countries for 
examiners to use as reference 
supporters of the reform say that by having its own 
documentation center the ins will rely less on the state 
department and thus may increase the number of asylum requests it 
approves 
the state department has infused the asylum process with 
foreign policy considerations and the ins has been unable to rise 
above its law enforcement ethos in order to examine the claims 
fairly said arthur c helton head of the refugee project of the 
lawyers committee for human rights 
on capitol hill sen edward m kennedy called the announcement 
a significant step toward fairer and more generous rules of 
asylum for those seeking refuge from persecution in their own 
lands 
mcnary said the number of asylum requests had increased from 
19000 in 1986 to a projected 65000 for 1990 of those requests 
28 percent are approved on the average every year he said 
about 85 percent of those seeking asylum in the united states 
are from latin america most of the remainder are from asia and 
ireland 
foreigners seeking asylum in the united states must be able to 
prove that if they are returned to their homeland they are likely 
to face persecution based on their political views their race or 
religion 
mcnary said the ins did not know if the new system would 
increase or lower the approval rate it will be a more accurate 
adjudication he said 
the system will cost between 7 million and 9 million a year 
and will be paid for mostly from fees the ins collects on various 
applications

fighting broke out in recent weeks around the station between 
forces of charles taylor a former government official seeking to 
topple president samuel doe and renegades who broke away from

the firing of two top southern baptist 
newsmen had some editors fumbling to meet their deadlines wednesday 
and wondering about the future of baptist journalism 
this is kind of like the day after the funeral said don 
kirkland associate editor of south carolinas baptist courier one 
of 38 state baptist weeklies 
they move a lot of stories stories that we need and we 
assume they will continue to move those as we have kirkland said 
the denominations fundamentalistdominated executive committee 
fired alvin shackleford 58 and dan martin 51 on tuesday during a 
closed meeting attended by 61 committee members the newsmen 
werent allowed inside nor were about 200 supporters who packed 
the halls outside the doors guarded by offduty police officers 
shackleford 58 worked at baptist press for 3 years martin 
51 had worked there for nearly a decade they were accused of 
producing a news report biased against fundamentalists who control 
the 149 millionmember denomination 
the two were given a week to clean out their offices at the 
44yearold news agency which sends stories and press releases to 
about 400 clients including 38 independent weekly newspapers 
mondays news report was the latest one that went out and 
editors were left pondering the future of baptist press which has 
bureaus in richmond va dallas atlanta and washington dc 
kirkland who said his greenville scbased paper has a 
circulation of 124000 had doubts about who might replace the 
journalists 
personally you have to have some question as to what kind of 
journalist would walk into a situation like that after they just 
fired two reputable journalists kirkland said 
nashville attorney jeffrey mobley has announced formation of a 
new independent press agency associated baptist press inc he 
pledged wednesday the new agency would be independent 
mobley said he did not know if shackleford and martin would be 
asked to join 
were going to hire the best baptist journalists we can find 
there has been no decision yet as to who those persons will be 
he said 
the election of the rev morris chapman of wichita falls 
texas as president at last months southern baptist convention 
consolidated fundamentalist control of the nations largest 
protestant church body and led to a renewed purge of moderates 
the ouster of martin and shackleford spurred moderates to call a 
meeting in atlanta next month to plan a financial strategy to route 
funds away from fundamentalist causes the rev jimmy allen of fort 
worth texas said wednesday 
allen said shackleford and martin were conscientious journalists 
who kept their politics out of the news report their firings 
were a tragic thing he said 
the firings show an arrogance of power that says we will 
control the flow of information said allen who heads the 
moderatebacked group baptists committed to the southern baptist 
convention

gen paredes was the commander of the panamanian national guard 
from 1982 to 1983 with noriega as his intelligence chief noriega 
gradually gained power and in 1984 was able to oust paredes 
in 1987 gen paredes gave interviews in which he charged that 
noriega was involved in corruption drug smuggling and political 
assassination according to the february 1988 indictment of his 
son amet paredes at that time was using noriegas protection to 
smuggle drugs into the united states

home until he surrendered asked why us authorities had not 
arrested paredes in the seven months since the us invasion of

a new york toymaker on wednesday recalled 
7600 bead coaster toys because the wooden beads may become 
detached and pose a fatal choking hazard to young children 
the three metal blue yellow and red wires of the toys form a 
hill and valley rollercoaster shaped vertical field attached to a 
wooden base to create what a spokeswoman for the consumer product 
safety commission called an activity toy 
wooden beads of various shapes and colors are threaded through 
and move easily about the wires it is these beads that may become 
detached and pose a potentially fatal choking hazard said the 
commission 
the toy was imported from taiwan by associated merchandising 
corp of new york and sold nationwide from september 1989 to march 
1990 under the trade name creative years which appears on the 
wooden base 
neither the commission nor the company are aware of any injuries 
associated with the toy but consumers are advised to take it away 
from children immediately and return to the store where purchased 
for a refund

the environmental protection agency said 
tuesday it plans to classify diesel exhaust as a probable cause of 
lung cancer in humans 
the cancercausing power of the exhaust was estimated to be 
slightly less than what the epa has calculated in the past 
the agency has long acted on the assumption that diesel exhaust 
causes cancer it has published estimates that somewhere between 
178 and 860 lung cancers in 1986 were the result of exposure to 
diesel exhaust a medical burden that it expected to be roughly 
halved by 1995 92 to 443 cancers as stricter vehicle exhaust 
standards took effect 
the epa opened a twoday workshop at its laboratories in 
research triangle park nc on a new assessment of the health 
risks of diesel exhaust reviewing the latest scientific studies 
comments from the workshop will be used to revise the assessment 
for presentation to outside scientific advisers before formal 
adoption as agency policy 
diesel exhaust contains hundreds of compounds many of them as 
fine coatings of tiny soot particles and many of them known causes 
of cancer 
it is clear that diesel exhaust is carcinogenic in animals 
the new assessment said this contention is suported by positive 
results in numerous independent studies in males and females of 
at least two species and by several routes of administration 
including inhalation intratracheal administration skin painting 
and subcutaneous injection 
the review of recent work on human exposure by miners railroad 
workers truckers equipment operators and others concluded that 
excess lung cancer was seen in nine out of 18 studies but due to 
the lack of actual data on exposure to diesel exhaust in these 
studies and other mehtodological limitations the evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans is considered to be limited 
americans probably were exposed to 302000 tons of diesel 
exhaust in 1986 a figure expected to fall to 138000 to 170000 
tons in 1995 the epa said the average exposure was estimated at 
26 micrograms per cubic meter of air in 1986 probably falling to 
12 to 16 micrograms in 1995 
for every million people exposed to 1 microgram over a lifetime 
20 to 100 would get lung cancer that they wouldnt otherwise get 
and the number extra cancers would rise with exhaust concentration 
the agency said in 1987 
the new assessment presented several new estimates both higher 
and lower but said the best is that 13 of every million exposed to 
one microgram would get lung cancer that otherwise wouldnt occur 
about 130000 people die from lung cancer every year most of it 
caused by smoking

the us supreme court on wednesday 
refused to lift a stay that could block florida executions for 
months while the courts consider arguments that the electric chair 
is in torturously poor condition 
the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta which issued the 
stay postponed another execution scheduled for thursday and its 
statement indicated it would bar executions in florida until the 
issue of the chairs functioning is settled 
flames and smoke erupted from under the headpiece worn by jesse 
tafero when he was electrocuted in the 66yearold electric chair 
may 4 witnesses said tafero didnt stop moving and breathing until 
after the third jolt of electricity 
defense attorneys argue their clients face the same fate which 
they characterize as cruel and unusual punishment barred by the 
eighth amendment 
in late june the appeals court stayed the execution of 
spousekiller judi buenoano on monday it postponed the execution 
of james hamblen and said both stays were based on the same issue 
whether the execution machinery of florida is operating 
properly 
on wednesday the court called off thursdays execution of jerry 
white saying we believe it is likely that this court will grant 
stays in cases involving death by electrocution in florida until 
buenoano is decided by us the florida attorney generals office 
appealed mondays order to the nations high court wednesday but 
the us supreme court unanimously refused to lift the stay 
carolyn snurkowski the states lead attorney in death 
sentences said the hamblen stay makes it doubtful any execution 
will take place in florida until the court makes a decision 
larry spalding head of the state office of attorneys that 
represent indigent death row inmates agreed but he noted that 
death appeals are decided by threejudge panels of the 11th circuit 
that rotate and that one panel might rule differently 
the next test would come in appeals for anthony bertolotti 
scheduled to die next week for a fatal stabbing 
defense attorneys say a broken electrode lowered the voltage 
during taferos execution from a swiftly fatal level of 2400 volts 
to a torturous level as low as 90 or 100 volts 
the state department of corrections and gov bob martinez have 
maintained that tafero who killed two policemen died instantly 
and that a synthetic sponge under taferos headpiece was what 
smoked and flamed the sponge has since been replaced with a 
natural sponge used in previous executions 
theres no malfunctioning of the electric chair martinez 
said tuesday during a reelection campaign stop in st petersburg 
and once we get someone to sit there again i guess will be the 
best test of it 
white 42 was the fifth condemned murderer in the last month to 
get a stay within hours of execution he was condemned for shooting 
shopper james melson in the back of the head during a grocery store 
in taft in march 1981 
twentytwo men have been executed in florida since the state 
resumed capital punishment in 1979

shirley richter appealed to iraqi president saddam 
hussein on wednesday for clemency for her husband who is serving a 
life sentence in iraq 
businessman ian richter worked for a water treatment company 
before he was arrested in iraq and accused of using commissions for 
bribery richter now 44 was sentenced in 1986 
his wife said she was happy for the family of british hospital 
administrator daphne parish 53 who returned to london on 
wednesday after saddam released her from her 15year prison 
sentence 
naturally i was absolutely delighted that she was released 
but my thoughts naturally were also with ian who is now entering 
his fifth year in imprisonment and im just hoping that a similar 
gesture will be made by the iraqi government to now release ian 
mrs richter told independent television news 
in her first interview since richter was sentenced she said 
until ian was sentenced he always felt that this was a terrible 
mistake and that he would be released so it was a terrible shock to 
him to realize that in fact he was facing a life sentence 
the foreign office said wednesday it had appealed to iraq for 
clemency in the case

after 16 years in political no mans 
land richard nixon returned to his birthplace wednesday to prepare 
for the formal opening of his library 
nixon and his wife pat arrived at the 21 million library at 
midafternoon for his first look at the exhibits and at the 
restored home where he was born in 1913 
he was applauded by a handful of tourists mrs nixon who 
seldom appears in public was handed a bouquet of flowers by some 
girl scouts who had planted a rose garden on the library grounds 
nixon met with some former members of his administration 
ive never been concerned about his place in history said 
bruce whelihan who had worked in the nixon white house press 
office 
ken khathigian who wrote speeches both for nixon and ronald 
reagan as president was asked whether he ever expected such an 
edifice to be built honoring nixon 
i always knew it would happen that it was just a matter of 
time khathigian said 
nixon originally planned to have his library in san clemente but 
the project got bogged down khathigian said the opening was in 
keeping with the boss career perseverance 
nixon began his memoirs by saying i was born in the house my 
father built 
the formal opening thursday to be attended by the three 
republicans who followed him into the presidency is another step 
back toward public life for nixon who resigned in 1974 when his 
watergate burdens engulfed him 
if anything the opening of the library and the birthplace 
will draw more attention to watergate because that is what most of 
those who are covering the event for the media are most interested 
in nixon told the los angeles times 
over time as their interest fades and if the public 
continues to visit the museum i would think that all the events 
covered will be seen in a more objective perspective nixon said 
in a written response to the newspapers questions 
the exhibits span a public career of nearly a half century 
beginning in 1946 when nixon ran successfully for congress from 
this orange county district through two years in the senate eight 
years as vice president and 5 years as president 
they touch on watergate the scandal that began in 1972 with the 
burglary by white house agents of democratic party headquarters in 
washingtons watergate office building and led to a coverup of 
white house involvement 
nixon who was named an unindicted coconspirator resigned aug 
9 1974 when it became apparent he could not avoid impeachment by 
the house and conviction by the senate 
nixon shares with franklin d roosevelt the record of being five 
times on the national ticket that counts roosevelts unsuccessful 
try for vice president in 1920 and nixons failed attempt to beat 
john f kennedy in the 1960 presidential election 
president bush was flying in to attend thursdays ceremony 
former presidents reagan and ford also planned to make speeches 
the only other living president democrat jimmy carter said he 
couldnt make it 
hr haldeman who was fired as chief of staff when watergate 
heated up is expected to be a guest library officials did not 
release a list but it was made clear john dean the former nixon 
counsel who revealed the watergate scandal to prosecutors was not 
on it 
among presidents dating back to herbert hoover nixon is the 
only one who has not had a museum to house the artifacts of his 
career or the papers of his presidency reagans 50 miles away in 
simi valley is scheduled to be opened next february 
unlike the others however nixons will get no federal funds 
by choice of the former president he is also the only one among 
them to eschew secret service protection saying the cost to the 
taxpayer is too high 
nixon contributed 2 million to the library and has pledged the 
proceeds from the sale of his eighth and latest book in the 
arena 
for the foreseeable future the library will have no 
presidential documents and when it does acquire them they will 
only be copies congress seized the 42 million pages generated by 
the nixon presidency looking for watergate evidence and they 
remain in a nondescript national archives warehouse in alexandria 
va 
nixon assistant john taylor said the library may join with the 
archives in putting 15 million pages of the socalled white house 
special files on digital discs those files which are available to 
scholars in alexandria contain the most sensitive information 
including much on watergate but they were heavily censored when 
thousands of pages were removed at nixons request 
when ordinary people are admitted to the library friday at a 
cost of 395 for adults they will see a sizable watergate exhibit 
that includes an audio presentation of the most famous white house 
tapes 
they also will see one of the most telling photographs 
associated with the end of the nixon presidency his defiant wave 
goodbye from the steps of the helicopter that carried him out of 
the white house and the highest office in the land 
pat nixon the former presidents wife of 50 years is expected 
to make a rare public appearance at the ceremony so will the nixon 
daughters julie eisenhower and tricia cox with their husbands and 
the nixons four grandchildren

the senate prepared to vote on a major civil 
rights bill wednesday after the bush administration and democratic 
sponsors failed to agree on a plan to fight job discrimination 
without leading to hiring quotas 
the failure of lastminute talks brought warnings that the 
measure was doomed to a veto if it reached the presidents desk in 
its current form 
we are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto sen 
john c danforth rmo said this is a bill that can do a lot 
of good for a lot of people and it is going nowhere 
senators said the hangup in the negotiations was one that had 
plagued the two sides for weeks how to define business 
necessity crucial words in court cases concerning job 
discrimination 
every combination of words has been tried danforth said 
glumly hours earlier he had served as a messenger in taking 
bushs last offer from the white house to the senate 
the behindthescenes negotiating involved the bill at the top 
of civil rights groups agenda for the year the measure would 
overturn five supreme court rulings 
provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial harassment in 
the workplace to punitive damages for victims of intentional 
discrimination 
most of the controversy however has surrounded a provision 
making it easier to challenge employment practices whose effects 
fall disproportionately on minority groups 
the supreme courts decision in a case involving hiring at a 
salmon cannery in alaska held that such practices do not violate 
the law unless those filing suit can show they were not motivated 
by business necessity 
the bill sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass would 
require the companies to prove that the practices involved did 
represent business necessity 
the bush administration and other critics of the kennedy measure 
say it would guarantee that businesses would turn to minority 
hiring quotas to avoid the costs of civil rights lawsuits

industrialist armand hammer said wednesday a 
700 million lawsuit that seeks his prized art collection was full 
of lies generated by the greed of his late wifes sole heir 
hammer the 92yearold chairman of occidental petroleum corp 
responded in an interview to the lawsuit filed in state court by 
joan weiss the niece of his late wife frances through a 
spokesman he had refused to comment when the suit was filed last 
week 
the suit says hammers fortune and that of occidental was 
built on money provided by frances his third wife it contends he 
tricked her into signing away her rights to property amassed during 
33 years of marriage 
but hammer said that waivers dating back to 1974 and tax returns 
from even farther back will clearly show a court his wife intended 
to give up her joint property rights under california law 
this complaint is full of falsehoods its completely untrue 
and im sure that if and when the case reaches court well be able 
to prove to the satisfaction of the court that this is all 
contrived hammer said in the interview at occidentals 
headquarters in westwood 
my attorney tells me that when lawyers find the documents are 
against them they claim fraud he said its the only way they 
can reopen the case otherwise there would be summary judgment 
obviously we disagree with all that said richard d cleary 
the lawyer who filed the suit for joan weiss we plan and expect 
to prove otherwise in court 
he declined further comment 
frances hammer died in december leaving her 15 million estate 
to joan weiss weiss husband robert weiss was named executor and 
brought the suit 
in addition to the 700 million in damages it asks for 
unspecified punitive damages it also seeks among other things to 
have mrs weiss awarded at least half the art collection which has 
been estimated to be worth 250 million to 400 million 
hammer and his lawyer jay goldberg said the weisses already 
had showed their greed by selling mrs hammers jewelry collection 
at auction and would do the same if they got part of the art 
collection 
goldberg said in a telephone interview from new york that 
documents and witnesses will show that for a period of 33 years 
this woman proceeded on a basic philosophy that she was 
relinquishing any share of property attributable to armand hammers 
efforts 
he said mrs hammer clearly and repeatedly acknowledged that 
donations to hammers foundation with which the art was purchased 
were from him not from her or from them jointly 
she not only said this to countless people but she executed a 
number of documents going back to 1974 reflecting this and in each 
and every one of the tax returns filed from 1968 on she evidenced 
the same by her signature goldberg said 
the suit seeks 400 million in damages from hammer and the law 
firm that advised him and his wife on tax matters it asks for 300 
million from his foundation the museum he is building to house his 
art and occidental 
by challenging his sole ownership of the art it further clouds 
the future of his museum being built beside occidentals los 
angeles headquarters and due to open this november 
suits already filed by shareholders challenging the museum 
contend that occidental is squandering 100 million in company 
money to fund a project designed for hammers glory 
occidental president ray irani defended the contributions as a 
legitimate corporate expense contending hammers worldfamous 
collection of art helps promote the company by association with it 
the money spent on the museum is a small fraction of occidentals 
annual cash flow of 18 billion he said 
mrs weiss suit says frances hammer was a multimillionaire 
widow and armand hammer was nearly broke when the couple married in 
1956 it says hammer used his wifes fortune to build occidental 
into an oil giant and amass a huge personal fortune 
hammer borrowed funds at 2 percent for speculative ventures and 
often failed to make interest payments to her its says when he 
did repay her it was with money that was their joint property it 
contends

farm bills being debated in congress will 
drive more family farmers from the land country music star willie 
nelson said wednesday 
nelson organizer of four large benefit concerts called farm 
aid said 400000 family farmers quit the business since the last 
farm bill in 1985 
were not giving our family farmers enough to make a living 
nelson said at a news conference before going to capitol hill to 
lobby for changes in the bill 
the senate may take up its version of the farm bill thursday 
debate in the house is likely next week 
nelson and ben cohen cofounder of ben amp jerrys ice cream 
joined several farm groups in criticizing the bill 
farmers dont want handouts or subsidies cohen said they 
want a fair price for their products and a rational production 
policy 
ben amp jerrys has started carrying the farm aid logo on its ice 
cream cartons to increase support for family farmers cohen said 
the company is trying to protect the livelihood of our suppliers 
and the health of our consumers he said 
family farmers are independent small businessmen working the 
soil with respect for the land and neighbors cohen said 
david senter national director for the american agriculture 
movement said farmers will be squeezed by the farm bills freeze 
on target prices higher excise taxes and little assistance for 
rural development health care research and education 
he criticized agriculture secretary clayton yeutters threat to 
urge a veto of the bill because of its high cost 
yeutter on tuesday said the fiveyear cost of the new bill would 
be 59 billion compared with the senate agriculture committees 
estimate of 55 billion and thats too much he said 
apparently they the administration think its too good 
senter said i guess they want to get rid of us quicker 
much of the nations farm program amounts to manipulation of 
supplies to raise prices such as limits on imports and planting 
restrictions economists say such measures represent costs to 
society just as direct subsidies do 
farm aid the cambridge mass group that administers funds 
raised by nelsons benefit concerts has distributed 9 million 
since 1985 to more than 100 farm organizations churches and 
service agencies in 41 states the singer said 
he said the concerts have failed to keep farmers from leaving 
the land but said they have drawn attention to the problem and 
raised some relief money 
as far as saving farms only this farm bill can do that 
nelson said it would be nice if didnt need another farm aid it 
would be nice if the people in this city who can help solve this 
problem would do that 
nelson 57 has testified previously before congressional 
committees on behalf of small farmers

the labor department is looking into the 
possibility that its june unemployment report was leaked to traders 
in financial markets by a news service an agency spokesman said on 
wednesday 
the matter involves a monthly report released july 6 on 
unemployment in june the governments first comprehensive look at 
economic activity for that month said bob zachariasiewicz 
zachariasiewicz said the departments action was not a formal 
investigation it is merely studying a report that the information 
had been leaked early and caused a fluctuation in market activity 
we had no way of telling that the market fluctuation was 
caused by a premature release of the information zachariasiewicz 
said 
just before the figures release one trader on the chicago 
board of trade began selling bond futures heavily according to a 
report wednesday by dow jones the selling spree could have been 
the result of a lucky guess or could indicate a premature leak the 
service said 
when the report is released each month news organizations are 
given copies at 8 am on the condition that they not be released 
until 830 am markets can rise or fall based on this information 
and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn the 
departments ire in the past 
zachariasiewicz declined to say which news organization was 
being reviewed but another labor department source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said it was a japanese service 
the department last week cautioned japanese news organizations 
in advance of the release of its report on producer prices the 
source said 
weve been having some trouble with the japanese the source 
said without elaboration

canadian radio and television as half of the wayne and shuster 
team died wednesday of cancer he was 72 
wayne and frank shuster had a long career as canadas bestknown 
cutups starting with a boy scout fundraising show they did on 
radio in 1930 and a touring army act during world war ii on tv and 
in london and new york 
a cbc spokesman who announced the death said the funeral was 
scheduled for friday in toronto 
in 1950 wayne and shuster began appearing as guests on various 
american tv programs including 67 performances on the ed sullivan 
show 
although their wideranging skits an amiable mixture of 
slapstick pantomime sheer corn and sometimes ingenious twists on 
classic situations did not always win critical acclaim they 
remained popular 
while they were regulars on the ed sullivan show in new york 
they always remained torontobased resisting invitations to move 
to new york or los angeles 
shuster 73 lamented the loss saying wednesday night i 
really cant believe hes gone i was with johnny two days 
ago 
an early break came during their college days when canadian 
songwriter ruth lowe recommended them to a talent agency as 
potential professional funnymen 
actually wayne said later we dont know why she was 
enthusiastic she wrote ill never smile again after catching our 
act 
of their experiences entertaining wartime troops wayne said 
we had the distinction of being the only military unit in world 
war ii that was fired on deliberately by all sides 
leonard starmer executive producers of the wayne and shuster 
cbctv show since 1970 said wednesday that to know wayne was to 
be challenged by his sense of humor and his general being ive 
lost a real friend 
its been very difficult for frank both of us feel drained

developed a radio program called wife preservers that dispensed 
household hints with humor at university claude bissell then an 
english lecturer and later the universitys president said to 
wayne what i like about you is you dont let studies interfere 
with your education 
what did interfere with their early career was the war and both 
enlisted in the army but soon after impresario jack arthur 
arranged to have the two transferred to montreal where they became 
headliners in the weekly canadian army radio show 
their success led to a canadian tour and later to britain 
france belgium and holland their group was said to be the first 
to entertain troops in normandy after dday 
this was a tougheningup process said wayne if the men 
could survive us they could survive anything 
by 1947 wayne and shuster had a regular cbc show with a live 
audience ed gould in his book entertaining canadians says the 
pair threatened to quit if they had to play to canned laughter 
after numerous guest appearances on american tv the pair was

array of characters such as the brown pumpernickel professor 
waynegartner and tex rorschach in 1985 wayne and shuster comedy

two lutheran congregations were suspended 
wednesday for ordaining homosexuals 
but the punished churches said the ruling was fair because the 
church disciplinary committee postponed an even worse penalty 
explusion for five years while the denomination wrestles with the 
issue of homosexuality 
both officials of the evangelical lutheran church in america and 
members of the two churches said the ruling recognized a continuing 
debate about whether gay men and lesbians should have to take a vow 
of celibacy to be officially ordained 
the discipline imposed is severe said a report by a 
disciplinary committee that ordered the suspensions at the same 
time the committees decision affords a much needed opportunity 
for study dialogue reconciliation and progress toward a more 
unified understanding 
under the ruling of the 12member disciplinary board the st 
francis lutheran church and first lutheran church wont be expelled 
until dec 31 1995 and then only if church policy has not changed 
but the two san francisco congregations wont be permitted to 
send official delegates to regional church meetings and cannot vote 
on official church policies until reinstated 
ruth frost one of three homosexual pastors whose unauthorized 
ordination led to a threeday church trial on the issue said the 
decision was a defeat for gay men and lesbians 
the positive aspect of this is that the dialogue will 
continue frost told a news conference it is not a victory 
from the perspective of gay and lesbian people because we have 
waited too long for recognition in the church 
kathy kelly cochairwoman of the disciplinary board was among 
four panel members who issued a minority report objecting to the 
expulsion of the congregations on principle 
even if we are unwilling to embrace diversity on this question 
of conduct as a permanent part of our churchs life we should at 
least be prepared to accept such differences the minority report 
said 
bishop lyle miller who called for the investigation that led to 
the suspension said the issue deserved more study before the two 
congregations are kicked out of the lutheran church 
the complicated issues surrounding sexuality homosexuality 
and ministry cannot be resolved by a discipline committee said 
miller the chicagobased denomination has started a study of 
church homosexuality that could lead to new rules he said 
the disputed policy prohibits sex outside marriage since 
homosexuals arent allowed to marry in the lutheran church the 
evangelical church will only ordain homosexuals who take a vow of 
celibacy 
frost 42 and her lover phyllis zillhart 32 have both 
refused to make such a promise st francis ordained the pair on 
jan 20 without official permission and in violation of 
congressional rules 
jeff johnson a homosexual who is assistant pastor at first 
united was ordained during the unauthorized ceremony and has 
refused to take a vow of celibacy johnson and zillhart were both 
in chicago on wednesday and unavailable for comment 
the pastors of the two suspended churches both vowed to try and 
change the rules during the next five years so they arent expelled 
we dont want to leave the church we love the church the 
rev james delange of st francis said 
we are heartened by part of this decision added the rev 
john frykman of first united 
the evangelical lutheran church with 53 million members is 
the largest lutheran group n the united states

politician koko sato said on wednesday he was 
complimenting us trade representative carla hills and not 
dismissing her when he referred to her as a woman after all at 
last weeks houston economic summit 
sato deputy secretarygeneral of japans governing liberal 
democratic party said he was trying to combat what he said was the 
prevalent image here of the us trade representative as being 
tough cold and even scary 
japanese newspapers and wire services quoted sato this week as 
describing hills as a woman after all in his remarks on a 
twohour conversation with her at houston 
i was just saying that when we switched from talking about 
business to talking about our families she would suddenly become 
a housewife and mother he told the associated press in a 
telephone interview 
thats why i said it when i said woman i meant a family 
person 
many seem to be afraid of hills but if you talk to her you 
realize she is a wise fine person 
sato 61 also bridled at being quoted in newspapers as having 
said the 56yearold hills was charming and cute as well as 
getting on a bit in age 
he said he had in fact complimented the us trade 
representative for seeming quite young despite being a grandmother 
he was merely repeating her own response to the compliment sato 
said 
sato a nineterm legislator from the northern island of 
hokkaido holds an influential position in the governing party he 
made a political comeback after being given a suspended sentence in 
japans lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s

former beatle paul mccartney said wednesday he 
never planned to get caught up in a beef over meateating during 
his first concert in iowa 
we havent come out on this tour to preach against meat 
mccartney said at a news conference before the concert were 
procorn very procorn 
the concert created a stir throughout pork and beef country 
along with a massive traffic jam in this central iowa city of 
45600 organizers expected the concert wednesday night to draw 
55000 
but an animal rights groups meat stinks campaign attracted 
most of the attention 
mccartney and his wife linda a keyboard player in his band 
are vegetarians no meat or fish is served to the 180 people 
traveling with mccartney 
this whole tour is vegetarian linda mccartney said 
the marylandbased people for the ethical treatment of animals 
planned to have an informational booth at the concert and to offer 
tofu not dogs as an alternative to the meatbased hot dogs 
country singer kd langs meat stinks television ads taped 
for the organization led to a ban of her music from some midwest 
radio stations last month paul and linda mccartney came to langs 
aid and have taped a message for the animal rights groups hotline 
iowa is the nations leading pork producing state and ranks 
fourth in the cattle being fattened for market 
before the concert mccartney was more interested in talking 
about environmental issues and his work with friends of the earth 
than about meat the environmental group hopes to win allies among 
iowa farmers for a campaign to protect groundwater quality 
iowa cattlemen said tuesday they were urging their supporters to 
concentrate on extolling the benefits of eating beef 
the iowa cattlemens association does not endorse any type of 
protest or demonstration at the mccartney concert and will not be 
participating in any such activities marshall king of boone the 
associations president said in a statement 
we urge all livestock producers and agriculture groups to 
channel their energy instead to working together to provide the 
public with accurate information about our industry king said 
the iowa pork producers association said it will not try to 
counter the animalrights groups efforts at the concert 
the reason they are doing that is clearly to provoke some 
reaction from livestock producers said andy baumert a pork 
producers staff member that would serve their purpose more than 
ours we are not going to participate in that 
linda mccartney has written a vegetarian cookbook called linda 
mccartneys home cooking already out in england and to be issued 
oct 31 in this country by arcade publishing 
she said she and her family became vegetarians one sunday 20 
years ago when they looked out their kitchen window as they ate 
lunch and saw their sheep in the field 
if animals could speak i think theyd tell us not to eat 
meat linda mccartney said in an earlier interview we are such 
a pompous race of humans were so destructive so sad people 
dream of heaven and you know were living in heaven but we make

a cuban delegation headed by the son of 
president fidel castro on wednesday signed three agreements to 
cooperate on peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
i think there will be a type of collaboration and cooperation 
that will benefit both countries said fidel castro diazbalart 
speaking at a news conference in mexicos capital 
he said the accord showed that cuba is not as isolated as 
critics of its hardline communist government have alleged since 
the democratic changes in eastern europe and the election defeat of 
nicaraguas leftist sandinistas 
the younger castro cubas executive secretary for nuclear 
affairs said the agreements would promote cooperation in areas 
ranging from nuclear power to medicine and industry but no 
specific projects were mentioned 
each country has a single nuclear power plant mexicos troubled 
laguna verde plant along the gulf of mexico uses us technology 
while cubas nuclear plant in cienfuegos about 180 miles southeast 
of havana uses soviet designs 
in response to questions castro said cuba planned to expand its 
use of nuclear technology throughout its economy and intended to 
build more nuclear power plants 
he noted that cuba has virtually no oil or coal practically 
we dont have options to nuclear power he said 
critics say mexicos laguna verde plant uses outdated and 
dangerous technology and a us plant based on similar technology 
has been closed 
soviet designs such as those used in cuba have come under 
increasing criticism both within the soviet union and in eastern 
europe especially following the soviet chernobyl nuclear plant 
disaster in 1986

american psychiatry for six decades and a major influence in prison 
and mental health reform nationally died wednesday of cancer he 
would have been 97 on sunday 
menninger who argued that insane people could be treated died 
at stormontvail regional medical center said judy craig 
spokeswoman for menninger the psychiatric center he helped found 
in 1925 he was admitted to the hospital june 12 and diagnosed with 
abdominal cancer two weeks later 
funeral plans were incomplete but services were expected to be 
here on saturday 
menninger was one of the first psychiatrists to integrate 
psychoanalytic theory into their practice said dr elissa benedek 
president of the american psychiatric association of washington 
dc 
he wrote and spoke the language of the average american 
making mental illnesses more understandable and less feared she 
said 
dr gertrude ticho a member of the american psychoanalytical 
association also said from washington his greatest contribution 
was the pioneering of psychoanalytical principles and thoughts 
a nephew dr walter menninger said he consistently conveyed 
a message of hope for the mentally ill 
he was curious about everything imaginable and unimaginable on 
this planet said a close friend andrew j gray of topeka 
menninger was once hailed by the american psychiatric 
association as the nations greatest living psychiatrist a 
forceful outspoken maverick he jolted popular thought with his 
theories on crime prisons and child abuse 
he was credited with convincing the american public that mental 
disorders could be treated and cured and he wrote the crime of 
punishment in 1968 to argue that you dont rehabilitate a man 
by beating him 
the menninger clinic which he founded with his father in 
topeka is one of the worlds most famous hospitals for the 
mentally ill he cofounded the menninger foundation a nonprofit 
organization for training research and public education in 
psychiatry and psychology its name was shortened to just menninger 
in 1989 
norman cousins a longtime friend of menninger who has written 
on health for the layman explained the psychiatrists choice of 
the midwest rather than a more stylish big city 
i think in going out to topeka he was able to demonstrate the 
fact that ideas can come out of the heartland and not just the 
periphery cousins said in an interview from los angeles he 
inspired me in that respect when we edited the saturday review we 
saw as the intellectual center as the midwest rather than either 
coast 
cousins said menninger explained that mental and physical health 
problems are inseparable and must be treated that way 
he showed the aim of the wise physician is to help the patient 
achieve a vital balance that what could go wrong in the mind 
could affect the body and what could go wrong in the body could 
affect the mind 
menninger received the nations highest civilian honor the 
presidential medal of freedom in 1981 the inscription read in 
part with the wisdom of his years he truly does represent the 
ideas of another generation the future rather than the past 
in recent years he still went to his office daily meeting with 
students having lunch with friends receiving guests and sometimes 
fretting about his place in history 
he took no credit for attaining age milestones i thank god i 
lived as long as i did its more his doing than mine and i had 
good parents you know 
karl augustus menninger was born july 22 1893 in topeka the 
eldest of three sons of dr charles f menninger he considered 
newspaper work or banking then decided to join his father in 
medicine and in 1917 graduated with honors from harvard medical 
school 
he interned in kansas city and taught briefly at tufts medical 
school in 1919 after the death of dr ernest southard of boston 
psychopathic hospital one of the great inspirations of my 
life menninger joined his fathers practice 
he soon became what was then called a nerve specialist 
menninger once recalled that he and his father established their 
clinic in 1925 because i saw you couldnt do psychiatry alone 
you needed others around you 
my chief purpose in the beginning was to show you could treat 
insane people everybody thought they were untreatable but i 
said they were being treated every day we demonstrated you could 
treat people in a better way 
in december 1925 his brother william returned from new york 
and joined the clinic in a twostory frame home in west topeka the 
building was designated a national landmark in 1974 
in 1941 the menningers set up the menninger foundation karl 
menninger served as its president from 194143 director of its 
education department for a time and chief of staff from 19521956 
he became chairman of the board of trustees in 1954 
menninger was hottempered and excitable and the force of his 
personality frequently startled those meeting him for the first 
time 
i guess i always have been a bit of a curmudgeon but i liked 
things done right he once said 
his greatest ambition was to do what he could to help mankind 
ive always believed in amelioration improving the lot of 
man he said 
by his own admission he sometimes tilted at windmills 
especially in his criticisms of the nations prison system yet he 
lived to see prison reform becoming reality much like the changes 
that swept through the nations mental institutions in the 1940s 
and 1950s 
crime and reform dominated his thinking in later years 
he moved to chicago in 1966 serving as a consultant on prison 
affairs and helping set up a mental health center in downtown 
chicago he moved back to topeka in 1974 
as he grew older he turned to painting and studying 
americanindian history for relaxation he also wrote 14 books 
including sparks the human mind love against hate and 
the vital balance 
in december 1976 he underwent surgery at the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn for removal of a brain tumor it left a portion 
of his face paralyzed and his speech slurred however he amazed 
associates by bringing both back to nearly normal through 
biofeedback and exercise 
survivors include his second wife jeanetta lyle menninger whom 
he married in 1941 a son three daughters and nine grandchildren 
funeral services were scheduled saturday at the first 
presbyterian church near the state capitol followed by a private 
graveside service

fearing victory by the khmer rouge the bush 
administration abruptly announced wednesday it is ending 
recognition of rebels battling the vietnamesebacked government of 
cambodia and instead opening talks with vietnam 
we want to do everything we can to prevent a return of the 
khmer rouge to power secretary of state james a baker iii said 
in announcing the policy reversal he said it did not mean the 
united states was normalizing relations with vietnam 
the khmer rouge was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians during a fouryear reign of terror that 
ended with vietnams 1978 invasion after 11 years of civil war 
the khmer rouge controls large sections of northwestern cambodia 
we had a goal of seeking vietnamese withdrawal from 
cambodia baker said in describing the reversal we have 
realized that 
vietnam contends it removed the last of its troops from cambodia 
in september 
a senior administration official said the united states is still 
seeking verification of this claim the official said there are no 
vietnamese combat units in cambodia but there may still be as many 
as 10000 vietnamese military advisers in cambodia 
another policy goal was to prevent the return of the khmer 
rouge to power the secretary of state told reporters weve 
not been able to achieve that goal and in fact it would appear 
that the risks are greater as we move forward that that might in 
fact occur so we want to do everything we can to prevent a return 
of the khmer rouge to power 
on capitol hill senate democratic leader george mitchell called 
past administration policy a dismal failure and said further 
steps are needed beyond bakers announcement 
with widespread reports of increasingly effective khmer rouge 
military actions inside cambodia there is simply no excuse to 
delay additional action such as direct talks with the cambodian 
government he said 
bakers announcement came three weeks after the senate 
intelligence committee according to sources who requested 
anonymity voted in closed session to end a 13 millionayear 
covert military aid program for the resistance coalition 
the senior administration official speaking on condition he not 
be identified said the administration will continue to press for 
aid to the antigovernment forces 
baker said the decision to begin discussions with the hanoi 
government does not constitute a decision to normalize relations 
with vietnam it is a decision simply to begin a dialogue with 
vietnam about cambodia 
he called khmer rouge control of the country in the mid1970s 
extraordinarily tragic the rebels had tried under the 
leadership of pol pot to force the country into a primitive 
agrarian commune 
baker spoke after meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze whose government supports vietnam the two were in 
paris for talks with european leaders on german unification 
shevardnadze standing next to baker commented that our 
approaches on the cambodian problem in principle have become much 
closer 
the administration official said the talks with representatives 
of the hanoi government will be held in new york where vietnam has 
a un mission he said ken quinn a deputy assistant secretary of 
state who deals with southeast asia would represent the united 
states 
under us pressure the united nations has awarded a seat to 
the cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to 
cambodian premier hun sen 
baker who revealed the policy change in answering a question 
about a los angeles times article said the united states was also 
changing its policy toward the cambodian un seat 
the senior administration official said that the united states 
will no longer support seating a member of the resistance 
coalition as long as it includes the khmer rouge but would not 
support awarding the hun sen government the seat either 
our feeling is that the hun sen regime is unelected was 
installed by force and doesnt merit seating at the un he said 
beijing the chief backer of the khmer rouge had no immediate 
reaction to bakers announcement 
telephone calls to the beijing resistance of prince norodom 
sihanouk the leader of the rebel coalition went unanswered 
sihanouks son prince norodom ranariddh commander of his 
fathers noncommunist army allied with the khmer rouge said the 
us move would force the guerrillas closer to beijing 
in the future to survive to go on fighting we will have to 
accept more aid from china he told reporters in bangkok 
the development was welcomed on capitol hill 
with the khmer rouge at phnom penhs gate the president is 
finally reacting said sen alan cranston dcalif he said bush 
needs to open direct talks with the hanoibacked government of hun 
sen 
the senior official said the administration is considering the 
question of talking to the pnom penh regime at some appropriate 
level but we want to do so only if it can be done to advance us 
toward the goal of free and fair elections in cambodia right now 
we do not yet see that opportunity presenting itself 
the talks with vietnam could be the first step toward 
normalization of relations 17 years after the united states 
withdrew its troops from indochina and accepted the communist 
victory over usbacked south vietnam in 1975 
baker said the progress of the dialogue over cambodia as well 
as what vietnam does about helping locate americans who may be 
missing in action in southeast asia will have a lot to do with 
whether or not we can move toward normalization 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater also said the 
dialogue would be confined to cambodia 
it really doesnt go any further than that the white house 
press secretary said were not considering normalization or any 
other moves 
in cambodia the guerrillas said they retained firm hold over 
the strategic town of stoung in the center of the country also 
the khmer rouge said in a radio broadcast today its fighters had 
launched a fivepronged attack over the weekend on the countrys 
secondlargest city battambang in the northwest

the senate ethics committee unanimously 
recommended wednesday that the full senate denounce sen dave 
durenberger for his unequivocally unethical financial conduct 
the panel proposed he make restitution of up to 124050 for 
exceeding senate limits on speaking fees and accepting improper 
reimbursements 
the committees recommendations for punishment of the minnesota 
republican go to the full senate leaders of both parties said they 
would try to schedule action before senators leave for their august 
recess 
the committee said durenberger should reimburse the senate 
29050 plus interest for accepting reimbursements for use of a 
condo he partially owned and pay charities 95000 for exceeding 
speaking fee limits in 1985 and 1986 the amount would be lowered 
by taxes durenberger paid on the money 
the panels most serious recommendation could have been 
expulsion a penalty usually reserved for serious criminal 
violations but the committee did not find any criminality on 
durenbergers part 
the committee said durenberger had knowingly and willingly 
violated federal civil law as well as senate rules and cited as 
reprehensible durenbergers behavior on virtually every 
allegation of financial misconduct that was part of the panels 
investigation 
that behavior has brought the senate into dishonor and 
disrepute the committee said the panel referred its findings 
without making any recommendations to senate republicans who 
could strip durenberger of any positions of party responsibility 
the findings also will go to federal agencies including the justice 
department and federal election commission 
durenberger said that of all the thousands of words that have 
been written or spoken during 23 months of investigation news 
coverage and commentary only three are appropriate today i am 
sorry 
he strongly indicated he has no intention of resigning his seat 
commenting i intend to spend the next four years being the best 
senator i can 
durenberger added that he accepted the committees direction to 
make restitution as a tangible sign of my regret and continuing 
commitment to the people of minnesota 
he said his outstanding or unbilled legal fees total 377000 
and he has already paid 211934 for previous legal costs the 
senator said he has raised 121337 so far for his legal expenses 
the money was raised from political supporters 
the committee passed a resolution saying that durenberger 55 a 
senator since 1978 should be denounced by the united states 
senate 
senate historians have said this would amount to a censure a 
punishment that would have no practical effect on durenbergers 
duties it could however seriously damage him in minnesota where 
his popularity has suffered since the case began a year ago 
the committee criticized durenbergers clearly and 
unequivocally unethical conduct in connection with 
his arrangement with piranha press in which durenberger 
contended he made speeches to promote two books that he said were 
not subject to the senates limits on honoraria the committee 
found however that these were normal honoraria speeches and were 
subject to the limits 
the senators failure to report the receipt of travel expenses 
in connection with his bookpromotion appearances and dualpurpose 
trips to the boston area in the later trips durenberger made 
speeches timed to coincide with trips to his marriage counselors 
office there 
durenbergers real estate dealings involving his minneapolis 
condominium so he could continue to receive questionable 
reimbursements from the senate for his stays there 
his pattern of discussing the condominium with the trustee of 
his blind trust 
repeated acceptance of free limousine service in violation of 
senate gift limits 
conversion of a campaign contribution to personal use 
committee chairman howell heflin dala and vice chairman 
warren b rudman rnh said their findings will be referred to 
the justice department and the federal election commission rudman 
however stressed at a news conference there was no finding of 
criminality anywhere in the report 
rudman told reporters that the panel found a pattern of 
misconduct in his book and condominium deals and taken in their 
totality the committee decided unanimously that they merited 
regretfully this severe punishment 
the committees report should go to the senate in seven to 10 
days 
the senators said they intentionally did not recommend any 
specific action to republican senators 
that is not a proper matter for the ethics committee that is 
a republican party matter they can read they can look at the 
sanction rudman said 
in minnesota the chairman of the democratfarmerlabor party 
todd otis said durenberger had brought a black cloud to 
minnesota politics and should resign or submit himself to the 
voters in a special election this year instead of waiting to 1994 
but barb sykora chairwoman of the independentrepublican party 
rejecting any suggestion that the senator should resign said 
durenberger would work very hard to get himself back into the 
good graces of the voters in the next four years

a bankruptcy judge wednesday tentatively 
approved the sale of the remaining assets of jim bakkers failed 
religious empire to a california evangelist for 45 million 
us bankruptcy judge thurmond bishop approved the sale to 
morris cerullo of san diego on the condition that two creditors 
owed 555 million by bakkers former ptl ministry resolve their 
terms by next tuesday 
the bankruptcy trustee overseeing ptls assets said he believes 
the sale will go through 
i think its going to happen trustee dennis shedd said 
last month morris cerullo world evangelism inc of san diego 
bought ptls religious cable network for 7 million 
with the additional 45 million cerullo would gain ownership of 
heritage usa the fort mill religious theme park that includes a 
500room hotel a shopping mall five restaurants a 10 million 
water park and 1700 acres of undeveloped land 
under the deal secured creditors will get about 3868 million 
of cerullos offer some of the remainder will pay for 
administrative costs with what little is left over going to 
unsecured creditors 
the unsecured creditors include the lifetime partners of 
bakkers ministry who are owed an estimated 160 million 
thousands of jim and tammy bakkers fans paid 1000 each in 
exchange for promises of lodging at the theme park the bakkers 
spent much of that money on houses jewels fancy vacations and 
other luxuries 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since bakkers 
spectacular downfall in 1987 following a sexandmoney scandal 
involving former church secretary jessica hahn bakker is serving a 
45year federal sentence for conspiracy and fraud 
the sale to cerullo was applauded by several bakker followers 
who attended the court hearing one lifetime partner said she 
thought cerullo was sent by god to take over heritage usa 
were going to win souls for jesus christ said edie stern 
75 we will win one billion souls worldwide in the decade of the 
90s it will be better and bigger than ever 
cerullo who did not appear in court wednesday will have until 
oct 19 to close the deal shedd said the first step will be 
obtaining the agreement of the two holdout creditors first 
mortgage investment and the resolution trust corp the government 
agency that takes over the business of failed savings and loans 
cerullo spokesman alan elias attempted to dispel concerns that 
cerullo would not have the money to finance the deal 
the bankruptcy court and dennis shedd would not have gone 
forth with the deal if they were not confident about the 
financing he said 
cerullo plans to repay the loans with a major fundraising 
campaign that will get under way in september according to a 
statement from his office 
secured creditors are those who possess a deed to parts of the 
ptl estate as collateral against their investments or loans 
last year toronto businessman stephen mernick failed to close 
on a 65 million deal to buy ptl when he failed to title insurance 
because of the catawba indian nations claim to 144000 acres of 
ancestral land that includes the heritage usa site 
on wednesday another federal judge released some of that land 
from the claim but attorneys were not sure if all was exempt the 
catawbas said they would appeal the decision

district attorney harry connick testified 
wednesday at his federal racketeering trial that it wasnt illegal 
or unusual for him to return seized gambling records to an arrested 
bookmaker 
it is my opinion that individuals accused of a crime have a 
right to examine those things that can be used against them he 
said under questioning from his attorney 
connick 63 is charged with racketeering and knowingly aiding 
an illegal gambling organization by returning betting sheets seized 
in a december 1988 raid connick has long contended that he was 
required to return the records under louisiana rules of criminal 
procedure 
bookie walton aucoin and aucoins lawyer patrick fanning are 
among connicks six codefendants connick said he decided to 
return the records at the urging of aucoin fanning and others 
connick said fanning told him aucoin needed the seized records 
to file federal income tax returns 
connick said prosecutors routinely and legally return seized 
items to defendants unless the items are drugs weapons or other 
things that cannot legally be possessed 
state discovery laws have been changed ovet the past 20 years to 
allow easier access he said 
connick said he stuck by his decision to give back copies of the 
records despite pressure from capt craig jennings head of the new 
orleans police departments intelligence division who wanted them 
withheld 
one thing he said he seemed to insist that returning them 
would be aiding and abetting a gambler i said thats not my 
interpretation of the law and i want to give them back connick 
said 
during crossexamination james cole a prosecutor from the 
justice departments public integrity section tried to weaken 
connicks claim that gambling cases were not a high priority for 
his office 
you understood that gambling is harmful to the public didnt 
you cole asked 
i think it can be harmful yes connick replied 
cole attacked connicks argument that since other seized items 
such as fishing nets used illegally by fishermen can be returned 
to the accused the betting records should have been returned as 
well 
nets can be used for legal or illegal fishing cant they 
cole said people cant use bookmaking records to conduct a legal 
business can they 
not that i can think of connick said 
connick faces up to 25 years in prison and 250000 in fines if 
convicted of two counts against him the trial began june 11 
connick the father of jazz musician harry connick jr has been 
district attorney in new orleans since 1974 he is up for 
reelection in october 
among the others on trial in us district court are actor paul 
burke a boyhood friend of connicks who starred in the 1960s 
television series the naked city burke is charged with one 
count of racketeering one count of aiding an illegal gambling 
operation and one count of lying to a federal grand jury

indin leaders asked the canadian government and 
the united nations on wednesday to begin an inquiry into a mohawk 
land dispute in quebec that has left a provincial police officer 
dead and prompted an antiindian backlash 
mohawk spokeswoman ellen gabriel said wednesday that mohawks 
want to take their arguments relating to sovereignty and land 
rights to the uns international court of justice in the hague 
flanked by us lawyers william kunstler and stanley cohen 
gabriel said the indians also want a moratorium on land development 
in the disputed area until a ruling by the court kunstler has 
defended indian rights in the united states 
indian leader walter david made the latest appeal for federal 
involvement in the confrontation that has taken one life and sorely 
tested quebec provincial officials 
in his remarks wednesday david made an appeal for calm in the 
weekold standoff well resolve this very soon he said but 
the feds have to get out here and get out here soon 
for four months the mohawks have blocked access to a golf 
course in oka a town 18 miles west of montreal the municipality 
had been trying to build an addition to the golf course on land the 
mohawks claim as ancestral territory 
on july 11 police stormed the indian barricade one officer was 
killed but it is unclear if he was killed by mohawks or fellow 
officers the armed indians remained there wednesday 
since the shootout mohawks at the nearby kahnawake reservation 
have been demonstrating their sympathy by blocking a bridge between 
montreal and its southern suburbs related demonstrations have 
occurred in british columbia and new york 
local residents have vented their anger at the bridge blockade 
with protests and racist slurs on tuesday the residents broke 
through police barriers there but stopped when confronted by 100 
officers standing shouldertoshoulder no injuries were reported 
the international centre for human rights in montreal and the 
canadian human rights commission issued a joint statement wednesday 
condemning such signs of racism as the burning of mohawks in effigy 
at chateauguay near the montreal bridge 
federal indian affairs minister tom siddon defended ottawas 
record in the mohawk dispute and said the federal government has 
tried several times to purchase land at oka to set up a reservation 
he didnt explain what prevented the government from doing so 
on tuesday yvon picotte quebec minister of municipal affairs 
accused siddon of being blind deaf and dumb in the dispute and 
shirking his responsibilities 
siddon has monitored the standoff the past week while leaving 
negotiations up to quebec native affairs minister john ciaccia 
indian leaders wednesday were reviewing that provincial officials 
undisclosed proposal for an agreement 
the federal minister had been personally involved in the past 
last month he met with mohawks oka municipal politicians and 
ciaccia at that time he suggested the government buy the golf 
course land for the natives if it was for sale 
one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations has been 
mohawk insistence that those behind indian barricades be immune 
from prosecution 
at a quebec city news conference wednesday provincial premier 
robert bourassa rejected the idea of amnesty for anyone found 
guilty of committing a crime at oka

communities report damage from mondays quake about 150 workers at 
a factory in the northern city of baguio were missing and may have 
been killed in a fire that broke out after the quake 
authorities also began plans to evacuate tourists and others 
from baguio which has a population of about 119000 baguio is 110 
miles north of manila 
many people bitterly complained that rescue efforts were poorly 
organized and ineffective 
people are losing hope simply because they havent received 
any assistance from the national government said ronnie del moro 
of the gma television network reporting from the town of agoo in 
la union province 
in la union and tarlac provinces thousands of people slept in 
cars and in their yards because of damage to their homes and fears

throughout the area 
in the mountain resort of baguio where at least 82 people were 
killed by mondays quake one woman approached visiting military 
chief of staff gen renato de villa and complained about the rescue 
efforts 
these are all piecemeal measures the unidentified woman 
shouted as president corazon aquinos spokesman tomas gomez tried 
to pacify her with promises that help was on the way why now 
why only now she asked gomez gave no answer 
the aftershocks delayed the search for survivors in several 
hardhit areas

began fleeing after the aftershocks they carried their belongings 
with them like war refugees

aboard military helicopters that were ferrying supplies from an air 
base in a nearby province 
thousands remained camped in city parks many with only 
umbrellas for shelter in the frequent thunderstorms 
we will just walk one woman said its dangerous on the 
road because of the landslides but it would be much safer than 
staying indoors we will be spending the night on the road 
at the hyatt hotel which collapsed in the earthquake clarita 
gonzales tearfully called out with a megaphone for her 5yearold 
daughter trapped in the rubble with her nanny 
if you are still alive please tap mrs gonzales sobbed

of people in central luzon island lacked electricity drinking 
water and food and were camped along highways for fear of 
aftershocks 
in baguio funeral director filemon relis said his mortuary 
received nearly 70 bodies of earthquake victims some bodies were 
covered with blankets and were lying outside his funeral parlor 
because there was no room inside 
mrs aquino flew to the area wednesday to inspect the damage

medicine food and heavy equipment could be brought in she also 
ordered city schools closed for a month

a coroner who dropped a dead baby 
headfirst and used his observations of the result in court 
testimony has been sued by the family of the infant 
dr charles odom former deputy coroner for lafayette parish 
said wednesday he dropped the dead 4monthold girl on a concrete 
floor during an autopsy to determine what damage would result odom 
maintained the experiment was proper 
the infants parents dwayne and ellen arnaud have sued odom 
for 2 million in damages for emotional suffering they claim they 
suffered because of the experiment on their daughter christina 
the infant died dec 22 1986 as a result of sudden infant 
death syndrome odoms autopsy was conducted the same day 
the arnauds parents became suspicious when they were preparing 
the body for burial and noticed disfiguration two months later 
after consulting with lawyers the parish coroner acknowledged the 
child had been intentionally dropped 
odom used information from the experiment while testifying later 
in a manslaughter trial in hawaii as a result of the testimony 
the charge was dismissed 
there are many many purposes and objectives for autopsies 
said odom who is now working as an assistant medical examiner in 
dallas one purpose is to gain medical knowledge and use that 
medical knowledge in the service of the living he said 
odom said skin bone eyes heart valves and kidneys are often 
removed from bodies and used elsewhere without the knowledge of 
the dead persons family 
all of these tissues are harvested from corpses to help the 
living he testified 
on tuesday jefferson parish coroner robert treuting testified 
that pathologists have the legal right to do anything they want 
with the body if they have a legitimate research reason 
under questioning from the arnauds lawyer j simon minos 
treuting said it would be callous for the survivors to be told 
specifically about the experiments because it would compound their 
anguish

residents voluntarily evacuated part of an alaskan village 
wednesday because of heavy smoke from a nearby forest fire and 
crews in montana worked to catch up with a blaze threatening the 
view from a scenic highway 
forests also burned in oregon idaho and washington state but a 
15acre fire in yellowstone national park was contained a fire in 
utah was reduced to hot spots 
the return of hot dry weather in eastern alaska rekindled a 
lowgrade fire south of the town of tok which was threatened 
earlier this month and the blaze quickly spread over more than 
2000 acres said steve waterman a us park service spokesman at 
tok 
the fire produced smoke so thick that all but about 15 of the 90 
residents of tetlin village about seven miles away fled 
officials said 
the fire was in a roadless region and work must be done by crews 
using shovels on the ground or by aircraft dropping chemical fire 
retardant waterman said 
the size of the gird point fire in southwestern montana was 
recalculated wednesday at 1980 acres 20 percent less than earlier 
thought but some 1170 firefighters continued to battle the blaze 
near hamilton 
firefighters discovered old trench lines in the area that they 
hope will help them to control the blaze they reported gaining 
ground late wednesday 
but the fire in the bitterroot national forest continued to 
threaten the vista from the scenic skalkaho highway with some spot 
fires burning within 50 feet of the road said fire information 
officer tim elridge officials had earlier closed the road and 
evacuated several campgrounds in the area 
fire information officer bill rockwell said the hot dry windy 
weather of recent weeks may be a harbinger of a long fire season in 
southwestern montana 
in another couple of weeks if we continue with these hot days 
and precipitation well be in a similar situation as we were in 
88 he said referring to the summer when hundreds of thousands 
of acres burned in yellowstone and other areas of montana and 
surrounding states 
cooperative wind wednesday helped crews battle two fires in 
eastern oregon that had burned across 1550 acres 
oregons largest blaze was the 1200acre corral basin fire 22 
miles southwest of john day but malheur national forest 
spokeswoman heidi bigler said shifting wind blew the fire back on 
itself tuesday and it grew by only 140 acres as it burned through 
steep terrain 
the bear fire on the wallowa whitman national forest near 
anthony lakes ski resort grew by just 50 acres to 350 acres 
firefighters expected to have it and the corral basin fire 
contained late thursday 
improved weather in central idaho let 400 firefighters gain the 
upper hand on the 430acre mormon creek fire just east of the south 
fork of the salmon river about 17 miles east of cascade officials 
said that blaze could be contained as early as friday evening 
there are low temps high humidity and its overcast boise 
national forest spokeswoman sue peece said they did get a little 
bit of precipitation up there so that helped too 
about 100 miles to the east in the challis national forest 
trees burned out of control along the north fork of big creek some 
30 miles east of challis sixteen firefighters moved into the 
primitive roadless area and fire bosses were moving an additional 
160 more men onto the lines 
forest service spokesman frank carroll said the idaho forests 
were as dry now as they were a year ago when fire claimed 200000 
acres in the state 
its like bread carroll said you put it in a toaster and 
you get toast 
in washington a fire in the glacier peak wilderness area about 
60 miles northeast of seattle in the wenatchee national forest 
grew to 550 acres authorities said 
in wyoming the only fire still burning in yellowstone was the 
15acre stonetop fire north of yellowstone lake the fire started 
by lightning on july 12 was 95 percent contained according to 
park spokeswoman sandra robinson 
in utah firefighters remained on the scene of a brush fire in 
the foothills of the oquirrh mountains in case wind rekindled a 
1500acre blaze that previously threatened homes in the area

mohan lal fled his village 13 years ago 
to escape the insults that were part of life as a hindu without a 
caste 
when he returned home last month lal found that his family and 
other casteless people still were pariahs of the village in 
rajasthan state 
caste hindus do not allow outcastes as they are called to 
wear shoes ride bicycles use umbrellas drink from the main 
village well or hold their heads up while walking in the street 
dozens of other rules ostracize the 100 million people in this 
nation of 880 million who are harijans untouchables who do not 
belong to any of the four castes recognized by the hindu religion 
we are treated worse than dogs said lal 28 now a 
construction supervisor in new delhi 
harijans have suffered for centuries under the rigid hindu caste 
system and the oppression is compounded by poverty and illiteracy 
most harijans are agricultural laborers who are lucky to earn 
enough for two meals a day 
there is a lack of awareness and coordination among the 
harijans said tk oomen a sociologist there is no mass 
consciousness harijans are a group by itself but they are not a 
group for itself 
sociologists and social activists say the subjugation of 
harijans is perpetuated by politicians because the untouchables 
provide useful vote banks during elections 
harijans means children of god in hindi mohandas k gandhi 
gave untouchables the name in hopes it would provide them some 
respectability 
the practice of untouchability was declared illegal after 
independence from britain in 1947 but continued unchecked 
politicians rarely talk about the problems of untouchables 
welfare minister ram vilas paswan a harijan himself acknowledged 
in parliament in may that he did not know how many harijans who 
were victims of violence had been aided by the government 
paswan said authoritied had been asked to take appropriate 
action both to punish the perpetrators or crimes and to provide 
appropriate relief and rehabilitation to the victims 
no minister or welfare official has made a public statement 
about the lack of progress in solving the problem of 
untouchability but many say privately it is endemic and too big 
to be solved by the government 
the four hindu castes which determine a persons social 
position by birth are the brahmins or priests kshatriyas or 
soldiers governors and landowners vaishyas or tradespeople and 
farmers and shudras or craftspeople and menial workers each 
caste has many subdivisions 
according to hindu belief caste hindus are defiled by touching 
a harijan and water becomes polluted if a harijan walks past the 
well 
such beliefs took root about 2500 years ago and remain 
widespread in indian villages where 75 percent of the people live 
according to sociologists 
in villages they cant use umbrellas wear new clothes or 
ride bicycles in the presence of caste hindus said kailash 
satyarthi a social activist harijans are beaten up for this 
their women raped and men sometimes killed 
last month the government said 14269 cases of atrocities 
against harijans were recorded in 1989 including 759 rapes and 479 
murders 
one crime was the burning to death of a harijan laborer april 5 
allegedly by his uppercaste village landlord the case was 
publicized because dhanraj was a resident of prime minister vp 
singhs constituency of fatehpur in the northern state of uttar 
pradesh 
the landlord belonged to singhs subcaste the thakurs who are 
part of the kshatriya caste 
members of the opposition congress party raised the issue in 
parliament and brought the victims widow to new delhi 
vp singh should be sent to jail because he is trying to 
protect the killers said kanshi ram president of the majority 
peoples party 
ram born into the sikh religion said the crime in fatehpur was 
not unusual 
his party is the only one in india that speaks for the harijans 
he said they and and tribespeople who also are outside the caste 
system make up 25 percent of the population and the lower castes 
are another 50 percent 
despite such a large reservoir of potential support the 
majority peoples party is strong only in some districts of 
northern india harijans uniformly distributed through the 
country do not have a common political organization 
social activists say politicians use of the lack of leadership 
to perpetuate divisiveness among those of no caste 
the harijans are splintered across political parties and each 
group is something like a politicians personal borough oomen 
said 
politicians guard the status quo because economic and 
educational progress would open the eyes of the harijans said 
satyarthi the social activist

children smacked together their hands as 
they tried to pop bubbles that appeared to float toward them 
other viewers ducked as balloons seemingly burst in their faces 
the movie they were viewing at the osaka expo 90 was a new film 
technology that seems to pull moviegoers right into the screen 
the film which shows simulations of microscopic life processes 
beginning with photosynthesis in plants and ending with blood 
sugars dizzying trip through human veins is being shown to 
thousands of viewers each day at the expos fujitsu pavilion it is 
one of several hightech works produced by the canadian firm imax 
systems corp in cooperation with japanese partners 
fujitsus film echoes of the sun shows strong imprints of 
both partners many of the visual images in the movie were produced 
with computer graphics developed by the major japanese electronics 
firm 
a fujitsu supercomputer a computer that handles extremely 
large inputs of data at very high speeds was used to make the 
stunning images of plant cells muscle fibers and atoms that float 
at the audience from the bowlshaped screen overhead 
it was also used to synchronize the two separate images used to 
produce a vivid sense of the threedimensional 
imax is a pioneer of giantscreen film technology its films all 
use a 70 mm film format with each frame 10 times the size of 
conventional 35 mm films special projectors and sixchannel sound 
systems its new technologies involve the use of multiple or 
customdesigned screens to give viewers a sense of leaving their 
seats to travel with the camera 
the fujitsu theater is premiering the first fullcolor film 
using imax solido a bowlshaped screen like that of a planetarium 
viewers wear goggles with lenses made of liquid crystal diodes 
like the face of a watch or computer screen that react to sensors 
in the two projectors used to show the left and righteye views of 
each scene 
since vision usually involves the combining of separate views 
from each eye into a single threedimensional image the 20minute 
solido film gives a very vivid 3d impression the screen extends 
beyond the peripheral vision of the audience and seems to disappear 
water seems to splash into the seats feathers from a pillow 
fight float through the air and the finale showing a 
loinclothclad kodo drum troupe from sado island in the japan sea 
thunders muscularly through the theater 
another imax film that made its debut at the osaka exposition is 
imax magic carpet it does not require goggles but it involves two 
18by25meter 594by825foot screens one in front of the 
audience and the other underfoot but visible through a transparent 
floor 
in keeping with the theme of the osaka international garden and 
greenery exposition flowers in the sky at the sanwa midorikan 
green hall documents the migration of monarch butterflies from 
canada to mexico where they winter 
while it isnt a 3d film synchronized images above and below 
also give viewers a strong sense of floating through the air along 
with the butterflies over lakes and forests above niagara falls 
and across the gulf of mexico on their 1900mile journey 
helicopters and other aircraft used to track the monarchs 
carried two synchronized cameras one facing forward and another 
facing downward to capture the feeling of flying through the air 
but the 15minute film which is sponsored by a group of 
companies led by the sanwa bank often uses only the upper screen 
to follow the life cycle of the butterflies and has a less dramatic 
visual impact than the 3d solido film 
japanese audiences saw the premiere of imaxs first hightech 
film 20 years ago at the osaka 1970 exposition and the latest 
films are among the most popular attractions at the 1990 exposition 
organizers at both pavilions said their theaters were filled to 
capacity for every performance with many viewers waiting several 
hours for a chance to float through the air while still safely 
seated

after being kicked out of china for his 
blistering attacks on the beijing leadership taiwan folk singer 
hou dejian wants to head back to the recording studio away from the 
political limelight 
i used to be an amateur dissident in china now i want to 
resume my career as a professional musician hou 33 said in a 
recent interview just weeks after chinese authorities placed him 
on a fishing boat bound for this offshore island 
his deportation last month ended an eventful sojourn in china 
that began seven years earlier with his defection from taiwan the 
seat of the nationalist chinese government that rivals the chinese 
communists he left behind a wife a twoyearold son and irate 
nationalist officials 
hou led a comfortable generally apolitical life of celebrity in 
china after the defection symbolized by the maroon mercedes sedan 
he drove through the impoverished streets of beijing but all that 
changed in 1989 when he went on a fast in tiananmen square in 
support of the prodemocracy movement 
when troops were called in to crush the massive prodemocracy 
protest hou negotiated an evacuation of students from the square 
and then fled himself to the safety of the australian embassy he 
emerged two months later and became one of the few chinese willing 
to openly condemn the government 
he then disappeared may 31 just before he was to issue an open 
letter calling for the release of political prisoners he surfaced 
in taiwan three weeks later saying chinese authorities forced him 
to choose deportation or jail 
the lean bespectacled songwriter is now free on bail while 
prosecutors investigate whether he illegally entered taiwan his 
case is expected to be treated leniently because of his role in the 
prodemocracy movement 
the ambivalence of the government toward hou whose 1983 
defection was a stinging propaganda blow to the nationalists is 
reflected in the taiwanese public at large 
onethird of the respondents to a recent survey in the china 
times newspaper said they welcomed hous return while onequarter 
said they did not some of the people surveyed referred to hou as 
an opportunist or grass on the fence that bends whichever 
way the wind blows 
but publisher chen paichung looks at the singer in a different 
light opportunists are those who cater to both sides but hou 
has said things that pleased neither 
hou who claims he does not care much about the poll results 
would no doubt agree with chens evaluation he is busy writing a 
100000word autobiography titled the real troublemaker 
the chainsmoking singer who lives with his two younger 
brothers in a quiet suburban community also plans to record an 
album of songs written during the past two years one cut tells of 
his wife in china who left him for another exiled dissident 
student leader wuer kaixi you are a little rock in my shoe 
go the lyrics you kill me wherever i go 
in his television talk show appearances interviewers seem 
particularly interested in hou the jilted lover they also pepper 
him with accusatory questions about his statement last year to the 
official chinese media that he saw nobody killed in tiananmen on 
june 4 1989 and believed fewer than 1000 people died in the 
crackdown 
hous answers on television tend to be brief and abstract but 
in an interview with the ap he spoke plainly about his generally 
pessimistic view of chinas future 
hou is particularly gloomy about the prospects for democratic 
change in china the liberalization already under way in eastern 
europe and the soviet union wont come to china soon because the 
peasantry which accounts for the bulk of the population is too 
conservative and unreceptive to revolution he said 
he also believes that the fractured groups of exiled chinese 
dissidents are doomed to collapse just like ice that melts into 
water on a hot day 
the dark portrait of china painted by hou represents a 
fundamental change for a writer whos first hit and still most 
memorable song heir of the dragon in 1978 was filled with 
nostalgic admiration for the chinese people living on both sides of 
the taiwan straits 
the song was published when the united states announced plans to 
switch diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing and helped 
boost confidence in taiwans future i wrote the song because i 
believed chinese could solve the problem on our own he recalled 
the singer now acknowledges that when he finally arrived in 
china he realized chinese culture was helpless because it was 
a culture that served emperors for 3000 years chinese are slaves 
who need masters 
hou has become an admirer of western civilization which he says 
does not have such a servile past once his legal problems are 
resolved he hopes to move to australia to study english

in new hampshire where george bush learned 
lip reading taxes are a prime issue in a state campaign mirroring 
the financial squeeze that finally forced the president to swallow 
his nonewtax vow 
gov judd gregg says bush made a mistake when he dropped the 
barrier against raising federal taxes gregg seeking a second 
term isnt budging from his own pledge against a state sales or 
income tax although he presided over a round of increases in most 
existing levies 
he has raised taxes more than any other governor in history 
said j joseph grandmaison a former democratic state chairman one 
of three candidates for the nomination to oppose gregg 
the governor said the new hampshire tax system works to keep a 
rein on government by restricting state revenues it has served 
us well gregg said in an interview we continue to be the 
lowest taxed state in the country on the basis of personal income 
new hampshire has neither general sales nor income tax and the 
pledge to keep it that way has become standard in state campaigns 
a line breached only by losers 
most campaign years the pledge against a broadbased tax has 
been unanimous among the contenders in both parties robert 
preston minority leader of the state senate has taken that pledge 
in his bid for the democratic nomination for governor 
the other two democratic candidates in the sept 11 primary are 
talking of tax change grandmaison said the system should be 
reviewed and reformed ending the era of no general sales or income 
tax although he isnt proposing a specific formula paul 
blacketor a state representative and college professor recommends 
a state income tax 
those are perilous campaign positions that lesson was 
reinforced when john sununu now the white house chief of staff 
was elected governor in 1982 upsetting a democrat who eased away 
from the orthodox ban against sales or income tax just as a 
wavering republican was ousted in a primary a decade earlier 
in 1988 when vice president bush limped into the new hampshire 
presidential primary campaign after losing his first campaign test 
in iowa the notax issue was tailored to his needs sununu ran the 
campaign in which bush and his barrage of campaign commercials 
depicted sen bob dole of kansas as a protax republican the 
tactic helped bush overtake dole to win the primary he had no more 
trouble on his way to the gop nomination 
the tax pledge became a staple of the bush campaign and 
eventually a oneliner 
read my lips no new taxes 
that gave way late last month to a bush concession that there 
will have to be tax revenue increases to cope with a swollen 
federal budget deficit bush said hed had to rethink his position 
in changing circumstances sununu resisted the tax retreat 
gregg a former house member said bush made a mistake when he 
dropped the tax bar without a democratic commitment to slash 
spending my experience in congress is that theyll take all the 
taxes youll give them and spend it he said 
he said bushs concession on taxes muted a basic republican 
theme it blurs the distinction between the parties gregg said 
but the governor said it wont hurt the gop in new hampshire 
where conservative republicans are absolutists on the tax issue 
federal and state gregg said hell try to cope with slumping state 
revenues and an increasing deficit with spending curbs not with a 
broadbased tax 
new hampshire already has raised the rates on its assortment of 
state taxes and imposed a new 5 percent communications tax 
property taxes have spiraled upward stirring signs of the kind 
of tax rebellion that has hit elsewhere it shows in town votes to 
turn down local school budgets rising property taxes have become a 
staple of talk radio programs a poll conducted this spring by 
american research group of manchester showed that 57 percent of 
those surveyed were opposed to a state sales tax but 58 percent 
would favor one if it came with a guarantee that the revenues would 
be used to cut property taxes 
grandmaison is banking on those attitudes as he proposes 
changing a system in which more than 60 percent of combined state 
and local revenues come from property taxes the national average 
is 20 percent 
our reliance on the property tax is inherently unfair he 
said 
he said any proposed tax bill would have to provide for the 
return of revenues to the towns to ease the property tax burden or 
it wouldnt stand a chance of enactment 
gregg said that wont work and new hampshire voters know it 
you dont reduce taxes by raising taxes he said thats 
medicine man politics

united methodist clergy are consistently 
more liberal than lay members according to research by the 
denominations general council on ministries 
it found among those not attending the denominations last

clergy consider the bible the literal word of god while only 
26 percent of the clergy and 26 percent of the laity who were 
conference delegates did so 
response to that question was found to be an indicator of 
responses on 45 other issues surveyed in the 9 millionmember

more conservative than elected delegates said the rev mearle

once diagnosed as heading into a stormy 
collision mainline protestant clergy and lay people now have 
shifted into closer accord they still show some differences but 
in intermingled ways 
both sides have modified their stances sometimes switching 
positions with each other 
there has been movement on both parts says sociologist 
donald a luidens in describing results of an extensive study 
collectively they now have more that knits them together than 
separates them 
some surprising reversals turned up including these 
lay people who used to criticize the clergy as lax on doctrine 
now are the most flexible about it clergy once accused of 
neglecting doctrine to meddle in politics now are the most devoted 
to it 
clergy have become the defenders of doctrine luidens said 
in an interview lay people are more flexible about it they tend 
to see personaal piety and experience as touchstones of faith 
rather than the creeds and traditional standards 
my sense is that the theological speculation of the clergy has 
been bought by the laity 
politically the clergy remain more liberal than the laity the 
study found in regard to a variety of issues while lay people are 
more likely to take more conservative positions 
the study involved completed questionnaires from 1756 lay 
people and 579 clergy in the reformed church in america generally 
considered a middlecourse denomination among mainline protestants 
case studies have indicated it is quite exemplar with the 
same ebb and flow that most of the mainline denominations have 
luidens said my sense is that mainline churches in general 
likely would show the same patterns 
the denomination is americas oldest protestant body with a 
continuous ministry it is rooted in dutch reformed presbyterian 
traditions medium sized with about 340000 members it 
participates in major ecumenical organizations 
luidens who chairs the sociology department at the 
denominations hope college in holland mich and another 
sociologist there roger j nemeth conducted the study 
it was prompted by questions about the relative calm in the 
churches nowadays in contrast to indications found in a study 20 
years ago that clergylaity differences were propelling them toward 
a shattering clash 
in that 1969 study the gathering storm in the churches 
sociologist jeffery haden saw evidence that the clergys liberal 
theology and social activism was dividing them from a socially and 
theologically conservative laity 
but the new study finds that the signs of storm have passed and 
that a form of rapprochement has taken place most lines of 
division no longer were found between clergy and laity but within 
those groups 
moreover luidens said much of the past liberal agenda seems 
to have become the mainstream agenda that is generally accepted 
by clergy and laity 
they both now largely accept womens rights and support the 
poor and minority rights are critical of the arms race and 
sometimes of us foreign policy he said 
we dont have the old divisions on these things between clergy 
and laity rather there are some of both on either side 
however on political issues such as increased social programs 
homosexual rights defense spending the death penalty banning 
abortion and school prayer clergy were found more liberal than 
laity it was more conservative 
at the same time lay people were found more liberal than clergy 
on theological beliefs such the apostles creed the heidelberg 
catechism nicene creed and other historic doctrinal statements on 
these the clergy were more conservative 
nemeth said that in contrast to a singleminded conservativism 
among the laity and a singleminded liberalism among the clergy 
some clergy and laity were liberal on both politics and beliefs 
while some clergy and laity were conservative on both fronts 
a pluralist patchwork of perspectives apparently has 
developed the researchers aid making for more grounds for 
agreement than existed in the 1960s and 1970s 
as a consequence the church is not as factionalized as it 
was and stability is more likely 
while clergy generally remained politically more liberal as 
found by hadden two decades ago the clergy now are more 
conservative theologically than are the laity the report says 
hadden had speculated that as a result of the past conflict one 
side or the other might capture control of the churches or that 
the more radical clergy would leave the church to push their causes 
elsewhere 
luidens and nemeth speculate some of the latter happened but 
their data dont deal with that aspect in any case they found the 
storm had receded the report says 
in effect the current status quo seems possible in part 
because the groups crossrough each other it would appear 
that a pluralist mode of adaptation has taken place which permits 
collective cohesion in the face of divergent and overlapping 
theological and political opinions

filmmakers forever proclaim that theirs is a 
collaborative craft but rarely has there been such a close 
partnership as the one that produced quick change 
the partners bill murray and howard franklin murray starred 
along with geena davis randy quaid and jason robards and 
coproduced with robert greenhut franklin wrote the script 
together they directed 
codirectors of major films are a rare breed unless they are 
brothers such as the zuckers airplane codirectors usually 
end up not talking to each other in the case of murray and 
franklin they were not only talking they sat down for a joint 
interview 
murray is the saturday night live graduate who hit with 
lowbudget comedies meatballs and stripes then moved on to 
the bigger stuff ghostbusters tootsie scrooged 
screenwriter franklin someone to watch over me makes his 
debut as a director with quick change 
franklin was more straight in his responses murray more 
whimsical here are their comments 
q to franklin did murray ever bark at you as a writer 
a does he bark never hes a gentleman and a kind soul i just 
ruined his image i guess 
q to murray does franklin ever bark at you as an actor 
a he doesnt bark but he doesnt always use the newspaper 
hes wellbehaved but he does have fleas he has problems big 
problems but nothing that couldnt be solved in one of the finer 
obedience schools 
no he was lionhearted because he showed up for work expecting 
to work the rest of us showed up expecting to have fun 
q to franklin did bill look over your shoulder when you were 
writing the script 
a no he was 3000 miles away when i was writing a couple of 
times i tried writing when bill was there so i limited my writing 
to the west coast one of the questions people have been asking is 
was there a lot of improvisation on the set in fact there wasnt 
a lot of that went into the script itself bill is naturally 
funny and comes up with funny things because we were dealing with 
the script for so many years he was able to come up with 
contributions 
q to murray you wear three hats actor codirector 
coproducer why 
a i had more jobs because i felt the more i had the better 
chance of achieving one of them i dunno i have no explanation 
im usually not this ambitious i dont know what came over me i 
think its because of all these processed foods ive been eating 
theres a kind of chemical imbalance 
q do you have a desire to maintain more control over your films 
a you dont worry about a project until you see it go wrong 
then you say youd just as soon make your own mistakes everyone 
makes mistakes 
living with other peoples mistakes is harder 
q were you both planning to direct from the beginning 
a franklin neither of us was in as director from the 
beginning we both liked the material we worked on the script and 
eventually we got very proprietary about the script since each of 
us was considering other projects to direct we decided why defer 
our plans why not take this thing we liked a lot and do it 
ourselves it was just an idea whose time had come i guess 
q to murray as coproducer how did you decide on casting 
geena davis and randy quaid 
a well none of my relatives came through they just couldnt 
deliver randy quaid i wanted from the first time i read the book 
by jay cronley i kept after him wheedled him and he basically 
held us up for a lot of money saying its impossible for me to 
do the part due to prior commitments 
we read a few people for the geena davis part and we liked the 
way she looked the best we talked about the script a bit and asked 
her to come back she came back and had the part nailed knew every 
beat exactly how it should go we could not not hire her 
she was a real delight a dream to be around loose smiling 
professional not a whiner looks good always got a smile and her 
mother brought brownies to the set you couldnt ask for more

hmmm say the hollywood executives abcs 
americas funniest home videos is now its happening its a 
nielsen knockout its fresh 
hey kids cries one mogul lets be creative lets get a 
video camera 
ergo we face three more network shows starring video cameras 
next season including abcs going places about tv newcomers 
working on a candid video tv series 
but cbs is getting the jump on everyone friday night it is 
starting wish you were here a summer sitcom that also stars a 
video camera plus some supporting actors 
its main supporting actor is lew schneider he plays donnie 
cogswell a highspirited tom hankslike yuppie who tapes himself 
doing such things as 
buying a home video camera 
quitting his wellpaying wall street stockbrokers job 
learning his apartment got flooded because he left the shower 
on 
losing his yuppie girlfriend janet leah lail who wants to 
break up even though he has told her on bended knee lets be 
roomies until his apartment is fixed 
he also tapes himself fleeing the new york rat race to become an 
amateur videotaper of the world he starts by using the last of his 
money to fly to paris to tape the sights and sounds of that fair 
city 
flying to paris isnt a bad idea 
but it is a bad idea for him to send the tape of all this back 
to his former girlfriend in new york complete with a nonstop 
highspeed babble of narration in which he often says he wishes she 
were with him 
it also is a bad idea that she watches the tape this is not 
just because it has the herkyjerky video verite style popularized 
in the early 1970s by college students who realized they couldnt 
write and went into tv 
it also is because she has stand back now a second yuppie 
boyfriend his name is dave but he really looks like a jeff this 
may be because studies show most male yuppies are named jeff 
when swain no 2 drops by her apartment says hi 
muffinface then notices donny vowing eternal love on the 
videotape he gets cranky even though she says donny is a case of 
past tense 
he reluctantly agrees to watch the tape with her 
thank you mr bunnynose she playfully says 
but when the taped donny again pines for her and says i can 
even hear you calling me your little bunnyface swain no 2 
objects take a shower she says okay he says but wants her to 
join him 
five minutes he says be there dress optional 
this is sophistication for the 90s 
anyhow a lovers tiff erupts when she continues watching the 
tape which shows donny chatting up a beautiful frenchwoman in a 
restaurant that happens after a lovers tiff in which her beau 
angrily stomps out 
things get worse for janet when donny reports a tiny fling with 
this beautiful frenchwoman 
mes etoiles as they say in paris 
is this adieu for donny and janet is he just trying to make her 
jealous through the magic of what he calls his donnycam has he 
realized the world is his oyster and he the great clam 
only those who love homevideo shows or want to see the worlds 
longest 30minute situation comedy will care the writing and 
direction of this epic in vcr are none too ept it resembles the 
work of filmschool graduates 
be that as it may five more video letters from donny will 
arrive after fridays installment next weeks electronic epistle 
is from budapest 
incidentally wish you were here may hold the record for the

true or false 
a interest rates in the united states are painfully high right 
now 
b the federal reserve has just promised to lower them 
if youve been keeping up with the big moneymanagement issues 
of the day chances are you didnt find that quiz very difficult 
if you answered true to both statements you would get plenty of 
agreement from the ranks of the socalled opinion leaders in 
places like the bush administration and congress 
but that view of things isnt exactly unanimous the way some 
financial analysts see it neither statement a nor b is 
absolutely supported by the evidence 
they suggest that if you are planning to make some decision 
about what to do with your savings and investments based on those 
assumptions you could be making a mistake 
the cost of credit and the difficulty of getting a loan at all 
are indisputedly posing big problems for a good many people right 
now interest rates however remain in the same range where they 
have hovered for several years says paul boltz financial 
economist at t rowe price associates in baltimore 
the record shows that interest rates are not unusually high 
for the long business expansion that began in late 1982 boltz 
observed 
by his reckoning the interest rate on oneyear treasury bills 
averaged 820 percent in the first half of 1990 compared with an 
average of 833 percent from 1983 through 1989 
thirtyyear treasury bonds carried interest rates of 855 
percent against a 198389 average of 974 percent fixed mortgages 
stood at 1008 percent vs a 198389 average of 1076 percent 
these comparisons are especially striking boltz adds when you 
consider that consumerprice inflation has lately been running at a 
little more than a 5 percent annual rate up from 36 percent to 
37 percent on average through the 80s 
as for the federal reserve surely there was no mistaking 
chairman alan greenspans statement a week or so ago that the fed 
stood ready to soften its credit policy in order to offset the risk 
of a credit crunch 
indeed greenspan did say that and the fed moved the very next 
day to lower the federal funds rate the interest rate on overnight 
loans between banks on wednesday he reaffirmed that he was seeking 
to prevent a squeeze on the economy 
but that is by no means the same thing as promising to reduce 
as if by pushing a button the interest rates consumers and 
businesses pay 
indeed greenspan has frequently insisted that the fed doesnt 
have the power to dictate on its own whether openmarket interest 
rates will rise or fall analysts like boltz agree with him 
the fed can stimulate the flow of money through the banking 
system tipping the balance of supply and demand for credit in 
favor of lower rates then traders in the bond and shortterm money 
markets have to do the rest 
their judgment can be influenced by a variety of other 
influences including interest rates overseas and potential changes 
in inflation they foresee as a result of the feds policy 
said boltz the last time the federal reserve tried to help 
out the economy with a lower federal funds rate was in december 
1989 and things did not work out well market interest rates 
immediately moved up smartly

just a few years ago some critics were beginning 
to view the elderly as a privileged class with their rising social 
security benefits medicare and lower income taxes 
moreover some had sizable capital gains to rely on a result of 
surges in stock and real estate prices in the previous decade as 
asset owners some benefited from the inflation that hurt younger 
assetpoor generations 
they also had a powerful lobby that sought to protect the 
improved position they occupied in economic society and their 
numbers were growing too some critics even referred to the threat 
of gray power 
times have changed the improved condition of the elderly was a 
long time developing mainly because the elderly had occupied so 
feeble a position in economic society it might take less time to 
undo 
once relatively free of federal income taxes some retirees now 
could become among the biggest percentage taxpayers in american 
society according to a background paper prepared by the national 
center for policy analysis 
the dallasbased center a nonprofit think tank that claims 
neutrality takes issue with a proposal under consideration in 
congress to raise taxes on some social security benefits 
that proposal would lower to 12000 from 25000 the amount of 
income a person could obtain without losing full social security 
benefits for couples the comparable figures would be 18000 and 
32000 
by doing so according to the centers paper congress would 
effectively tax many older folks more than younger ones those in a 
15 percent bracket it says might go to 225 percent those at 28 
percent might leap to 42 
nobody in congress is conceding that point instead of raising 
income taxes they say they are raising the benefits tax 
not so says john goodman center president he declares it is a 
tax on income and he sets out to demonstrate 
the first thing to understand he says is that no tax is 
incurred unless a taxpayers income reaches a certain level when 
that income level is reached 25000 for an individual now 
12000 as proposed two things happen 
1 for every dollar of income beyond that point the affected 
person loses 50 cents of social security benefits 
2 simultaneously that person pays taxes on the income that 
caused them to lose the benefits 
the result is this according to the analysis since 50 cents 
of benefits is taxed for each additional 1 of income when elderly 
taxpayers earn 1 they pay taxes on 150 
that is those affected pay a tax rate 50 percent higher 225 
percent than other people in a 15 percent income tax bracket and 
50 percent higher 42 percent than other taxpayers in a 28 percent 
bracket 
thats the beginning add in items such as the social security 
fica tax a social security earnings penalty and state and local 
taxes some based on the federal rate and the elderly wage earner 
can face an 80 percent tax 
as presented in congress there would not be an income tax 
increase for the elderly only a lowering of the threshhold at 
which earnings would be taxed but says goodman the impact is of 
greater consequence than the intent 
one of the arguments for taxing social security benefits is that 
beneficiaries paid only a small portion of their benefits through 
payroll taxes 
but says goodman if that argument is accepted wouldnt it be 
more reasonable to include a portion of social security benefits in 
with ordinary income and tax the sum at rates of 15 percent to 28 
percent 
he suggests the young pay attention 
income levels today are relatively low enough to exclude many 
retirees from the worst effects of the proposed tax but the 
inevitable rising of income standards in years to come eventually 
would include everyone

vietnamese women once again are 
wearing the ao dai the sensual elegant traditional dress that 
rigid communists suppressed for years in favor of drab shirts and 
black trousers 
students alight from bicyles in pure white ao dais whose fabric 
clings to the body and flows over the legs 
the ao dai which literally means long dress had been worn 
for at least 13 centuries but virtually disappeared after the 
communists won the war in april 1975 and imposed their spartan 
ethos on what had been south vietnam 
it is slit on both sides from the waist down and is worn with 
loose white trousers it usually is made of a blend of silk and 
nylon and costs about 110000 dong 22 which is expensive in a 
country with one of the worlds lowest per capita incomes 
color and fashion began returning in late 1986 when the 
authorities allowed a more open society and adopted westernstyle 
economic reforms 
now the ao dai graces high school students hotel receptionists 
airport staff and workers at the foreign trade bank central post 
office and textile mills in ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
it also is said to be regaining popularity in other areas of 
southern vietnam 
tran phuoc chan owner of the citys largest ao dai factory 
said his workers made only 10 a day in the years immediately after 
the war and had to work second jobs 
his 20 fulltime employees now make 25 garments a day and work 
extra hours to keep up with orders during the christmas season and 
tet the vietnamese new year 
wives of communist party politburo members have begun wearing ao 
dais at receptions said nguyen the thanh editor of the magazine 
ho chi minh womens weekly 
a miss ao dai contest the magazine sponsored in march 1989 was 
the greatest impetus for the revival it was the first beauty 
pageant in the city since 1975 and the most popular event in recent 
years 
the ao dai has immortal beauty no one can kill it ms 
thanh said even without this contest it would have reappeared 
for five nights a gymnasium that seats 6000 was jammed with 
people cheering their favorites among the 165 contestants she 
said do thi kieu khanh a 20yearold hairdresser won in a bright 
yellow ao dai embroidered with roses 
despite the more liberal atmosphere the mayor and local 
communist party chief refused to attend the contest and older 
officials found the swimsuit competition offensive ms thanh said 
some derided the ao dai as symbolizing luxury and laziness she 
said and the party has rejected the magazines application for a 
another miss ao dai contest this year 
the ao dais return to the classroom has been received 
enthusiastically but some parents complain of the cost and 
students say it is difficult to ride a bicyle while wearing the 
dress said ho thieu thung of the education department 
he said the department made it the required uniform in 10 senior 
high schools this year in response to student requests and for all 
senior highs next year 
when the girls started wearing the ao dai the male students 
suddenly became very polite with them and boys took over such 
messy classroom chores as cleaning the blackboards thung said 
chan the ao dai maker said white fabric embroidered with birds 
and flowers is the most popular 
some ao dais are sequined other variations recently seen in the 
city include leopardskin patterns and bareshoulder styles 
a history published by womens weekly said the ao dais origins 
were uncertain but that temple carvings showed wealthy women of the 
7th century wearing them 
women in the cold north wore several ao dais at a time and the 
wives of 19th century kings wore as many as 18 at once the history 
said 
in the 1930s city people followed european style with a tighter 
fit and higher slits they experimented with several styles but 
the traditional one prevailed

subhi abu dahi 
proudly displays his trophies the scars of four gunshot wounds 
from encounters with israeli soldiers in nearly 32 months of the 
palestinian uprising 
a 7yearold sister lulu sits in a wheelchair eyes dull and 
head tilted against a brace she has been paralyzed unable to 
speak since a soldier fired a rubbercoated steel ball that struck 
her in the head 18 months ago 
their father and an older brother were killed by israeli forces 
over the years and a 14yearold brother was shot in both legs 
subhi is tall and muscular with big broad hands and looks like 
a high school basketball player but life has left him little time 
for sports 
in the dusty garbagestrewn streets of shabura young men his 
age are more likely to throw stones at israeli soldiers than shoot 
balls through hoops the soldiers often respond with bullets and 
subhi has his scars to show 
the toll on his family has been dreadful even by the standards 
of shabura where nearly every home has a tale of suffering from a 
generation of israeli occupation 
about 25000 palestinian refugees are crowded into the camps 
small concreteblock houses residents say 37 people in shabura 
have died in clashes with the israeli army since the uprising began 
in december 1987 
shabura is part of the town of rafah on the egyptian border 
palestinian flags outlawed by israel fly throughout the camp and 
slogans written on walls declare hatred and anger for the israeli 
presence in the gaza strip and west bank which israel captured 
from egypt and jordan in 1967 
stopping the intefadeh is like killing the palestinian 
people reads one slogan using the arabic word for the uprising 
an extended abu dahi family of 29 people lives in eight small 
rooms under a corrugated tin roof similar spreadout shacks are 
close by separated by sandy paths used for dumping garbage and 
dishwater 
cousins and brothers in the abu dahi household told the familys 
story in the heat of a july afternoon they cursed the soldiers 
accusing them of firing needlessly and said the family would 
continue fighting israeli occupation 
if things dont change the uprising will go on with rocks 
firebombs and killing collaborators subhi said perhaps there 
will be weapons some people have guns we have seen collaborators 
killed with shots 
his mother kamilya said of the israelis when they leave 
the uprising will end if they stay forever we fight forever 
kamilya is 40 and has borne nine children she said her first 
husband subhis father was killed as a guerrilla leader in 1970 
her oldest son osama was shot to death when he attacked an 
israeli border guard with a knife in october 1988 
the paralyzed child lulu is from her second marriage in 
moslem fashion kamilya married the brother of her slain husband 
lulu was shot when she ran outside during a riot in february 
last year kamilya said 
at the time the army said lulu was wounded in a stonethrowing 
riot military officials have accused palestinians of putting 
youngsters in the front of protests because wounded children are 
bad publicity for israel 
kamilya said lulu saw a boy she knew being arrested she 
grabbed at him trying to tug him away from the soldiers one 
soldier opened fire 
she looked at the girls frail twisted body and said we 
sacrificed too much 
her glance moved to subhi the oldest surviving son scarred by 
bullets on the face one arm and both ankles 
people here call him the suspended shaheed she said 
shaheed arabic for martyr describes the palestinian dead of the 
uprising 
thats why i am afraid she said thats why he got 
married so young now he has to support his family he shouldnt do 
anything illegal 
subhis wife hanan also 19 blushed when subhi was asked if he 
was ready to give up revolution for a job and children 
i am studying the situation he said i will manage to 
combine work everything 
three days earlier subhi was freed after 180 days in gaza 
central prison his third jailing of the uprising he was convicted 
of offering services to an illegal organization the mainstream 
fatah guerrilla faction led by plo chairman yasser arafat 
according to subhi the services were distributing leaflets 
writing graffiti carrying money 
he has worked as a welder and house painter but said it would 
be difficult to find jobs in the economic shambles of gaza he is 
not allowed to work in israel because of his jail record 
two men who have jobs in israel support the abu dahi clan one 
is a construction worker the other a pizza cook the family also 
gets united nations food aid and subhi said a plo stipend for 
the members killed or wounded in the uprising 
subhis grandfather ahmed complained that like many 
palestinians his family had become used to living on handouts 
since fleeing their village of qubeiba near ramle when israel was 
founded 42 years ago 
in qubeiba there were rich and poor he said now we are 
all beggars 
ahmed 65 wears the white knit cap of a religious moslem and is 
known as sheik ahmed for his role as a mosque prayer leader 
he said the family fled qubeiba on may 23 1948 then joined 
thousands of other palestinians in moving from place to place for 
months to escape the israeli army they reached the gaza strip in 
early 1949 
why did the family leave qubeiba 
there were clashes all around and we were afraid after deir 
yassin he said referring to a palestinian village where jewish 
irregulars massacred more than 200 men women and children in april 
1948 
israeli historian benny morris wrote that israeli soldiers 
captured qubeiba and drove out the remaining inhabitants on may 27 
1948 four days after the abu dahis fled the army demolished most 
of the houses and jewish immigrants took over what remained 
i think my house was destroyed said ahmed abu dahi 
from a cupboard a grandson pulled a deed issued to ahmeds 
father in 1930 when britain ruled palestine it described the 
house as made of stone built in 1910 and having a common wall with 
another familys home 
they live next to us here too ahmed said

in the late 1960s the cowsills were the 
quintessential american family a sweet pop rock group of five 
siblings and their miniskirted mother who later became the model 
for tvs the partridge family 
by 1971 they had virtually vanished the victim of a fickle 
public and poor management their 30 million fortune disappeared 
in bad investments the breakup was so acrimonious many members of 
the family did not speak until their mothers funeral in 1985 
it wasnt just the end of a business it was the end of a 
family said group leader bob cowsill 40 
several of the cowsills spent the last two decades battling 
drugs alcohol and severe depression the family declared 
bankruptcy in 1977 
now theyre planning a comeback both as a group and as a 
family they reunited for the first time in 20 years in boston in 
early july in a concert dedicated to their mother in attendance 
at a packed club for the concert were singer paula abdul and two of 
the beach boys 
at their concert the cowsills sang the old hits as well as new 
material in a surprisingly smooth polished set reminiscent of 
such groups as fleetwood mac they have a new manager and are 
shopping a tape of new music at different record labels 
the cowsills had three no 1 hits including hair the 
rain the park and other things and indian lake and two 
other top 10 singles from a total of eight albums they starred in 
their own nbctv special headlined in las vegas did milk 
commercials and were plastered on the covers of teen magazines 
we were the first family of rock n roll said susan 
cowsill 30 who joined the group when she was 7 later sang backup 
for other artists and now collaborates with former bangles member 
vicki peterson 
but the cowsill brothers who wanted to do serious music in the 
tradition of the beatles bob dylan and the rolling stones 
resented the bubblegum image foisted on them by record companies 
wed worked hard to be a real creative band and instead they 
had us tap dancing on the ed sullivan show said barry cowsill 
36 who now lives in carmel calif we didnt want to be these 
cute guys on posters for lonely girls in the midwest 
several of the cowsills considered changing their names in an 
effort to be accepted as serious musicians all have held a 
succession of day jobs in recent years and performed solo in small 
clubs 
the band consisted of bill now 41 bob 40 paul 38 barry 
36 john 32 little sister susan and their mother barbara bobs 
twin brother richard was excluded from the band by their father 
bill was later kicked out of the band after a fight with his father 
the wholesomelooking family from newport ri who shot to the 
top between 1967 and 1970 fell as fast as they had risen 
as their fame evaporated so did the facade of the happy family 
years under the iron rule of their father and manager bud 
cowsill took a toll 
my dad was a seventh grade dropout who joined the navy and he 
ran his family like the military too said bob cowsill we had 
spent our whole lives together 24 hours a day when it came apart 
it was kind of an explosion 
at the time of their mothers death from emphysema she was 
working the night shift in a rhode island nursing home estranged 
from several of her children 
she just wanted to be our mom she never really wanted to be 
up on stage said barry cowsill her knees were rattling 
together up there 
bud cowsill whom his children say has mellowed now lives 
alone in rosarita beach in mexico 
the cowsill kids were recruited for the partridge family tv 
show in 1970 but refused to sign on when producers rejected their 
mother in favor of actress shirley jones 
the cowsills got their start very early in newport bill and bob 
taught themselves how to play guitar and barry and john later 
joined in by 1965 they had a regular gig at a local club and were 
spotted by a producer for nbctvs today show who booked them 
the today show led to a record deal and bud cowsill decided 
to add barbara and susan cowsill to the band 
whatever dad said went said bob cowsill who has performed 
solo for the past decade in small southern california clubs he 
wasnt the kind of guy you argued with 
that rule extended to the arbitrary exclusion of bobs twin 
brother from the band 
it was hard man said richard cowsill who showed up 
backstage at the boston concert people would say oh are you a 
cowsill and i had to say yes but it was hard to explain why i 
wasnt in the band dad had his own reasons i guess 
bill and richard are both recovering alcoholics and several 
others have had serious problems with drugs many of the brothers 
saw each other no more than a few times in the past 20 years and 
rejected offers to go on oldies tours 
but after deejay barry scott who hosts a lost 45s program 
on wzlxfm in boston taped an interview with bob last year the 
group decided to get back together 
the cowsills hope to find a record company that will allow them 
to do the kind of music they envisioned in the early days in 
newport only four cowsills performed in boston but the plan is to 
add the other three including richard once they get more bookings 
we all love each other very much said barry cowsill it 
was just like the molecules got too close i think if people just 
put away their prejudices we can really come back again

blue jeans for decades the uniform of rebels and 
conformists alike are fading from the fashion forefront as aging 
baby boomers opt for new and more flattering looks 
to put it bluntly as their pocketbooks have gotten thicker 
so have their waists said alan millstein publisher of the new 
yorkbased newsletter fashion network report 
jeans dont fit the lives of the thirtysomething generation 
which is starting to confront the flab of middle age and facing the 
fact that gravity is the reality millstein says 
the biggest fans of jeans traditionally tightfitting 
youthoriented fare are those between the ages of 14 and 24 a 
segment of the population that has been shrinking for the past 
decade said dan chew marketing manager for levi strauss amp co 
headquartered in san francisco 
jeanswear communications a new yorkbased fashion industry 
group said in a study released in june that total domestic jeans 
sales dropped from a 1981 peak of 502 million pairs to 387 million 
pairs in 1989 
deborah bronston an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc estimates the number of jeans sold declined by 6 percent 
during the first three months of this year alone 
the decline of jeans has forced manufacturers to scramble for 
ways to protect their domain often with other products ranging 
from childrens sweat gear to sexy lingerie they have met with 
varying degrees of success some have been wounded because they 
responded to changing tastes too late 
vf corp a wyomissing pa jeans maker that markets lee and 
wrangler brands and holds about 25 percent of the us market 
recently announced it would close four jeans factories by september 
the costs of that cutback will be reflected in the companys 
secondquarter financial report and probably result in a 50 percent 
earnings decline from a year earlier vf chairman lawrence r pugh 
said he blamed a continuing shortfall in jeans orders resulting 
from weak consumer demand 
levi strauss on the other hand is riding high the company has 
dramatically improved sales and profitability since it became a 
private company five years ago in a debtfinanced takeover the 
improvement has come from much more than just sales of the 501 its 
classic 5pocketed blue jeans 
levis created dockers a cotton twill pant for maturing 
baby boom men as one of retailings brightest success stories 
sales of dockers went from 35 million in 1986 to a projected 500 
millionplus this year the product line has been expanded to 
include mens shirts and sweats as well as active wear for women 
and children 
dockers have helped offset the basic softness in mens 
jeans chew said 
for vf however diversification has been far rockier the 
company purchased a north carolina maker of mens cotton twill 
pants in 1984 but closed the unit two years later to focus on its 
acquisition of blue bell holding co parent of wrangler jeans 
jantzen swimwear and jansport sports clothes 
the move shoved vf ahead of levi as the nations biggest jeans 
maker when jeans are booming every age group is wearing them 
said vfs chief financial officer jerry johnson but these days 
he said theres a lack of fashionability attached to the 
product 
this year vf has introduced a line of tshirts and sweats under 
the lee label in an effort to exploit its best brand name so far 
sales are going very well and the sweat shirts have sold out 
johnson said 
still the company hopes to reduce dependence on jeans partly 
by strengthening its intimate apparel offerings vf which sells 
vanity fair and lollipop brands purchased the lingerie concern 
vassarette for 12 million earlier this year 
johnson said vf foresees growth of 10 percent annually in 
intimate apparel and is seeking to acquire additional brands or 
trademarks in that area 
analyst bronston predicted intimate apparel will account for 15 
percent of vfs estimated 1991 sales of 273 billion up from the 
current 13 percent while jeans will bring in 53 percent of annual 
revenue down from the current 55 percent 
many experts said jeans makers are hoping to strengthen their 
dungaree business by exporting while interest may be waning in the 
united states jeans still retain considerable allure in the soviet 
union parts of europe and the far east 
levis chew said international sales accounted for roughly a 
third of the companys 36 billion in revenue last year up from 
about 20 percent from five years ago 
but levis strategists also say the us market cant be 
ignored the average american teenager still buys four to six 
pairs of jeans a year so levis is spending heavily on a fresh 
advertising campaign directed by and featuring spike lee acclaimed 
director of do the right thing 
designer jeans from calvin klein gloria vanderbilt and others 
are partly responsible for expanding the acceptance of blue jeans 
as appropriate dress for many occasions but even at their peak in 
1984 designer products accounted for less than 4 percent of the 
total blue jean market chew said 
nonetheless some designer labels have managed to adapt to a 
changing marketplace guess inc for example which sells a basic 
56 3zip jean one zipper on the fly one on each ankle because 
the pants are so tight continues to drum up interest in its 
broader array of clothes 
expensive skintight jeans were the cornerstone product when 
guess was founded in 1981 but the company now sells everything 
from miniskirts and suede cowboy shoes to fragrances and eyewear in 
an effort to capture the customer who has needs other than 
denim said spokeswoman leah levy 
the company is pushing its new georges marciano line of career 
clothes for women which appear in standalone boutiques in major 
department stores 
still guess derives about 80 percent of its estimated 400 
million in annual sales from the denim collection rather than 
allow its fortunes to rest on a single jean design guess 
continues to push ahead 
this fall the silhouette of guess jeans change dramatically 
from excruciatingly tight to very baggy antifit pants levy 
said part of the reasoning behind the shift is that todays jeans 
dont have to fit

congressional negotiators must resolve a host 
of disputes over how far government and industry should go to clean 
the air from placing emission restrictions on small factories to 
helping workers laid off because of tougher pollution controls 
the sheer size of the 148member housesenate conference 
committee more than a quarter of the congress points to the high 
stakes in the political battle the legislation is expected to cost 
more than 21 billion a year in new pollution controls 
there will be clean air legislation this year i dont think 
anyone disputes that asserts sen max baucus dmont chairman 
of the conference 
baucus said in an interview that he considers separate clean air 
bills passed by the house and senate by and large very similar 
with identical goals of significantly cutting urban smog reducing 
acid rain and curtailing the industrial release of toxic chemicals 
by the end of the decade 
but there remains much dispute over details of the two bills 
while environmentalists express concern the clean air package 
may be weakened industry lobbyists argue the next few months of 
congressional negotiations could determine if some factories will 
be forced to close because of the high costs of compliance 
industry is looking to allies on the house negotiating team led 
by rep john dingell dmich to soften the legislation dingell 
has protected automakers from tough pollution controls for years 
the house named 139 members to the conference ranging from 
henry waxman dcalif a longtime champion of tougher pollution 
controls to william dannemeyer rcalif the only congressman to 
vote against the clean air bill in the energy and commerce 
committee 
the senate negotiators on the other hand number only nine 
four of them senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
baucus sen john chafee rri and sen david durenberger 
rminn led the senate battle for clean air legislation seven of 
the nine are members of the senate environment committee and they 
are expected to balk at any proposals that would significantly 
weaken the legislation 
the separate bills that breezed through both the house and 
senate last spring would impose stiff new requirements on industry 
to control toxic chemicals on factories to reduce smogcausing 
pollution and on electric power plants to curb sulfur dioxide 
which causes acid rain they also would direct automakers to build 
cleaner cars and oil companies to provide cleaner fuels to reduce 
urban smog 
but the house and senate versions often differ on how far 
companies should go to control toxic releases what polluters 
should be covered or in some cases what measures should be taken 
to comply 
the final negotiations on these details will determine whether 
you have a good clean air bill or a bill thats not very good at 
all said richard ayres chairman of the national clean air 
coalition an environmental umbrella group 
industry meanwhile makes no secret that it will push the 
congressional negotiators to scuttle some of the strongest 
requirements in either bill 
we know the goals of the two bills are about the same were 
trying to make it the most affordable to the american business 
community and to the consumer said william fay executive 
director of the clean air working group the industrys lobbying 
coalition 
fay calls the governments estimated 215 billion price tag for 
the clean air bill unrealistic and maintains the cost will be much 
higher if some of the provisions found in either the senate or 
house bills survive 
according to lawmakers congressional aides and lobbyists here 
are a number of the most contentious issues that will have to be 
resolved by the house and senate negotiators 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
both the house and senate bills would require tougher tailpipe 
emission controls but the senate bill would trigger a second round 
of even tighter requirements automatically if air quality did not 
meet federal health standards in a dozen pollutionplagued cities 
by the end of the decade 
the automakers argue they cannot meet the second phase of 
controls with current technology and hope the house version will 
prevail they have a strong ally in dingell 
at the same time however the automakers plan to fight another 
house provision not in the senate bill that would require them 
to build and market at least some alternative fuel cars 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the house bill calls for a threeyear 250 million program to 
help workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution 
controls the senate bill would provide no assistance 
while senate leaders have expressed support for the house 
measure the white house has threatened to veto legislation 
containing assistance for workers saying it would be difficult to 
control the cost while it is doubtful to many in congress that 
bush would sacrifice clean air legislation because of the labor 
assistance the administration is expected to argue vigorously 
against the provision

keeping us securities markets competitive in 
a world of globalized 24hour trading cannot be left entirely to 
the private sector according to a congressional report 
the office of technology assessment said in a report to be 
issued today that congress may have to urge regulators to prod 
market officials into taking a longterm view of market development 
it is by no means certain that us markets will remain in the 
forefront of the movement toward roundtheclock global securities 
trading the ota said 
last month several securities exchanges in new york and chicago 
announced plans to phase in overnight trading over the next several 
years in an attempt to regain some of the business lost to foreign 
competitors during those hours 
but the ota an arm of congress that analyzes science and 
technology says the change may be too slow in coming 
in addition to existing competition from exchanges in london and 
tokyo the report said swiss german and french exchanges are 
making vigorous efforts to increase their volume automate their 
activities and modernize their regulatory regimes by 1992 when 
common market trade barriers are eliminated 
while us futures exchanges and our overthecounter market 
are acting aggresively to put worldwide electronic networks in 
place the us stock exchanges have been slower to act read the 
106page report trading around the clock global securities 
markets and information technology 
officials at the new york stock exchange and the american stock 
exchange said they hadnt seen the report and thus could not 
comment 
the report said congress needs to address how to combine 
international cooperative efforts to achieve regulatory harmony 
while keeping the united states competitive 
us stock exchanges are so far slow to show any interest in 
adopting automated trading systems that bypass or compete with 
traditional dealer intermediaries or that operate around the 
clock the report concluded 
vary t coates project director of the study said the report 
stated that as international securities trading increases congress 
should look at both whether american markets are competitive 
globally and what are the addititional risks to american investors 
and on the first point about being competitive although we 
say that our markets are the fairest and most liquid and most 
efficient in the world probably they are not very well positioned 
yet for international trading ms coates said 
theyve been slow to move in that direction at least the 
exchanges are 
while the new york stock exchange announced plans last month to 
begin limited afterhours trading next year ms coates said the 
study found 24hour trading wont be ready for 10 years and we 
think globalization is going to move a lot faster than that 
the ota acknowledged the report was the first and least 
controversial section of a twopart report on technology in the 
securities markets 
the second part is expected to be released in the fall when 
congress is expected to conduct hearings on the matter 
in january a draft version was sent back to the drawing board 
after some sharp criticism by a blueribbon advisory panel 
the earlier study described the specialist trading system at the 
new york and american stock exchanges as faltering and possibly 
irredeemably obsolete 
under the specialist system of trading stock can only be traded 
through certain designated exchange members that are charged with 
maintaining an orderly market in that security even if it means 
buying or selling the stock because no other takers can be found

as judges and lawyers in the national battle 
over asbestos liability slug out how to resolve snowballing 
litigation victims and their families keep waiting for their few 
thousand dollars in compensation 
weve all been depending and hoping for this money to be 
coming said shirley johnson of portland ore 
mrs johnson and her brother and sister are expecting checks for 
8333 each from the financially ailing manville trust the first 
installment of compensation for their fathers 1986 lung cancer 
death 
but a federal judge in brooklyn on monday formally halted 
payments pending a restructuring of the trust which was created as 
part of manville corps 1988 bankruptcy reorganization but has run 
out of money to pay new claims 
the move at least temporarily delays payments to potentially 
hundreds of people who have settled their cases and are awaiting 
payments 
in addition another federal judge on monday ordered more than 
100000 lawsuits involving asbestos nationwide lumped into a class 
action to ease a backlog of cases and speed payments to victims 
some victims and their families already have been waiting for up 
to a decade for compensation the manville trust which has 130000 
claims pending announced recently that some new claims would not 
be paid until the year 2025 or later average payments to date have 
been about 43000 much higher than the 25000 expected initially 
attorneys for plaintiffs and asbestos manufacturers agree that 
steps are needed to get people money and reduce litigation costs 
but they doubt the initial plan presented by thomas d lambros 
chief judge of us district court in cleveland to create a class 
action can survive 
i think a lot of the individual needs the individual 
strengths the inidividual weaknesses are lost in the mixture 
said richard glasser a norfolk va attorney representing 1100 
shipyard workers 
to create a class the judge must show that all defendants lack 
the money to pay claims which attorneys said will be difficult to 
prove in addition the federal antiinjunction act prevents a 
federal court from interfering with a state court about half of 
the asbestos docket is in state courts 
the legal barriers presently are insuperable said andrew 
berry a newark nj lawyer representing several asbestos 
defendants 
at issue is a flaky white mineral used widely and without 
safeguards in shipbuilding construction and other industries from 
the turn of the century asbestos since then has been determined to 
cause lung cancer and other oftenfatal diseases 
product liability lawsuits have driven manville and several 
other asbestos manufacturers into bankruptcy court protection now 
more than 100000 lawsuits are on file in every federal court and 
some 500 state courts and the tide of filings shows no signs of 
abating 
judges would like to simplify the method by which attorneys 
investigate individual claims reduce delays by defendant companies 
that claim they cant afford to pay asbestos settlements and limit 
money being spent on litigation rather than compensation 
the amount of money being expended on defense costs is 
enormous and the amount of money thats going to plaintiffs lawyers 
by way of contingency fees also is enormous said lawrence 
fitzpatrick president of the center for claims resolution a 
princeton nj consortium of 20 asbestos defendants that has 
resolved 36000 claims in 18 months 
a class action most likely would force both sides to sit down 
and reach a settlement for all victims creating a single pool from 
which to divvy up claims 
that would require defendant companies to quit stalling 
settlements and avoid payments as some lawyers charge they have 
done in turn plaintiffs lawyers could reap a smaller percentage 
of individual settlements and quit filing claims for people not 
injured by asbestos 
but the asbestos litigation may defy a class action because of 
its complex nature 
other large product liability settlements such as those for the 
vietnamera chemical agent orange and ah robins cos faulty 
dalkon shield birthcontrol device involved just one product with 
a limited time exposure and consistent injuries 
but about 40 separate companies made asbestos using it in 
differing amounts in widely divergent products about a dozen 
diseases stem from exposure with effects ranging from negligible 
to death and symptoms have not even begun to show up for many who 
were exposed also asbestos was used in countless projects in 
varying industries across the country for decades 
the issues the exposure the disease mixes are so different 
in every part of the country that i think it defies a nationwide 
resolution by class said richard scruggs a pascagoula miss 
lawyer representing 4000 former mississippi shipyard workers 
but lawyers said dividing the case into subclasses organized by 
region or applying a standard for conducting legal investigations 
in each case might work in a class action judge lambros order 
left open such steps

attorneys representing more than 1100 asbestos 
victims from virginia have asked a federal appeals court to 
overturn a temporary halt in payments from the manville trust 
the move tuesday came a day after us district judge jack b 
weinstein formally stopped disbursements until a plan is drawn up 
to overhaul the financially ailing trust which was created to 
compensate thousands of victims of asbestosrelated disease 
but lawyers for former shipyard workers in virginia said they 
have settled claims for more than 60 million and dont want the 
money held up by weinsteins order 
the individual settlements range from 12000 to 200000 and 
primarily involve workers from the newport news va and norfolk 
va shipyards exposed to asbestos from the 1940s through the 
1970s the settlements were reached with the trust in federal court 
in the eastern district of virginia 
the judgments are going to people who have lost a loved one 
due to asbestos those who are literally dying as we speak and 
those who are suffering with various stages of disability said 
richard glasser a norfolk attorney representing the workers 
they are entitled to their funds he said our court has 
overseen the process we do not feel another court in another 
jurisdiction should be authorized to upset the work that has been 
done 
weinstein announced the order last week and formally signed it 
on monday to preserve the trusts assets as a reorganization 
proposal is prepared the stay is due to expire aug 6 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals scheduled a hearing on the 
matter but not until the week of aug 13 however glasser said he 
believed the appeals court may expect weinstein to extend the 
payments halt 
the payment stoppage placed in limbo potentially hundreds of 
claims that already have been settled but not actually paid 
manville recently reported it had settled 1128 million in claims 
but has only 932 million to pay out 
the appeals court motion also challenges weinsteins authority 
to order a reorganization of the trust saying that even if the 
trust does ultimately run short of current funds that is a 
consequence of the design of the plan 
under weinsteins order the trust still can pay victims who 
show they would not survive more than six months without treatment 
and relatives who can demonstrate hardship 
the trust created as part of manville corps 1988 bankruptcy 
reorganization is out of money to pay new claims the trust based 
in washington has 130000 claims outstanding but does not expect a 
new infusion of cash until late 1991 
weinstein is involved in the matter because he is supervising 
571 asbestos cases involving workers from the old brooklyn navy 
yard

congress and president bush appear headed 
toward a veto showdown over rapidly rising textile imports that 
displace hundreds of thousands of us jobs but some say also 
hold clothing prices down 
reopening a sixyear battle that congress lost twice to 
thenpresident reagan the senate voted 6832 tuesday to limit 
increases in textile clothing and footwear imports to 1 percent a 
year that vote would be more than enough to override a 
presidential veto 
supporters said the bill is needed to halt the past decades 
loss of about 400000 american jobs and the closing of more than 
1500 us plants in the three industries 
since 1980 the import share of the us textile and clothing 
market has climbed from 28 percent to 60 percent imported shoes 
now account for four of every five pairs sold here up from their 
onehalf share of that market five years ago last year alone 
clothing imports climbed by 12 percent 
extrapolate that through the 1990s and by the year 2000 
rather than the loss of 60 percent we will have the loss of 92 
percent and the textile industry will be gone said sen ernest 
hollings dsc the bills chief sponsor 
opponents contended the bill would raise the price of shoes and 
clothing to us consumers by 25 billion to 27 billion a year 
you do not notice it much said sen bob packwood rore 
just 50 cents a shirt here a dollar two dollars a pair of 
shoes there but add that up by 250 million consumers in this 
country that is a lot of money 
sen strom thurmond rsc made an unsuccessful appeal to bush 
on tuesday to disavow the administrations promise to veto the bill 
i cant do that bush replied i cant say that i think 
the answer to the problem of textiles is further protection 
administration officials have vehemently opposed the bill 
saying it would derail their efforts under the uruguay round of 
talks on the 100nation general agreement of tariffs and trade to 
reduce foreign barriers to us exports of farm products computers 
and services such as banking 
critics however said they fear the talks will produce only a 
further erosion of the us textile industry under the guise of 
free trade 
i think of will rogers every time i think about gatt said 
sen jesse helms rnc will rogers said and of course that 
was before vietnam that the united states has never lost a war or 
won a negotiation and that just about sizes it up 
a sustained presidential veto on the bill could pose significant 
political damage to helms who faces a tough reelection battle 
this november in north carolina the nations largest 
textileproducing state reagans veto of a similar bill in 1985 
was widely credited with helping democrat terry sanford unseat 
thenrepublican sen james broyhill of north carolina in 1986 
this years bill virtually identical to ones reagan vetoed in 
1985 and again in 1988 still faces a rough road in the house 
although similar legislation there enjoys the sponsorship of 243 
of the houses 433 members it is opposed by rep sam gibbons 
rfla chairman of the ways and means committees trade 
subcommittee 
supporters of the bill said they doubt it will reemerge until 
after congress returns from its august recess when the plan is to 
bring the senate bill directly to the house floor and bypass 
gibbons subcommittee 
in 1988 house supporters fell 11 votes short of overriding 
reagans veto the senate that year passed by the bill by only a 
5936 margin well short of the twothirds needed for an override 
this year bill supporters picked up backing from several farm 
state lawmakers by including a provision to raise quotas beyond the 
1 percent growth restrictions on foreign textile and apparel 
producers who increase their imports of us farm products

field publications the educational 
publishing company that puts out the weekly reader and the funk amp 
wagnalls encyclopedia may be changing hands 
bruce seide president of field publications said tuesday that 
the companys parent field corp of chicago is searching for 
buyers for the middletownbased firm 
the firm employs 300 people at its middletown headquarters 60 
at its funk amp wagnalls affiliate in ramsey nj and another 600 
at its distribution center in columbus ohio 
seide said field corp has retained the investment banking firm 
morgan stanley amp co to negotiate with potential buyers 
there are any number of publishing and direct marketing 
organizations who are looking for the possible opportunity for 
growth or synergy with their own companies he said we will 
evaluate all of them initially and should have the group narrowed 
down in a few weeks 
the privately held company publishes and sells a variety of 
publications to schools students and individuals its principal 
products are book clubs for children and adults and the weekly 
reader a 61yearold classroom newspaper read by more than 10

the sale of the company would be its fourth 
founded in ohio in 1902 it was known as american education 
publications in 1949 when it was bought by wesleyan university for 
82 million 
wesleyan brought the companys editorial offices to middletown 
in 1952 and sold the company to xerox in 1965 reportedly for 
between 54 million and 56 million 
xerox seeking cash to expand its office systems and financial 
research units sold its educational publishing unit to field corp 
in august 1985 
in 1988 field corp expanded into the encyclopedia market by 
purchasing new jerseybased funk amp wagnalls inc which sells 
reference books through supermarkets 
seide said field publications revenues were about 300 million 
in 1989 and were expected to be about the same in 1990 
field corp founded in 1984 by marshall field v also owns 
seattlebased muzak and manistique papers a newsprint manufacturer 
based in manistique mich 
the field family sold its interest in the chicagobased marshall

the united states is keeping the pressure on 
the european economic community to negotiate an end to export 
subsidies but agriculture department officials say money may 
become a problem 
one of the favored weapons in the us trade arsenal is the 
5yearold export enhancement program or eep which provides 
bonuses or subsidies to make us commodities cheaper for 
selected foreign buyers 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said tuesday the us 
subsidy program is modest compared with the 10 billion annually 
spent by the 12nation european trade bloc on farm export subsidies 
further he said the house appropriations committee recently 
cut the subsidies under eep to 500 million from the 900 million 
the administration had requested for the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 
yeutter said export subsidies are probably the most important 
part of the ongoing trade negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt 
the 97member gatt is scheduled to conclude the current uruguay 
round of talks by the end of this year 
despite a possible cutback in eep funding yeutter said he is 
optimistic the trade talks will conclude favorably many in europe 
are beginning to view export subsidies as to large a financial 
burden he said 
if we can have a successful negotiation on export subsidies a 
lot of countries around the world will benefit including the 
united states yeutter said in a telephone news conference with 
farm broadcasters 
undersecretary richard t crowder who directly oversees 
international and commodity programs in the agriculture department 
said eep programs are in place for all the major targeted 
customers and markets of american farmers 
crowder said the subsidy programs serve a dual purpose for 
achieving and maintaining a market share for us agricultural 
exports and for the trade policy effect that it will have on the 
europeans particularly as we enter the critical phase of the 
trade talks 
so we are prepared to use eep as aggressively as possible to 
ensure our competitiveness in the world market against those 10 
billion of export subsidies he said 
yeutter asked if european community policies had changed as a 
result of trading pressure over the years said there has been 
very little so far 
they have been bringing their domestic price support levels 
down in a modest way over the last two or three years but not 
enough to have very much effect on production thus far he said 
weve been pointing out to them they need to bring those 
stratospheric supports down much closer to world market prices 
the high supports stimulate production and the surpluses are 
dumped on the world market through european community export 
subsidies yeutter added 
the agriculture secretary was asked if the united states had 
backed off at last weeks economic summit in houston from an 
earlier position calling for the elimination of export subsidies 
now the questioner said it appears the united states would settle 
for a reduction 
we have by no means altered the us position yeutter 
replied we did not have to change it one iota in houston 
the key language used in the houston agreement was worked out a 
year or so ago and remained unchanged he said it calls for a 
substantial progressive reduction in subsidies 
we believe that calls for ultimate elimination yeutter 
said the european community knows thats our interpretation 
but how long that might require is another matter he said the 
united states has proposed a fiveyear phaseout of export 
subsidies but the european community objects vigorously to 
that timetable yeutter said

a suggestion by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter that the 1990 farm bill be delayed until negotiators finish 
working on overall federal budget cuts is being met with harsh 
criticism in congress 
the administration is hiding behind the budget and trying to 
kill the farm bill sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
senate agriculture department said tuesday 
since the budget summit may take months to complete the 
administrations proposal sets the stage for a oneyear farm bill 
extension so that american farm policy would be written in 
geneva at international trade talks he said 
leahy said the administration was conspicuously absent from 
the negotiations in congress that led to the draft of the farm bill 
set to go to the senate floor this week 
now that every member of the agriculture committee has voted 
on the farm bill the administration still wants to duck and delay 
action for the indefinite future said leahy 
yeutter said he was not trying to delay the farm bill to enhance 
the us negotiating position at the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade talks in geneva 
thats nonsense he said whether we have a one threeor 
fiveyear farm bill is fundamentally irrelevant to the gatt 
process 
yeutter said his suggestion was based strictly on budget 
considerations 
we have no idea what we will be able to spend over the next 
five years he told reporters tuesday its totally up in the 
air because we still do not have a budget agreement with congress 
yeutter said delaying the farm bill would be the most 
propitious way to handle the matter 
otherwise congress might have to write two farm bills he said 
indicating that the eventual agreement reached on the overall 
federal budget might require changes in farm programs not 
anticipated in the pending legislation 
he said he has not asked any members of congress directly to 
delay farm bill action however 
senate leaders have said they would like to begin floor debate 
on the bill this week probably thursday in the house the rules 
committee meets that day to determine the procedures that will be 
used during house debate which could begin next week 
meanwhile budget negotiators who have been working since 
midmay have indicated little significant progress toward reaching 
an agreement some have suggested that congress will have to return 
after the november election to get a budget passed

international business machines corp is 
considering selling its lowtechnology businesses which include 
former mainstays like electric typewriters and keyboards according 
to a report published today 
the businesses could fetch around 3 billion through a proposed 
leveraged buyout the wall street journal said quoting 
unidentified wall street and industry executives 
ibm already has been negotiating with a potential buyer and a 
deal could be worked out by the end of the month the newspaper 
said 
in a statement issued today from its armonk ny headquarters 
the worlds largest computer company said it has not concluded 
any transaction like the one speculated on 
ibm is in the process of considering many options as it moves 
to sharpen its strategic focus and remain on the leading edge of 
the information processing business 
the computer giant added that any future action taken would not 
disrupt its fullemployment policy 
ibm has a tradition of no layoffs when it sold businesses in 
the past it has tried to allay employee fears of job losses 
buyouts however are often followed by layoffs to cut costs and 
help the acquirer repay the debt used in the purchase 
ibm has been paring its operations and payroll since the mid 
1980s when growth in the computer industry began to slow in 
december ibm announced another round of employee reductions 
through early retirement programs 
the company also has been looking for ways to get out of 
businesses considered marginal since the proliferation of desktop 
computers and other word processing systems in the 1980s 
the executives quoted anonymously by the journal said ibm has 
admitted it simply cannot make some of these lowmargin items as 
inexpensively as its competitors 
besides typewriters and keyboards ibm also could sell its 
lowend computer printer line all three of which are produced at 
ibms recently modernized lexington ky plant the executives 
said 
earlier this week ibm reported that its secondquarter profit 
rose 5 percent to 141 billion over a year ago as revenue grew by 
8 percent to 165 billion

general dynamics corp today reported a 240 
million or 575 a share loss for the second quarter because of 
half a billion dollars worth of cost overruns in two defense 
programs 
the 500 million charge included 450 million of estimated 
higher costs for the a12 aircraft program for the navy and 50 
million in higher costs for the sincgars radio contract for the 
army 
the quarterly loss for the nations second largest defense 
contractor compared with a profit of 584 million or 139 a 
share for the same period a year ago 
sales for the quarter which ended june 30 were up slightly at 
26 billion compared with 25 billion 
meanwhile the nations largest defense contractor mcdonnell 
douglas corp reported a profit of 57 million or 149 a share 
for the second quarter that compares with a loss of 48 million 
or 125 a share for the same period last year 
the good news comes in the wake of mondays announcement that 
the company was planning to cut its work force by up to 11 percent 
this year and trim other expenses in an effort to save 700 million 
sales for the quarter were 412 billion compared with 337 
billion in last years second quarter 
both mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics worked together on 
the navys a12 program but apparently when it came to estimating 
costs they parted ways 
while general dynamics took a big loss for the program 
mcdonnell douglas didnt report any cost overruns and said general 
dynamics was being too cautious in its estimate

toyota motor corp has asked its suppliers to 
streamline the parts they sell toyota to improve the fuel 
efficiency of its automobiles a company official said wednesday 
the move was taken partly in response to pressure by a bill 
presented to the us senate that will require auto manufacturers 
to improve the gas efficiency of their vehicles by 40 percent 
within 10 years 
toyota asked its subcontractors who provide roughly 70 percent 
of the parts used in its vehicles to reduce the weight of their 
products by at least 10 percent said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the company will not switch immediately to using lighter 
materials such as aluminum because of their cost but will try to 
improve existing designs he said 
toyota will consider switching to aluminum however if the 
united states passes the bryan bill which requires auto 
manufacturers to raise their fuel efficiency by 20 percent before 
1995 and by 40 percent before 2001 
japanese automakers have opposed the legislation they say 
increasing efficiency will be much more difficult for them than for 
american manufacturers because they are already highly efficient 
but the toyota official said the companys request to its 
suppliers was not just a response to the american threat 
whether or not the bryan bill is passed toyota intends to 
make its cars compatible with the environment he said 
toyotas request to lighten parts is typical of its relations 
with its more than 100 subsidiaries and affiliated suppliers it 
often applies pressure on the smaller companies to cut prices and 
improve quality 
such pressure on parts suppliers has been criticized as a reason 
for hasty production and a spate of defects in recent japanese 
cars but toyota has said it will provide all possible assistance 
to help its suppliers make the necessary changes 
other japanese car manufacturers including nissan motor co have 
also asked their affiliated parts suppliers to trim parts as a way 
to improve efficiency

the worst of times could be the best of times for 
jim gall and his auctioneers 
with the nations savings and loan system in shambles and 
regulators anxious to unload seized assets gall says his 
11yearold auction house is poised for profits and fame 
im as upset about the sampl crisis as anyone were all in for 
thousands of dollars per person for the bailout said gall 
chairman of miamibased auction co of america but around here 
we couldnt be busier 
gall part savvy executive part slick showman is striving to 
become the principal gavelbasher for the resolution trust corp 
the agency established last year to dispose of insolvent thrifts 
it appears his quest is paying off 
last month in miami gall raked in more than 300000 for the 
rtc in an auction of dinnerware and other luxury items from the 
failed centrust savings bank more than 1000 bidders filled a 
marble hall in the centrust tower to compete for items such as a 
rare book collection and the personal mahogany humidor of ousted 
centrust chairman david paul 
galls next big rtc auction appearance is planned for early fall 
when he will bring about 300 million in commercial properties to 
the block bidders from around the nation and in tokyo and london 
will participate via a special satellite hookup 
with auction company commissions ranging between 5 percent and 
10 percent galls firm stands to make millions off the real estate 
sale billed by gall as the largest auction in the history of 
the world he said he plans to ask for recognition in the 
guinness book of world records 
yeah but we also look at it as the taxpayers gain as well 
he said the better price we get for the properties the less the 
taxpayers burden for the bailout 
during a recent interview in galls office the telephone rang 
it was the rtc calling from washington gall slumped into his 
leather chair 
today he asked gazing out at a 23rdfloor view of the 
atlantic ocean all right well be ready 
gall put down the receiver and winced the rtc was preparing to 
release a list of the 100 to 125 properties in the fall auction and 
wanted to use auction co of america as a contact number for the 
press 
this kind of took me by surprise we dont even have a special 
phone ready he said but hey lifes full of surprises 
gall 44 is no stranger to the unexpected he and the companys 
senior vice president arrived unannounced in washington last year 
they were loaded down with 50page information packets designed to 
persuade congressmen to include auctions in sampl bailout legislation 
but few lawmakers took interest in the pair who would show up 
in offices without appointments and ambush congressional aides 
finally they gave up and dumped the folders 
besides they weighed too much said gall 
before they left town they typed a onepage position paper that 
caught the attention of us rep doug bereuter rneb who 
sponsored a successful auction amendment 
the rtc will watch the response to the fall auction before 
deciding whether to use gall or other companies for future 
nationwide auctions said agency spokeswoman nancy schertzing 
i would not doubt it if we see other auctions she said 
were still taking assets under rtc control 
as of midjuly the rtc had 247 thrifts under conservatorship 
and had sold or liquidated 209 others she said 
this sampl crisis has turned out to be a wonderful opportunity 
for the auction industry said ann wood executive vice president 
of the 740member certified auctioneers institute in overland park 
kan its showing the nation that auctions are a way to dispose 
of property quickly and efficiently people are learning theres 
more to being an auctioneer than just being able to talk fast 
but gall talks fast anyway a paper sign in his office reads 
do it now 
in the early 1970s he peddled office furniture and novelties 
such as key chains before his first taste or whiff of the big 
time 
working with special highly concentrated oils developed by 
minnesota mining amp manufacturing co gall and his sister developed 
scratchandsniff tshirts in a miami kitchen in 1976 
the tshirts a shortlived fad had a moment of national fame 
when former abc sportscaster alex karras donned one during a 
monday night football broadcast from miami gall had tracked 
down the broadcasts coanchor howard cosell earlier in the day to 
give him the shirt 
the tshirts went up then down and out of sight said gall 
but it taught me how to do national and international marketing 
it taught me how to think big 
in 1979 gall began classes at a kansas city mobased 
auctioneer school i found my niche he said 
he returned to miami and began looking for clients within a few 
years he was holding estate auctions at some of palm beachs most 
exclusive addresses 
more recently gall won the right to auction the contents of 
nelson bunker hunts ranch outside dallas in one of the nations 
largest personal bankruptcy liquidations 
gall does not discuss the companys finances but he noted that 
during one week this july he auctioned more than 10 million in 
property the itinerary a marina in davenport iowa 85 
foreclosures in louisiana townhouses in new york 103 condominiums 
at waterville valley nh then more townhouses in atlanta 
of course all weeks are not that good he said but 
considering what the rtc holds thats nothing

a ceremonial handshake today on the fifth floor 
of the massive general motors corp building began a process that 
some observers predict may end in a strike of at least one big 
three automaker this september 
negotiations between the giant automaker and the united auto 
workers union for a new national labor contract got under way 
following a 10minute photo opportunity in which negotiators 
reached across a table to shake hands 
uaw talks with ford motor co begin thursday with chrysler 
corp negotiations to open friday the three contracts expire at 
midnight sept 14 
as negotiators smiled inside about 2000 demonstrators gathered 
outside to demand increased costofliving allowances for uaw 
retirees union leaders earlier rejected an effort to make cola a 
key issue of the talks 
the demonstrators today chanted millions for roger peanuts 
for us referring to chairman roger smiths hefty retirement plan 
no single issue in the talks is seen as likely to bring a 
strike but union anger remains from the last talks at gm and 
chrysler during which the uaw thought it had won broad job security 
the two automakers have combined to close six assembly plants 
and lay off 17000 workers since the contracts were signed in 1987 
at gm and 1988 at chrysler both used a clause that allowed plant 
closings only because of slow sales of the products made there 
the unions top priority again is protecting current jobs of the 
more than 450000 big three workers it represents 
the companies top goal is getting the union to agree to 
flexibility in how vehicles are built 
analyst ron glantz of dean witter reynolds inc in san francisco 
calls a strike against gm likely 
the odds of a strike are probably the highest that theyve 
been in 20 years said analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp 
co of new york the last general strike against one of the big 
three was a 12day stoppage in 1985 against chrysler 
i think its a key set of talks it will likely shape labor 
relations in the auto industry for the 90s said labor analyst 
harley shaiken of the university of california at san diego i 
think it is taking place against a backdrop of an industry that has 
gone through some very large structural changes 
during the 1980s the big three rode a financial roller coaster 
in 1981 the companies lost a combined 12 billion in 1988 the 
combined earnings were a record 112 billion 
the turnaround came partly because of surging car and truck 
sales and largely because of costcutting and plant closings 
the corporations in the unions view have a credibility 
problem going into the talks shaiken said there will likely 
be a lot of watching of the fine print in the job security this 
time around 
auto industry observers are split over which company the union 
is likely to choose as a target for setting a model contract for 
the other two 
we still think the odds greatly favor ford being the target 
kirnan said i think the uaw knows full well that as far as job 
security is concerned ford is in the best position to grant that 
shaiken said the unions strategic needs and internal politics 
point to gm 
uaw vice president stephen yokich seen as the likely successor 
to union president owen bieber in the mid1990s will lead his 
first set of negotiations as director of the uaws huge gm 
department he led the negotiating effort in 1987 when the union 
targeted ford 
ernest lofton was chosen a year ago to succeed yokich as head of 
the unions ford department he has served on national bargaining 
committees before but has never led in negotiations 
the aug 1 promotion of gm president robert stempel to succeed 
smith could spare gm a strike call it a honeymoon 
it would not be the way he would want to start his tenure 
shaiken said there would be some motivation to start it without 
a strike

federal inspectors found 21 violations of 
faaapproved quality assurance procedures in an audit of the boeing 
cos production plant in everett wash last year records show 
federal aviation administration spokesman dave duff said none of 
the violations posed a safety risk to the flying public boeing 
which has been under the gun to deliver airplanes said all the 
violations have been corrected 
details of the violations were reported today by the seattle 
postintelligencer the faa responding to a freedom of information 
act request made available to the newspaper part of a quality 
assurance systems analysis review it conducted at the plant in 
february 1989 
the everett plant is where boeing makes its widebody 767 and 747 
jetliners 
inspectors said violations included failure to 
check approved engineering drawings in the manufacture and 
inspection of parts 
use proper methods and tools to cut composite and titanium 
parts 
document and check reworked parts 
use the proper torque to tighten tubes and latches 
document parts used in areas for which they were not originally 
intended 
the report also said workers were not properly protected from 
airborne dust while drilling holes in graphite composites 
all area personnel are completely unaware of the safety 
consideration of cutting and drilling advanced composites the 
report said great amounts of cutting and countersinking are 
being conducted without vacuums or the wearing of respirators 
a report of a similar january 1989 inspection done at boeings 
renton facility where 737 and 757s are manufactured documented 
five similar violations the postintelligencer said 
boeing which is now producing a record 34 airplanes a month 
said the problems have been fixed 
we have corrected all the items in that audit to the 
satisfaction of the faa said spokeswoman elizabeth reese for 
a facility like everett 21 violations was not a bad number but 
its not something you want to rest on 
faa officials in seattle who oversaw the audits declined to be 
interviewed the newspaper said 
duff said the faa did not fine boeing as it had in the past 
between 1985 and 1989 boeing paid 14 fines to the faa totaling 
245000 for quality control violations found in previous 
inspections which are done every 18 to 36 months 
in the past we relied on legal enforcements as the primary 
action after the quality assurance review duff said 
but under the philosophy of faa administrator james busey who 
was appointed by president bush last year there is less emphasis 
on time and manpowerconsuming legal proceedings and more on 
assuring compliance duff added enforcement is now the last 
resort to ensure compliance

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan sent a 
strong signal today that the central bank will act decisively to 
keep the country out of a recession by lowering interest rates once 
policymakers agree on a deficitreduction package 
in his strongest comments to date greenspan sought to reassure 
members of congress that the fed will do its part in any effort to 
significantly attack the huge federal budget deficit 
many republican critics of tax increases have charged that 
president bushs reversal on the tax question threatens to push the 
country into a recession by increasing the tax burden at a time 
when the economy is already growing at a sluggish rate 
however greenspan delivering the feds midyear economic report 
today said that a major cut in the budget is unquestionably the 
right thing to do 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater welcomed 
greenspans comments clearly we have said that one of the 
reasons we need to get the deficit down is to take pressure off 
interest rates and to help bring them down he said 
certainly thats the direction wed like to see said 
fitzwater he also said it was helpful just in knowing that 
others see the goal of this process the same as we do which is to 
get interest rates down and to keep the economy growing 
while greenspan said that the specific details of any fed 
response to a deficitreduction package would depend on the 
performance of the economy at the time he left no doubt that the 
central bank would move to offset the adverse effects on growth 
from government spending cuts and tax increases by lowering 
interest rates 
major substantive credible cuts in the budget deficit would 
present the federal reserve with a situation that would call for a 
careful reconsideration of its policy greenspan said i can 
only offer the assurance that the federal reserve will act as it 
has in the past to endeavor to keep the economic expansion on 
track 
the administration on monday dramatically boosted its estimate 
of the size of the 1991 budget deficit to 1688 billion far above 
the 64 billion deficit limit set by the grammrudman balanced 
budget law 
in presenting the new estimate treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and other administration officials said they were counting on 
the fed to do its part to lower interest rates the administration 
has been complaining for months that the fed has kept interest 
rates too high and thus slowing economic growth to dangerously low 
levels 
after keeping interest rates unchanged since last december the 
fed took a modest step toward easing them last friday it supplied 
enough additional cash to the banking system to push a key interest 
rate the federal funds rate down from 825 percent to 8 percent 
the rate fell further today trading at 7 1516 percent by 
midday in the credit markets 
the drop in the federal funds rate which banks charge each 
other for overnight loans has helped push the stock market to 
record highs as investors speculated that further rate declines 
would be forthcoming stock prices largely were lower at midday 
today however 
in his testimony today greenspan confirmed that the fed had 
eased slightly last week saying the action was taken to offset the 
effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans 
greenspan refused to characterize the developments as a 
fullscale credit crunch but he did say the tightness this 
year was beginning to have very real unwelcome effects on 
economic growth 
the fed released its new estimates of economic growth this year 
indicating that the central bank is willing to tolerate slower 
growth than the administration is counting on 
the administrations revised economic forecast on monday put 
growth this year at 22 percent as measured by the gross national 
product and 29 percent next year but the feds new estimate 
projected growth this year of between 15 percent and 2 percent and 
put gnp growth in 1991 between 175 percent and 25 percent 
the fed also released new growth targets for the money supply 
today putting the most closely watched measure of the money supply 
at growth of 25 percent to 65 percent for 1991 slightly lower 
than the previous target 
greenspan said this narrowing of the range for the money 
aggregate known as m2 did not indicate a desire to tighten down on 
money growth but rather reflected the fact that the money supply 
has been growing more sluggishly this year 
in assessing the economy greenspan said despite pockets of 
weakness it appeared that growth was continuing 
on balance the economy still appears to be growing and the 
likelihood of a nearterm recession seems low in part because 
businesses have been working hard to keep their inventories in line 
with sales trends he said

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed in early trading today on the chicago board of trade as the 
markets continued to consolidate after posting fairly steep losses 
in the past two weeks 
william biedermann research director with the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc in crystal lake ill said the lower 
prices had stimulated foreign demand for us grain 
but forecasts for continued good growing weather in the midwest 
helped keep a lid on gains resulting in twosided trade and little 
price movement 
it does seem that the attitude of the market is that were 
very near a low in soybean and corn futures he said 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 302 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with july at 273 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with july at 117 a bushel soybeans 
were unchanged to 2 cents higher with july at 597 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange

the chairman of the federal trade commission 
said today that health warnings on alcoholic beverage ads may help 
curb alcohol abuse but that the agency was taking no stand on 
whether they should be required by law 
ftc chairman janet steiger told a house panel that the 
evidence is inconclusive whether beer wine and liquor 
advertising on television and elsewhere encourages consumption 
she said requiring advertising warning labels like those now 
required on alcohol cans and bottles can be an effective 
component of a multifaceted effort against alcohol abuse but 
she said in a formal statement that the bush administration wasnt 
taking sides over the ads which are strongly opposed by the 
alcohol industry 
the decision whether to require the proposed rotating health 
warnings in alcohol advertisements is a question of public policy 
that is most appropriately decided by the united states congress 
she said 
she spoke at a hearing on a bill to require the labels sponsored 
by rep joseph kennedy dmass and sen albert gore dtenn 
held by the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
transportation tourism and hazardous materials 
kennedy told the panel that beer and other alcoholic beverage 
ads are glamorizing drinking and are aimed at young people 
like it or not beer ads educate americans particularly 
younger americans that taking a drink is needed in order to win 
that race or make it down the ski slope or land that account or 
score with that new girl or guy he said 
preparing for the hearing the beer institute launched an 
offensive against the legislation and released a poll purporting to 
show that a majority of americans dont think warnings would curb 
alcohol abuse 
james c sanders president of the beer institute said tuesday 
that if the bill passed he expected beer companies would withdraw 
advertising that underwrites sports events or television coverage 
of the sports with such a mixed message he said the ads would be 
no longer effective 
bud selig owner of the milwaukee brewers baseball team said 
passage of this legislation could spell the end of family 
entertainment across the country 
but pat taylor director of alcohol policy for the private 
center for science in the public interest said there was no 
evidence the ad warnings would bring an end to sports sponsorship 
she said the bill does not limit sports sponsorship by beer or 
other alcohol products 
clearly there is a veiled threat here ms taylor said 
its impossible for me to imagine the alcohol industry in america 
will stop advertising if this bill goes into effect 
their undertaking this kind of campaign indicates the bill 
will probably be an effective part of what needs to be done to 
control the alcohol problems she said 
the bill would require five rotating warnings with messages that 
drinking during pregnancy may cause birth defects that drinking 
and driving is dangerous and that drinking may become addictive 
backers of the bill say television and other types of ads 
encourage drinking 
fred meister president of the distilled spirits council of the 
united states countered that alcohol advertising is aimed at 
encouraging drinkers to switch from one brand to another but it 
does not enlarge the drinking population

house republicans today declared their 
opposition to any deficit reduction plan that includes new taxes a 
position democrats said would cripple budget talks with president 
bush 
the resolution was approved by voice vote at a meeting of the 
house gop only hours before congressional leaders were to meet bush 
for what his spokesman said would be an effort by the president to 
nudge the talks forward 
if they want republican votes theyd better come up with a 
package that republicans believe in said rep mickey edwards 
rokla he said he would rather have the talks collapse than a 
deal that excludes house republicans 
house minority leader bob michel rill said the resolution 
would not undermine the nearlystalled budget talks but democrats 
disagreed 
to have one party say revenues are off the table would really 
cripple this negotiation said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater downplayed the 
house republicans vote which rejects bushs reversal on his no 
new taxes pledge they dont need to pass a resolution to make 
us aware of that he said 
rep richard armey rtexas sponsor of the resolution and 
other republicans said it was aimed at the democrats and not the 
president it included a clause attacking senate majority leader 
george mitchell who said last week he would not support a cut in 
the capital gains tax unless tax rates on the wealthy were 
increased 
democrats were sure to deliver to the president today the 
message that they need more leadership from bush especially in 
selling to the public the prospect of pocketbookpainful decisions 
on taxes and program cuts 
the oval office meeting was scheduled a day after a balanced 
budget constitutional amendment came within seven votes of passing 
the house a sign of lawmakers frustration over slow progress on 
striking a budget deal 
eight years ago the house defeated a balanced budget amendment 
by a comfortable 46 votes on tuesday it fell just seven votes shy 
of the twothirds margin needed in a 279150 tally the measure had 
bushs endorsement 
rep wayne owens dutah said he had opposed a balanced budget 
amendment all his political life but he voted for it tuesday 
i dont like this constitutional amendment he said but 
we must figure out how to have the courage to raise the 
revenues or cut the expenditures or expand the already 
unfathomably large debt burden on the next generation 
the governments debt topped 31 trillion this year and would 
well exceed 4 trillion before the amendment took effect 
the amendment starting in 1995 would prohibit government 
spending from exceeding revenues or any increase in government 
borrowing unless the requirements are waived by a threefifths 
vote of each chamber of congress 
the white house asked for the effective date of 1995 rather 
than 1993 as originally proposed by reps charles stenholm 
dtexas and larry craig ridaho the chief sponsors 
the administration said cutting the deficit too quickly would 
hurt the economy doing it by fiscal 1993 would put spending cuts 
or taxes before the public right before bushs reelection date 
opponents said the amendments requirements could easily be 
dodged through accounting gimmickry and delaying the effective 
date to 1995 amounted to passing the buck 
this socalled balanced budget amendment is the amendment for 
the truly religious because the balance to which it refers occurs 
only in the hereafter said rep david obey dwis 
but supporters said it was their best hope of returning the 
government to fiscal balance 
its obvious we need a more compelling force to restrain 
spending said rep tim penny dminn this could not hurt and 
in fact might help 
bush like ronald reagan before him has never proposed a 
balanced budget but has touted the amendment but faced with a new 
surge in red ink the president abandoned his pledge not to raise 
taxes 
the white house budget office on monday projected that the 
deficit in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 would reach 1688 
billion not counting the tens of billions needed to bail out 
insolvent savings and loans 
white house and congressionl negotiators are looking to reduce 
that figure by at least 50 billion but in the two months since 
bush called the budget summit an agreement hasnt been close 
on tuesday congressional democrats continued their series of 
private meetings on possible spending cuts and tax increases 
with the talks moving so slowly congressional committees are 
moving ahead with their legislative responsibilities in the 
meantime 
the senate appropriations committee voted tuesday to limit 
defense spending next year to 2949 billion 84 billion less 
than bush wants but more than democratic liberals support

stock prices ended lower on londons stock 
exchange wednesday pressured by a poor showing on wall street 
trading was active 
the market opened higher but rapidly lost ground on expectations 
of a drop on wall street due to an anticipated poor us consumer 
price index for june 
the inflation fears were borne out with the index showing a 
rise of 05 percent compared with an expected 03 percent 
however traders said some of londons losses also could be 
attributed to profittaking after a recent rally 
the strong pound also pressured the london market raising fears 
of poor overseas earnings for british companies 
but sentiment overall remained optimistic one dealer said with 
people looking for buy ideas rather than sell ideas

the dun amp bradstreet corp said wednesday its 
second quarter profit fell 182 percent reflecting lower revenue 
and higher costs at its domestic credit services segment 
the business information marketer whose products include 
nielsen television ratings donnelly telephone directories and 
moodys investment services said it still expected to earn in the 
range of 280 a share for the full year compared with 314 in 
1989 
dun amp bradstreet said it had a profit of 123 million or 67 
cents per share for the three months ended june 30 compared with 
1504 million or 80 cents a share a year earlier

106 billion 
the companys us credit services business was stung last year 
by complaints from some customers that they had been overcharged 
the company said it took remedial action but the repositioning 
the division was expected to depress revenue and boost costs for 
the year 
operating revenue from the riskmanagement information business 
fell 18 percent to 2352 million for the quarter mainly because 
of a high singledigit decline at us credit services 
but revenue was up overall because of increases ranging from 22 
percent to 337 percent at the companys directory marketing and 
financial information units and its business services segment 
overall operating costs and other expenses climbed 205 percent 
to 9981 million in the quarter due to the impact of the credit 
services actions accelerated investment at the nielsen marketing 
research and the impact of the acquisition of managament science 
america late last year

earned 2333 million or 127 a share down 206 percent from 
2937 million or 157 a share a year earlier

the european commission on wednesday 
fined six steel companies for forming an illegal pricefixing 
cartel from may 1986 to october 1988 
french ugine aciers de chatillon et gueugnon german krupp stahl 
and italian ternie accial speciali were each fined 100000 european 
currency units the equivalent of 126000 german thyssen 
edelstahlwerke and british steel were each fined 50000 ecus or 
63000 and belgian alz was fined 25000 ecus or 31500 
spanish acerinox swedish avesta and finnish outokumpu were also 
members of the cartel the commission said but the european 
commission has no authority over the scandinavian businesses and 
the spanish company was not fined because spain was still in the 
early stage of ec membership at the time and thus limiting its 
steel exports to other ec countries 
the commission said the nine companies had shared a 17country 
market the 12 ec countries plus a majority of european free trade 
area countries where they had agreed on quarterly production 
quotas 
this cartel helped keep prices at a higher level than what 
would have take place if competition had normally functioned the 
european executive said 
it added however that the fines were low because ec officials 
had not properly coordinated their job it admitted that some 
officials in charge of controling the cartel ignored it

amr corp parent company of american 
airlines reported wednesday that second quarter earnings were down 
274 percent from last year and off by almost 170 million for the 
first six months of the year the company blamed increasing 
expenses 
second quarter earnings were 1292 million or 205 per share 
down from 1779 million or 283 a share for the same period in 
1989 revenue during the quarter rose to 297 billion from 271 
billion a year earlier 
first half earnings were 1099 million or 175 per share 
down from 2789 million or 443 per share for the same period 
last year revenue during the six months rose to 566 billion from 
517 billion 
the company said passenger yields the average amount one 
passenger pays to fly one mile increased by 47 percent to 1274 
cents 
but the increases were not enough to offset increases in fuel 
maintenance engineering and rentals which all increased faster 
than our growth in capacity amr chairman and president robert l 
crandall said 
as a result he said we have launched a corporatewide 
drive to curtail costs and enhance revenues in both the near and 
longer term 
amr spokesman ed stewart said the company has put a hold on 
hiring new employees in some departments but vacancies are being 
filled and no layoffs are planned 
obviously crucial positions will not go unfilled he said 
most of the costcutting measures are simple things such as 
cutting down on photocopying he said crandall also has urged 
employees to send costcutting ideas to an internal program that 
has saved 94 million in three years stewart said 
amr said it recorded a 29 percent increase in revenue passenger 
miles and a 12 percent increase in cargo revenue ton miles it 
scored its biggest traffic day ever on june 28 with more than 282

job security loopholes that allowed general 
motors corp to close four plants in the last three years must be 
closed before a new labor contract can be signed uaw president 
owen bieber said wednesday 
we told the corporation that disappointment is far too mild a 
word to describe our feelings about how they perceived their job 
security commitments they made to us three years ago bieber said 
at a news conference after negotiations began with the giant 
automaker 
talks between the union and ford motor co open thursday in 
dearborn negotiations start friday at chrysler corps 
headquarters in highland park 
the contracts cover more than 450000 hourly workers and nearly 
as many retirees each of the agreements expire at midnight sept 
14 
the talks are between a us auto industry that is reeling from 
the competition of japanese automakers and a union that has seen 
thousands of its workers laid off or idled indefinitely due to 
plant closings 
in addition to eliminating plant closings bieber said the union 
would seek company commitments to 
recall laidoff workers 
review executive compensation before deciding to lay off 
workers bieber declined to say whether the union would try to link 
executive bonuses to profitsharing payments similar to a formula 
used at chrysler 
reduce hours worked without cutting wages 
each of the automakers is expected to seek more flexibility in 
operating their plants in addition to finding ways to contain 
health care costs 
gm and chrysler controlled costs in a sagging auto market by 
shutting plants that made poorly selling products such indefinite 
idling was allowed in the most recent contracts and 17000 uaw 
workers lost their jobs because of it 
i accused them of performing the cynical semantic maneuver 
represented by the term idling plants bieber said 
ford which uses its assembly plants more efficiently has cut 
back by trimming overtime for hourly workers 
chief gm negotiator al warren said the companys goal is to 
preserve current jobs but that employment levels depend on market 
conditions car and truck sales through july 10 of this year were 
down 31 percent from the same period a year earlier although 
there has been a slight upswing since late june 
much of biebers and warrens news conferences wednesday 
centered on health care costs the companies have said health care 
expenses boost vehicle prices putting the big three at a 
disadvantage with japanese companies that make vehicles in the 
united states 
warren said gm spends 622 in employee health care costs for 
every one of the cars and trucks it sells compared with 50 to 100 
per car for japanese assembly plants in the united states 
bieber said endorsement of a national health care system is the 
only way gm and other employers can cut their health care costs 
dick obrien gms vice president for personnel administration 
and development dodged the question of whether the huge automaker 
would back the unions call for national health insurance 
were looking at all solutions to the healthcare question at 
gm obrien said 
although no single issue is seen as a harbinger of a strike 
some analysts have said a strike is more likely now than at any 
time since 1970 when the uaw struck gm for seven weeks 
before the talks began wednesday morning at gm about 2000 uaw 
members and their families marched around the massive building in a 
demonstration demanding protection for retired workers against the 
rising cost of living 
the union and the companies have said that linking cost of 
living payment adjustments for pensioners to the inflation rate 
could cost billions of dollars

principal purposes for which he joined the firm have been 
substantially achieved or obviated by the firms chapter 11 
filing 
drexel filed for protection from creditors feb 13 the firm has 
said it plans to emerge from chapter 11 proceedings but has not 
said what business it would conduct 
drexel soared to wall streets heights in the 1980s largely 
because of its command over the junk bond market but never 
recovered from its guilty plea in the governments insider trading 
probe drexel agreed to pay 650 million in penalties and pleaded 
guilty to six felonies 
drexel chief executive john f sorte said the restructuring is

other assets without additional outside supervision 
the firm has said liquidation is a matter of routine bankruptcy 
procedures and it has granted adequate input

west german automaker 
mercedesbenz ag said wednesday it was introducing saturday 
overtime shifts to meet rising demand for its cars 
the automaking arm of daimlerbenz ag said that special 
saturday shifts will be added on several saturdays beginning in 
september the overtime shifts will affect the companys plants in 
stuttgartuntertuerkheim sindelfingen and bremen 
the move comes after the companys workers council gave its 
agreement to the overtime shifts 
mercedesbenz had tried to introduce the overtime shifts at the 
start of the year but the company could not reach an agreement 
with the workers council 
in a brief statement mercedesbenz said the extra shifts will 
be added so that the company can react flexibly to the heightened 
demand it said growth rates in europe and other foreign markets 
for mercedesbenz cars in general along with lively demand for 
certain models and upgraded equipment had prompted the need for 
extra shifts 
the increasing globalization of the markets the 
internationalization of the supply and changes in customer behavior 
make it necessary to react more flexibly and faster to take 
advantage of market chances the company said 
it said demand for its sportline equipment which can be 
added at extra cost to lower and middlepriced cars was 
especially strong demand was also keen for the companys cheapest 
car the new 190 e 18liter model that can be purchased in west 
germany for about 34000 marks or 20600 
the company said its operations in italy france and spain had 
recorded sales increases of 7 percent to 15 percent in the first 
half of 1990 sales in japan jumped 44 percent and the company 
indicated solid sales in the important us market had played a key 
role in the decision to boost production 
a spokesman for mercedesbenz said sales figures for the us in 
the first half were not available but said the company expects to 
sell about 75000 cars in the us this year 
although the projected figure would be roughly the same as last 
year the spokesman described it as successful in light of tough 
competition in the us market 
we are doing comparatively well in the us the official 
said referring to other luxury carmakers that have been 
experiencing sales declines 
the spokesman said the extra saturday shifts will enable the 
company to produce 570000 cars this year up from an earlier 
forecast of 556000 
mercedes record production year was 1987 when its output 
reached 580000 cars

surging food housing and gasoline costs sent 
consumer prices soaring 05 percent in june more than double the 
inflation rate of the past two months the government reported 
wednesday 
in other bad economic news housing construction fell in june 
for the fifth consecutive month pushing the level of building 
activity to its lowest point since the depths of the last recession 
if you view it as a twofront war were getting hammered from 
both sides both on inflation and the growth front said 
martin regalia chief economist for the national council of savings 
institutions 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called the june 
inflation report higher than we would like to see but said much 
of the increase was due to a temporary jump in housing and gasoline 
costs and did not reflect an upturn in underlying inflationary 
pressures 
greenspan said that despite some problems the economy was 
performing reasonably well at present and is not on the edge of 
either falling apart into a recession or about to take on highly 
inflationary characteristics 
he confirmed that the central bank had eased credit slightly 
last week and indicated the fed stood ready to do so again to 
deflect any adverse effects on the economy from tax increases and 
spending cuts under consideration to reduce the huge budget deficit 
the inflation news caused jitters on wall street by raising 
fears that higher inflation will limit the feds ability to lower 
interest rates the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 1807 
points to close at 298168 
the unexpectedly steep rise in the labor departments consumer 
price index followed 02 percent increases in both april and may 
through the first six months of the year consumer prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 59 percent well above the 46 percent 
for all of 1989 
the commerce department reported on wednesday a drop of 23 
percent in housing starts last month with new homes and apartments 
being built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 118 million 
units the june decline followed decreases of 09 percent in may 
69 percent in april 122 percent in march and 51 percent in 
february 
analysts called the june inflation figure a worrisome increase 
that demonstrates entrenched inflation they had expected prices to 
keep recovering from a jolt early in the year when a cold snap sent 
the costs of fruits vegetables and energy skyward 
this was the time when we were supposed to be getting a good 
number in response to the surge from the first of the year but the 
message is inflation is very much still part of the scene and 
theres no sign that its abating said robert dederick chief 
economist at the northern trust co of chicago 
michael k evans who heads an economic forecasting firm in 
washington said there was no reason to hope for better news any 
time soon on either inflation or sluggish economic activity 
the problem is endemic low productivity lack of investment 
and a high budget deficit these problems are not going to change 
overnight evans said 
in the inflation report grocery store food prices which had 
fallen in each of the past two months rose 1 percent in june as 
prices went up for all of the major food categories 
gasoline prices which generally increase during the 
heavydriving summer months jumped 25 percent last month after 
falling 16 percent in may 
housing costs climbed 06 percent the largest increase in such 
costs since a 1 percent rise in may 1985 
within the food category which rose 07 percent overall there 
was a sharp turnaround in the price of fruits and vegetables which 
rose 15 percent after falling 24 percent in may 
pork prices up 40 percent in june have risen sharply over the 
past nine months climbing at an annual rate of 262 percent during 
that period poultry prices were up 13 percent while dairy prices 
after dropping the past three months rose 02 percent in june 
energy costs overall were up 06 percent the price of natural 
gas shot up 27 percent but fuel oil dropped 42 percent and 
electricity fell 16 percent 
prices for items outside the volatile food and energy sectors 
jumped 04 percent in june analysts consider this socalled 
core rate a better indicator of underlying inflation pressures 
in the economy 
new car prices edged down 02 percent the fifth straight 
decline in the face of sluggish sales 
clothing costs which jumped sharply earlier in the year when a 
warm february got spring sales off at an early start fell 01 
percent last month that had been expected as merchants marked down 
summer sale clothing 
medical care costs soared 07 percent in june for the fifth 
straight month pushing those costs 90 percent higher than a year 
ago 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1299 in june that means a hypothetical selection of goods and 
services costing 100 in the 198284 base period cost 12990 last 
month up from the 12410 a year ago

industry analysts said wednesday they werent 
surprised by a reported plan by ibm to sell several of its 
lowtechnology product lines including its wellknown selectric 
typewriters 
my guess is the market has not been very attractive said 
barry bosak who follows ibm for smith barney harris upham amp co 
ive been wondering what the fate of the typewriter plant would 
be for some time 
international business machines corps typewriter lines in 
particular face an uncertain future as word processors increasingly 
gain favor in offices and homes analysts said 
also said to be under consideration for sale are ibms lowend 
computer printer and computer keyboard lines analysts said the 
keyboard business increasingly is being dominated by lowcost asian 
manufacturers 
according to unidentified sources quoted by the wall street 
journal ibm is considering selling the three product lines in a 
leveraged buyout valued at about 3 billion 
ibm has been negotiating with a potential buyer and a deal could 
be worked out by the end of the month the newspaper said 
ibm shares lost 87 cents wednesday to close at 11987 on the 
new york stock exchange 
in a statement issued from its armonk ny headquarters the 
worlds largest computer company said it has not concluded any 
transaction like the one speculated on 
ibm is in the process of considering many options as it moves 
to sharpen its strategic focus and remain on the leading edge of 
the information processing business 
the company also said it had no plans to modify its 
fullemployment policy of no layoffs 
when ibm sold businesses in the past it has tried to allay 
employee fears of job losses buyouts however often are followed 
by layoffs to cut costs and help the acquirer repay debt used in 
the purchase 
ibm has been paring its operations and payroll since the mid 
1980s when growth in the computer industry began to slow in 
december ibm announced plant consolidations and another round of 
employee reductions through voluntary early retirement 
the company also has been getting out of businesses it considers 
marginal or requiring investments that would crimp profits 
in the past few years ibm sold its rolm telephone business to 
siemens ag of west germany and most of its copier business to 
eastman kodak co last week ibm said it would transfer its 
automated teller line to a joint venture with diebold inc 
ibm does not disclose revenue and profit from individual product 
lines but analysts said the three lines in question probably make 
up less than 5 percent of its overall business 
the typewriters keyboards and lowend printers are produced at 
ibms lexington ky plant in the early 1980s ibm spent hundreds 
of millions of dollars automating the plant in a bid to compete 
with lowercost foreign manufacturers 
in retrospect that decision appears to have been a mistake 
analysts said however smith barneys bosak added not all that 
was as obvious when the modernization plans started 
ibm spokesman peter thonis said the lexington plant is a 
stateoftheart facility thats been profitable and a very 
effective operation the plant ibms only domestic typewriter 
manufacturing site employs about 5000 he said 
analysts questioned whether the product lines could fetch the 
reported 3 billion one analyst said he believed 2 billion was a 
more realistic price 
bosak speculated that the product lines would be most attractive 
to a foreign buyer given that the typewriter business is 
concentrated overseas and that the us leveraged buyout business 
has dried up in the past year 
earlier this week ibm reported its secondquarter profit rose 5 
percent from a year ago to 141 billion as revenue grew 8 percent 
to 165 billion

its second quarter earnings 
a weak advertising market hurt both media companies 
its the same problem the whole industry has the ad linage 
numbers continue to be disappointing said peter appert media 
industry analyst for the investment firm cj lawrence morgan 
grenfell 
retail advertising which accounts for about half of the typical 
newspapers ad revenue has been hurt because of industry 
consolidation and severe financial woes at some major department 
store chains 
classified advertising which makes up another 40 percent of 
newspaper ad revenue has fallen as the economy has deteriorated in 
parts of the country 
thats a combination that makes for a very tough climate for 
newspaper companies appert said

newspaper advertising revenues were down 4 percent in the second 
quarter reflecting a 7 percent decline in runofpress advertising 
volume and reduced newspaper advertising in detroit where a joint 
operating agency started up last november 
it said normal cyclical lows in retailing have been 
exaggerated by bankruptcies and consolidations of some major 
department stores which traditionally have been among the 
companys largest advertisers

million in the quarter the company said retail ad linage fell at

the nations two largest defense contractors 
reported very different second quarter earnings on wednesday 
primarily because of different accounting approaches to the same 
problem 
the problem is development of the a12 the navys new bomber 
for its aircraft carriers 
general dynamics corp the countrys second biggest defense 
company said it lost 240 million or 575 a share in the second 
quarter primarily because of a 450 million cost overrun for the 
a12 
the quarterly loss for the st louisbased company compared with 
a profit of 584 million or 139 a share for the same period a 
year ago sales for the quarter which ended june 30 were up 
slightly at 26 billion compared with 25 billion in the 1989 
period 
along with the 450 million general dynamics said its sincgars 
radio contract with the army would cost an additional 50 million 
bringing the total onetime charge against secondquarter earnings 
to 500 million thats the largest onetime quarterly charge in 
company history 
general dynamics partner on the a12 program mcdonnell douglas 
corp didnt take any charges for the project and reported a 
profit of 57 million or 149 a share for the quarter 
that compares with a loss of 48 million or 125 a share for 
the same period last year sales for the quarter were 48 billion 
compared with 337 billion in last years second quarter 
the good news comes in the wake of mondays announcement that 
mcdonnell douglas also headquartered in st louis was planning to 
cut its work force by up to 11 percent this year and trim other 
expenses in an effort to save 700 million 
general dynamics stock price closed at 3150 down 125 cents 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange wednesday 
mcdonnell douglas stock closed up 175 at 43 on the nyse 
whos right about the a12 
neither is wrong each company is using its own consistent 
accounting approach this is not a scheme by mcdonnell douglas to 
try to fool anybody said howard rubel a stock analyst for cj 
lawrence in new york 
mcdonnell douglas said its partner was using an inflated cost 
estimate for mcdonnells share of the work on the halffinished 
program and did not include estimates of claims for additional 
bills above the agreedupon 48 billion contract price 
we are confident that our costs will be lower and that these 
claims are valid and will result in payment said company 
spokesman andrew wilson 
paul nisbet a stock analyst with prudentialbache securities in 
new york said the different directions in earnings were expected 
on wall street as were the profit reports 
general dynamics earnings were fairly strong except for the 
a12 mcdonnell douglas was right on expectations nisbet said 
rubel said there were some good signs for mcdonnell douglas 
including improved profits in its missiles space and electronic 
systems division and much lower losses in commercial aircraft 
the results arent as bad as the worst fears said rubel 
if you will this should dispel the worst fears

b2 bomber maker northrop corp said 
wednesday it earned 293 million during its second quarter 
compared with a 781 million quarterly loss a year earlier due to 
cost overruns on a classified project 
per share earnings were 63 cents compared with a loss of 167 
in the second quarter of 1989 sales were virtually unchanged at 
about 14 billion 
northrops backlog of orders increased 27 percent from 515 
billion on june 30 1989 to 654 billion on june 30 this year 
about half of northrops revenue comes from the b2 stealth 
plane the aerospace company said its prototype b2 now being 
tested in flights above the california desert had met or bettered 
all its initial test objectives 
defense secretary dick cheney wants to cap production of the 
radardodging planes at 75 down from 132 that once had been 
planned some congressional opponents would like to stop the planes 
at the current level of 15 already in the pipeline 
the secondquarter 1989 loss stemmed from a 150 million loss 
provision northrop was forced to take on a fixedprice research and 
development program in its missiles and unpiloted vehicle systems 
division like several other defense contractors northrop has 
stopped accepting such fixedprice research projects because costs 
are so unpredictable and hard to contain 
for the first six months northrop earnings totaled 1253 
million 267 per share compared with a loss of 684 million 
146 per share during the same period last year the 1990 
earnings include an aftertax gain of 671 million or 142 per 
share from the firstquarter sale of the companys headquarters 
buildings in century city 
sales for the first six months were 269 billion up 
fractionally from the 268 billion in revenues in the first half 
of 1989

the rise in unemployment in east germany is 
quickening now that the country has merged its economy with that of 
west germany the government reported wednesday 
at midjuly the number of east germans registered as jobless 
rose to 223876 or 25 percent of the labor force said regine 
hildebrandt east german minister for labor and social affairs 
at the start of the month there were 150000 registered 
unemployed in east germany that total that was up from 45000 in 
april 
economists say unemployment could hit 3 million within a year as 
uncompetitive east german companies go bankrupt because they cannot 
make the adjustment from a centrally planned ecomomy to freemarket 
capitalism 
earlier this month hildebrandt said the biggest problem facing 
east germany was that western companies were not investing as 
quickly as expected she also said the number of new smaller and 
mediumsized companies expected to stimulate new jobs in the future 
hadnt been rising as quickly as the government would like 
the two germanys joined their economies and monetary systems on 
july 1 and are expected to merge into one nation by the end of the 
year

a new agreement appears to have broken an impasse 
between union and nonunion ual corp workers over the proposed 
buyout of united airlines parent company employee spokesmen said 
wednesday 
under the agreement the noncontract employees would accept 
505 million in wage cuts in exchange for more than 14 percent of 
ual corp if the unionled attempt to buy the airline succeeds 
settlement of the conflict between the union and nonunion 
employees represents another step toward putting together the 
financing package needed to complete the 438 billion buyout 
proposal spokesmen for both groups said 
i think this is a significant step forward said stephen 
fraidin an attorney representing uniteds 25700 noncontract 
employees it is an attractive and fair offer 
the united employees acquisition corp the entity formed by 
employees to handle the buyout has until aug 9 to secure 
financing for the deal a previous employee takeover effort ended 
in failure in october 
the agreement calls for the noncontract employees to own 1426 
percent of ual 
previous reports indicated the noncontract employees would have 
to accept wage cuts of about 77 percent but fraidin said the 
505 million in concessions represented a significantly lower 
percentage he declined to provide the exact percentage 
unions representing the airlines pilots mechanics and flight 
attendants have all agreed to accept wage and benefit cuts in 
exchange for stock in the company if their buyout bid succeeds 
the acquisition group said 2 billion in annual cost reductions is 
needed to help offset buyout costs 
ual stock closed at 16250 a share wednesday in composite new 
york stock exchange trading up 50 cents 
the noncontract employees who make up one of the largest 
segments of the airlines 71000 employees had objected to the 
buyout proposal saying they were not consulted at the companys 
annual shareholders meeting in april noncontract employees called 
their exclusion from the buyout plan rude illegal and 
undemocratic 
if workers succeed in this attempt to buy ual it would make the 
company the nations largest employeeowned firm 
ual is the parent of one of the nations largest airlines

the news corp ltd said wednesday it intends to 
pursue its planned 150 million sale of deluxe laboratories to the 
rank organisation plc despite opposition from the justice 
department 
on tuesday the department said it will oppose the deal because 
it would lessen competition among motion picture printers 
news corp said in a statement that it was told the justice 
department would file court action seeking to block the deal on 
antitrust grounds 
but news corp and rank organisation will defend vigorously 
against this action and expect upon review of the facts to 
prevail so that the sale may go through the statement said 
the rank organization plc a british firm operates the film 
house group inc of toronto canada which prints featurelength 
motion pictures for hollywood studios 
deluxe laboratories based in hollywood is a unit of news 
corps fox inc subsidiary which is involved in producing films 
and television shows 
the government said film house and deluxe would control 51 
percent of the north american market if they were combined based 
on 1989 production figures 
if permitted the acquisition would eliminate competition 
between two of the three leading laboratories in the north american 
market for widerelease prints and dramatically increase 
concentration in that market said james f rill assistant 
attorney general for antitrust 
technicolor is the nations largest movie printing laboratory 
the industry had sales of more than 140 million last year the

prozac probably will continue to be widely 
used for treating depression despite a lawsuit charging that the 
drug produced by eli lilly and co prompts suicidal behavior 
analysts said wednesday 
its hard for me to see it destroying the potenial for the 
product said mark mayer a drug analyst for the new yorkbased 
investment firm sanford c bernstein i think this is still a 
breakthrough antidepressant 
but others said the lawsuit may cast doubts on prozacs 
projected use as a wonder drug for obesity smoking and other 
obsessivecompulsive behaviors analysts said 
prozac has helped lilly enjoy record earnings this year and news 
accounts have fueled speculation that the drug one day will be used 
for a variety of human behavior problems 
rhonda hala of new york sued lilly on tuesday for 150 million 
in damages claiming she became suicidal and selfdesctructive while 
taking prozac for depression following back surgery in 1988 she 
also alleged the suicidal impulses disappeared after she stopped 
taking the drug 
on tuesday lilly announced separately that the rapid growth of 
prozac was a primary reason its profit rose 26 percent to a record 
274 million in the second quarter 
prozac has been approved only for the treatment of depression 
however it is representative of a class of drugs called 
psychotropics that experts believe could someday provide cures for 
personality disorders such as overeating smoking alcoholism and 
obsessivecompulsive disorders 
lilly spokeswoman marie abbot would not comment on the lawsuits 
implications for prozac sales however she did note that more than 
2 million patients have taken the drug for depression and that it 
has been found to be a useful addition to the number of treatment 
options available to physicians to treat their patients with 
depression 
abbot also said the company is not removing prozac from the 
market and said it has not been shown that the drug causes suicidal 
thoughts 
ronald nordmann a drug industry analyst for the investment firm 
painewebber inc in new york said that given the annual suicide 
rate for depression patients was 22 percent to 36 percent higher 
than for the general population it was not surprising that some 
who took prozac for depression might think about suicide 
in my opinion the lawsuit filed yesterday is trivial in 
nature and wont cause any change in prescribing habits for this 
drug he said i anticipate that this drug will continue to be 
prescribed prudently for depressed patients who have found the 
product to be very helpful and in whom the benefits greatly 
outweigh the risks 
nordmann and other analysts said they believed lilly has been 
candid about information linking prozac to suicidal thoughts 
they are being very cautious they are reporting every single 
side effect to the fda in may prozacs package insert was changed 
to include six cases of suicidal ideation or the increased 
thoughts of committing suicide nordmann said 
he also said the incidence of problems was fewer than three per 
million patients 
prozac is used for about 25 percent of the nations 
prescriptions for antidepressants the highest market share for any 
product of its kind mayer said 
its a huge product and its going to be a huger product he 
said 
but mayer said the suit may give the us food and drug 
administration some concern about approving the drug for other 
uses such as treatment of obesity or alcoholism 
barbara ryan drug industry analyst for prudentialbache 
securities in new york also said she expected the fda would act 
much more cautiously in giving approval for use of prozac to treat 
other disorders 
if there is a safety concern at the fda and there doesnt 
appear to be one now then the indications will have to be 
medically important ones she said 
ryan does not believe lilly sales will suffer because of the 
lawsuit and subsequent publicity about the drug some analysts have 
predicted prozac sales could reach 1 billion if treatment for 
obesity were approved 
ryan said prozac sales are expected to reach 750 million this 
year mainly because of treatment for depression 
i still think that you can make a good strong case why this 
would be a billiondollar drug even without the other 
indications she said

iraq warned fellow opec members on 
wednesday it viewed violations of the cartels production quotas as 
virtual acts of war and accused neighboring kuwait of stealing its 
oil for the past decade 
after meeting in emergency session kuwaits national council 
or parliament issued a statement rejecting what it called the 
iraqi policy of violence threats and blackmail 
it was the latest instance of bellicose behavior by iraqi 
president saddam hussein although until now his muscleflexing has 
been aimed mainly at israel and its chief ally the united states 
the accusations also represent a dramatic escalation in 
baghdads campaign against fellow members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries who violate production quotas 
opec beset by disputes over production levels and prices opens 
its midyear meeting in geneva next thursday 
the collapse of oil prices blamed largely on overproduction 
has cost iraq billions of dollars in lost revenue at a time when it 
was involved in the costly 198088 persian gulf war with iran 
kuwait which was one of iraqs staunchest allies in that war 
called the emergency legislative session to discuss the iraqi 
accusations and quickly began a diplomatic offensive iraq and 
kuwait have long disagreed over their border 
iraqs foreign minister tareq aziz claimed kuwait had drilled 
oil wells in iraqs southern rumaila field and pumped oil worth 
24 billion out of it since 1980 he said baghdad expects kuwait 
to pay it back 
we showed patience and prudence aziz said in a letter to 
arab league secretarygeneral chadli klibi which was read over 
official baghdad radio and on state television but things have 
developed to a level which we can no longer ignore 
the iraqi foreign minister renewed iraqs accusations of 
overproduction by kuwait and the united arab emirates and said such 
actions were tantamount to military aggression against iraq 
the attempts by the governments of kuwait and the united arab 
emirates to flood the oil market is a premeditated and 
deliberate plan to weaken iraq and undermine its economy and 
security he declared 
on tuesday saddam threatened to retaliate against kuwait and 
the uae with force if necessary for quota violations iraq has a 
1 millionman army kuwait with only 17 million residents has 
20300 members of the armed forces 
in kuwait city the emirates capital the 75member national 
council legislature was called into closeddoor session to discuss 
the iraqi allegation 
in its statement the interim parliament formed earlier this 
month said iraq should abide by the style of consultation 
understanding and conducting dialogue before hastening to 
spread charges against kuwait or attempting to cast doubt on 
kuwaits national and humanitarian stands 
the statement recalled that kuwait had suffered at the hands of 
iranianbacked terrorists for its support of iraq in the gulf war 
later kuwaits foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed flew to 
saudi arabia carrying a message for king fahd he also planned to 
visit other members of the sixnation gulf cooperation council that 
groups saudi arabia kuwait qatar bahrain oman and the united 
arab emirates the official kuwait news agency reported 
two other government ministers were dispatched to 12 other arab 
league countries including egypt syria libya and jordan the 
news agency said 
it said kuwait had begn a widescale campaign on the arab 
level to explain its viewpoint on the iraqi complaint against it 
gulf diplomatic sources insisiting on anonymity said saudi 
arabia was considering summoning the gulf cooperation council to an 
emergency meeting over the issue 
the sources said king fahd had conferred by telephone with 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah late wednesday fahd 
was expected to lead efforts to defuse tensions 
overproduction has helped drive prices down from the opec 
benchmark of 18 a barrel to below 14 in recent weeks 
kuwaits quota is 15 million barrels a day but it has been 
producing as much as 19 million barrels daily the uae has 
produced up to 21 million barrels a day in recent months more 
than double its daily quota of 109 million barrels 
iraq with oil reserves estimated at 110 billion barrels wants 
to eventually double its own production capacity to 7 million 
barrels a day and push prices up to the 25 level 
saddam said tuesday iraq had lost 14 billion because of the 
price slump iraqs foreign debt is estimated at 60 billion to 70 
billion 
in recent months saddam has been stridently critical of the 
united states and its allies for what he perceives as a concerted 
campaign to curb his effort to build an arsenal of hightechnology 
weapons including longrange missiles 
he claimed in april that iraq has binary chemical weapons and 
threatened to use them against israel if it tried to attack iraq 
iraq and kuwait have never agreed on the demarcation of their 
80mile border since kuwait gained its independence from britain in 
1961 at the time the iraqi government of gen abdul karim kassem 
refused to recognize kuwait and the emirate called in british 
troops for protection 
kassem was deposed in a february 1963 coup by the baath arab 
socialist party which insisted kuwait was part of iraq

volcanic activity in guatemela that was initially believed to have 
caused severe damage to the central american nations coffee crop 
subsequent reports contained lower damage estimates esther 
eskanasy a coffee analyst with cargill investor services inc who 
was raised in guatemala said there could have been no crop damage 
because guatemalan growers harvested all their coffee earlier this 
year 
the volcano had some activity but this is normal during this 
period of time she said 
eskanasy said coffee futures also were supported by technical 
buy signals and by news that it had snowed in santiago chile for

the nation was more dependent on foreign oil 
imports in the first six months of 1990 than ever before the 
american petroleum institute said wednesday 
from january to june the united states got 499 percent of its 
oil from other countries api said the previous sixmonth high was 
488 percent during the first six months of 1977 
in june the united states imported 523 percent of its oil 
the group said the country was relying on imports more because 
domestic crude oil production had declined and a inventories were 
built up 
edward murphy finance and statistics director of the petroleum 
group said the figures signal worrisome even potentially 
ominous trends in the american energy environment 
this situation is bad and is going to get worse said sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas realistically we cannot expect to 
eliminate our trade deficit as long as our dependence on foreign 
oil is increasing at this rate 
the united states produced 6 percent less oil than it did during 
the same six months of 1989 about 73 million barrels of oil per 
day were produced from january to june the lowest level in 29 
years 
without alaska oil production from january to june fell to 55 
million barrels per day the lowest level in 40 years 
while the country is relying more on oil imports it is 
consuming less oil overall consumption fell 25 percent compared 
to the same period a year ago the institute said 
part of that is due to unusually warm weather nationwide the 
institute said but murphy added this size of this decrease is 
larger than we would have expected given the slow but positive 
growth in the economy and the fact that petroleum product prices 
remain low relative to the levels of several years ago 
the institute said demand increased for only one oil product

safety and police groups asked the government 
wednesday to bar radar detectors in interstate trucks citing new 
evidence suggesting that as many as half the truck drivers in some 
states use the detectors as a defense against being nabbed for 
speeding 
eight groups including the nations largest trucking group 
signed a petition to the federal highway administration to ban what 
they called electronic partners in crime in all commercial 
vehicles in interstate commerce 
the only reason youd want to have one in a truck is to drive 
faster than you ought to said tom donohue president of american 
trucking associations which represents 4500 truck companies 
groups supporting the use of detectors criticized the petition 
saying the dashtop units protect motorists against speed traps and 
police errors 
the government cant limit a citizens use of a radar detector 
any more than it can limit the use of an amfm radio said jason 
richards of the ohiobased radio association defending airwave 
rights or radar 
a study by the insurance institute for highway safety which 
drafted the petition found that between 33 percent and 47 percent 
of all trucks and 37 percent to 52 percent of semitrailers in a 
recent sevenstate survey were using radar detectors 
tom larson federal highway administrator said the agency had 
received the petition and would review it 
the reagan administration rejected a similar move in 1988 
saying that such laws should be left to the states but the new 
petition includes a representative of state highway safety 
officials peter orourke chairman of the national association of 
governors highway safety representatives 
the climate has changed considerably said brian oneill 
insurance institute president a meeting on highway safety called 
by transportation secretary samuel skinner earlier this year in 
chicago endorsed action against radar detectors he said 
increasing speed is occurring on our highways and it is 
getting increasingly difficult for police to enforce speed 
limits oneill said when a big truck or bus crashes the 
results are disastrous usually affecting other motorists 
other groups signing the petition were the american automobile 
association the international association of chiefs of police the 
national safety council the advocates for highway and auto safety 
and public citizen 
only connecticut virginia and the district of columbia outlaw 
detectors in all vehicles new york has passed a law banning them 
in larger trucks they are legal in all other states with about 2 
million sold each year 
james baxter head of the national motorists association in 
dane wis which defends radar detectors and opposes the 55 
mileperhour speed limit said the petition was part of an effort 
to get all radar detectors banned 
he said there was no evidence directly linking radar detectors 
and accidents 
chuck hurley of the insurance institute said no study had been 
made of the detectors involvement in accidents but he said 
studies do tie speed to highway deaths and the new institute survey 
shows that truckers using radar detectors are more likely than 
those without detectors to drive faster than 70 mph 
the study was based on the use of a new detector that can 
identify vehicles using the units 
the institutes checks of highways in seven states showed usage 
of detectors by tractortrailer trucks ranging from at least 37 
percent in virginia where detectors are outlawed to 52 percent in 
delaware 
other results included 38 percent in maryland and new york 40 
percent for connecticut where they also are outlawed 41 percent 
in new jersey and 46 percent in pennsylvania 
another 7 percent to 27 percent of the truckers depending on 
the state were possibly using the units the study said

the senate approved a landmark civil rights 
bill wednesday night after the bush administration and democratic 
sponsors failed to reach a compromise plan to fight job 
discrimination without inviting hiring quotas 
quotas schmotas the issue is job discrimination exclaimed 
sen edward m kennedy dmass as the senate approved the 
measure 6534 over threats of a veto 
all 55 democrats voted for the bill republicans voted against 
3410 with one not voting 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater traveling with 
president bush in anaheim calif said the administration was 
disappointed by the vote 
well work to change it in the house we still want a bill we 
can sign fitzwater said 
in a written statement later fitzwater also said the 
president wants a bill that ends discrimination not one that 
starts a quota system 
the measure is the top priority of the civil rights movement in 
congress this year and would overturn five supreme court decisions 
the house judiciary committee is expected to take action on its 
version of the measure within days 
kennedy told reporters after the vote that the strong support on 
the floor for the bill suggested that the senate might ultimately 
override a veto this is not quota legislation this is 
antidiscrimination legislation he said 
bush has said a number of times that he wants to sign a civil 
rights bill but would not do so if it would lead to hiring quotas 
tempers frayed again on the floor wednesday night as they had 
earlier in the week underscoring lingering republican bitterness 
over the success of democratic sponsors in cutting short debate 
gop leaders retaliated with an adroit tactical move that blocked 
action on amendments sought by moderate democrats such as a plan 
to cap the amount of punitive damages that could be recovered by 
discrimination victims 
kennedy said he still would like to make a deal with bush and in 
any case hopes that the president will relent and sign the bill 
republican leader bob dole of kansas again complained that the 
bill was being shoved down my throat and renewed his warning 
that the measure would inevitably lead to hiring quotas for members 
of minority groups 
provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages for victims of the most serious forms 
of discrimination 
most of the controversy however came over a provision makaing 
it easeier to challenge employment practices whose effects fall 
disproportionately on minority groups 
the supreme courts decision in a case involving hiring at a 
salmon cannery in alaska held that such practices do not violate 
the law unless those filing suit can show they were not motivated 
by business necessity 
the bill would require the companies involved if challenged in 
court to prove that the practices were prompted by business 
necessity 
the bush administration said the definition of business 
necessity in the bill having a significant relationship to 
successful performance of the job would prompt employers to 
adopt minority hiring quotas to insulate themselves from lawsuits 
kennedy and white house chief of staff john sununu were hung up 
for weeks in efforts to reach a compromise on the definition 
every combination of words was tried sen john c danforth 
rmo said glumly 
we are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto 
danforth declared this is a bill that can do a lot of good for a 
lot of people and it is going nowhere 
nothing in the bill requires the use of hiring quotas but many 
republicans business critics say companies would be fearful not to 
use quotas under the measure it is a bad bill because it is a 
quota bill said sen pete wilson rcalif 
he said company lawyers would tell executives better make 
certain that your percentage of the workforce matches the 
percentage of available applicants 
sen alan simpson rwyo raised the possibility that companies 
might rush like lemmings into an ocean of quotas he also said 
the damages provision makes sure there are plenty of bucks out 
there to satisfy a few very very greedy lawyers 
kennedy said however that the measure would merely return the 
law to what it was before the supreme courts decision last year 
and it had not caused companies to use quotas in the past 
the false hue and cry of quotas is a disservice to the 
president of the united stateds a disreputable tactic by those who 
dont care about civil rights for women and minorities kennedy 
said 
bush had said repeatedly that he wanted to sign legislation to 
combat discrimination in the workplace but he said he would not 
sign a quota bill 
the last negotiating session between kennedy and sununu broke up 
on capitol hill at midnight on tuesday and bush himself enlisted 
danforth and two other moderate republicans to take a final 
compromise offer to the senate on wednesday morning 
conservatives also had sought to rally around an alternative 
version sponsored by sen nancy landon kassebaum rkan but dole 
said that it became clear that the measure didnt have the 
votes
