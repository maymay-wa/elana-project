one year after the soviet union 
withdrew its soldiers from the war against usbacked moslem 
guerrillas president najibs government points proudly to its 
survival 
but it is still a government under siege militarily 
politically and economically 
najib former chief of the dreaded khad secret police has 
confounded his most strident critics notably those in the united 
states who predicted a bloodbath and a guerrilla victory within 
months if not weeks of the red armys departure but at best 
najib and his sovietstyle peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
are survivors not victors 
the capital today is best viewed from afar early in the morning 
when it glistens under a dusting of snow 
up close its a city of warweariness and poverty where men 
women and children slog through slush and mud many of them 
sockless in cracked secondhand shoes and plastic sandals 
its a city where a 13yearold schoolboy like ismail can earn 
4000 afghanis a month pulling a cart loaded with bags of flour 
weighing three times as much as he does his father is paid 3000 
afghanis a month as an office worker at the culture ministry 
at the official exchange rate ismails earnings are worth 72 
while his fathers are worth 55 but at the more realistic black 
market rate ismail makes the equivalent of 8 while his father 
earns 6 
ismail competes with other young boys and old men for fulltime 
work during the annual novemberfebruary school vacation he boasts 
dubiously that because of his earnings his family of nine can 
afford a little meat almost every day 
the afghani has become an almost meaningless currency its 
dollar value has been cut in half in the past year while fixed 
wages have not changed its more appropriate to view earnings in 
the context of meat which costs between 800 and 1000 afghanis per 
22 pounds 
ismails wages are worth about 11 pounds of mutton his 
fatherss 825 pounds hardly enough to feed a family of nine for 
a month let alone buy rice bread and cooking fuel 
kabul salaries are especially sobering for the foreign visitor 
who plunks down 3000 afghanis to purchase a fistfull of notebooks 
and a dozen batteries 
militarily the afghan forces have expanded their control both 
around kabul and the countryside but guerrilla rockets still hit 
kabul every day although with less accuracy and fewer verified 
deaths than a year ago 
the government claims to have expanded its security belt 
around the city and pushed back the guerrillas since the soviets 
completed their withdrawal feb 15 1989 
our defensive line extends between 65 kilometers 40 miles 
and 80 kilomters 50 miles from the center of kabul brig gen 
gulbahar salim told reporters 
while visits to the front indicated those figures are 
exaggerated the government has indeed expanded its control 
not only did it defeat the guerrillas when they tried to capture 
the eastern city of jalalabad last year it has reopened key 
highways leading east and south of kabul toward the guerrilla 
strongholds 
proof of this comes not only from the statements of the 
government and foreign diplomats but perhaps more convincingly 
from the lush displays of oranges tangerines and pomegranates 
throughout kabul 
at this time of year afghanistan produces such fruit only in 
the warmer climates near the pakistani border guerrilla turf since 
the civil war started in 1978 between the sovietbacked government 
and the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
politically najib has spent the year attempting to convince the 
world he is ready to share power through speeches and the 
dispatching of envoys to both eastern and western europe 
invitations have been extended to afghan exiles 
there have been no public takers 
in kabul there is a sense of change in the peoples democratic 
party which seized power nearly 12 years ago and initially but 
unsuccessfully tried to impose marxism on a tribalistic and 
capitalistic society 
sources in kabul speaking on condition of anonymity say najib 
wants to rename the party to give it a less socialistsounding 
name the party has long been denounced by the guerrillas as a 
collection of godless communists 
such efforts by najib appeared to have been hurt this week by a 
change of leadership in the national front a purportedly 
multiparty umbrella group set up about four years ago 
the national front which the mujahedeen consider nothing but a 
pseudonym for najibs party and its followers on manday accepted 
the resignation of its chairman abdul rahim hatif 
hatif a nonparty man is afghanistans vice president and 
technically the no 2 man in government after najib 
the official explanation for his resignation was that hatif a 
businessman in his late 60s needed more time for his vice 
presidential duties 
more telling was the fact his successor is farid ahmad mozdak a 
member of the politburo and secretary of the central committee of 
najibs own party still the only real player in kabul politics

the general counsel of ronald reagans 
presidential campaign and his partners in a georgia housing 
development are to pay back nearly 720000 in misspent federal 
money under an agreement reached wednesday 
under the plan worked out between the us department of housing 
and urban development the brunswick city commission and developers 
of cypress mill plantation the developers will repay the money 
plus interest over 20 years 
the developers partners in brunswick housing development group 
ltd are edward l weidenfeld the washington lawyer who served as 
general counsel to the reaganbush campaign michael e yates of 
savannah and stephen m botnick of akron ohio 
none of the three could be located for comment wednesday 
the developers received about 31 million in federal housing 
money for the 6 million lowincome project a 152unit complex 
completed in 1987 hud officials found financial discrepancies last 
year and ordered an audit 
conducted by the agencys regional inspector general the audit 
said 757667 of the federal financing allocated for the cypress 
mill project was misused the money was spent on expenses 
ineligible under federal guidelines including some development 
costs related to plantation oaks a sister project in savannah hud 
officials said 
the audit followed an april report by hud inspector general john 
a adams that alleged mismanagement within the agency and 
influencepeddling by prominent republicans to win housing 
contracts 
hud officials said however the brunswick audit was unrelated 
to the influencepeddling scandal 
the developers the agency said had failed to put enough of 
their own money a required equity injection into the project 
instead improperly charging certain expenses against the grant 
subsequent review of the expense figures resulted in the final 
hud order for repayment of 718605 with interest and a 54000 
fee the total due hud came to 920088 according to hud documents

the united states and the soviet union 
will send home thousands of their troops stationed in central 
europe under a new deal struck by the two sides 
but the kremlin may have a hard time finding a welcome mat in 
the increasingly independent east bloc for the 195000 soldiers 
allowed under the agreement worked out by foreign ministers this 
week in canada 
even so the european continent will still be crowded with 
hundreds of thousands of soldiers ranging from those who are part 
of alliance forces to those in their own national armies 
its a very substantial reduction but its still a lot of 
troops around by historical standards said john cross deputy 
director of the international institute for strategic studies in 
london 
it will still be fairly densely populated with military he 
said 
under the agreement the soviet union and the united states will 
slash their troops stationed outside national territory to equal 
ceilings of 195000 in central europe the region covers west 
germany east germany the netherlands belgium luxembourg 
czechoslovakia poland hungary and denmark 
in a surprising concession the kremlin agreed to let washington 
maintain an additional 30000 soldiers outside that zone in 
britain and southern europe the united states wants the extra men 
to reassure its allies and make up for the vast distance between 
the united states and europe 
the presence of us troops in europe is at the express 
wish of the allies said manfred woerner secretarygeneral of 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
it is necessary due to the geographical distance from the 
continental united states and as a concrete expression of the 
american commitment to europe he said in a statement welcoming 
the accord 
to meet the new levels the soviet union will have to pare 
370000 soldiers from its estimated total of 565000 
the united states will have to trim 60000 in central europe and 
20000 outside that region from a total of 305000 troops in all of 
europe 
terms of the deal require that the units be disbanded 
the agreement will be part of a final accord to be wrapped up by 
years end on reducing tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms 
in europe the talks are between the 16 nato nations and the seven 
of the warsaw pact 
in accepting the troop cuts the soviet union recognized the 
changing situation in eastern europe where a wave of political 
reform has ousted longfaithful communist regimes 
the kremlin opened talks with new governments in hungary and 
czechoslovakia after they demanded quick pullouts of troops sent 
decades ago to keep them in line poland could also join the drive 
the soviets could well find themselves in due course in some 
difficulty in maintaining 195000 troops in eastern europe 
said cross 
richard fieldhouse a military analyst for the natural resources 
defense council in washington said the soviets are going to 
make troop reductions with or without an arms treaty 
the result he said might be very few soviet troops in 
eastern europe 
some 10000 soviet soldiers already have left hungary and 
czechoslovakia under a withdrawal plan announced in december 1988 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
about 52000 red army soldiers are still in hungary and 70000 
in czechoslovakia poland has an estimated 40000 and more than 
380000 are assigned to east germany 
marshal sergei akhromeyev an adviser to gorbachev said in an 
interview this week that the kremlin had not received a formal 
request from poland to discuss troop withdrawals 
once we have such an initiative on the part of poland 
this is not going to be a problem he said we are going to 
engage in the talks and have our forces removed from there 
analysts say poland may see a contingent of soviet forces as 
protection fearing possible designs on its territory by a 
reunified germany 
reductions of the red army in east germany will depend on 
security arrangements worked out for the reunification of the two 
german states but it would be unlikely that a huge number would be 
allowed under any solution that joined the eastern sector to its 
powerful western neighbor 
west germany has about 240000 american soldiers on its soil 
belgium britain france and the netherlands have sent more than 
100000 there 
even under the troops accord there will still be a substantial 
american presence in west germany moreover the agreement does not 
affect the forces of other nato allies 
germany is not going to be demilitarized of foreign forces 
said fieldhouse

the 3centuryold oberammergau passion play is 
eliminating some antisemitic stereotypes but an ancient blood 
curse still divides american jewish leaders and villagers in the 
small town in the bavarian alps 
the script for the 1990 production expected to draw more than 
200000 american visitors emphasizes the jewishness of jesus 
drops horns from the heads of jewish high priests and presents 
judas as confused rather than a cold mercenary figure 
we have tried to show the jewish tradition in a positive 
light said otto huber one of the directors in an interview 
from his home in oberammergau 
but american jewish leaders who have been meeting with village 
officials are concerned the anticipated halfmillion spectators for 
the play will still hear the passage from matthew 2725 that has 
plagued jews for 19 centuries his blood be on us and our 
children 
for 1990 we still have the same basic text with the blood 
curse said rabbi james rudin national interreligious affairs 
director for the american jewish committee 
the passion play dates from 1663 when bubonic plague ravaged 
the mountain valley where oberammergau sits when the roman 
catholic villagers vowed to stage a passsion play every 10 years if 
the plague abated the epidemic vanished in what was considered a 
miracle according to historical accounts 
the play to be performed this year from may 21 to sept 28 was 
last performed in 1984 when a special jubilee production attracted 
470000 spectators americans accounted for about 45 percent of the 
visitors to the daylong production 
since then leaders from the american jewish committee and the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith have sought to change 
aspects of the play they believed maligned jews and blamed them for 
the murder of christ 
among the changes for 1990 
jesus identity as a jew is emphasized including having him 
and his followers wear traditional prayer shawls we have tried 
to show jesus really as a jew coming out from jewish tradition and 
jewish faith huber said 
jesus has a larger popular following among jews and there is 
no longer a separation of jesus and his followers and the rest of 
the jewish community in light and dark clothing you had the good 
guys and the bad guys in the 1984 text rudin said 
there is no longer any connection between the temple merchants 
and jesus persecutors rudin said that connection was one of the 
worst stereotypes of the play playing on antisemitic images 
such as shylock 
the jewish high priests who presided at the trial that led to 
the condemnation of jesus will no longer have horns an image 
carried over from the middle ages 
pontius pilate who before 1984 was portrayed a noble roman 
and in 1984 was shown as ambivalent in sentencing jesus to death 
is presented in the 1990 text as an unsympathetic brutal character 
judas iscariot the disciple who betrayed jesus is portrayed 
as a confused character who lost faith in jesus rather than as a 
man motivated only by the 30 pieces of silver he received for 
giving jesus up 
rudin said jewish leaders are sensitive to the efforts made by 
the german village but while there were many positive 
developments the retention of the blood curse is very 
problematic 
the idea that jewish people have collective guilt for the death 
of jesus has been devastating in its impact on jews throughout the 
centuries rudin said a new script should be written in light of 
the holocaust and advances in jewishchristian relations 
rudin said american jewish groups are not urging a boycott of 
the play but plan to make available background materials on the 
play and hold briefings for people planning to visit oberammergau 
huber said the changes show oberammergau is very conscious 
about all the questions of antisemitism 
he noted the passage from matthew was barely retained by an 119 
vote of the text committee and with certain provisions that a 
fivepage explanation be included in scripts that tourists purchase 
to follow the germanlanguage play the explanation says the 
passage does not apply to one race and outlines the history of 
antisemitism surrounding it 
with all the changes i think that antisemitism is not the 
problem of the play in 1990 huber said

despite an agreement on european troop 
ceilings the united states and the soviet union are still arguing 
over combat aircraft and anticheating procedures for a 23nation 
treaty to reduce forces on the continent bush administration 
officials say 
the agreement reached by secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze at an open 
skies conference in ottawa canada on tuesday prompted us 
allies to begin preparing for a 35nation summit meeting later this 
year 
the treaty now in negotiations in vienna between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact would be signed 
at the session which would be attended by the united states 
canada the soviet union 31 european nations and the vatican 
baker is scheduled to meet next with shevardnadze sometime in 
the first two weeks of april in washington a us official said 
the talks in moscow last week and the april meeting are in 
preparation for bushs summit meeting with gorbachev in washington 
in june 
the agreement on manpower provides a ceiling of 195000 american 
and soviet troops in central europe and an additional 30000 us 
soldiers in such countries as britain italy and spain 
for treaty purposes central europe is defined as west germany 
denmark belgium luxembourg and the netherlands for stationing 
american soldiers and east germany czechoslovakia poland and 
hungary for soviet troops 
two bush administration officials at a background briefing for 
reporters at the state department on wednesday cautioned against 
assuming the treaty is about to be wrapped up following the 
agreement on troop ceilings and the start of summit preparations 
for one thing the united states and the soviet union are at 
odds over combat aircraft baker said in a speech monday in ottawa 
that moscows position would require nato to add 2000 planes to 
reach an equal level 
this is one of the major outstanding issues for everybody who 
wants to get this treaty done one of the us officials said 
he described the soviet response to the us position on 
distinguishing combat aircraft from defensive interceptors which 
would not be subject to limits as patently unreasonable 
the official said he could not predict the outcome of the 
dispute the positions are very difficult and there is 
substantial distance between them he said 
among other difficult and unresolved issues he said is 
verification or what measures to use to make certain the cutbacks 
ordered by the treaty are implemented 
as a matter of treaty drafting verification is a tremendously 
timeconsuming and difficult task he said so there is a lot 
of work to be done 
under the treaty ceilings would be set for troops tanks 
artillery armored personnel carries and helicopters from the 
atlantic across the vast expanse of europe to the ural mountains in 
the soviet union 
monitoring compliance is immensely more complex than dealing 
with the us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles that 
were banned in a treaty in 1988 the official said 
bush on tuesday called soviet acceptance of his troop reduction 
proposal as an important breakthrough that removes a major 
obstacle to the treaty 
now lets close the deal thats what i want to do conclude 
this cfe conventional forces in europe agreement and get it done 
and signed he said 
but bush said theres still some technical problems

vietnamese forces may be operating again in 
cambodia just five months after hanoi reported all of its troops 
had been withdrawn for good according to reports reaching top us 
officials 
the officials said wednesday the reports indicate renewed 
vietnamese involvement in the conflict was the result of 
battlefield setbacks suffered by the hanoibacked government in 
cambodia 
representatives of the united states and the four other 
permanent members of the united nations security council compared 
notes on the issue on monday and tuesday in new york where they 
discussed ways to advance the cambodian peace process 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and installed a friendly 
government after ousting the khmer rouge regime which has been 
held responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million cambodians 
during almost four years in power 
under heavy international pressure vietnam gradually scaled 
back its troop deployment and hanoi officials announced in 
september that the last of its troops had been withdrawn 
the vietnamese invasion touched off the formation of three 
cambodian insurgencies aimed at driving hanois forces from 
vietnam the united states and a number of other interested parties 
have been attempting to end the conflict through a process ending 
in free and fair elections 
us officials who briefed reporters wednesday said the chinese 
delegate at the new york meeting and two others commented on the 
purported vietnamese military role in cambodia 
the officials asking not to be identified indicated they 
considered the reports concerning the vietnamese presence to be 
accurate one participant at the new york meeting according to the 
officials said about 1000 vietnamese troops may be operating in 
the area of angkor site of temples and other buildings of historic 
significance 
it was not clear to the officials whether the vietnamese 
soldiers had returned to cambodia or whether they had never left 
if indeed the reports of their presence there are accurate 
according to the officials the army of the provietnamese 
government of cambodia has suffered setbacks in the most recent 
fighting against resistance forces of the khmer rouge and of former 
cambodian premier son sann the fighting has tapered off recently 
but could intensify before the end of the dry season this spring 
the sources said 
in a bid to end the fighting the permanent members of the 
security council have been discussing proposals in which the united 
nations would provide a peacekeeping force once a ceasefire is 
agreed to and to play an administrative role in the process leading 
to free elections 
the bush administration has said prevention of a khmer rouge 
return to power is a major policy objective nonetheless the two 
resistance groups which the united states supports have formed a 
tactical alliance with the khmer rouge prompting some critics to 
warn that us policy could be paving the way for a khmer rouge 
comeback 
the khmer rouges main backer is china which seeks to reduce 
vietnamese influence in southeast asia

historians say the world need not fear that 
german jackboots will echo again on european pavements but some 
still see the rush toward german reunification as a setback a 
step away from the integration of europe 
for the most part the historians say an east germany collapsing 
into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united 
german state 
the west germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic 
fervor but a perceived need to deal with a crisis said henry 
ashby turner of yale author of the two germanies since 1945 
there is no such a thing as indelible national character 
turner said i dont think there is any chance that the young men 
of germany are going to slip out of their adidas running shoes and 
pull on jackboots and start running around saying heil 
he was one of several experts in german history discussing the 
implications of reunification following the decision tuesday by the 
four world war ii allies the united states britain france and 
the soviet union to accept the reunification of a germany they 
divided 45 years ago 
university of chicago historian michael geyer a native of 
germany said he feared the creation of a strong sovereign 
nation in the center of europe could reverse a more important 
development the 40year drive toward an integrated europe in 
which industries banks trade unions and even government 
ministries have been collaborating across borders 
the east german state is collapsing said geyer so 
something has to happen very dramatically but they have a choice 
the europeans and germans and americans do they want to opt for 
the european card or for the german card i think they are opting 
for the german card 
i hear these days very little about what gorbachev called the 
house of europe he said 
the result of a dominant uncomfortably strong german state 
geyer added could be a setback to the diminishment of national 
borders it could also mean he said that american troops might 
have to stay in europe as a counterweight to germany 
if i had my druthers reunifications would have happened after 
1992 after the integration of the west german economy into the 
economy of western europe said charles j herber of george 
washington university expressing similar concern 
then there would have been fewer chances for german 
adventurers he said 
west germans were aware of their european neighbors misgivings 
said richard breitman of american university and so they presented 
reunification within the context of european integration they 
wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united germany again dominating 
europe 
even if the history did not exist there would be fears of 
that kind he said were dealing not just with rational 
calculation but a whole host of emotional memories 
for all that breitman said one germany is not only 
inevitable but given the successful record of west germany over 
the last 40 years my feeling is it is better than having a regime 
in chaos 
the only alternative to reunification added turner is an 
east germany in ruins a basket case a bangladesh of europe 
he said germans have no significant interest in territorial 
revisions those misgivings are misplaced 
gerhard weinberg of the university of north carolina considered 
a leading historian of the nazi era cautioned that reunification 
if mishandled could prove explosive 
while the people of west europe have gotten over nationalistic 
distrusts east europeans living in closed societies have not he 
said and fear of germany is a reality in east europe and russia 
he said 
i dont think the germans are heading for moscow again but we 
have to give people and the germans have to give people time to 
think this through and get used to it mishandled 
reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into 
starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it 
would end 
gordon craig emeritus professor at stanford said the division 
of germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which worked 
pretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to be 
corrected 
german reunification said craig gives the world the chance to 
build a new international system one that will prevent the use 
of international violence 
he added we have to be careful that we dont fall back into 
the kind of system that existed before the second world war a 
europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances 
rivalries disputed frontiers driven by what they considered to be 
legitimate reasons but pitted against each other the sort of 
things that gave rise to hitler in 1933

a limited choice of contraceptives in the 
united states is leading to increases in abortions and voluntary 
sterilizations according to a report by the national research 
council 
called developing new contraceptives the study released 
wednesday said americans have fewer contraceptive choices than in 
other countries due to government policies that discourage research 
and product development 
the contraceptive methods now available in the united states 
the report said leave major gaps in the ability of people to 
control fertility safely effectively and in culturally acceptable 
ways 
contraceptives are used at some point in the lives of 95 percent 
of the 54 million sexually active american women between ages 15 
and 44 the report said it said about 20 percent of this number 
have been voluntarily sterilized 
among sexually active men with partners at risk of pregnancy 
about 15 percent have had vasectomies 
limited contraceptive methods force many women and men to make 
difficult choices to have an abortion or to be sterilized at a 
young age that could be avoided if additional safe effective 
acceptable and affordable contraceptives were available the 
report says 
the 193page report said a greater availability and variety of 
safe and effective contraceptives could significantly reduce the 
frequency of abortion in the united states 
one recent study the report said indicates that as many as 
half of all unintended pregnancies resulting in abortion were the 
result of contraceptive failure 
about onethird of american women at risk for unwanted 
pregnancies use oral contraceptives with about 3 percent of the 
pilltakers becoming pregnant in the first year of use three 
percent of women use intauterine devices with 6 percent of these 
having an unintended pregnancy in the first year 
the report said condoms continue to be the contraceptive method 
for 17 percent of the partners of women ages 18 to 49 but it said 
about 12 percent of these women become pregnant accidentally in the 
first year of use 
for 4 percent to 6 percent of women the diaphragm is the 
contraceptive of choice even though this method has been shown in 
some studies to have failure rates of up to 23 percent the report 
said 
contraceptive sponges which have a failure rate of 18 percent 
are used by 3 percent of the women and vaginal contraceptives 
such as foams jellies and creams are used by 2 percent of women 
with a 21 percent failure rate it said 
the report said 44 percent of all american women who use 
contraceptives and who are married for 15 years or longer have been 
sterilized another 24 percent of women are married to men who are 
sterilized 
these figures confirm that at some point american women are 
ready to stop childbearing the nrc report said these data 
also suggest that there are problems with available temporary 
contraceptive methods 
the report said regulations by the food and drug administration 
and the risk of product liability lawsuits have caused all but one 
of the major us pharmaceutical firms to stop contraceptive 
research over the last 20 years as a result it said many 
contraceptive implants devices and injectables that are available 
in europe cannot be sold in this country 
many of the techniques now in use in other countries the report 
said are safer longerlasting and more effective than the methods 
available to americans 
rigid fda safety regulations which evaluate contraceptives by a 
different standard than is used in europe keep products off the 
market here the report for instance noted the fda blocked 
marketing of an injectable contraceptive in this country because 
the manufacturer could not prove that it was safe in the united 
kingdom however the logic was turned around and the product was 
approved after it could not be demonstrated that it was unsafe 
some companies have halted attempts to market contraceptives in 
the united states because of stringent product liability laws that 
can hold manufacturers liable for damages even if a product meets 
federal food and drug standards 
product liability rules can be changed to remove most of their 
undue negative consequences for contraceptive development without 
increasing the health risks of contraceptive users the report 
said 
the report was produced jointly by the national research council 
and the institute of medicine both are affiliated with the 
national academy of sciences a congressionally chartered private 
organization that does research for government agencies

a united germany will have 77 million 
people the two german states now have more than 500000 soldiers 
within a few years the economy of a single germany could 
overshadow that of any other european nation 
is the world really ready for one germany 
friends and allies of east and west germany say yes but 
many of them including britain france and poland have 
apparently not overcome their unification jitters despite german 
assurances 
the french worry that plans for european unity could be 
jeopardized and poland is preoccupied that german conservatives 
will demand some of its territory 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher supports eventual 
german unity but has recalled the nazi past by saying poland and 
britain have had experiences this century that we are determined 
should not happen again 
europeans are greatly concerned about the economic power a 
united germany would eventually wield said dominique moisi a 
french specialist in international politics 
in the short term there will be a slowdown of german 
initiative and power as the west germans digest east germany 
said moisi of the parisbased french institute for international 
relations but in five to 10 years economically we will be 
confronted with a very strong country 
in land area alone a united germany would be a sizeable 
presence combining east germany with west germany would result in 
a country of more than 137600 square miles smaller than france 
but still a considerable expanse at europes heart 
merging east germany with west germany would add 16 million 
people to the wests population of 61 million 
unification is apt to cause many discomforts for germans 
increased joblessness and factory shutdowns in the east and a new 
economic burden for west germans 
experts say west germanys rescue of east germany will cost 
billions of dollars but they also say that because of west 
germanys financial muscle it has europes mightiest economy 
and east germanys industrial potential the transition may not 
have to last too long 
west german companies like volkswagen are already launching 
plans to bring their technical knowhow to east germany and the 
signs of giant west german concerns like siemens could soon be a 
common sight in the neighboring land 
peter pietsch an economist at west germanys commerzbank says 
there are excellent possibilities for investment in east germany 
once freemarket economic conditions are established 
allies and friends of the two germanys have come to accept the 
inevitability of unification since the only other option would 
likely be east germanys collapse 
but fears about a united germanys strength persist along with 
bitter memories of adolf hitlers third reich 
polands prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on wednesday 
demanded his country be included in the newly agreed talks on 
german unification which are to include the two germanys and the 
four victorious world war ii allies the united states the soviet 
union britain and france 
president francois mitterrand of france has thrown his support 
behind german unification but also has words of caution 
according to french newspapers mitterrand said the germans 
must remember that we are bound together by certain commitments 
security in europe the future of the european economic community 
and the balance of power in europe 
concerns about a united germanys military stance also persist 
the soviet union says a united germany should be neutral while the 
united states insists it should be a part of nato 
west germany is one of the strongest nato partners with nearly 
400000 troops east germany has about 200000 opposition 
politicians in west germany have begun calling for troop cutbacks 
as unification nears but a united germanys military might is an 
open question 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has assured the world that 
german unity will present no foreign threat 
kohl says german unity will strengthen all of europe and will be 
a positive factor in the eecs plans for a barrierfree internal 
market by 1992 
moisi the french political scientist said european unity will 
undoubtedly slow as west germany focuses more on unification 
moreover he believes that east germans must learn a sense of 
european identity which he contends is shared more by budding east 
bloc democracies such as hungary and poland 
it is the duty of the west germans as they swallow east 
germany to give them a sense of european identity if they do so 
we will have a stronger europe if they dont we will have a 
strong germany within a weak europe said moisi

president bush has stressed eradication and strict law 
enforcement rather than education and treatment as the major us 
weapons in the war against drugs 
but bush was ready to show his three summit partners a national 
survey showing a steady decline in illegal drug use among us high 
school students 
he was expected to argue that the bush administration is working 
to reduce the demand for drugs a major concern of latin american 
nations that produce much of the cocaine and other illicit 
narcotics that are sold on us streets 
the presidents safety was a major worry in advance of his 
scheduled sixhour meeting with the presidents of colombia peru 
and bolivia at a heavily guarded military base outside cartagena 
there were fears that colombian drug lords might try to attack 
bushs entourage 
the drug war has been a major feature of bush administration 
policy but his efforts have been criticized as inadequate because 
the us narcotics trade is still flourishing one year after he 
took office

before president virgilio barco of colombia began an allout 
assault against cocaine traffickers last august most of his 
countrymen considered him an unlikely commander in the drug war 
an engineer and an economist by training the bespectacled 
barco 68 is a studious man with a halting speaking style often 
ridiculed by colombians 
barco was born into a family whose fortune was made in the 
petroleum industry 
a member of the ruling liberal party barco entered politics 45 
years ago as a city councilman in durania a small town in eastern 
colombia he was elected to the national congress in 1949 and over 
the decades built a network of political contacts in bogota the 
capital as a legislator 
barco served as colombias development minister in the late 
1950s was named agriculture minister in 1963 and was mayor of 
bogota from 1966 to 1969 in 1986 barco was elected president for a 
fouryear term ending this august 
polls have shown that while barco has he has gained 
international prestige for his hardline stance against drug 
traffickers many colombians disapprove of his performance because 
of their countrys economic difficulties

peruvian president alan garcias trip to cartagena was one of 
the last major acts of his rollercoaster presidency before 
peruvians choose their head of state in elections scheduled for 
april 8 
garcia vigorously condemned the us invasion of panama and said 
he would boycott the summit if us troops were still in panama by 
then when bush said us troops would be reduced to preinvasion 
levels garcia agreed to go to cartagena 
the charismatic young leader came to power in mid1985 and was 
hugely popular in the first years of his presidency strongly 
nationalistic garcia imposed limits on foreign debt payments 
pumped available dollars into perus languid economy and produced 
three years of growth 
but the economy faltered when the money ran out hyperinflation 
sent prices skyrocketing and garcias popularity plunged many 
blame his populist freespending policies for the economic slide 
which resulted in 2775 percent inflation last year and a 10 
percent drop in the gross national product 
the violent shining path guerrilla movement expanded during 
garcias presidency and has gone on the offensive in many parts of 
peru

a collector paid 55000 for a letter by george 
washington in which the former president thanks an author for 
dedicating a book to him but since he cannot tell a lie admits 
he hasnt read it 
charles hamilton a handwriting expert and autograph dealer 
said wednesday that the letter was recently discovered in an attic 
trunk in cincinnati and sold tuesday to joe maddalana of beverly 
hills calif 
in the twopage letter which washington wrote aug 15 1798 he 
thanks the rev jonathan boucher for sending him a copy of 
bouchers causes amp consequences of the american revolution 
and for dedicating the book to him 
but the man who supposedly admitted to chopping down his 
fathers cherry tree also admits he hasnt had time to read the 
book 
heres how he breaks the news 
i know not how it happened but the fact is that your favour 
of the 8th of nov last year is but received and at a time when 
both public and private business presses so hard upon me as to 
afford no leisure to give the book a perusal 
washington wasnt kidding according to john riley a research 
librarian at the washington homestead at mount vernon relations 
between the united states and napoleonic france were so tense at 
that time that the old general was officially reactivated briefly 
washington alludes to those troubles describing france as a 
nation whose intermeddling amp restless disposition and attempts to 
divide distract and influence the measures of other countries 
threatens peace 
washington writes that since he hasnt read the book it 
follows of course that i can express no opinion with respect to its 
political content an inhibition that if widely shared would 
have severely curtailed cocktail party conversation in the years to 
come 
but he tells boucher that there is no man in either country 
england or america more zealously devoted to peace and good 
understanding between the two nations than i am peace with 
all the world is my sincere wish i am sure it is our true policy 
and the ardent desire of the government 
washingtons declarations of love of peace hamilton claimed 
are what makes the letter probably the most important washington 
letter still in private hands 
thats debatable riley said he noted that peace is generally 
popular and he cited a 1789 letter still in private hands in which 
washington tells secretary of war henry knox that his impending 
inauguration as president makes him feel not unlike a culprit 
going to his execution 
dorothy twohig another washington scholar said the letter is 
particularly interesting because boucher was a wellknown loyalist 
who spent time in england during the revolution she said that 
although hamilton sold the original poor copies of the letter are 
on file in some libraries 
hamilton said the letter was part of a cincinnati mans 
autograph collection that was discovered recently at the late 
collectors house by his two elderly daughters the letter was 
framed and in good condition he said except for a small portion 
which was nibbled away by mice

question how does frequent flyer george bush 
avoid jet fatigue when he has a predawn flight 
answer he sleeps on his plane overnight in a heavily guarded 
airport hangar 
that was the solution bush chose in order to arrive refreshed in 
colombia today for a fournation drug summit 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs unusual 
sleeping arrangements had nothing to do with elaborate security 
precautions surrounding the summit 
its a sleep thing not a security thing fitzwater said 
he feels its the best way for him to get the most sleep without 
having to wake up in the middle of the night 
bush said he did the same thing a few times while he was vice 
president 
to reach colombia by midmorning air force one had to take off 
well before dawn 
bush decided to sleep aboard air force one in a hangar at 
andrews air force base md instead of waking up early to catch a 
helicopter flight to the airport 
bushs stateroom on the plane is equipped with a fullsize bed 
fitzwater said experience has shown that bush can sleep right 
through takeoff

employers use electronic devices to keep tabs 
on workers at an alarming rate that is increasing stress in the 
workplace according to a report released today by a workers 
advocacy group 
computers and other electronic equipment are used for several 
types of worker surveillance such as allowing employers to listen 
in on phone calls count keystrokes and gauge the amount of time 
workers spend on transactions said the report by a clevelandbased 
group called 9to5 working women education fund 
computer monitoring used to evaluate about 10 million american 
workers many times without their knowledge or permission has 
become a technological whip for keeping workers in line the 
report said 
businesses contend monitoring is merely an extension of normal 
supervision 
employer monitoring is a necessary tool for employers to 
review work progress said roger middleton an attorney for the 
us chamber of commerce 
he said monitoring is also used to train workers and promote 
those who perform well in addition hidden video cameras serve 
security functions he said 
sharon danann research director for the group that conducted 
the report said a certain degree of monitoring is acceptable but 
managers rely too heavily on it to assess workers efficiency 
supervisors seem to go berserk with this stuff it becomes an 
overboard effort at control she said 
the report included case studies of workers who had complained 
about job surveillance to the groups computer spying hotline 
that was established last year 
the studies showed computers are often used by airlines and 
phone companies to time how long workers spend on the phone with 
customers for ticket agents the computers show how successful the 
agent was at booking flights 
some hospitals require nurses to carry a small computer for 
logging data so supervisors will know how much time they spend with 
each patient the report said in addition a growing number of 
truck drivers are required to turn in printouts showing their 
speed the gears they use and the time and length of their stops 
it said 
surveys show that monitored workers are more likely than 
nonmonitored workers to describe their jobs as stressful the 
report said 
workers who complained to the hotline believed monitoring too 
often sets up an atmosphere of suspicion and results in 
heavyhanded and demeaning discipline the report said 
a woman who worked as a data entry operator for a manufacturer 
in minnesota said the firm used keystroke monitoring to track the 
number of invoices processed time per job keystroke rate and the 
number of errors 
i dont think workers should be judged solely by the cold hard 
data of a computer printout as a worker i want to be treated like 
a human being not a machine the woman said 
a software specialist who worked for a georgia computer 
manufacturer said managers could listen to any phone call without 
notice and tracked the origin and destination of phone calls 
hidden video cameras were in the ceiling and doorways of the work 
room and in the lunch room the woman said 
congress is considering a measure that would require employers 
to give workers prior notice of the types of electronic monitoring 
that would be used

a rise in farm income is helping financially 
pressed rural banks and other lenders recover from the tough 1980s 
according to agriculture department analysts who forecast further 
gains this year 
barring major weather problems farm sector adjustments in the 
last half of the 1980s indicate a more stable farm sector and 
agricultural credit situation in the early 1990s the 
departments economic research service said wednesday 
but the agency also cautioned that loan delinquency rates will 
remain high by historical standards because farm financial stress 
is still present especially in certain areas adversely affected by 
weather 
farmers appear ready to take on new debt for expansion after 
years of belttightening and paying off heavy debt loads that 
persisted through much of the 1980s 
the large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders 
appears to be over and debt is expected to grow 1 billion to 2 
billion in 1990 or approximately 1 percent the report said 
borrowing for both real and nonreal estate loans should expand 
in 1990 and creditworthy farmers should have ample access to 
operating credit 
as a result banks and other commercial lenders are once again 
focusing on competitive efforts to attract lowrisk borrowers 
the economic recovery in agriculture was also reflected in a 
drop in agricultural bank failures last year to 24 the fewest 
since 1983 the report said 
net cash income of farmers nationally in 1990 is currently 
forecast at 52 billion to 57 billion compared with an estimated 
53 billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 that is 
money left over from gross cash income after paying cash expenses 
however another usda method shows net farm income which takes 
into account changes in inventory values depreciation and other 
factors during a calendar year may be in the range of 44 billion 
to 49 billion compared with last years record of 48 billion 
for hardpressed farmers who may not be qualified for loans from 
banks or other commercial lenders the report said the farmers home 
administration could see demand for its direct loans exceed the 
supply but fmha guaranteed loans made by commercial lenders 
should be relatively unchanged from last year 
after steadily increasing throughout the decade the fmhas 
direct farmer loan program delinquencies fell slightly to just 
under 87 billion at mid1989 the report said despite the 
decline the share of delinquent loan payments to outstanding loan 
volume increased to 371 percent as loan volume dropped 
only 35 percent of fmhas 34 billion available for loan 
guarantees was obligated in the 1989 fiscal year reflecting weak 
demand and greater lending authority the report said

the national farmers union says drought aid 
was the major agricultural accomplishment of congress in 1989 
michael v dunn the nfus chief lobbyist on capitol hill said 
the 900 million disaster aid bill for farm losses due to last 
years drought was hindered by a dispute about whether the bill 
should be limited to winter wheat losses or expanded to include 
general crop losses 
at the end the comprehensive approach favored by nfu 
prevailed dunn said in a review of 1989 legislation 
but there were a number of setbacks including the failure of 
congress to pass rural development legislation 
it was the senate which passed a good rural development bill 
but the house which failed to get the measure out of committee 
he said

college students say they are concerned about 
the environment and many say it will be a factor when they vote a 
new survey shows 
the national wildlife federation the nations largest 
conservation organization announced the results of a poll of 500 
undergraduates in fouryear colleges and universities wednesday 
when asked what environmental issues they were familiar with 96 
percent named oil spills with acid rain and smog in second place 
at 92 percent 
when asked what the most pressing environmental problem was 23 
percent named air pollution 20 percent ozone depletion and 11 
percent trash and garbage 
acid rain was one of the least frequently mentioned at 4 
percent followed by loss of tropical rain forest at 3 percent and 
global warming at 2 percent 
three out of 10 students said they believed strongly that a 
candidates position on protecting the environment would be an 
important factor in their decisions as voters and additional 41 
percent said they felt somewhat that it would be 
tom hughes president of hughes research corp of rockville 
md which conducted the survey said i think its going to be 
one of the issues of the 90s if not the issue of the 90s 
this is a large group of people hughes said there are 8 
million in four year colleges and 5 million in twoyear colleges 
it is also a group with very very strong concerns 
three percent of the students said they were not at all active 
on environmental issues 32 percent somewhat inactive and 18 
percent somewhat active an additional 32 percent described 
themselves as neither active nor inactive 
however 76 percent said they thought there was something they 
personally could do to help protect the environment such as not 
littering reducing their use of environmentally harmful products 
and taking part in environmental organizations 
ninetyfour percent said they would be willing to pay more for 
products that are safe for the environment 
we are tremendously encouraged by these results said jay b 
hair president of the federation college students are 
expressing a deep concern for the environment and the overwhelming 
majority are clearly willing to do something about it 
sean captain of scranton pa a student in the georgetown 
university school of foreign service in washington described 
efforts to discourage use of styrofoam cups on the georgetown 
campus 
everybody complains about styrofoam but they didnt have time 
to get into it full time he said but when we organized a 
program to see how we could get rid of it how it could be done 
economically and feasibly we got support 
threequarters of the students said recycling of newspapers 
glass and cans should be required by all communities 
asked whether people should be willing to sacrifice 
environmental quality for economic growth 42 percent said they 
disagreed strongly 28 percent disagreed somewhat 8 percent agreed 
strongly 18 percent agreed somewhat and 4 percent had no opinion 
the survey was conducted in november the students ranging in 
age from 17 to 24 were about evenly divided between men and women 
the federation said the survey had a margin of error of plus or 
minus five percentage points

dramatic cuts in the size of us fighting 
forces phased in over the next five years would do little to help 
budget writers shrink next years federal deficit congressional 
analysts say 
the congressional budget office said in its annual overview of 
potential spending cuts and tax increases wednesday that cutting 
troop strength by one quarter by 1995 would save just 510 million 
next year from the bush administrations plans 
that would be a small fraction of the 365 billion the 
administration estimates it needs to save to reduce the fiscal 1991 
deficit to 64 billion as required by the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
the projection for the relatively small savings came as the 
prospects for an armed confrontation with the soviet union and its 
allies are dropping rapidly and as congress prepares to scrutinize 
the pentagon for budget savings 
the cbo congress budget analysis arm examined 160 ways to 
save money these included a twoyear delay in work on the 
superconducting super collider the research atom smasher planned 
for texas for a savings of about 100 million next year a 440 
million gain by slightly raising the amount federal workers 
contribute to their retirement benefits and a 16 billion boost 
by imposing a 50centsperpound tax on water pollutants 
in defense cbo studied a scenario in which the us military of 
21 million forces would be reduced by 500000 men and women by 
1995 the first part of the reduction would occur in fiscal 1991 
which starts oct 1 with a cut of 60000 troops 
the report said the reduction would save 70 billion over the 
next five years when compared to the spending that would be 
necessary to keep pace with the costs of inflation 
but that total is probably unrealistically high since the 
diminishing threat from warsaw pact nations has put pressure on 
president bush and congress to seek reductions in pentagon 
spending rather than increases 
the study acknowledged that making such steep reductions over 
just five years could cause significant disruptions the 
authors said retirements and reduced enlistments would probably not 
produce enough cuts making layoffs of career soldiers likely 
by reducing us forces by 250000 troops over the same five 
years cbo said 60 million would be saved next year from bushs 
current plans and 38 billion over five years compared to 
increases with inflation 
in his 1991 budget released last month bush proposed reducing 
troop strength by 38000 
the report said canceling further spending for the radarevading 
b2 stealth bomber would save 11 billion from an inflation 
increase 
limiting spending on star wars the proposed antimissile 
research system to just research rather than deployment would 
save 860 million from an increase with inflation and retiring all 
four navy battleships in 1991 rather than the two the 
administration plans to mothball would save 75 million next year 
the government would earn 28 billion next year by doubling the 
16cent per pack tax on cigarettes placing a onetime tax on motor 
vehicles based on the sulfur oxides and other pollutants they emit 
averaging 250 per vehicle would raise 19 billion in 1991 
of the 36 ideas for raising revenues cbo analyzed none involved 
cutting the capital gains tax rate a favorite idea of bush in the 
past cbo has argued that the proposal loses money in the long run 
bush says cutting taxes paid when real estate and other property is 
sold would stimulate the economy and produce more revenue for the 
government 
cbos options which the agency studies but does not endorse 
usually share the same fate that awaits most plans to reduce the 
deficit they offend one constituency or another and rarely are 
enacted into law

placido domingo and shirley verrett sang the 
title roles in samson et dalila when the metropolitan opera 
presented the saintsaens opera for the first time this season 
alain fondary of paris who made his met debut in 1988 sounded 
rich and authoritative as the high priest before the capacity 
audience wednesday night 
all three principals were singing their roles at the met for the 
first time in this production which dates from 1964 
charles dutoit conducted the orchestra which performed well 
the chorus which is so important in this opera sounded fine 
domingo sang splendidly making for a strong heroic samson he 
made final ringing phrases very stirring and acted effectively 
miss verrett looked absolutely dazzling however the weakness 
of her singing diminished the dramatic aspects of the tale she was 
so shaky that one wondered whether she could finish the opera some 
of her singing wasnt audible on the plus side she wasnt shrill 
and conveyed a honeyed seductive tone especially in the lower 
part of her register 
in act 3 zachary solov choreographed a hot dance for a couple 
in fleshcolored leotards kimberly graves and richardo costa were 
spellbinding never looking silly costa caused gasps even from 
people whod seen the routine before when he swung graves around 
and dropped her from the temple of dagon altar into the arms of 
other dancers 
michael devlin of chicago and john macurdy of detroit were 
excellent as the philistine commander abimelech and the old hebrew 
who warns samson against dalila 
but samson who had enjoyed a good look at her paid no heed

airlines are pleased with a study that finds 
only pockets of problems in the industry but theres concern 
on capitol hill some travelers may be paying too much in cities 
where theres little competition 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said the results of a 
ninemonth study of airline competition released wednesday shows 
deregulation of the industry a decade ago has brought more service 
and lower fares 
but the report also confirmed congestion and higher fares at 
some key airports 
deregulation has worked and the study clearly points out that 
competition in the airline industry remains strong with only 
pockets of problems skinner told a news conference 
the problems he said include increased congestion at some 
major airports and 187 percent higherthanaverage fares at eight 
hub airports where a single airline dominates 
if one lives in the pocket of a problem its serious said 
steve hilton spokesman for sen john danforth rmo a strong 
critic of decreasing airline competition 
hilton said danforth believes the transportation department 
study adds to evidence of excessive fares on routes where 
competition is minimal and underscores the need for legislation to 
increase competition 
the report shows that deregulation is not delivering to the 
traveling public fare benefits if you happen to live near a 
noncompetitive airport said hilton he said danforth believes 
it is intolerable to have an industry that is neither regulated 
nor competitive 
several bills are pending in congress to strengthen government 
control over airlines and encourage competition one would restore 
some government authority to regulate fares and routes 
only about 10 percent of the total passenger hours flown are in 
the higher fare markets skinner said passengers generally get 
better service including nonstop flights and more frequent 
flights for the higher fares he said 
air travelers have benefited under deregulation through more 
service at lower cost the secretary said how can you complain 
when 90 percent of people in this country today are flying with 
discount fares 
the number of airlines increased from 30 to 38 between 1978 
when airlines were deregulated and 1984 but there are only 29 
large carriers with eight of them providing 90 percent of the 
service 
the study which analyzed data from 1979 to 1988 brought 
criticism from a business travelers group and praise from the 
airline industry 
in terms of daytoday operations and for people who are 
really biting the bullet and out there flying i think there are a 
lot of problems in this report said margie crace president of 
the national business travel association 
she said deregulation has brought delayed flights lost luggage 
and air fares that are increasing at a rapid rate 
american airlines chairman robert l crandall said the study 
confirms that deregulation has created a strong vibrant and 
dynamic marketplace in which to compete 
he said it has saved consumers over 100 million in 10 years 
with a wide range of discount fares and has given smaller 
communities air service they would get no other way 
robert aaronson president of the air transport association 
which represents major carriers said the study underscores the 
healthy competition among airlines and demonstrates that there is 
no basis to reregulate the industry in any way 
a study conducted last year for the association concluded there 
was no correlation between high fares and the reduced number of 
airlines or the concentration of airlines around hubs through which 
they feed most of their flights 
the dot study however said fares at eight airports where a 
single carrier has established an operating hub averaged were 
higher than fares at other airports a more limited study by 
congress general accounting office last year also found higher 
fares in and out of hubs 
airlines set up hub operations to consolidate their operations 
at one airport saving administrative and maintenance costs 
the most concentrated hubs are minneapolis cincinnati dayton 
st louis pittsburgh memphis salt lake city and charlotte nc 
fares also are higher for flights to larger cities between 250 and 
1000 miles from these hubs the report said 
fares overall have increased 14 percent since deregulation but 
that represents a decline when adjusted for inflation the study 
said

at the same time the voters overlooked the years boxoffice 
blockbusters batman indiana jones and the last crusade and 
lethal weapon 2 
the nominations by the more than 4700 members of the academy of 
motion picture arts and sciences suggested that if independent 
filmmakers were looking for praise from hollywood they were 
looking in the wrong place 
do the right thing writerdirector spike lees fiery 
account of racial confrontation in new york city landed on 81 film 
critics top 10 lists and took the best picture best director and 
best music awards from the los angeles film critics association 
yet when nominations for the 62nd academy awards were announced 
wednesday do the right thing could do no right collecting 
just two nominations supporting actor for danny aiello and 
original screenplay for lee 
in a little way im happy in a little way im disappointed 
lee said we got jerked outta best director best film i think 
my cinematographer did a great job i think my editor did a 
great job i know in my heart that my father bill lee 
deserved a nomination for best score 
while do the right thing was financed and distributed by 
universal pictures the films inventive style and rough tone ran 
against the hollywood grain so did drugstore cowboy and sex 
lies and videotape both made and distributed outside the studio 
system 
drugstore cowboy a gritty examination of drug addicts on 
the lam was named film of the year by the national society of film 
critics it collected no oscar nominations 
sex lies and videotape the provocative character study 
considered one of the decades most successful independent films

look whos talking captured only five nominations combined 
batman costar jack nicholson wasnt nominated and music

driving miss daisy focusing on a difficult southern jewish 
widow and her black chauffeur carried off the most nominations 
nine including best picture and best actors for morgan freeman

its unification drive bolstered by the allied 
agreement in ottawa west germany is giving crippled east germany 
36 billion in immediate aid to tide it over until free elections 
next month 
another 1 billion will go to resettle some of the hundreds of 
thousands of east germans who have abandoned their homeland and 
fled to the west 
the amount of aid fell far short of what east german premier 
hans modrow had requested west germany made it clear it would not 
commit more funds until after the march 18 balloting the first 
free elections for a country founded as a communist state 40 years 
ago 
though the money is earmarked for specific east german programs 
none of it will go directly to the government of the communist 
premier who likely will be ousted by voters 
several east german cabinet members who accompanied modrow for 
two days of talks in bonn were displeased with how the delegation 
was received one described the tone of the talks as somewhat 
condescending 
modrow had requested 9 billion in immediate direct aid on 
tuesday but was turned down by the government of chancellor helmut 
kohl 
the twoday summit in bonn which ended wednesday was 
overshadowed by the landmark agreement in ottawa by the soviet 
union the united states france and britain that sets up a 
procedure for formal talks on reunification 
the agreement by the four world war ii allies that defeated and 
divided germany 45 years ago is the first step to a timetable for 
unification and clear recognition that such a merger is inevitable 
the talks will take place in two parts the two germanys first 
will discuss merging their economies and other domestic issues the 
second phase to include the four wartime powers will deal with 
the strategic and global implications of a united germany 
particularly its military allegiance 
during the talks between the germanys west germany has a 
commanding position because of its vibrant economy which will be 
needed to bail out the financially ailing eastern state 
west german finance minister theo waigel said wednesday that the 
government agreed at a cabinet meeting to spend 24 billion to 
modernize east germanys aging factories repair roads install a 
new phone system and other immediate measures 
the 1990 budget supplement also provides 1 billion to cope with 
the costs of tens of thousands of east germans resettling in west 
germany and another 12 billion for a contingency fund for 
unforeseen expenses related to east german reforms 
officials said the funds were designated for specific projects 
and would not be at modrows disposal to cover daily expenses and 
the east german governments mounting debts 
modrow whose interim government includes noncommunists and 
opposition figures lacked a consensus in his cabinet to reach any 
significant agreement on west germanys plan to unify the two 
countries economies 
modrow and kohl agreed only to set up a commission to study the 
issue 
such a step would make the mighty west german mark east 
germanys currency east germans are concerned about protecting 
their savings social security benefits and subsidized rents and 
are also worried about massive unemployment expected to result form 
such a move 
west germany has pressed modrows government to introduce 
radical freemarket reforms before pouring massive aid into east 
germany the east german government while making cautious moves to 
free the economy has resisted going further with capitalist reform 
the main stumbling block to a unified germany is expected to be 
a decision on its military alignment the soviets want it to be 
neutral while the west expects it to be part of nato the western 
alliance that includes west germany 
poland twice conquered by germany has insisted that it be 
allowed to take part in the reunification talks prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki has called for a peace treaty recognizing the 
present polishgerman border 
german unification became more than an oftspoken idea after a 
popular revolution last fall ousted east germanys hardline 
communist leaders opened the berlin wall and led to democratic 
reforms

congress is taking the first tentative step 
toward considering changes in federal deposit insurance an issue 
regarded as too hot to handle in last years savings and loan 
bailout 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee scheduled a hearing on the subject feb 21 saying 
wednesday congress should not regard the 100000 per account 
insurance as a divine right 
the hearing with federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman and general accounting office head charles a 
bowsher promises to be the opening shot in the most explosive 
financial industry question before congress in the next few years 
many private experts say deposit insurance helped encourage the 
risky behavior that created mammoth sampl losses but others fear 
tinkering with the insurance could destabilize the entire financial 
system making banks much more prone to runs by depositors 
last year congress did not even consider changing the 100000 
limit postponing the question by ordering the treasury department 
and gao to prepare comprehensive studies of the subject 
federal insurance of accounts up to 2500 began in 1934 over 
the years the limit was raised with the last big step from 
40000 to 100000 coming in 1980 
gonzalez said few people have bank accounts that large and 
questioned the public policy of government guarantees for the 
most affluent in the society 
coverage of 100000 was enacted under great secrecy in 
1980 and was never fully examined he said in a statement not 
only do we need to examine the absolute limits of the coverage but 
to determine whether the multiple accounts maintained by some 
depositors are unnecessarily increasing the risks to the funds 
congress isnt expected to act until next year after completion 
of the treasury and gao studies but already the battle lines are 
being drawn 
small banks in particular are opposing any reduction of 
deposit insurance they argue that no matter what the rules big 
banks would continue to enjoy de facto protection because 
regulators will bail them out rather than risk the collapse of the 
banking system 
two weeks ago budget director richard darman in the 
administrations 1991 budget suggested consideration of several 
sweeping reforms without endorsing any option darman listed a 
range of possible changes including 
scrupulously enforcing the existing 100000 limit and forcing 
big depositors and other creditors to accept some loss 
forcing all depositors to bear some loss through a deductible 
allowing insured deposits to be used for only a limited range 
of safe investments 
charging banks with risky investments a higher deposit 
insurance premium 
making the government the catastrophic insurer that steps 
in only after the failure of private insurance 
darman has laid out the system he would like to see and its 
very different from the system we have now said kenneth a 
guenther executive vice president of the independent bankers 
association of america 
financial confidence is a very fragile commodity and i really 
think if you begin changing deposit insurance youre undermining 
the stability of our financial system guenther said 
however president bushs economic report issued last week by 
white house economic adviser michael boskin says deposit insurance 
can encourage excessive risk taking but also has worked very 
well in preventing panics 
the only reform option mentioned by boskin is charging higher 
insurance premiums to banks posing a greater hazard to the 
insurance fund 
last fall in hearings conducted by rep frank annunzio dill 
chairman of the panels financial institutions subcommittee 
private analysts said the commercial bank insurance fund although 
solvent is dangerously weak seidman however has said there are 
enough reserves to cover foreseeable bank failures

black americans suffer six times more tuberculosis 
than whites do and one important reason appears to be a genetic 
susceptibility to the disease according to a study today 
the research found that when living conditions are identical 
black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the 
tb bacteria 
the relatively high rate of tb among blacks has traditionally 
been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty 
while social factors undoubtedly play a central role the study 
suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes 
we found that there is a systemic difference between whites 
and blacks said dr william w stead whites seem to be more 
able to fend off the organism without its ever being able to 
establish an infection 
stead a tuberculosis specialist at the arkansas department of 
health discovered the racial difference while analyzing health 
statistics from nursing homes and prisons 
its a very intriguing finding commented dr george 
comstock of johns hopkins university i never quite believe 
anything until somebody replicates it but i dont know of any real 
holes in this one 
at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
dr george curlin called the findings plausible and provocative 
however he added im scared to death that people are going 
to say this explains it all and forget everything else of the 
total six times difference what proportion is attributable to 
biology and what to social factors i would say that biology is 
relatively minor 
steads study published in the new england journal of medicine 
was based largely on a review of 25398 elderly people who were 
free of tb infection when they were admitted to arkansas nursing 
homes when they were retested at least two months later 14 
percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new 
infections 
prison data from arkansas and minnesota also found that black 
inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the 
bacteria while incarcerated 
another soontobe published study reports the discovery of a 
racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the tb 
bacteria which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone 
to tuberculosis 
about 22000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the 
united states resulting in 1700 deaths in the population at 
large tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as 
whites 
an estimated 10 million americans are believed to be infected 
with the bacteria but not sick the disease which attacks the 
lungs has long been associated with poor crowded living 
conditions 
steads study found that blacks got infected more readily than 
whites regardless of the race of the person who initially brought 
the infection into the nursing home in homes where the initial 
source of the disease was white 17 percent of blacks and 12 
percent of whites caught the infection when the primary source was 
black 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the 
bacteria 
this phase of the study also suggests however that infected 
whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks 
stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses 
against tb because the bacteria has long been common in europe and 
parts of africa north of the sahara but is traditionally rare in 
subsaharan africa 
by contrast blacks are genetically more resistant than whites 
to malaria which is common in africa 
in the other study dr alfred crowle of webbwaring lung 
institute at the university of colorado found differences in the 
resistance of germeating blood cells called macrophages in 
blacks these cells are more likely to harbor tb infections 
this helps explain why black people are more susceptible to 
tuberculosis than are white people said crowle 
at the turn of the century tb was the nations leading cause of 
death the number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until 
1984 
experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of 
the emergence of the aids virus which weaken the bodys resistance 
to tb bacteria others possible factors include homelessness and 
immigration of people from areas where the disease is still common

defense secretary dick cheney promised 
unequivocal support for south korea wednesday while bracing for 
a cooler reception in the philippines president bush offered a 
little free advice to corazon aquino who has pointedly declined 
to meet cheney when he arrives this weekend 
cheneys trip to seoul was the first leg on a twoweek tour 
designed to reassess the us military posture in asia and the 
pacific including talks on reducing the numbers of american 
troops and getting the allies to pay more for their support 
but with cheneys visit to manila still days away bush signaled 
his displeasure with the philippines president for saying she 
wouldnt meet with cheney after his arrival monday 
she clearly feels that a visit at this time might complicate 
the status quo there today in the philippines and thats her right 
to see or not see who she wants bush said 
my own view is that she can learn a great deal from dick 
cheney about the way we view the very important united states 
presence in the pacific bush said in an interview with newsday 
saying he would offer mrs aquino a little free advice bush 
said maybe you could learn from the man or he could learn from 
you madam president 
cheney arrives in the philippines on sunday after a stopover 
saturday in hong kong he also will visit japan before returning to 
washington feb 24 
upon arrival late wednesday cheney hastened to reassure his 
south korean counterpart lee sang hoon of americas intention to 
help support the south against any threat from communist north 
korea 
the us commitment to korea remains firm and unequivocal 
us troops will remain in korea as long as they are needed to 
guarantee the peace and the korean and american peoples and 
governments want them to remain cheney said following a review 
of a color guard by korean troops at the seoul air base 
cheney also offered assurances that there would be no drastic 
reduction of the 43000 us troops that have been based in korea 
under a 1954 mutual defense treaty 
officials traveling with cheney said he told south korean 
officials the pentagon wants to slash its forces in asia by 10 
percent to 12 percent at least 12000 troops over the next 
three years 
they said said some 5000 of the troops would be pulled out of 
south korea with an additional 7000 to 9400 being withdrawn from 
the philippines and japan there are 120000 us troops based in 
the three nations 
a senior pentagon official told reporters the secretary and his 
delegation also intend to ask south korea to increase its 300 
million annual contribution to the us defense to around 700 
million by 1993 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
expected the discussion to be a very difficult one for both 
sides and that no resolution was anticipated during the secretarys 
visit 
the official said he thought a final decision on any increased 
south korean contribution may not be hammered out until another 
round of discussions scheduled for fall 
the official said the delegation intends to suggest some numbers 
to the south koreans but he didnt expect a resolution until 
october the official said the asian nations hosting us forces 
are very sensitive to being pushed around about money 
the important thing is the trend are they moving in the right 
direction the official said describing the negotiations as 
sort of a kabuki referring to the stylized japanese drama 
cheney is slated to spend three days in korea meeting with us 
and korean military officials as well as south korean president roh 
tae woo 
he is also slated to spend a day traveling north of seoul to the 
demilitarized zone to observe the barriers separating north and 
south korea

the chairman of the house agriculture 
committee says the presidents proposal to scrap federal spending 
on crop insurance will force congress to restructure the program 
this year 
i say the program as it now stands is dead but not the 
concept of crop insurance with federal involvement restructured 
hopefully in a better way rep kika de la garza dtexas said 
wednesday 
de la garza said a bush administration plan to eliminate the 
program was forcing our hand into enacting reforms 
although president bush proposed scrapping federal participation 
in the multimilliondollar crop insurance program in his 1991 
budget the administration is now backing away from that 
recommendation 
president bush does not necessarily favor elimination 
cooper evans the presidents agriculture adviser said wednesday 
this action was a good way to get congresss attention to the 
need for changes 
there arent too terribly many happy with the way its working 
now including the administration so its probably just as well 
that they used the budget so that kind of helped us to work and 
come up with a better program de la garza said 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house agriculture 
subcommittee on conservation credit and rural development is 
preparing to introduce legislation to restructure crop insurance 
an aide said 
the federal government spends about 450 million to 500 million 
a year for its share of the crop insurance program as congress has 
been approving almost yearly disaster relief legislation to bail 
out farmers whose uninsured crops were destroyed by extreme weather 
bushs proposal to scrap the program appears to be unsettling 
farmers as well as farm belt lawmakers 
one complaint has been that the premiums are too high and the 
coverage too low the bush administration and members of congress 
say farmers have also been wary of buying crop insurance because of 
congress willingness to spend huge sums on disaster relief 
evans said the bush administrations believes the government 
cant continue to fund the expensive crop insurance program at the 
same time congress passes yearly disaster bills 
its fair to say on the administrations side that it isnt 
clear to us how a pure crop insurance program can preclude the 
congress from doing disaster bills when it sees fit evans said 
about half of all acres in production in 1989 were covered by 
crop insurance said kellye eversole executive director of the 
crop insurance study commission up from about 30 percent to 35 
percent in 1988 but part of the increase was due to a requirement 
that farmers receiving disaster aid in 1988 take crop insurance in 
1989 
rep bill sarpalius dtexas said members of agriculture 
committee have accepted the fact that the program must be 
reformed 
the question is how do you pay for it said sarpalius

the slayings were horrifying a couple and 
their two children bound hand and foot shot in the back of the 
head doused with gasoline and set on fire in their suburban dream 
house 
the motive was heartbreaking 
robbery 
the take a pair of womens sneakers and some underwear diamond 
earrings a television and vcr and 200 cash 
with one suspect killed in a police shootout and another in 
custody but not talking police remain baffled by the brutality of 
the slayings but criminal justice experts say seemingly random 
crimes are becoming more common in this country as a society 
obsessed with feeling good becomes desensitized to violence 
more and more we see criminals who are willing to use lethal 
force if necessary said james alan fox professor of criminal 
justice at bostons northeastern university 
to a sociopath even 5 could be more important than the lives 
of four people 
state police allege that robbery was the motive that led michael 
kinge and his mother to the large gray house in the affluent ellis 
hollow community the night of dec 22 
credit cards and a bank access card taken from the home were 
later used to make about 1650 worth of purchases at malls in 
suburban syracuse and auburn and to withdraw 200 from a cash 
machine 
but the robbers decided to leave no witnesses capt carl shaver 
said 
pillowcases were tied over the heads of dolores and warren a 
tony harris and their 11yearold son marc their feet and 
hands were bound and each was shot in the back of the head 
the harrises 15yearold daughter shelby was found in a 
different room she had been sexually assaulted before being shot 
in the head 
michael kinge who would have been charged with the familys 
murders died in a shootout feb 7 as police tried to arrest him at 
his dryden apartment 
his 54yearold mother shirley a petite woman with 
graystreaked hair was arrested and charged with arson murder and 
possession of stolen property police say she has told them little 
the involvement of mrs kinge a cook and cleaner with no 
criminal record remains unclear police said her fingerprint was 
found on a gasoline can at the crime scene but they have not said 
whether she took part in the killings or even if she was in the 
house when they occurred 
dryden town judge edwin sweetland on tuesday ordered mrs kinge 
held in lieu of 25000 cash bail or 50000 property bond on the 
arson charge but because prosecutors presented no evidence on the 
murder and stolen property charges sweetland said mrs kinge could 
be released on her own recognizance on those charges if she raised 
the bail for the arson charge 
michael kinge had run afoul of the law before the 33yearold 
sometime maintenance worker had a record of arrests for burglary 
and robbery 
after a 1982 arrest for weapons possession kinge told police he 
regretted not shooting it out with the arresting officer and 
killing as many police as possible said state police 
superintendent thomas constantine 
jack levin a sociologist at northeastern university and 
coauthor with fox of a book on mass murder said the brutality and 
precision of the harris slayings suggests a killer who took 
pleasure in causing pain 
fbi statistics show the incidence of violent crime rapes 
murders robberies and aggravated assaults has climbed by 18 
percent during the past five years local officials backed up those 
statistics 
weve seen more robberies more injuries during the course of 
robberies and more violent homicides where the victims are 
tortured said howard relin monroe county district attorney 
much of that increase is drugrelated though police say drugs 
apparently were not a factor in the harris killings 
officials also blame other factors violence on television and 
movies and the disintegration of societal restraints 
fox and levin say the pop psychology messages of guilt is 
bad and be assertive have led to a more sociopathic society 
in which people feel little concern for others 
for those who already lack the capacity for remorse who lack 
a strong moral sense of what is right or wrong this is giving them 
license to commit hideous crimes levin said 
it used to be im ok youre ok fox said now its im 
ok and youre dead

college students are taking six to 10 years to 
earn a degree according to a study that says only 15 percent 
complete a bachelors degree four years after high school 
the picture of the average american college student today is 
not the picture that many of us have in our minds based upon our 
own experiences 15 20 and 25 years ago said oscar f porter 
author of the study released wednesday 
its clear that completing an undergraduate college degree in 
four years is not the norm in either the public or independent 
sector he said 
the national institute of independent colleges and universities 
said the survey showed that six years after high school graduation 
46 percent of the students had earned a degree 
counting both those who went straight to college and those who 
took some time off after high school 55 percent had either earned 
a degree or were still working on one six years after high school 
graduation 
while students in the independent sector are more likely to 
have completed their degrees in the traditional four years than 
students in the public sector the overall degree completion rate 
offers little solace for either sector porter added 
among private colleges 54 percent of students who enrolled 
straight out of high school completed the degree in six years for 
public institutions 43 percent finished in six years 
the study noted a halfcentury of research has shown a 
remarkable stability in the fraction of students starting college 
who win a degree about 50 percent 
but institute president richard rosser said it took less time in 
the 1950s and 1960s however he offered no figures from those 
decades for comparison 
the completion rates are historically still essentially the 
same said rosser 
well probably see many more students taking 10 years to 
complete a degree he added 
the study drew its conclusions from the education departments 
high school and beyond data base a national survey of what 
happened to 28000 high school seniors in the class of 1980

singapore intensified its antidrug campaign 
today by extending the death penalty to cover traffickers in 
cocaine opium and marijuana 
execution by hanging is now mandatory for those convicted of 
trafficking manufacturing importing or exporting more than 106 
ounces of cocaine 176 ounces of marijuana 705 ounces of hashish 
and 26 pounds of opium 
under the new law possession of those amounts is equated with 
trafficking 
we have contained the drug problem but it has not been 
eradicated drugs are still quite readily available in the 
region said poh geok ek director the central narcotics bureau 
before the law was amended the death penalty applied only to 
people convicted of trafficking in more than half an ounce of 
heroin and more than 106 ounces of morphine 
we recognize the potential of addicts going for substitute 
drugs said poh that is why there is a need for stiffer 
punishment for cocaine cannabis and opium offenses 
the drug law was amended nov 30 by parliament and it took 
effect today since 1975 37 people have been sentenced to death 
under the law and 26 hanged 
home affairs minister shunmugam jayakumar said extending the 
death penalty would cut the inflow of marijuana and help deal with 
singapores drug problem 
narcotics experts said addicts in the country of 26 million 
often start using marijuana before switching to heroin officials 
estimate there are 9000 addicts about 85 percent of them using 
smokeable heroin 
by extending the death penalty to include other drugs the 
authorities also hope to deter international crime syndicates from 
using singapore as a relay point for shipments to other countries 
southeast asia is the main supplier of heroin smuggled into the 
united states and a leading supplier to europe most of it comes 
from eastern burma thailand and northern laos a region known as 
the golden triangle 
opium use has a long history in the region especially among 
migrant chinese laborers imported by the british who controlled 
the opium trade early in this century there were about 75000 
registered opium smokers at the time it was outlawed after world 
war ii

times beach has been a boardedup ghost 
town since the federal government bought up all 801 homes and 
businesses seven years ago and moved the people out after the 
discovery of dioxin 
now the government is finally close to building a huge 
incinerator to clean up the highly toxic compound and heal the 
deserted town a grim reminder to former residents of lives turned 
upside down by their evacuation 
the us environmental protection agency plans to burn all the 
soil that was contaminated in the 1970s by dioxintainted oil 
sprayed on unpaved streets to keep the dust down the agency also 
wants to treat contaminated soil from other sites in eastern 
missouri leaving it almost 100 percent clean 
it says the incinerator would be dismantled afterward but a 
vocal contingent of neighbors who fear for their safety is trying 
to block the incinerator which they say will become a permanent 
fixture 
its spooky said eureka mayor otis nelson how would you 
like to live next to it how would you like to encourage 
development next to it 
nelson is so concerned hes advocating that his town annex the 
neighboring wasteland of times beach to gain some leverage about 
what happens there even though it would mean increased liability 
we have no choice but to take that risk nelson said 
former residents of the community about 20 miles southwest of 
st louis just want the cleanup to begin which all sides agree is 
long overdue 
if this cleanup doesnt take place im afraid times beach is 
still going to be sitting there like it is today five to 10 years 
down the road said marilyn leistner a former mayor its been 
eight years something needs to be done 
dioxin an unwanted byproduct in the manufacture of other 
chemicals is suspected of causing disorders of the nervous system 
liver kidneys and bladder it also has been linked to cancer in 
laboratory animals 
bethann eichenser an epa spokeswoman said the incinerator 
plans were too far along to be threatened by lastminute opposition 
from nelsons times beach environmental task force 
nelson said his group opposed the incinerator to be built 
alongside the meramec river because it would be vulnerable to 
flooding and because of fears that the epa might not dismantle it 
thus making times beach the nations dioxin dump 
we feel that once this incinerator gets here itll never 
leave theres no doubt in my mind that itd be permanent nelson 
said maybe they do need a permanent incinerator but is st 
louis county the place to put it this makes no sense 
nelson said he has received support from other municipalities 
and residents a rally is scheduled this month bills have been 
introduced in the legislature to prohibit the building of an 
incinerator in a flood plain and within five miles of a school 
nelsons group wants the epa to either bury the soil in a 
permanent container or use a commercial incinerator that already 
exists in sauget ill across the mississippi river from st louis 
eichenser said work could begin as early as summer on the 118 
million cleanup which could take 10 years 
i know that there are many residents in eureka who say well 
its in our backyard but times beach is 400 acres of unpopulated 
land its a viable obvious location to do this project 
eichenser said 
people view incinerators like chernobyl she said they 
think its going to blow up and dirt will fly everywhere this 
would be safe 
the epa said the socalled thermal treatment unit would 
roast the contaminated dirt breaking the dioxin molecules into 
carbon oxygen chlorine and hydrogen eichenser said the treated 
soil would be 99999 percent clean and could be turned back into 
regular soil 
eichenser said the incinerator which would process soil from 
times beach and up to 27 other eastern missouri sites would be 
surrounded by a levee to protect it from floodwaters 
flooding is a big part of times beach which sprung up in the 
1900s as a weekend retreat for st louis residents 
the worst flood came at the end of 1982 rain had fallen for 
days but many residents were caught by surprise and forced to flee 
when the meramec spilled it banks reaching the second floor of 
homes 
many residents never returned days later the centers for 
disease control and the missouri divison of health announced the 
dioxin findings and recommended that the town be evacuated 
the town officially ceased to exist when times beachs alderman 
voted to disincorporate in 1985

dialaporn services could transmit to adults 
by telephone with certain restrictions under pending federal 
communications commission rules drawn to supreme court standards 
the services would have to require credit card payments issue 
access codes scramble their messages and ask telephone companies 
to list 900 calls to their services on customers bills 
the fcc is seeking public comment by march 2 on the rules which 
the commission first adopted in 1987 
congress concerned that the rules were not tough enough to 
prevent enterprising youths from gaining access to the sex 
messages banned dialaporn services outright in april 1988 but 
the supreme court overturned the ban saying the statute could 
apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene not 
merely indecent 
the court said the technological safeguards proposed by the fcc 
were enough to ensure that minors would not reach the dialaporn 
services and therefore the government was left with no compelling 
reason to ban such calls for adults

coalition wins the feb 25 election we are going to make the 
sandinistas pay the bills one by one for alleged violations of 
human civil and political rights

to disrupt the campaign 
after meeting with cardinal miguel obando y bravo the roman 
catholic archbishop of managua ortega told reporters late tuesday 
that about 2000 rebels had infiltrated northern nicaragua from 
bases in neighborhing honduras to disrupt the voting

elections fraudulent 
since they know they have already lost the elections they 
have this plan of saying there was fraud and the elections would be 
invalid ortega said wednesday he also said the army was taking 
action to neutralize any contra infiltrators

their promise to conduct free elections

payoffs according to the lawsuit which also named 32 present and 
former union officials including the unions international 
president john bowers 
in response to this shocking pattern of criminality ila 
officers have done virtually nothing assistant us attorney 
chad vignola said in court papers 
ila spokesman jim mcnamara was unavailable for comment his 
office said 
the 90000member ila has been under a cloud for years due to 
alleged mob domination in 1953 it was expelled from the american 
federation of labor for corruption 
the lawsuit named the gambino crime family and gotti its 
reputed boss the genovese family and boss anthony fat tony 
salerno and the westies a violent gang from manhattans west 
side and westies boss james coonan 
salerno and coonan are in prison 
gottis attorney bruce cutler denied his client had anything 
to do with waterfront corruption they throw his name around just 
to throw it around cutler said its a continuing vendetta 
gotti known as the untouchable don was acquitted last week 
for the third time in a criminal case 
instead of pursuing criminal charges the government filed the 
lawsuit in an attempt to remove from office ila officers linked to 
organized crime it also seeks appointment of trustees to oversee 
union elections and discipline ila officials 
the defendants also could be forced to pay back illegal profits 
were trying to take the ila away from the mob and give it 
back to the ila rank and file said james fox fbi agent in 
charge of the new york office 
according to the lawsuit the genovese family controlled the new 
jersey locals the gambino family controlled a local in brooklyn 
and the westies through the influence of the gambino family 
controlled the manhattan locals 
leonard newman the executive director of the waterfront 
commission of new york harbor said that despite numerous 
convictions of ila officials the mob bosses were able to appoint 
successors from jail 
out of office is not out of power he said 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said the lawsuit was 
needed to attack corruption as a systemic problem 
the case is similar to one the federal government brought 
against the international brotherhood of teamsters last year and a 
failed lawsuit concerning alleged mob influence at at manhattans 
fulton fish market 
the ila suit was assigned to us district judge leonard b 
sand who will hold a hearing on the case feb 26

a high schools 22yearold tradition of 
a fatherson banquet is getting a makeover mothers are now 
welcome 
the change came about after a quarterback at mohawk trail 
regional high school said he would boycott the event which for 
years was sponsored by the friends of mohawk football unless his 
mother could attend 
a lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers 
but they couldnt come to our banquet quarterback owa brandstein 
said it was blatant discrimination and just plain wrong 
after brandstein complained late last year the banquet was 
canceled but a group of parents stepped in and arranged the new 
event scheduled for saturday night with boston college coach jack 
bicknell as speaker 
in most cases whole families mothers fathers sisters and 
brothers are coming said stuart eisenberg brandsteins 
father what we are trying to do is not be divisive but 
recognize that we are a football family even the coachs wife can 
come

clean language have decided that this livingston county village of 
3400 will once again greet motorists with signs that read best 
town by a damsite 
the village 30 miles south of rochester had the slogan removed 
from signs last summer after some residents complained that the pun 
was distasteful but after the new signs went up other residents 
said they missed the slogan and wanted it restored 
in a vote tuesday slogan defenders defeated opponents who 
wanted it removed by a count of 34194 
i think it belongs there said resident pat crowley who 
voted to restore the slogan its been there for years and years 
and years and years and whats wrong with saying damn i say a

the challenge how to save as many trees as 
possible while clearing underbrush for a 13 million municipal 
complex 
the problem heavy machinery used to clear land often damages 
root systems which can kill trees 
the solution betsy the mule 
the mule doesnt make near the mess that a tractor does 
said wayne mabry the subcontractor responsible for clearing the 
30acre site 
he borrowed betsy from a cherokee county sawmill where the 
animal usually works to haul sled loads of underbrush from the 
building site to a shredder at the edge of the property 
i pondered on the thought of using manpower but that would 
have cost me a fortune mabry said being a country boy like i 
am i just decided to use a mule because economics made it 
feasible 
renting a light tractor and buying fuel for it would have cost 
about 2000 mabry said betsy works for 500 a month and a 
friend is providing room and board

ground controllers readied two new 
satellites for tests of a star wars plan to destroy ballistic 
missiles with laser beams bouncing off orbiting mirrors 
both spacecraft are doing almost exactly what we expected them 
to do said air force col tom meyer a project official three 
hours after the spacecraft were launched wednesday by a delta 
rocket 
meyer said that after several days of checking out the satellite 
systems controllers will be ready for preliminary tests full 
scale tests of both satellites should begin in a month or so 
one satellite carried a mirror designed to reflect lasers fired 
from a hawaiian mountaintop back to a ground target to test the 
accuracy of such a system 
the other held sensors for measuring how successfully scientists 
can correct distortions caused by dust moisture and gases as the 
laser beam shoots through the atmosphere 
meyer said the experiment was the most ambitious yet in the 
pentagons program to develop a spacebased shield against missiles 
he emphasized the use of groundbased lasers also called 
directed energy is just one part of the project also being 
studied are spacebased lasers and other weapons that would collide 
with an enemy missile 
a success in the current 313 million mission could help 
preserve the 45 billion that president bush is seeking for 
research in budget year 1991 for the strategic defense initiative 
or star wars some members of congress want to cut that amount 
in the missileintercepting project called relay mirror 
experiment two ground stations on maui hawaii will aim 
lowpowered laser beams simultaneously at the 2300pound satellite 
orbiting 270 miles above earth the satellite holds a 24inch 
mirror designed to point a laser beam with an error of less than 57 
millionths of a degree 
the experiment will use the first two beams as signals to orient 
its mirror when an air force station atop mount haleakala aims 
another beam at the satellite the beam should reflect off the 
mirror and strike a sensor target at the base of the mountain 12 
miles away 
the second satellite called lace for lowpower atmospheric 
compensation experiment will test a set of 210 lasersensitive 
sensors mounted on its side 
the mount haleakala laser to be used on the 3175pound payload 
has a special flexible mirror for distorting the laser beam on 
earth to compensate for atmospheric disturbances the beam should 
be sharp and powerful by the time it reaches lace orbiting 340 
miles high 
lace also carries an experiment to track the exhaust plumes of 
rockets to determine which wavelengths are most useful in detecting 
these plumes another experiment will measure neutron levels in 
space to help scientists develop a means of distinguishing between 
enemy warheads and decoys

a computer software tax in michigan brings in 4 million to 5 
million a year for aids and public health education 
in california white cocktail napkins are printed with the

six rear ends clad in a variety of dress from evening gown to a 
pair of blue jeans above the photographs the large black type 
says no ifs ands or butts 
below an admonition medical evidence proves that having anal

the aids virus 
a health department poster from rainy oregon shows a 
goodlooking man apparently naked under a bright yellow slicker 
with the caption good boys always wear their rubbers 
simple explicit messages seem most effective say state health 
officials although there isnt enough data available to know for 
sure what works best 
in michigan a wellfinanced educational program seems so far to 
be working said jan ruff deputy chief for the center for health 
promotions in lansing 
extensive evaluations indicate that 31 percent could identify 
components of the aids campaign she said 
the departments television ads promote condom use and the use 
of bleach to clean needles by intravenous drug users a highrisk 
group the campaign includes slogans like are you a big enough 
man to wear a condom 
it doesnt mince words ruff said there are always people 
who dont like it

the noncommunist government quadrupling 
earlier estimates now says nearly 10 percent of polands workers 
will lose their jobs under the crash transformation from central 
planning to capitalism 
it also says prices rose nearly 79 percent in january the first 
month of the marketoriented reform program it said the higher 
prices combined with smaller wage increases produced a 433 
percent drop in real earnings 
the announcements wednesday were the latest indications of the 
mounting difficulties facing the solidarityled government in 
trying to break with the damage wrought by four decades of 
communist rule and revive a moribund economy 
there are frequent news reports of forced vacations as plants 
suspend production and the government anticipates that 
unprofitable companies kept functioning by communist government 
subsidies will close 
the previous forecast of 400000 jobless was raised 
substantially wednesday by labor minister jacek kuron in a report 
to a parliamentary committee the official pap news agency said 
however pap said the new estimate of 17 million unemployed 
based on a world bank assessment includes a large group of 
employees old enough to get pensions and farmers also working in 
industry 
the total workforce is about 18 million of polands 37 million 
people 
last week there were about 55000 unemployed the report said 
the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza newspaper said wednesday that 
a survey of 500 enterprises in an industrial region of southern 
poland found 25000 workers were expected to be dismissed in the 
first half of 1990 
the newspaper said the largest layoffs were planned in the 
mining industry and that several mines were considering bankruptcy 
the new economic policies that went into effect jan 1 force 
governmentrun enterprises to become selfsufficient while 
absorbing huge increases in the prices of gas electricity and 
other costs no longer kept artificially low by subsidies 
the price of food increased 79 percent and nonfood articles by 
72 percent during january the statistics office said 
a 149 percent increase in the price of services stemmed from 
higher rents and increased charges for heat electricity 
transportation and telecommunications the report said 
the statistics office of the 5monthold solidarityled 
government reported some leveling of prices and even decreases 
were noted toward months end as the drive continued to turn the 
centrally controlled socialist economy into a marketdriven system 
higher prices have forced down demand which is causing a drop 
in production 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has asked for the freezing of 
the polish debt to the governments informally represented by the 
paris club which totals about 30 billion of the nearly 40 
billion owed to the west 
mazowiecki who in august became the first noncommunist to head 
an east bloc government said the foreign debt burden is the most 
critical factor in polands effort to emerge from economic crisis

coretta scott king urged a peaceful dismantling 
of apartheid but an african national congress leader at her side 
warned of a struggle that would make the french revolution look 
like a childrens picnic if negotiations with the south african 
government fail 
the comments came during a torchlighting ceremony wednesday at 
the crypt of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr in 
celebration of the release of anc leader nelson mandela 
i hope and pray that the antiapartheid movement in south 
africa will be able to adhere to the nonviolent strategy that has 
begun to produce the historic reforms we have witnessed in recent 
months mrs king said 
if the south african people cannot come together im afraid 
to think of what is going to happen the french revolution would 
look like a childrens picnic said anc member sifiso makhathini 
mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 along with 
seven of his anc colleagues for their role in a conspiracy to 
overthrow the minority white government by force despite the 
promise of negotiations with the government mandela continues to 
support the ancs armed struggle 
asked how the anc has managed to maintain mrs kings support in 
light of her fierce opposition to the use of violence makhathini 
said they understand our history they understand why we had to 
take up arms they know for decades and decades we were involved in 
a nonviolent struggle 
the activists however were in unanimous agreement that 
stronger stiffer sanctions should be enacted until the south 
african government lifts the 3yearold state of emergency and 
releases all political prisoners unconditionally

a us congressional commission 
contends the salvadoran government has not yet fully investigated 
important leads and allegations in the november massacre of six 
jesuit priests 
rep joe moakley dmass commended president alfredo 
cristianis government for good police work in the technical 
aspects of the investigation 
but the commission led by moakley said wednesday that doubts 
remain as to whether the people who planned the slayings have been 
identified even though a salvadoran army colonel has been arrested 
it also said some members of the armed forces may have conspired 
to protect others implicated in the killings 
the investigation is not over and important leads and 
allegations remain to be fully investigated said a threepage 
statement read by moakley at a news conference the 14person 
delegation was on a fourday visit to el salvador to evaluate the 
governments investigation of the jesuit killings 
before dawn on nov 16 five days after leftist rebels launched 
their biggest offensive of the 10yearold civil war a contingent 
of 30 soldiers from the elite ustrained atlacatl infantry 
battalion raided the campus of the jesuitrun central american 
university 
the soldiers awakened the rector rev ignacio ellacuria the 
vicerector rev ignacio martinbaro and four other 
priestprofessors as well as the domestic servant and her 
15yearold daughter five of the six priests were taken to the 
yard behind their residence ordered to lay facedown and shot in 
the head according to accounts from witnesses and court documents 
the sixth priest was killed inside as were the housekeeper and 
her daughter 
an army colonel three lieutenants and five soldiers have been 
charged with murder in the case col guillermo benavides one of 
the accused became the highestranking salvadoran soldier indicted 
on a human rightsrelated charge 
the salvadoran roman catholic hierarchy and the society of jesus 
have expressed concern that benavides may be a scapegoat for other 
highranking officers who might have been involved 
in el salvador jesuit intellectuals have for years been 
considered subversives by the far right 
moakley said that a central question is whether the human 
rights problems in el salvador including the jesuit killings are 
the actions of a few renegade military figures or whether they stem 
from attitudes and actions that go to the very heart of the armed 
forces and other major institutions in this country 
encouraging genuine change in these institutions remains the 
greatest challenge facing el salvador a challenge that despite 
enormous investments of money and effort has not yet been fully 
met the us official said 
the united states has provided more than 4 billion in economic 
and military aid to el salvador in the past decade 
several senators have proposed legislation that would condition 
further aid on improvement of the governments human rights record 
and progress toward a negotiated peace

defense secretary dick cheney told 
south korean officials the pentagon wants to slash its forces in 
asia by 10 percent to 12 percent at least 12000 troops over 
the next three years us officials said today 
cheney said some 5000 of the troops would be pulled out of 
south korea with an additional 7000 to 9400 being withdrawn from 
the philippines and japan officials said there are 120000 us 
troops based in the three nations 
we arent going to move precipitously our commitment 
remains strong cheney said at a news conference the threat 
remains undiminished 
cheney is on a twoweek tour of asian nations that hosting us 
forces south korea japan and the philippines to respond to 
congressional demands for a reassessment of the us military role 
in the pacific 
he met today with south korean president roh taewoo and defense 
minister lee sanghoon to discuss us troop cutbacks and increased 
burden sharing for the upkeep of us forces based in south korea 
lee speaking at the same press conference said his country had 
accepted in principal the gradual cutback in troop strength of 
the noncombatant us forces he pledged to work with us 
military officials to work out the precise numbers and details of 
the drawdown 
cheney also said progress was made in the talks on the issue of 
turning command of the joint uskorea military structure over to 
a south korean general operational control of the majority of 
south koreas 600000 forces now is under the senior us 
commander a fourstar general 
we talked about the us playing more of a supportive role as 
the rok south korea takes the lead cheney said 
the korean minister asked about a possible withdrawal of 5000 
us troops said the exact numbers would be determined by the 
military commanders of both nations 
the minister also pledged to give positive consideration to 
increasing payments for sharing costs for the us forces in korea 
cheney did not personally refer to the 10 percent to 12 percent 
us troop reduction in asia that was given earlier by us 
officials but noted that the republic of korea was only one of 
several nations being asked to increase its contributions 
primarily due to congressional pressure 
korea has by no means been singled out in this process 
cheney said 
cheney wants seoul to nearly double its 300 million annual 
contribution to support the 45000 american troops over the next 
three years officials said 
prior to the news conference an american official familiar with 
the discussions said the koreans reacted with horror to the 
suggestion of a us troop reduction 
mr cheney is laying out what we would like to see done 
said the us official who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified by name were laying out goals its the first step 
in consultations with the korean government to see what wed like 
to have happen 
he said the koreans were horrified at first because they believe 
any cutback in american soldiers would be the first step in a total 
us troop withdrawal and the american security blanket is gone 
cheney is telling the koreans that congress would make sharper 
cuts if south korea does not assume a greater role in its own 
defense some lawmakers have suggested dropping the us troop 
level to 10000 men and women 
the seoul government has balked at suggestions that it pay more 
for such things as libraries theaters and pool halls to make life 
easier for us troops because they provide none of those things 
for their own 680000 military personnel the official said 
us lawmakers are unhappy that the united states spends around 
24 billion a year on us troops on the korean peninsula while 
south korea enjoys a trade surplus with the united states 
the official in the cheney party said he expected the koreans to 
raise their contribution by about 30 million this year but that 
us officials hoped to put the korean government on a path for a 
substantial increase over the coming years 
the official said he wouldnt argue with reports that estimate 
the united states will call for the koreans to increase their 300 
million contribution to nearly 700 million by 1993 
by south korean estimates seoul contributes nearly 2 billion 
annually to the us forces in south korea the pentagon places its 
contribution at around 300 million 
the koreans count such things as rentfree use of land for 
military installations

one of the first acts of a school 
superintendent reinstated after his suspension sparked racial 
protests was to suspend 86 high school students for chanting civil 
rights slogans in a school cafeteria 
norward roussell the superintendent also said wednesday he 
would file a lawsuit against the white majority school board that 
voted not to renew his contract in december 
roussell who is black said the lawsuit would allege racial 
discrimination 
most of the black students who were suspended had taken part in 
disruptive protests outside selma high school on tuesday when all 
11 public schools reopened for the first time since they began 
closing feb 6 roussell said 
he was restored as superintendent that day his dismissal a week 
earlier led to protests but his restoration failed to immediately 
end the turmoil as the student protesters called for a renewal of 
his threeyear contract which ends in june 
james carter an aide to roussell said attendance was 92 
percent for the school system wednesday about 23 percent missed 
classes when they resumed tuesday 
students passed through a metal detector at selma high where 
national guardsmen state troopers and selma police provided 
security and school officials worked to bring school operations 
back to normal 
roussell said expulsions may be in store for some of the 
students who began chanting during the first lunch period and 
continued in the second period with a slogan they had used marching 
to school tuesday 
the only way were going to solve our problem in selma is to 
cut the rotten core out of the apple city attorney henry pitts 
said of the suspensions 
officials said 143 students about 2 percent of the 
6000student public school system have withdrawn since classes 
resumed tuesday the city is 52 percent black and its public school 
system is about 70 percent black

robot by an infatuated doll named jodi ended just before 
valentines day when toby learned that jodi had gone to the big 
dollhouse in the sky 
tobys owner jim barclay a printer and handyman at a medical 
clinic said the last of a string of cards and letters arrived 
monday with the bad news that jodi died in a headon collision on 
the way from royal oak mich to the north pole 
i had tears in my eyes when i started reading that letter 
barclay said wednesday his wife margene started crying too 
he said 
toby seemed to lose his juice 
he is just standing over there with a blank stare on his face 
with his black arm band on barclay said of the batterypowered 
18inchtall robot 
of the practical jokers behind the correspondence mrs barclay 
swears it isnt her barclay said maybe now somebody will come 
forward 
the romance began when barclay came to work one morning before 
christmas 1988 and found the goldtoned robot propped in his chair 
the note attached to toby said he was a gift from santa 
soon after jodi began sending toby cards and letters 
expressing her longing for the time they would be reunited at 
santas workshop 
the missives arrived about once a month from across the country 
with each card the barclays and the 50 other employees at the 
clinic became more curious about the identity of jodi and of the 
architect of the elaborate scheme 
interest hit a peak when the barclays received a hefty ham this 
past christmas from jodi and toby no one could figure out how the 
lovebirds got the gift into barclays locked car 
no one expected the romance to come to such a sad ending 
i thought we would come in here someday and toby would be gone 
and then we would get pictures of them on the beach at waikiki 
wearing bikinis and grass skirts barclay said 
while jodis death has brought an end to the romance it 
answered a few questions that had nagged at the barclays 
they had assumed that jodi was a robot like toby but the death 
notice included photographs that revealed her to be a redhaired 
bespectacled cabbage patch doll she posed with the nutty 
television alien alf her cabbage patch sister lori a stuffed 
pony corky and a stuffed dog named porky 
the photos and letter were all sent by jackie described as 
a friend of jodi 
barclay dismissed bets by his coworkers at a medical clinic 
that the correspondent would convince cabbage patch sister lori to 
pick up the romance where jodi left it 
jodis death means they are trying to bring it to an end

the government has decided to 
partially lift emergency regulations including a law that allows 
security forces to dispose of bodies without inquest a senior 
minister said today 
the announcement came hours after amnesty international harshly 
criticized the restrictions and said thousands of people had 
disappeared or were murdered by the government forces and death 
squads last year 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters six emergency 
regulations imposed in june would be repealed at midnight they 
involve restrictions on publications political parties and travel 
on rail and public tranport 
president ranasinghe premadasa assured rival politicians on 
wednesday that he would revoke some of the emergency rules imposed 
to try to quell a 2yearold uprising by ultranationalist sinhalese 
extremists 
more than 6000 people have been killed in the fighting in south 
and central sri lanka 
a separatist rebellion by minority tamils in the north and east 
has cost 11000 lives since 1983 sinhalese militants began 
attacking the sinhalesedominated government when it tried to make 
peace with the tamil rebels contending it was making too many 
concessions 
the emergency regulations which need the approval of parliament 
each month give broad powers to security forces to search arrest 
or detain suspects for indefinite periods 
amnesty international said reports of killings increased sharply 
after emergency regulations were introduced 
in a report released today the londonbased human rights group 
said also said indian peacekeeping troops in sri lanka were 
reported to have committed extrajudicial executions and there 
were numerous allegations of torture of prisoners by members of the 
indian force 
sri lankan and indian officials had no direct comment on the 
report 
indian soldiers arrived in sri lanka 2 years ago to supervise 
an arms surrender by tamil separatists under a pact signed in july 
1987 
most groups gave up their weapons but the dominant liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam reneged on the peace plan 
the indian troops who were supposed to maintain law and order 
in the strifetorn northern and eastern provinces instead fought 
the tamil tigers at least 1100 soldiers died in the fighting 
the presence of the indian troops and the peace accord sparked a 
sinhalese backlash indian forces started leaving sri lanka last 
year and the last troops are to be gone by march 31 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim they are denied jobs and education by the sinhalese who 
comprise 75 percent of the population

chancellor helmut kohl told parliament 
today that unification will begin to take shape quickly after east 
germanys elections and that no nato troops should be stationed on 
what is now east german soil 
it was one of the stormiest parliamentary sessions in recent 
memory with kohl accusing his political opponents of being too 
close to the disgraced east germany communist party in years past 
the opposition social democrats responded with hoots and 
shouting and parliaments president rita suessmuth harshly 
admonished the lawmakers 
west germany is to hold national elections in december and the 
social democrats decisively defeated kohls party in recent state 
elections the rival parties are also vying to win support among 
the east german electorate 
kohl laid out to parliament the results of his talks over the 
weekend with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and on tuesday 
and wednesday with hans modrow east germanys communist premier 
never before since the division of our land have we been 
so close to our goal the unity of all germans in freedom as we 
are today kohl told parliament 
he said he and gorbachev had agreed on the singular importance 
of east germanys march 18 elections 
i was able to underscore my firm belief that the result of the 
elections will not only be a democratic and negotiationscapable 
government but also a government program with the clear goal 
unity as soon as possible 
kohl vowed that the security concerns of neighboring states 
will not be ignored on the road to german unification he 
reiterated his position that a united germany must be a nato member 
and not demilitarized and that germany will remain committed to 
european integration 
the history of this century shows nothing is more detrimental 
to european stability than a germany that swings between two 
worlds between east and west said kohl referring to world war 
ii 
the imperative stability factor needed in the middle of europe 
is a free and democratic germany as part of a secure alliance and 
a growing political and economic integretation within the european 
community said kohl 
the chancellor seemed to be addressing concerns among many 
europeans that a united germany could derail attempts to create 
closer european unity or seek to reclaim land ceded to poland 
after world war ii 
kohl also said he favors keeping any nato troops off the 
territory of what is now east germany 
the soviet union has insisted that a united germany be neutral 
a demand rejected by the united states and its alliance partners 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister has 
proposed that as a compromise nato troops not be allowed on what is 
now east german turf 
kohls address was interrupted several times as he condemned the 
social democrats for having close contacts with east germanys 
communists during years past 
you were allied with these people said kohl 
hansjochen vogel head of the social democrats fired back by 
reminding kohl that his christian democrats are now supporting the 
east german christian democrats who for years were allied with the 
communists 
mister chanceller whoever supports the east cdu which for 
40 years went along with everything the communists said has no 
right to point the finger at the social democrats said vogel

housetohouse fighting was 
reported today between eritrean rebels and government troops 
battling for control of the red sea port of massawa 
the staterun ethiopian news agency called the fighting 
ferocious and said both sides had suffered heavy casualties 
since the eritrean peoples liberation front last week launched its 
first offensive in more than a year 
the agency gave no casualty figures for combatants or civilians 
but the relief and rehabilitation commission a government agency 
said the fighting had created a dangerous situation with a likely 
massive loss of life in the northern provinces of eritrea and 
tigre 
massawa ethiopias main port is the gateway for all goods 
going to the two provinces hundreds of thousands of tons of 
emergency relief food pass through it annually to feed people 
threatened by famine caused by drought and aggravated by civil war 
the united nations hoped to ship 11 million tons of emergency 
food through massawa in the next few months to feed an estimated 4 
million people mainly in eritrea and tigre 
the eritrean rebels claimed capture of the port in a radio 
broadcast saturday but a government official in addis ababa said 
the rebels controlled only parts of the town 
the news agency reported heavy shelling of massawa by sea and 
land apparently by both sides it said the shelling had damaged 
many buildings and the port where relief food is stored 
the rebels claim to have sunk or captured 12 warships if the 
claims are true that would be more than half of the ethiopian 
fleet of two frigates and 21 patrol boats listed by the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
president mengistu haile mariams marxist government has 
repeatedly accused unidentified arab nations of turning the red sea 
into a moslem sea inferring that they have been arming the rebels 
with naval craft 
delivery of relief food from massawa to the interior was halted 
after the eritrean secessionists began their offensive on feb 8 
officials say 
the relief and rehabilitation commission says 90000 tons of 
relief food are stranded in massawa 
the rebel offensive has virtually cut the provincial capital of 
asmara from the national capital in addis ababa except by air 
the tigre peoples liberation front another rebel group cut 
the asmaraaddis ababa road when it took control of tigre province 
eritreas southern neighbor early last year 
the two rebel groups claim to have killed at least 2500 
government troops since the eritrean offensive began 
the eritreans took up arms in 1962 to press for independence of 
their former italian colony late last year rebel and government 
emissaries held two unsuccessful rounds of peace talks mediated by 
former president jimmy carter in nairobi kenya and atlanta 
the tigrean rebels fighting since 1975 controls the province 
tigre and seek mengistus ouster

a federal judge who declared a mistrial in 
the first international drug prosecution brought jointly by chinese 
and us officials says the case proves you cant meld the two 
legal systems 
us district judge william orrick halted proceedings wednesday 
in the case against three men accused in connection with 700000 
worth of heroin found inside dead goldfish after a key prosecution 
witness said he had lied under pressure and death threats from 
chinese officials 
the witness who is seeking asylum in the united states 
recanted his testimony and said he had been tortured in a shanghai 
prison 
orrick said the breakdown of the trial was proof positive you 
cant meld the legal system in the peoples republic of china with 
the legal system in the united states 
assistant us attorney eric swenson told reporters orricks 
conclusion was valid for this case but im still confident that 
this type of problem does not have to affect future cases the 
legal system in china is almost identical to many of the western 
european systems 
no decision has been made on a retrial swenson said 
federal drug agents charged that seven pounds of southeast asian 
heroin had been put inside condoms that were sewed into the bodies 
of goldfish and mixed into shipments of live goldfish from china to 
the united states three men arrested in san francisco leung 
taklun chico wong and andrew wong were charged with possessing 
heroin with intent to distribute 
the witness wang zongxiao was arrested in shanghai in march 
1988 and held there for most of the time until last december when 
he was brought to san francisco he testified feb 1 that he took 
part in the heroin shipment along with leung 
but wang filed for asylum four days later saying he had been 
threatened with death by officials from shanghai who had 
accompanied him to the united states 
he said in court papers that he had been coerced into confessing 
and warned by the chinese officials not to reveal the coercion or 
the later beatings and electric shocks he received nor to disclose 
that students and workers were held and tortured in the shanghai 
prison 
wang returned to the witness stand tuesday without the jury 
present to describe his torture in china he said he had lied in 
testimony that implicated leung 
orrick said wednesday he was declaring a mistrial because of the 
allegations of perjured testimony and because the chinese 
government had not provided defense lawyers before the trial with 
wangs earlier statements as the judges order required 
after those actions any conviction in the case would surely be 
reversed on appeal he told the jury 
orrick also noted that two shanghai officers who accompanied 
wang to san francisco returned suddenly to china on sunday after 
the judge issued an order last week prohibiting us officials from 
returning wang to china while his asylum application is pending 
the officers had been accused of threatening wang if he changed 
his testimony 
i dont think youll be seeing them again orrick said 
cedric chao a lawyer appointed to represent wang said the case 
for asylum is strong and described wang as at peace with 
himself after his latest testimony 
it would be unconscionable to send him back to china to face 
certain death chao told reporters

the speed of change in eastern europe is 
mindboggling and raises concern about continued stability in 
the region president bush said in an interview published today 
i never thought youd see this rapid a change bush told usa 
today 
one example he added was that two weeks ago the soviets 
said they had a problem with our proposals on troop reductions in 
europe less than a week later its accepted 
despite the fastmoving pace of change bush said his concerns 
about continued stability do not have him in a sleepless mode 
theres sometime when you wonder is this going to be brought 
to conclusion or whats going to happen in terms of stability as 
the change takes place in eastern europe he said 
theres worries but not in the sense of a crisis 
environment 
he said it is good that political reform is evolving within 
the soviet union and no reason to lose sleep because our 
thesis that democracy and freedom should be contagious is proving 
to be correct and i hope it proves to be correct in south africa 
the president said he would not attempt to oust nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega as he did manuel antonio noriega in 
panama even if he concludes that the leftist leader has stolen the 
upcoming elections in nicaragua 
no he relied in response to a question theres a lot of 
nonelected leaders around the world that can sleep comfortable 
pressed on that point bush called the line of questioning too 
hypothetical but the answer is no if youre talking about an 
effort to protect american life or something the signal should be 
loud and clear ill do whats necessary to protect american lives 
but if youre saying i dont like the results of an election and 
will be use military force the answer is no

the district attorneys office said it would drop 
attempts to retry a woman whose conviction was overturned after she 
spent nine years in prison for a 1980 fur store robbery in which 
the owner was killed 
joyce ann brown said the decision wednesday by the dallas county 
office was the best valentines day gift in the world 
i really held my breath up until the last moment ms brown 
said after state district judge ron chapman accepted the 
prosecutors decision 
ms brown 43 was sentenced to life in prison by chapman in 
october 1980 for aggravated robbery five months earlier that ended 
in the death of ruben danziger 
after her conviction was overturned by the texas court of 
criminal appeals in november prosecutors said they would try ms 
brown again 
but prosecutor george west said wednesday there was 
insufficient evidence to proceed to trial although the case 
would remain open 
west said the decision is one in which someone is going to be 
pleased someone is going to be upset and there was no way out for 
me im going to have to face both of those 
he declined to give specific reasons for dropping the charges 
despite the lack of physical evidence linking ms brown to the 
crime she was found guilty of being an accomplice largely because 
of the testimony of two prosecution witnesses including danzigers 
wife ala 
mrs danzigers attorney david vaughan said justice was not 
been served and that ms brown was guilty 
ms brown said of mrs danziger i have to live with the fact 
that she will probably go to her grave thinking they released a 
guilty person and they didnt 
ms brown was the third texas inmate in a year to have a 
conviction overturned amid national attention clarence brandley a 
former janitor who was six days away from execution after nine 
years on death row had his conviction reversed in december the 
capital murder conviction of randall dale adams whose case was the 
subject of the movie the thin blue line also was dropped after 
he spent 12 years in prison

a lawyer for the nations largest organization 
for runaways and a priest have acknowledged providing a false 
identity to a 26yearold man they believed was a 19yearold 
prostitute a newspaper reported today 
the two men have said they created a new identity for kevin kite 
at the behest of the rev bruce ritter founder of the covenant 
house shelter for runaways the new york times reported today 
kite has charged that ritter gave him money and gifts in return 
for sex the 62yearold roman catholic priest has vehemently 
denied those charges and similar ones since made by three other 
men ritter has been placed on leave of absence from running the 
shelter pending an investigation by franciscan leaders 
the rev michael duval has told church superiors that he 
obtained birth and baptismal documents to falsify an identity for 
kite the newspaper said covenant house officials originally said 
kite had obtained the false identity himself 
duval and the attorney gregory loken declined to be quoted 
but officials of the roman catholic church and the shelter told the 
times how they tried to help kite who purportedly was running away 
from an organized crime ring 
according to the times account 
when ritter brought kite to new york from a covenant house 
shelter in new orleans in february 1989 he introduced him as his 
nephew however ritters niece learned that someone was using her 
brothers name

of leukemia in 1980 at age 10 the priest filled out a blank 
baptismal certificate with the names of timothy and his parents 
dated it dec 27 1970 and signed it with another priests name 
duval also obtained a certified copy of timothys birth 
certificate which is illegal for a nonfamily member to do it was 
not clear which state agency issued the certificate the documents 
were given to kite 
monsignor david lee communications director for the buffalo 
diocese told the times duvals actions were absolutely and 
totally contrary to church rules 
duval took a leave of absence from the church in august he 
resigned last week from his job as a family services caseworker in

loken and duval have said they believed kite needed a new 
identity so he could start a new life

the pilot of a jetliner that crashed 
with 146 people aboard may have tried to manually override the 
planes sophisticated computer control minutes before the disaster 
newspapers reported today 
at least 91 people were killed wednesday when the 3monthold 
airbus 320 jetliner operated by indian airlines crashed 150 feet 
short of the runway at bangalore airport in south india 
a spokesman for the staterun domestic carrier tried to 
discourage speculation in the media about the cause of the crash 
all these stories are speculations in cases like such 
crashes how can you say what happened without a proper inquiry 
said the spokesman who declined to be identified 
press trust of india said firefighters had found the flight data 
recorder in the fuselage of the wrecked plane 
the times of india newspaper quoting unidentified aviation 
sources said the crash may have occurred because the pilot tried 
to change the mode of control from computer to manual or 
viceversa 
the response time of the inflight computer for doing this is 
five to six seconds which is too little to make the switch at 
the final stage of the landing the newspaper said 
another daily the hindustan times said there was a strong 
possibility of a lastminute bid by the pilot to change over from 
computer to manual control and thus losing a valuable few seconds 
leading to the crash 
one publication science report said the aircrafts technology 
includes a preprogrammed software that tells the computer and 
not the pilot to make judgments 
if the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid collision the 
report said the system will not let the airplane respond beyond 
a certain rate 
the new delhibased hindustan times said the planes instruments 
may have indicated the wrong altitude which may have misled the 
pilot to descend earlier than he should have 
john mancosky 28 of chicago said the plane began to shake 
about five minutes earlier and at he first he thought the pilot 
made a hard landing 
then we heard a loud booming noise and soon we were enveloped 
in a ball of flame said mancosky who like most of the 
survivors escaped through the aircrafts rear door he suffered a 
broken leg 
the planes bottom hit a wall while coming down for the landing 
and it slithered on the rough ground before bursting into flames 
and breaking into at least four pieces 
among the 146 people on board were the sevenmember crew and 
four infants 
the pilot and copilot were killed in the fire that engulfed 
most of the plane leaving only the tail intact most of the 55 
survivors jumped down from the rear door 
the airline spokesman at least 17 foreigners had been on the 
flight they included seven americans a frenchman two canadians 
three japanese and a hong kong man embassy and airline officials 
said 
a us embassy official in new delhi said one american died one 
was missing and five had survived the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said their identities would not be released 
until families had been notified 
the airline spokesman said a fourmember team from airbus 
industrie the european consortium that makes the aircraft had 
arrived in india to help investigate the cause of the accident 
wednesdays crash was the latest in a series of accidents that 
have earned indian airlines the reputation of being one of the 
worstmanaged carriers in the world 
poor morale among the staff has led to frequent strikes and 
flight delays are endemic employees allege that preflight safety 
precautions are often ignored 
the a320 which had logged less than 400 flying hours since 
indian airlines acquired it in december was one of 14 purchased 
last year to try to upgrade the carriers fleet 
the last indian airlines disaster occurred oct 19 1988 when a 
boeing 737 crashed on final approach in the western city of 
ahmedabad killing 113 people on board an inquiry blamed pilot 
error for the crash the worst in the airlines 27year history 
wednesdays crash is only the second accident involving an a320 
and the first in commercial service three people were killed and 
50 injured when an a320 crashed at an air show in eastern france in 
june 1988 
the twinengined narrowbodied jet is the first civilian 
airliner with a fully computerized flight control system it 
consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar planes

a mutilated body found in the mississippi 
river had been embalmed authorities said leading them to believe 
they have a case of grave robbery and not murder on their hands 
police chief bill mccutcheon said wednesday that the mutilation 
of the body of an unidentified boy apparently was part of a 
religious group a fanatical group 
its sick you cant say it any better than that he said 
i mean think about it 
prints from the boys foot ruled out the possibility that the 
body found tuesday was that of 11yearold jacob wetterling 
sending waves of relief through the abducted boys hometown of st 
joseph in central minnesota jacob disappeared last october 
a worker at a mississippi river dam found the unclothed body 
tuesday floating near the dam authorities said the hands feet 
and head had been severed mccutcheon said the feet were later 
found nearby 
the body was described as that of a boy between the ages of 9 
and 13 
authorities stopped treating the case as a homicide when a 
coroner found embalming fluid in the body mccutcheon said the 
time and cause of death and how long the body might have been in 
the river were not immediately determined 
investigators were consulting cult experts to determine what 
kinds of groups may have performed such a ritual were 
interested in knowing if there was a ceremony down by the river 
mccutcheon said 
they also were checking with cemeteries to see if there were 
unreported grave robberies 
sandy gallant a san francisco police officer who has studied 
occult crimes in the united states said there have been cases of 
grave robbery and mutilation as part of some ritual but she said 
she knows of no cases where a body was stolen mutilated and then 
discarded 
it would make more sense if the body was found somewhere at 
the center of a ritual scene they usually leave the body where it 
can be found she said

renegade gen michel aouns forces 
pounded residential districts of east beirut today and launched 
tank attacks against the strongholds of a rival christian militia 
police said eight major fires blazed out of control in the 
ashrafiyeh district as aouns tanks blasted positions of the 
lebanese forces militia in the lowincome district of ein rummaneh 
they reported several other fires in the districts of nabaa and 
ein rummaneh controlled by samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
a police spokesman said aoun was concentrating his ground 
offensive on ein rummaneh on the southeastern edge of beirut 
while his gunners hammered ashrafiyeh and the lebanese forces 
third stronghold at nabaa with howitzer shells 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said at least three people were killed and 12 wounded in the sudden 
barrage against ashrafiyeh and nabaa 
stray shells also crashed into densely populated residential 
districts in moslem west and south beirut killing at least four 
people and wounding 39 by police count 
the casualties raised the overall toll from 17 days of christian 
fighting to 522 killed and 1775 wounded 
the figures include 31 people killed and 149 wounded in the 
citys moslem districts which have not been involved in the 
fighting for mastery of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
hassan hallak a shiite moslem resident of shiyah a district 
bordering ein rummaneh said the christian area was burning 
a huge cloud hangs over ein rummaneh smoke billows from the 
whole district said hallak 
moslem and christian radio stations interrupted regular 
programming to broadcast reports of renewed hostilities a relative 
lull had prevailed over east beirut since monday 
aouns command in a communique blamed the clash on the 
christian militia it said geagea has fired the coup de grace 
at attempts by a mediation committee to work out a settlement to 
the power struggle for control of the estimated 1 million 
christians who live in the enclave 
the command of geageas militia countered the charge saying the 
generals men surprised civilians with heavy shelling early in 
the day 
a police spokesman said the barrage started around 530 am 
just as a few civilians were venturing out of underground shelters 
to buy bread from the few bakeries that operated in the besieged 
districts 
maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir went on radio to 
appeal to both geagea and aoun to stop fighting 
the people are on the brink of despair sfeir said 
monasteries schools and hospitals are in bad need of supplies to 
help the the wounded patients and refugees 
both geagea and aoun are from the maronite community that has 
dominated key government posts the army command and judiciary 
since independence from france in 1943 
heavy clashes renewed a few hours after geagea reiterated his 
rejection of aouns proposal to disband the militia and transform 
it into a political party 
we want all lebanese potentials preserved including our 
military forces geagea said wednesday 
aoun had said geageas militiamen should join his army 
lebanese forces militiamen wont join the army our militiamen 
are politically minded fighters the army doesnt have a cause 
gagea told a news conference 
aoun rejects the syrianbacked christianmoslem government of 
president elias hrawi and has vowed to drive out the syrian forces 
backing moslem militias but his latest attentions have been 
focused on maintaining his hold on the christian heartland

a man who spent nearly eight years 
jailed for a grocery store robbery he never committed walked out of 
prison after being given a full pardon 
the release wednesday of michael anthony woten 36 marked the 
sixth time since 1984 that an inmates conviction in dallas county 
has been thrown out or reversed and the person freed after spending 
years in prison 
the most famous case was that of randall dale adams who served 
13 years after being convicted of killing a dallas police officer 
but was freed last year after his story was told in the film the 
thin blue line also free wednesday was joyce ann brown after 
prosecutors decided against trying her again on a charge in 
connection with the holdup of a dallas fur store 
gov bill clements signed the pardon at midmorning in austin 
shortly afterward texas department of corrections officials picked 
woten up at the eastham prison farm for the drive to the walls unit 
at huntsville where he was given a new social security card 200 
and his freedom 
woten said inmates guards and prison officials cheered and 
clapped when he drove away it was like being at a football 
match 
i dont think its quite hit me yet until a few hours ago 
woten said later i was still incarcerated and did only what i 
was told to do its going to take me some time to realize that im 
free and i can start doing what i want to do 
woten had been convicted in the april 1982 armed robbery of a 
north dallas supermarket and sentenced to 55 years in prison five 
witnesses testified that he was one of two men dubbed the cowboy 
bandits who robbed that store and another grocery 
woten insisted that at the time of the robbery he was 
hitchhiking from dallas to st louis he said he got a ride with a 
trucker he could identify only as don and kangaroo the mans 
citizens band radio nickname 
the dallas times herald launched a search for kangaroo after 
woten got a statement from another inmate that the inmate and 
another man had robbed the store the paper succeeded and the man 
don fainter of claycomo mo told authorities last month he had 
indeed given woten a ride the day the robbery 
woten said he plans to open a leather crafts shop taking 
advantage of the leatherworking skills he learned in prison after 
trading his white prison shirt for a blue one woten swore he would 
never again wear white 
even if i become a painter im going to wear plaid he said

president bush expressed 
irritation with the news media today as he flew to colombia for a 
fournation drug conference criticizing reports that he said 
suggested he was secretive and deceptive from now on its going 
to be a little different bush asserted 
the president vowed to hold fewer news conferences and to 
restrict his sessions with reporters in the future 
im not going to be burned for holding out or doing something 
deceptive bush fumed 
bush aired his grievances with the news media in a chat with 
reporters aboard air force one shortly before he landed here to 
transfer to a helicopter that would take him to cartagena for a 
drug summit with the presidents of colombia bolivia and peru 
what apparently riled the president were news stories suggesting 
that he had sometimes said one thing then done something else 
for instance his comments at a news conference on monday that 
he did not think it was time for a fourpower conference on the 
future of germany came a day before a major agreement on german 
reuinification was reached in ottawa 
when i told you that i didnt think thered be a deal and 
there shortly was a deal then im hit for deceiving you bush 
said 
he said that at his news conference he did not know that an 
agreement that would involve oversight by the four postworld war 
ii european powers the united states the soviet union britain 
and france was at hand 
the president expressed his testiness from the start of todays 
exchange with reporters accompanying him here on air force one 
bush had slept aboard the plane in a hangar at andrews air force 
base in the maryland suburbs so that he would not arrive in 
colombia sleepy after todays predawn flight and he was asked if 
he had enjoyed a good nights sleep 
i had a very good nights sleep i cant get into the details 
of that because some will say its too much sleep some will say 
its too little 
then the president added i think weve had too many press 
conferences its not good it overdoes it its overexposure 
bush has had about a news conference a week on the average 
since he took office on jan 20 1989 
im taking no answers to questions im not going to discuss 
what im going to bring up bush said when asked about his agenda 
for the days drug conference 
im not going to discuss whether theres any surprises or not 
this is a new thing this is a new approach 
asked about an nbctv report that colombian president virgilio 
barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to 
extradite them to the united states if they turned over drug labs 
bush snapped i have no comment whatsoever on that i have no 
comment on whether i know about it or not i cant comment on 
whether its true or not 
so from now on its going to be a little different he 
added were going to have a new relationship it will be 
pleasant it will be fun but its different 
im not going to be burned for holding out or doing something 
deceptive 
bush did not mention which news reports he was referring to 
however todays editions of the washington post copies of 
which were on bushs plane had a story on what it called the 
debate between president bush and the press over secrecy and 
deception

housing starts boosted by the warmest january 
on record rebounded 296 percent for their biggest gain on record 
last month after falling to a sevenyear low during decembers cold 
spell the government said today 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 163 million units in 
january after slumping a revised 69 percent in december starts in 
december originally were reported to be down 79 percent 
the department said the january increase which it attributed to 
unusually warm weather was the highest since housing starts first 
were recorded in 1959 it topped the previous record gain of 293 
percent reached in july 1982 
analysts had expected a big jump in starts during january 
because of the contrast in weather from december 
some like michael p niemira of the mitsubishi bank in new 
york suggested in advance of todays report that a truer picture 
of housing activity could be drawn by averaging the starts for the 
two months 
thomas holloway senior economist for the mortgage bankers 
association also said the jump was weatherrelated 
levels like the ones were seeing here would indicate a 
housing boom and there is just simply no fundamental reason to 
believe that is going on he said 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said january 
temperatures were the warmest for that month since the government 
began keeping records 96 years ago december was the fourth coldest 
on record it said 
many analysts also expect starts this year to total about the 
same as 1989s 137 million units because of the sluggish economy 
some however said rising move interest rates could slow starts 
further 
construction of singlefamily homes rose 248 percent in january 
to an annual rate of 114 million units after falling 98 percent 
in december 
the increase was the steepest for single dwellings since a 26 
percent gain in march 1979 
apartment construction jumped 423 percent to an annual rate of 
488000 units after a revised 18 percent gain in december the 
december figure originally had been reported to be a drop of 24 
percent 
januarys gain in apartment starts was the sharpest since a 56 
percent advance in january 1985 
the midwest recorded the steepest jump in overall starts up 
426 percent but the other regions also posted sharp gain starts 
were up 386 percent in the northeast 246 percent in the south 
and 231 percent in the west 
applications for building permits a barometer of future housing 
activity jumped 267 percent the highest gain since a 30 percent 
jump in june 1980 applications had risen 25 percent in december

solidarity leader lech walesa distancing 
himself from the government he helped create said today that a 
reunified germany poses no danger to poland and he wants soviet 
troops out as soon as possible 
the solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki has adopted a more tolerant attitude toward soviet 
withdrawal saying the 40000 troops in poland should leave only 
after creation of a new security arrangement for europe 
but walesa insted that the red army withdraws this year 
i will continue activities so that the soviet troops are 
removed from poland as soon as possible walesa told reporters 
referring to suggestions from president wojciech jaruzelski and 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza that the soviet troops 
help ensure polands security in the face of a reunifying germany 
the solidarity union chairman said 
i dont envision any danger on the part of germany because 
europe has had too many bad experiences to allow the germans that 
walesa also seemed to depart from the governments insistence 
that poland be present at planned sixnation german reunification 
talks involving east germany west germany and the four postwar 
occupying powers the united states soviet union britain and 
france 
what is important is what role would poland play at such 
talks walesa said i think poland could not be very effective 
there he said 
but others in poland conquered twice this century by a united 
germany and then abandoned by the allies to the soviets says it 
cannot risk being shut out of talks on the future of germany 
nothing about us without us government spokesman henryk 
wozniakowski said wednesday quoting a polish proverb 
our stand is that our security matters cannot be settled by 
proxy for us we must be present mazowiecki told a news 
conference in london 
east and west germany and the four powers that occupied germany 
at the end of world war ii agreed tuesday on a framework for talks 
that will lead to german reunification 
some germans including west german finance minister teodor 
waigel say germany still in theory exists within its 1937 borders 
in other words spreading over much of presentday poland west 
german chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday passed up an opportunity 
to allay polish fears saying that decision should be left to the 
future government 
we are the only country in which the situation is unclear 
said wozniakowski 
poland is not seeking full membership in the talks he said but 
it does insist on participating in those sessions that touch on its 
vital interests primarily the question of german borders 
wozniakowski said britain the united states and the soviet 
union were sympathetic to polands appeal and mazowiecki 
certainly will press for east berlins support friday when east 
german premier hans modrow visits 
resistance however was coming from west germany 
a bonn government official said poland or other neighboring 
states had no reason to be involved in the negotiations 
the unification proposal involves only the territory of west 
germany east germany and berlin he said on condition of 
anonymity there is no reason for fear in poland 
poles are sensitive to the issue because of past german 
aggression and because rightwing german politicians have never 
reliquished claims to the 40000 square miles of territory poland 
was awarded from germany at the end of world war ii compensation 
for an even larger area taken from poland by the soviet union 
the territory acquired after world war ii comprises about 
onethird of presentday poland 
germans fled or were expelled after the war and millions of 
poles mostly expelled from the sovietannexed territories moved 
in today about 104 million of polands 38 million people live on 
formerly german territory 
only about 1 million ethnic germans live in poland now

the democratic party is changing its rules to 
permit california to hold one of the first presidential primaries 
of 1992 a move aimed at giving the nations largest state more 
influence in selecting the nominee 
party activists say other states may advance the dates of their 
primaries as well 
the democratic national committees rules panel voted wednesday 
to allow most states to hold primaries or caucuses as early as the 
first tuesday in march one week after new hampshire holds the 
first primary and one week earlier than previously allowed 
the change is expected to be approved easily by the full dnc 
next month 
it means a proposal now in the california legislature to set its 
presidential primaries on march 3 1992 would be permissible under 
national democratic party rules 
the california assembly has approved shifting the states 
presidential primary from june to that early march date and a 
state senate vote is expected 
the obvious intention is to give california the chance to go 
early and the opportunity to have more say in the process said 
donald l fowler cochairman of the rules committee and dnc member 
from south carolina 
i anticipate other states will move up to that tuesday he 
said i dont think other states will let california have that 
tuesday to themselves 
scott scowry deputy press secretary for the republican national 
committee said were delighted with the prospect of 
california holding both parties primaries in early march he said 
he did not believe any gop rules would be affected by californias 
change 
the new democratic rules still allow iowas caucuses to be the 
first presidential delegateselection event followed eight days 
later by new hampshires primary a special provision would permit 
maine to begin its caucus process earlier too but other states 
would have to fall within the socalled window from the first 
tuesday in march to the second tuesday in june 
california under this schedule would become the first big 
state to vote holding its primary one week after new hampshires 
the socalled super tuesday round of primaries would follow a week 
after california and illinois would follow a week later 
it is important that a large state crucial to electing a 
democratic president weigh in early in the process brown said 
californias june primary date in past years has placed it at 
the end of the delegateselection process when the nominee was 
already a foregone conclusion 
california felt very strongly they wanted to be a player in 
the process said alice travis a member of the dnc executive 
committee from california coming last made it somewhat 
irrelevant 
some believe placing california so early in the primary season 
will diminish the importance of iowa and new hampshire by 
tradition the two earliest states with california following so 
quickly they reason wellfinanced wellknown candidates may 
concentrate instead on california the state with the most 
delegates 
party strategists hope that advancing primary calendar will 
enable the party to decide on a nominee earlier in the year and 
have more time to concentrate on the general election campaign 
but fowler cautioned there could be unintended consequences 
such as splintering the field and prolonging the selection of a 
nominee 
this is a mechanical adjustment the political impact of which 
is unknown and subject to various interpretations fowler said 
other changes allow the party to apply a new sanction against 
states that violate national party rules by holding their primaries 
or caucuses too early or violate other delegateselection rules 
the change would provide an automatic 25 percent reduction in the 
states total delegates 
in the past the only sanction available to the party was 
refusal to seat a violating states delegation a sanction so 
severe the party often ignored violations

the liberal democratic party is likely to hold on 
to its majority in the lower house of parliament following the 
general election according to public opinion polls published today 
but from 30 percent to 40 percent of voters questioned remained 
undecided according to surveys by the asahi shimbun the yomiuri 
shimbun the mainichi shimbun the nihon keizai shimbun and kyodo 
news service 
also today a shot was fired at a campaign car of a candidate 
slightly wounding one of the politicians assistants a news report 
said 
the five nationwide surveys conducted in the past two weeks 
and released three days before sundays election reached similar 
conclusions 
the asahi survey of 103200 eligible voters projected the 
liberal democrats will end up with 271 seats in the house of 
representatives down from their current 295 seats but well over 
257 seats needed for a majority 
the lower house names the prime minister and has the power to 
adopt the national budget and treaties even without approval of 
the upper house which can block legislation on other issues 
the yomiuri shimbun put the liberal democrats total at 260 
seats while mainichi shimbun estimated 265 
the nihon keizai shimbun a financial daily said the liberal 
democrats may lose about 10 seats to the socialists but that the 
conservative partys new candidates are faring well and will 
offset some veterans losses 
yomiuri questioned 100000 voters mainichi 91520 and nikon 
keizai 52000 
kyodo news service in a poll of 110000 voters said the 
liberal democrats will win at least 259 seats and could get up to 
285 
the polls generally agreed the leading opposition group the 
japan socialist party will do well reaching 120 seats from its 
previous 85 according to the asahi 
other major opposition parties the clean government party with 
54 seats in the last session the japan communist party with 26 and 
the democratic socialist party with 25 are all projected to lose 
strength 
the polls were done through interviews of a set number of voters

opposition candidates are calling for political reform to 
prevent corruption and are seeking support among traditionally 
conservative farmers by stressing their opposition to opening 
japans agricultural markets to less expensive imports 
besides the apparent vulnerability of the governing party the 
other new wrinkle in this campaign year has been the level of 
violence

soviet legislators clashed today over a proposal 
to restore private property rights in the soviet union and one 
ukrainian lawmaker said such an idea is so radical that it should 
be put to a national referendum 
we have to ask the people said lawmaker leonid sukhov of 
kharkov the people know better 
while the 35article property bill does not go as far as to use 
the word private property it does recognize the right for the 
existence of diverse forms of property and says that citizens can 
own property including houses and apartments for private use 
the proposal does not clearly state whether land can be 
privately owned state ownership of all land is a fundamental 
principle of marxism 
in another departure from orthodox dogma which forbids 
individuals to own factories and equipment on a largescale the 
bill says citizens can now own the means of production for 
farming and other labor activities 
the bill also would allow foreigners to enjoy the same rights as 
soviet citizens in owning property citizens could own stocks and 
bonds 
deputy prime minister leonid abalkin urged the legislature today 
to consider the proposal with great care abalkin addressed the 
packed legislature that had adopted a 22point agenda which 
includes measures to strengthen the presidency now held by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
after its first reading before the 542member supreme soviet 
last fall the bill underwent substantial revisions with at least 
10000 changes written into the lengthy draft the tass news agency 
reported 
during the initial debate conflict arose over who currently 
owns land and natural resources the national government or the 
individual republics that issue has been skirted in the draft in 
favor of phrasing that says the land and its resources belong to 
people living on a given territory 
the issue is critical because the legislature in lithuania has 
already adopted laws that allow the sale of land to individuals 
in his report read at the start of the session today abalkin a 
noted soviet economist who helped write the draft told the 
legislators that attempts have been made to reach a compromise 
during the course of revision 
but already today the bill aroused controversy at the supreme 
soviet which was meeting in a building in the kremlin more than 
20 speakers asked to take the floor for a fiveminute chance to 
suggest changes or express approval 
one speaker objected to the introduction of private property on 
the ground that it would favor city dwellers with money rather than 
collective farm workers who had spent their life on the land but 
had no savings 
another speaker claimed that the language of the bill was too 
vague and that it needed to be rewritten in a clearer fashion 
at a news conference after the morning session abalkin 
acknowledged that society had mixed feelings about the bill but 
that the important thing was that no option could be excluded in 
the pursuit of economic reform 
he said it was important that there should be complete freedom 
for individuals in economic activity and that local authorities 
should have greater responsibility in establishing property laws 
debate was continuing today

a jury ordered a radio station and two disc 
jockeys to pay 694200 in damages to a news director whom they 
referred to with risque jokes on a shock radio program 
liz randolph 32 claimed the jokes which implied she was 
promiscuous and mentally unstable caused her to suffer panic 
attacks and led her to seek psychiatric treatment 
disc jockeys jim quinn and donald banana don jefferson and 
ez communication owner of wbzzfm were found liable for 
defamation and invasion of privacy and ordered to pay about 
260000 in damages 
ms randolph won an additional 390000 from quinn and jefferson 
for intentional infliction of emotional distress 
in addition the jury awarded ms randolph 30704 for medical 
bills and 13500 for lost wages 
ms randolph said she was glad she had endured a twoweek trial 
that made public much of her personal life including details of 
her psychiatric history 
we knew it was going to be tough she said 
one of her attorneys samuel p kamin said wednesdays verdict 
by the allegheny county common pleas jury sends a message to 
broadcasters about airing risque humor especially jokes that 
target coworkers 
i think thats something the industrys going to have to think 
twice about now he said the signal this sends is the 
workplace is no place for abuse 
i think theres no question this will have an impact on the 
kind of conduct youll hear on morning shows said jeff pollack 
a los angelesbased media adviser its clear this case will make 
a lot of people think twice what they say to fellow workers on the 
air 
pollack said innuendo of the type used on quinn and jeffersons 
show is common in morning radio talk shows around the nation the 
verdict could restrict creative freedom and make disgruntled 
employees more likely to sue he said 
jimmy roach part of the morning team at wmygfm in pittsburgh 
said offbeat humor has its place in radio but members of a 
broadcast team should agree on jokes and comedy bits before they 
are aired he said 
federal communications commission chairman alfred c sikes has 
been cracking down on shock radio since he took office in 
august twelve stations have been cited for indecency since then 
ms randolph began working for wbzz in may 1985 and walked off 
the job jan 22 1988 after quinn and jefferson aired a joke she 
said shocked her 
the disc jockeys and station management contended the remarks 
were not meant to be taken seriously and said ms randolph knew the 
absurdist format of the broadcast when she was hired they also 
said she did not complain about the jokes to the announcers or to 
management 
quinn 46 and jefferson 30 were not in the courtroom when the 
verdict was announced and their attorney foster s goldman jr 
said no decision had been made about appealing the case

a pilot who flew cocaine profits to panama pleaded 
guilty today to one count of illegally transporting funds becoming 
the first person indicted with former panama dictator manuel 
noriega to admit wrongdoing 
but the attorney for eduardo pardo 44 said he did not know if 
his client would testify against noriega and the other defendants 
in the drug conspiracy case 
thats all up to him said lawyer william meadows a former 
us attorney in miami who said there was no plea bargain with the 
government 
the pilot pleaded guilty to making a flight with 800000 in 
drug money from fort lauderdale to panama in 1983 noriega who is 
still arguing with prosecutors over their right to prosecute him 
is accused of taking payoffs to protect the cocaine trade 
us district judge william hoeveler told pardo he could face up 
to five years in prison and a 10000 fine on the charges 
attending pardos changeofplea hearing were several attorneys 
for the other five defendants either in custody or out on bond 
including noriegas lawyer frank rubino 
federal prosecutors who are under a gag order in the case 
refused to comment on the plea 
richard sharpstein attorney for defendant brian alden davidow 
told the associated press that even without an agreement to testify 
for the government pardos plea made him a likely witness 
now that hes pleaded guilty pardo can be summoned before a 
federal grand jury to testify and cannot invoke the fifth 
amendment against selfincrimination sharpstein said 
at a hearing wednesday government and defense attorneys 
wrangled over what the defense said was a failure of the 
prosecution to turn over an inventory of materials seized in 
noriegas homes and offices in panama 
noriega attorney steven kollin told magistrate william c 
turnoff we havent received the inventories and we feel we are 
being stonewalled i feel we are dealing with two governments the 
military and the us attorneys office 
but assistant us attorney michael p sullivan told turnoff 
we have supplied a partial inventory and we are continuing to 
update all the time and they have been sent to mr kollin 
kollin said he had not received the partial inventory but 
turnoff said that he felt the government was making a good faith 
effort to comply with his orders

three west german hackers were found 
guilty today of selling western military computer codes to the 
soviet kgb and given suspended sentences ranging from 14 months to 
two years 
dirk brzezinski peter carl and markus hess were arrested in 
march after an investigation by us and west german officials 
revealed the three had obtained passwords and codes giving them 
access to key military and research computers in the united states 
western europe and japan 
a fourth man 30yearold karl koch who was also arrested in 
the case committed suicide in may 
at the trial which began jan 11 all three admitted guilt in 
obtaining the codes to sell them to a soviet kgb agent in east 
berlin 
in todays decision chief judge leopold spiller said the three 
were given suspended sentences because it could not be proven 
that substantial damage had been done to the federal republic west 
germany or its nato partners but spiller also said the three 
sold the computer codes for money 
carl was sentenced to 24 months hess 20 months and brzezinski 
14 months 
all three men were freed on suspended sentences as long as they 
stay out of trouble with the law for the duration of their terms 
carl 35 told the court during the trial that he could only 
identify the kgb agent he dealt with as serge and said he did 
not wish to reveal anything more about the soviets in open court 
for fear of reprisals 
court records show that carl made at least 25 contacts with the 
soviets and received a total 54500 for the computer information 
which was split among the hackers amateurs who figure out ways to 
access private computer systems 
brzezinksi 30 told the court that koch had the original idea 
of selling the information to the kgb 
according to brzezinski koch claimed he had gained access to 
the us defense department general databank known as optimus 
us and west german news media reported the hackers also gained 
access to a nasa and a star wars research computer and 
computers linked to nuclear weapons and energy research in new 
mexico and the fermi laboratory in illinois 
however us officials said last year that although the hackers 
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers they 
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information 
investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and 
passwords for computers in japan great britain france italy 
switzerland and west germany were also obtained and sold to the 
soviets by the hackers

duffield tonight they said 
roberts plans to meet friday with pittstons 1700 union miners

nasa engineers were unwilling to wait 
until october to see the galileo spacecrafts photographs of venus 
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures 
sent to earth early 
one of the photos released wednesday shows clouds as small as 25 
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere 
it was taken monday night when the jupiterbound galileo was about 
1 million miles past venus the second planet from the sun 
you can see clouds and you can see some very interesting 
detail in the cloud patterns said neal ausman galileo mission 
director at the national aeronautics and space administrations jet 
propulsion laboratory the engineers and scientists are 
exceptionally pleased 
galileo is scheduled to go into orbit around jupiter in december 
1995 in a 135 billion mission to study the solar systems largest 
planet just before 10 pm pst last friday the spacecraft swooped 
about 10025 miles over venus so that planet could act as a gravity 
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to jupiter 
most of the photographs and other data collected during and 
after the flyby wont be sent back until october when the 
spacecraft is closer to earth galileos main antenna now is furled 
to protect it from the heat of the sun a smaller antenna which 
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate is 
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft 
but nasa engineers were able to get galileo to send the three 
photos back to earth on monday and tuesday by transferring separate 
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio 
transmission ausman said 
nasa spokesman jim wilson called the technique experimental 
and difficult 
ausman said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to 
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study venus 
lower atmosphere as well as ultraviolet light measurements and 
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in 
space around venus 
by the time galileos flyby of venus formally ends friday 
night the spacecrafts television camera will have taken about 80 
pictures of cloudshrouded venus 
many other spacecraft have photographed venus some from much 
closer than galileo but the new photos still should have 
scientific value ausman said 
galileo was deployed from the space shuttle atlantis last oct 
18 on a looping 24 billion sixyear route that requires venus and 
earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to 
jupiter it will fly past earth on dec 8 then again on dec 8 
1992 
meanwhile in the outer reaches of the solar system the voyager 
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully 
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the 
solar system according to jpl spokeswoman mary hardin 
voyager 1 which photographed jupiter in 1980 and saturn in 
1981 was ordered to shoot the pictures tuesday evening but it 
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs 
to travel the 37 billion miles to earth hardin said wednesday

a federal indictment charges seven people with 
plotting to blow up a nuclear plant airport dam and other 
installations to try to spring a jailed drug runner 
the indictment was unsealed wednesday after a fouryear 
investigation by the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms said us attorney ray rukstele 
five of those named were already in custody on drug and 
racketeering charges including the drug runner whose freedom was 
allegedly being sought the two remaining suspects were arrested 
wednesday rukstele said 
the indictment says the seven planned to bomb a nuclear power 
plant an east coast airport power transmission towers a dam and 
a navy ship in a scheme to barter the release of jerry allen 
lequire of maryville tenn 
rukstele declined to identify the intended targets 
lequire 46 was convicted last year in an alabama federal court 
of importing about 33 tons of cocaine to the southeastern united 
states he was sentenced to 20 years in prison to be served after 
a 36year term he was already serving for other drugrelated 
convictions 
indicted with lequire tuesday were bonnie sue anders 41 of 
corbin ky michael carl jenkins 40 of greenback tenn charles 
allen lequire 26 william michael lequire 28 and james thomas 
lequire 39 all of maryville tenn and gene edward lequire 42 
of louisville tenn 
authorities would not comment beyond information contained in 
the indictment so it was not immediately clear how the other 
lequires were related to jerry allen lequire 
the seven are charged with conspiracy to violate federal 
explosives laws two counts of detonating explosives to destroy 
property used in interstate commerce and illegally transporting 
explosives across state lines jenkins also is accused of bombing 
two transmission towers near atlanta in 1985 
the seven face possible 35year jail sentences and fines of up 
to 1 million if convicted 
according to the indictment the plot was supposed to work this 
way 
the group would acquire explosives and rent a house in orlando 
fla where some of the explosives would be stored an innocent 
dupe of latin american origin would be found to live in the house 
jenkins was to carry out the actual bombings the indictment said 
after each bombing the miami herald would be phoned and told 
the bombings were in retaliation for american actions in central 
america 
jerry lequire then would offer through his latin american drug 
contacts to help find the bomber in exchange for his freedom 
he would produce the address of the house and the dupe would be 
arrested 
the indictment does not say if a dupe was found it says the 
plotting took place between june 1985 and january 1986 
the two arrested in knoxville tenn wednesday were gene and 
william lequire rukstele said

a strong eruption of redoubt volcano 
this morning blew abrasive ash more than six miles into the sky and 
across the cook inlet toward the port town of homer 
state seismologist john davies said the latest eruption began at 
403 am 
weve got reports from the drift river oil terminal that 
theres a lot of lightning around the mountain davies said 
theyre packing up to evacuate 
we also got reports from troopers in homer that they can see 
the ash clouds that the winds appear to be taking the steam and 
ash plume in that direction 
the mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions 
began in middecember disrupting air travel and mail in and out of 
anchorage during the holidays because the airborne ash particles 
can damage or shut down aircraft engines 
the federal aviation administration immediately issued new 
flight restrictions today warning aircraft to remain at least 20 
miles from the mountain 
an airline pilot en route to anchorage reported an ash cloud 
ranging from 31000 to 33000 feet today davies said 
winds at that flight level were about 91 knots 105 mph and 
they were blowing from the northwest davies said 
seismic signals from the mountain during the initial moments 
of the eruption were as strong as any weve received since the 
mountain became active several months ago davies said 
the mountain began generating more earthquake activity a couple 
of days ago leading seismologists to believe another eruption was 
coming he said we did expect one but not this soon 
an state trooper dispatcher in soldotna confirmed that ash was 
falling in the ninilchik area of the kenai peninsula but she said 
there were no immediate reports of any ash fall around soldotna 
redoubt volcano is 115 miles southwest of anchorage 
a klm royal dutch airlines boeing 747 encountered an ash cloud 
from redoubt on dec 15 two days after the mountain began 
erupting the ash clogged all four engines and the aircraft fell 
more than two miles before the engines could be restarted 
it made a successful emergency landing at anchorage 
international airport but preliminary estimates of damage to the 
threemonthold aircraft were 50 million

nelson mandela said today that his 
guerrilla movement considers government installations to be 
legitimate targets for attack and that civilians inevitably will be 
caught in the cross fire 
mandela released feb 11 after 27 years in prison said there 
has been no decision to suspend the armed struggle which has been 
largely dormant in recent months 
our objective is that the targets are government 
installations mandela said in an interview from his home in 
soweto the township outside johannesburg in a conflict 
civilians must be caught up in cross fire 
mandela helped launch the african national congress guerrilla 
campaign in 1961 a year after the organization was outlawed the 
official policy always has been to limit attacks to government 
facilities and personnel although some anc leaders have expressed 
a desire to hit civilian targets 
there have been numerous attacks on civilians in recent years 
but the anc has said those were the results of guerrillas who had 
not undergone proper training 
president fw de klerk legalized the anc on feb 2 but the 
group says its armed struggle remains one of its strategies to put 
pressure on the government 
asked if the countrys 5 million whites would have to change 
their lifestyles under an anc government mandela said they are 
already adjusting themselves to changes 
he cited recently integrated beaches the fact that a few select 
neighborhoods have been opened to all races and that some private 
schools are integrated although public schools remain segregated 
whites in this country are a very important section of the 
community and without them without their cooperation we will have 
immense problems mandela said that is why we are so keen to 
ensure that the changes we are demanding are not going to mean 
domination of whites or blacks 
de klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include 
the 28 million black majority in the national government but he 
opposes a oneman onevote system and outright black majority 
rule he envisions some mechanism that will give whites veto power 
on major policy decisions 
earlier today mandela met jesse jackson on his final day of an 
eightday visit to south africa 
the former democratic presidential candidate said south african 
blacks still were not free and the united states and western europe 
must put pressure including economic sanctions on the government 
to end apartheid 
we must not lower the standards of democracy or expectations 
for democracy in south africa jackson said 
in the capital of pretoria supporters of the proapartheid 
conservative party held a rally to call for the removal of de klerk 
and new elections 
our people have kept a low profile up to now but we have 
fought for our own fatherland and that fatherland you will not take 
away from us conservative leader andries treurnicht told a rally 
wednesday night in bloemfontein 
the opposition has denounced de klerk for freeing mandela and 
legalizing the anc and other black opposition groups in an effort 
to start talks on ending the white monopoly on power 
the conservative party wants south africa split into separate 
states for whites and blacks it received 31 percent of the vote in 
september elections in which only whites could vote 
government officials said 1000 army troops would be deployed in 
natal province to help police quell fighting between conservative 
and radical black factions police said protesters fired at police 
vehicles overnight and one officer was shot and wounded near 
durban 
mandela in news interviews wednesday said the anc is willing 
to compromise with the white government on a postapartheid 
constitution as long as blacks are guaranteed full voting rights 
the 71yearold black leader in his first interviews since his 
release sunday after 27 years in prison also praised de klerk 
saying that because of his flexibility and integrity the 
possibility of a settlement is always there 
mandela was asked if the anc was willing to negotiate over its 
demand for a oneperson onevote system that would lead to black 
majority rule 
compromises must be made in respect to every issue as long as 
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population group 
but the country as whole mandela told reporters 
the anc repeatedly has rejected any system falling short of 
oneperson onevote but mandelas comments indicated the movement 
would at least be willing to let this be a topic for negotiations

streets were virtually abandoned and 
fishing boats were kept away from cartagena bay docks today amid 
unusually heavy security surrounded the convening of a fournation 
drug summit 
first class weve got the best the best president bush 
said of the extraordinary protective measures taken in his behalf 
security already had been heightened in cartagena bay by the 
time the president arrived aboard air force one at barranquilla a 
caribbean port city some 60 miles northeast of the summit site 
naval authorities closed off cartagenas bay to private boat 
traffic and were guarding it with frogmen frigates highspeed 
patrol boats and at least one submarine helicopters hovered above 
highrise luxury hotels where guests were being required to submit 
to fingerprinting 
a colombian frigate had stationed itself just off the coast of 
the peninsula and small patrol boats were speeding along the shores 
with machine guns pointed inland across the bay from the 
peninsula authorities had forced the fishing boats that normally 
crowd cartagenas docks to leave and except for some decrepit 
ships too damaged to move the wharves were empty 
scores of troops also surrounded the convention center where 
much of the international press watched barcos welcoming speech 
broadcast on a giant screen television from the guest house across 
the bay 
soldiers wearing camoflauge uniforms and resting automatic 
rifles on their hips were standing on the roof of the convention 
center as military patrols roamed the sun baked streets below 
cartagenas streets normally packed with traffic and 
pedestrians in the early morning hours were practically empty 
public and private schools were closed and some residents said 
they were staying home from work for fear that violence might 
accompany bushs visit 
bush was meeting with presidents virgilio barco of colombia 
jaime paz of bolivia and alan garcia of peru to sign an agreement 
to combat cocaine trafficking 
already stringent security measures were wound even tighter 
today as about 5000 security agents from the four countries 
represented at the antidrug summit roamed the city and scouted the 
colombian naval base where the meeting was being held 
the base houses the presidential guest residence where barco and 
paz stayed wednesday night bush and garcia arrived today 
the us security forces have taken extraordinary measures to 
guard bush following a report in december that colombian drug lords 
had taken a 30 million contract on the presidents life and 
reports that surfacetoair missiles had been acquired to shoot 
down his plane 
two us warships the nassau and the sampson were cruising off 
the colombian coast the nassau carries a marine amphibious assault 
company that can be used in the case of an emergency 
colombian navy frogmen were checking the bay apparently looking 
for explosives near the spanish fortification where the presidents 
were meeting 
some cartagena residents saying they feared such an emergency

any trouble the colombians all of whom asked not to be 
identified said they feared possible attacks by drug traffickers 
as well as leftist guerrilla groups 
the government estimates there are 10000 rebel forces active in 
the country

like the student demonstrations at bogotas national university on 
wednesday about 100 hooded students threw rocks at police who had 
fired tear gas to break up the demonstration 
there were no injuries but several arrests were reported 
municipal officials decided to close area schools today they 
did not give a reason for their decision but some parents said 
they assumed it was because of the threat of violence 
the largest us school in the colombian capital of bogota the 
nueva granada school also was closed as a security precaution 
during a 1982 visit to bogota bush escaped an apparent 
assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried under the 
lone runway at the bogota airport the explosives were found hours 
after bushs plane took off and security officials discovered the 
dynamite was connected to wires running to an electrical generator 
300 yards away

perrier has ordered distributors worldwide to dump 
160 million bottles of its bubbly water because a toxic chemical 
may be contained in some shipments officials say the move will 
disrupt distribution for three months 
in yanking shipments from distribution in 120 countries perrier 
president gustave leven said officials dont want the least 
doubt as minimal as it might be to weigh on the image of the 
quality and purity of our product officials estimated the recall 
will cost the company 35 million 
earlier this week 72 million bottles of perrier were withdrawn 
from the us market after benzene was detected in tests by the 
us food and drug administration the recall was extended to 
canada and a japanese subsidiary said it would withdraw perrier 
from stores 
traces were also found earlier this week in samples from denmark 
and the netherlands prompting a recall there perriers 
distributor in australia today ordered the recall of 40000 cases 
leven told a news conference wednesday that the company halted 
distribution because halfmeasures were not possible 
managing director frederik zimmer said the benzene had passed 
through a dirty filter and made it into some shipments 
benzene a naturally occuring toxic chemical used in solvents 
entered the water in trace amounts when workers failed to change a 
pipe filter at perriers natural spring at vergeze in southern 
france company officials said 
perrier had known about the filter since sunday but had waited 
to assemble all the facts before publicizing the findings zimmer 
said 
french securities regulators meanwhile launched an 
investigation into recent trading of perrier stock 
a spokeswoman for the commission des operations de bourse said 
the probe will attempt to determine whether insider trading took 
place prior to the announcement the mineral water would be pulled 
from shelves in north america 
no indications have surfaced that insider trading took place 
the spokeswoman said but she noted that options volume on the 
companys shares was unusually high on friday 
zimmer said the company is advising importers to to dump about 
160 million bottles of the water on site and return the green 
bottles to the company for cleaning and refilling 
distribution should return to normal within three months zimmer 
said with the new bottles showing the date they were filled 
computercontrolled instruments will measure water purity to 
prevent a benzene recurrence 
the company will not issue a general recall in its home country 
after a preliminary ruling by health ministry officials that it 
poses no public danger leven said 
french distributors will decide independently whether to pull 
perrier off the shelves and ask the company for fresh shipments 
leven said 
zimmer ruled out industrial espionage and said disciplinary 
action has been taken against the workers involved he didnt 
elaborate 
the water and the natural carbon dioxide gas that makes it 
bubbly are normally separated underground then carried up separate 
pipes to the bottling facility zimmer said 
a filter on the gas pipe that cleans out benzene and other 
impurities had not been changed in several months zimmer said 
which caused a malfunctioning and allowed benzene to seep through 
we dont know exactly how long the filter had been there 
thats the problem said zimmer it was complete negligence 
toxicologists from the university of clermontferrand said that 
the amount of benzene found in samples it tested would pose a 
cancer threat only if consumers drank a liter per day for life 
the samples exceeded us standards of 5 parts per billion and 
european standards of 10 parts per billion zimmer said

with her historical origins unveiled 
cinderella started living happily ever after with a prince in a 
business suit and a missing glass slipper that turned out to be 
made of plastic 
a hilarious courtroom reunion between the hardworking fairy 
tale wench and her suitor occurred during a justforfun court 
session wednesday to determine the origin of the classic story 
the trial featured theories that walt disney had created 
cinderella to brainwash american women and claims the cinderella 
marketed by disney had appeared earlier in france italy and ninth 
century china 
but the height of the courtroom drama came when attorney frank 
winston jumped from his chair waving a clear highheeled 
slingback 
i think i have it i think i have it winston exclaimed and 
dashing to the witness stand where cinderella was testifying he 
slipped the shoe on her foot 
oh someday my prince will come said cinderella alias 
municipal judge diane elan wick who wore a blond wig patched 
dress clogs and carried a basket with three stuffed mice 
municipal judge george t choppelas ruled that while the tale 
that has delighted children all over the world stems from the 17th 
century story by french lawyer and writer charles perrault walt 
disney deserves credit as a folklorist for the american version 
perrault took the oral tradition and he changed it he adapted 
it to the times choppelas said at the 61st session of the court 
of historical review and appeals disney took the written version 
and made it an animated film he changed it around just like 
perrault 
representing the united states and walt disney was san francisco 
supervisor wendy nelder who termed cinderella the typical 
american ragstoriches story 
jo anne miller vice president of the san francisco board of 
education testified that the 1950 disney film was a part of a 
sinister plot to get women out of shipyards and factories and back 
behind the stove and ironing board after world war ii 
we were told that only when the prince comes will you life 
change and of course it doesnt she said 
glass or at least clear plastic slippers also are american 
argued nelder who reminisced with miller about the shoes they wore 
as adolescents 
they were great because you could clean them with windex 
miller said the last thing i have to say is if the shoe fits 
wear it 
winston while keeping his royal origins secret called 
witnesses to support his arguments that cinderella didnt come from 
hollywood 
we go back to 400 bc before cinderella he quipped 
in ninth century chinese stories the heroine transforms herself 
into a beauty with the bones of a dead fish in a neapolitan 
version zezolla is an abused child who mrders her evil stepmother 
only to be saddled with another 
gerald f uelmen dean of the school of law at santa clara 
university said most of the nowessential elements of the fairy 
tale including the pumpkin turned into a coach and mice changed 
into horses first appeared in perraults story cendrillon 
published in the 1697 collection tales of mother goose

a tehran newspaper thursday called on 
britain to apologize to world moslems for protecting british author 
salman rushdie from a yearold iranian death sentence 
the daily jomhuri islami also said the british government should 
condemn rushdies novel the satanic verses as blasphemous 
against islam and hand over the indianborn writer for execution 
on wednesday iranians celebrated the first anniversary of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis feb 14 ruling that rushdie should be 
killed for writing the novel 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus quoted 
the farsilanguage jomhuri islami as saying london could 
disentangle itself from the present controversy over rushdie 
this could be done by offering an apology to the moslem world 
for its past behavior in that connection by condemning the 
satanic verses and writer salman rushie and by surrendering him to 
world moslems it said 
jomhuri islami is considered aligned with the radical 
faction in iran which advocates preserving the purity of the 
islamic revolution and opposes renewing contacts with the west 
the iranians have condemned london for not handing over rushdie 
who is in hiding in britain under police guard 
iranian parliament speaker mahdi karrubi said wednesday that 
however much salman rushdie may be kept under guard eventually a 
moslem will carry out the edict 
all 12 members of the european economic community briefly 
recalled their ambassadors from tehran last year to protest the 
death sentence on rushdie irans relations were later normalized 
with all the countries except britain

italian authorities posted avalanche 
warnings throughout the south tyrol region of northern italy on 
thursday after nearly six feet of snow fell 
police said about 40 tourists were blocked by snow and strong 
winds in one hotel 
a huge snowslide shortly after dawn in the venosta valley 
damaged a chairlift and a restaurant at san valentino alla muta 
police said nobody was hurt 
snow slowed down traffic along the brenner highway and long 
lines of trucks formed at campo trens near the italianaustrian 
border 
authorities in bolzano said an avalanche hazard was likely to 
continue for several days as a result of an expected rise in 
temperatures which would result in ground not frozen hard enough 
to support the new snow 
the snow that fell this week ended a long dry spell that had 
hurt italys winter tourism industry 
in the alps of neighboring france which also received heavy 
snow recently four people died in avalanches in the past two days 
the victims were identified thursday as skiers from britain and 
france who died in avalanches in southeastern france one victim 
a 17yearold woman was killed when an avalanche swept her car 
from the road leading to the ski resort of les arc 
three other people were seriously injured when their cars were

a prisoner who starved himself for nearly a year 
to proclaim he was innocent of drug charges feasted on soda 
crackers cheese and freedom after the michigan court of appeals 
ordered him released 
rene acuna 37 who had vowed not to eat until he returned home 
began trying to rebuild his health and his life after the court 
wiped out a 100000 appeal bond and set him free tuesday evening 
i am here and i dont believe it he said wednesday as he 
sat on his living room couch with his daughter nuria 2 
the cuban immigrant was convicted march 3 1989 in macomb 
county circuit court of delivery and conspiracy to deliver more 
than 2 pounds of cocaine 
he was given two mandatory life sentences without parole and 
began his hunger strike a short time later subsisting on water and 
coffee with sugar he was forcefed for a time last fall and again 
monday and tuesday when prison doctors concluded his life was in 
danger 
prosecutors claim acuna was a lookout for drug dealers but 
acuna insists he was arrested in august 1988 only because he was a 
hispanic in a white neighborhood when undercover agents bought 
drugs from other hispanics 
the appeals court overturned the convictions for lack of 
evidence jan 23 but an appeal bond of 100000 still stood acuna 
continued to serve his sentences until this week when the appeals 
court reduced his bond 
prosecutors are appealing to the state supreme court to get his 
convictions reinstated but acuna said he believes the state 
supreme court will uphold the appeals courts decision to throw the 
convictions out 
i have something inside my soul acuna said when i pray 
to god i listened to the voice of god say you will be free be 
patient you will be free i know that you are innocent i am 
here 
i cant blame the american justice system no i can blame 
some persons who represented the american justice system in the 
wrong way 
carole murray chief of the drug unit in the macomb county 
prosecutors office said after acunas release my only comment 
is im sorry to see that 
murray said macomb county prosecutors still believe there was 
ample evidence to convict acuna and his bond should have been 
retained at 100000 to prevent him from fleeing 
theres always a concern when you have a large penalty that a 
defendant is facing she said 
acunas face was gaunt his cheeks sunken and his hair which 
had begun to fall out had been shaved off his weight was down 
from 180 to about 105 
i am happy i am nervous i feel like running i feel several 
emotions at the same time he said 
his lawyers marveled at acunas stamina during his 11month 
hunger strike 
this guy is the most courageous person ive ever met said 
paul denenfeld legal director for the michigan chapter of the 
american civil liberties union 
denenfeld said acunas convictions and the mandatory life 
sentences were symptoms of american hysteria over drugs 
i never expected him to live to see his case reversed said 
michael schuck attorney with the state appellate defenders 
office its extraordinary he survived a good six months on pure 
guts and the knowledge that he was innocent 
the longest hunger strike ever according to the guinness book 
of world records is a 385day strike in 197273 staged by an 
englishman who said he was wrongly charged with rape like acuna 
that man was forcefed by tube

the florida supreme court today 
unanimously upheld a state rule requiring shrimp fishermen in 
florida waters to use devices designed to keep sea turtles from 
getting killed in their nets 
turtle excluder devices are like trap doors that let sea 
turtles which need to surface to breathe escape drowning in 
shrimp nets some shrimpers argue that teds also let enough shrimp 
out to put them out of business 
the rule was approved by gov bob martinez and the cabinet in 
august as an emergency measure to help save endangered species of 
sea turtles the temporary rule the court reviewed expired last 
week but the governor and cabinet also have approved a permanent 
rule requiring the use of teds 
the challenge to the state rule was brought by david davis the 
first shrimper cited under it he argued that the florida marine 
fisheries commission had overstepped its authority in writing the 
measure and that the state legislature was the only body that could 
properly make such rules 
a franklin county judge agreed with davis on nov 27 and found 
the rule invalid the state appealed to the 1st district court of 
appeal which labeled the issue one of great public importance 
and passed it along to the states high court 
charles shelfer general counsel for the state fisheries 
commission said officials will seek to have challenges to the 
permanent rule thrown out as a result of todays decision 
we are very pleased and feel in some respect vindicated by the 
supreme court action he said adding that for florida this 
pretty much settles it 
the federal government also has rules requiring shrimpers to use 
teds but shelfer said that unlike the federal rules the florida 
rule would require the use of teds yearround in all parts of 
florida the federal rules require teds yearround in some florida 
waters but only in certain seasons in other areas off florida 
davis still faces trial on the charge punishable by up to 60 
days in jail and a 500 fine 
i disagree with that but theyre the supreme court said j 
patrick floyd an attorney for davis 
im surprised and very disappointed because it appeared clear 
that the marine fisheries commissions power does not include 
dealing with endangered species he said

president bush held securityshrouded 
summit talks today with leaders of latin americas three major 
cocaineproducing nations hoping for a fruitful and productive 
exchange on intensifying their war against drugs 
we shall move forward in spite of the sacrifices that we have 
had to take declared colombian president virgilio barco who 
welcomed bush and the presidents of peru and bolivia to the summit 
site at a heavily guarded naval base 
no we will not weaken we will not let the deaths of 
thousands of colombians be in vain said barco whose country has 
been ravaged by bombings assassinations and other violence from 
drug lords and leftist guerrillas 
at midmorning the four leaders strolled briefly in 85degree 
heat along the shore of cartagena bay admiring the panoramic 
skyline of the sundrenched city in the distance before they 
entered the rugged old stone fort manzanillo to begin their talks 
moments before air force one landed safely in colombia bush 
told reporters that its going to be a good meeting because 
its four countries cooperating in the fight against drugs 
security was extraordinarily tight around the summit site 
patrol boats sped along the shore with machine guns pointed inland 
and a colombian frigate was stationed just off the peninsula 
across cartagena bay the wharves were empty and the streets of 
this resort city normally backed with traffic and pedestrians 
were virtually abandoned 
bush arrived in a swarm of five helicopters possibly to thwart 
the possibility of an attack later while standing next to barco 
bush was asked if he were afraid afraid of what he replied 
absolutely not absolutely not 
in a statement issued after his arrival bush said the summit 
would produce a broad flexible framework which will guide the 
actions of the four hemispheric countries in their battle against 
drug traffickers 
barco said there was a need to provide viable economic 
alternatives to those who grow coca plants the raw material for 
cocaine the only law that the narcoterrorists do not break is 
the law of supply and demand the colombian president said 
before he left washington at dawn after a nights sleep aboard 
air force one parked in a hangar bush said in a published 
interview that the drug summits success will be measured by a 
reduction in cocaine production and thats going to take some 
time 
during the 4hour flight to colombia bush refused comment on 
an nbc report that barco had promised not to extradite drug lords 
to the united states if they agreed to turn their cocaine 
laboratories over to the bogota government 
bush landed without incident at the caribbean port city of 
barranquilla and flew 60 miles southwest by helicopter with a small 
group of top aides to a restored 17th century fort in cartagena 
where the sixhour summit took place 
at cartagena bush walked down a red carpet with barco and shook 
hands with his other summit partners presidents jaime paz zamora 
of bolivia and alan garcia of peru who was accompanied to 
cartagena but not the summit talks by two coca producers whom 
he invited along as observers 
us warships patrolled offshore and 5000 colombian troops 
provided security for the summiteers bush pronounded the us 
security arrangements as first class weve got the best the 
best 
arriving in cartagena garcia said he would seek a new era of 
hemispheric cooperation in the drug war we have come to make up 
for lost time he said 
a colombian radio report said police were investigating the 
early morning explosion of an electrical transformer near the 
cartagena airport which reportedly was left without electricity 
such incidents occur occasionally in colombia because of power 
surges 
the latinamerican leaders planned to seek expanded us 
economic aid to ease their farmers shift from lucrative coca 
plants used to produce cocaine to growing legal crops but 
white house officials hinted that any new us offer would be 
modest 
one plan reportedly would include 30 million in assistance 
including technical advice from visiting us teams of agricultural 
experts we dont have unlimited resources said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
in an interview published in todays editions of the newspaper 
usa today bush said reducing us demand for drugs the strategy 
stressed by the andean nations was only part of the problem 
as for cocagrowing farmers in colombia or peru bush had this 
advice grow another crop grow one that has a useful purpose and 
not an immoral purpose in the world 
some strains were evident before the summit began garcia had 
threatened to boycott in protest of the us invasion of panama 
then invited a group of coca growers to attend with him and 
ultimately delayed his arrival until today the colombian and 
bolivian presidents arrived wednesday 
the bush administration has said it will ask congress to approve 
22 billion in aid to the three countries through 1995 to help 
them fight drug traffickers including a 206 million increase for 
next year 
coca reduction in exchange for development that is our 
premise paz zamora said earlier this week 
garcia was quoted this week as saying massive economic 
resources are needed to switch crops because coca is enormously 
important to our economy 
the four leaders planned to issue a joint statement following 
the meeting that officials said would include a us pledge to help 
track illegal export of usmade firearms and crack down on 
drugrelated chemical shipments 
us ambassador thomas e mcnamara said both the united states 
and colombia must act more aggressively to halt the flow into 
colombia of us semiautomatic weapons which are favored by drug 
traffickers 
i think we can do more to control the export of firearms and 
cololmbia can do more to monitor imports mcnamara told reporters 
in remarks that appeared to conflict with bushs opposition to 
tighter export controls on such weapons 
two us warships were cruising along colombias coast while 
colombian patrol boats a colombian submarine and a frigate were in 
cartagena bay helicopter gunships flew continually over the 
meeting site and colombian marines searched vehicles at roadblocks 
nonetheless bush was traveling with a sharply reduced staff 
because of concerns for his safety fitzwater said the purpose was 
to eliminate any excess personnel and for security reasons to 
simply not have any more people there than is absolutely 
necessary he said 
in december there was a report that colombian drug lords had 
taken a 30 million contract on bushs life 
bushs visit was denounced wednesday by colombias four main 
labor federations which condemned the us invasion of panama 
workers marched in bogota the capital and medelin home of the 
powerful colombian drug cartel 
meanwhile two us citizens remained in the hands of leftist 
guerrillas who kidnapped them in the drug capital of medellin on 
tuesday to protest the bush visit

prime minister ingvar carlsson 
submitted the resignation of his social democratic government today 
after losing a vote in parliament over an economic rescue bill 
five opposition parties from communists to conservatives 
united to kill the plan calling for a twoyear freeze on wages and 
prices and restrictions on strikes the government proposed the 
bill to quell escalating wage demands and labor strife 
the vote was 190153 endorsing a committee resolution to reject 
the governments plan six members were absent 
immediately following the vote carlsson went to the chamber of 
speaker thage g peterson to hand in his resignation swedish radio 
and the national news agency tt reported 
the resignation set off what could be an extended period of 
haggling to create a new government if unsuccessful an early 
election will be required 
commentators said carlsson was the only politician capable of 
forming a new government since his social democrats and communists 
together could block any nonsocialist coalition 
in an earlier speech carlsson said his plan was intended to 
guarantee continued full employment the basis of a fair 
society 
if the five opposition parties together reject the social 
democratic proposals then mr speaker the government will 
resign carlsson had said winning applause from the packed 
chamber and the spectators gallery 
the vote came after several hours of debate 
all opposition parties said they objected to the measures we 
happily reject these proposals which no one believes in said 
carl bildt leader of the centerright moderate party daring 
carlsson to call an immediate election 
carlsson would remain head of a caretaker government while 
peterson consulted on the formation of another government 
the assignment could be given to a coalition of centerright 
opposition parties or carlsson himself could be asked to try 
again 
if no one succeeded an election would be called 35 to 90 days 
after efforts broke down the next scheduled election is in 
september 1991 
the social democrats who have governed sweden for 51 of the 
last 58 years unveiled the wageprice freeze last week to suppress 
a convulsion of strikes 
all swedens banks have been closed for nearly three weeks 
drying up retail business and threatening major industries with 
liquidity and supply problems 
a potentially crippling strike of preschool teachers nurses 
and other municipal employees was suspended until next week 
carlsson said the labor chaos was throwing the economy off 
balance adding that sweden cannot afford to meet the wage demands 
salaries rose 28 percent over the last three years while 
production grew an average 2 percent he said 
the measures were designed to curb an inflation rate heading 
toward 9 percent about double the european average economists 
have blamed the low unemployment of just over 1 percent for adding 
inflationary pressures 
carlsson said the opposition is so splintered that swedens 
economic crisis would be compounded by a political crisis if the 
social democrats were forced out of office 
a political crisis might be created that leads to paralysis 
uncertainty and insecurity and that is the last thing sweden needs 
today he said 
the social democrats control 156 seats in the 349member 
riksdag usually working in cooperation with the 20seat communist 
party 
the three centerright parties have a total of 152 seats and 
the balance is held by the environment party

a mother of four and her boyfriend were sentenced 
today to life in prison for the tortureslaying of the womans 
4yearold son and the beating of his brother both of whom were 
hung upside down in closets for hours 
alicia abraham 28 and johnny campbell 40 were sentenced by 
cook county circuit judge michael b getty who had called the case 
the most heinous brutally sadistic torture and murder that i 
have ever heard in my 6 years as a judge my over 10 years as a 
prosecutor or indeed my 51 years on this earth 
in sentencing them today to life imprisonment with no chance of 
parole getty said campbell is mentally ill and ms abraham had not 
participated directly in the death of her son making them 
ineligible for the death penalty 
assistant cook county states attorney james bigoness had argued 
that death by lethal injection is the only only just sentence 
for both defendants 
defense attorneys acknowledged the crimes were horrible but 
urged the judge to spare their clients lives 
campbells attorney allan sincox said campbell is psychotic 
and argued that sentencing him to death would be cruel and 
unusual punishment 
clyde lemons jr ms abrahams attorney said she never 
committed any of the acts that led to lattie mcgees death 
lattie was starved burned with a hot iron stuck with pins and 
needles singed with cigarettes beaten with a tree branch hair 
brush belt and hands scalded with steaming water and tied up 
with a clothesline rope and tights for 2 months in the familys 
south side apartment during the summer of 1987 court records 
showed 
a severe blow to his head on aug 14 1987 was the eventual 
cause of death a pathologist from the county medical examiners 
office testified 
latties 8yearold brother cornelius abraham testified that 
campbell had twice tied him up with a rope and hung him upside down 
in the closet once for two days 
cornelius said campbell had taken a hot iron and put it on my 
brothers chest and he put that iron on my butt 
the boy said his mother was in the living room watching tv 
at the time 
he told of seeing campbell tie latties wrists to his ankles and 
hang him upside down in the closet once cornelius said his 
mother helped tie up lattie 
campbell a vietnam veteran exsteel worker and heavy drug and 
alcohol user pleaded guilty in december to firstdegree murder and 
aggravated battery he said he beat the boys to curb what he 
thought was homosexual behavior 
ms abraham pleaded innocent contending that she never actively 
abused the children 
but prosecutors said she never tried to stop campbell and getty 
convicted her of the same charges jan 11 
there can be no question that when a mother puts her child 
into an alligator pit that the mother has condemned that child to 
death the judge said 
the boys father lattie mcgee sr has custody of cornelius 
ms abrahams other two children by another man now live with 
their paternal grandmother

a senior nato official suggested 
thursday that a united germany remain in the alliance but with 
both soviet and western military forces stationed in its territory 
the remarks by henning wegener assistant nato secretarygeneral 
for political affairs rankled a visiting delegation of soviet 
legislators 
valentin falin head of the soviet delegation proposed in 
response that the germanys be reunited within the warsaw pact and 
asked wegener a west german how would you like that 
the soviet union wants a future german state to be neutral but 
the united states and its allies want the reunified country in the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
a united germany should not only firmly remain in nato as a 
full member but there must also be reassuring arrangements for 
soviet and east european security interests wegener told a 
conference sponsored by the north atlantic assembly made up of 
legislators from the 16 nato nations 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany has 
proposed nato membership for a single germany but with only west 
german territory tied to its military structure and no nato forces 
in what is now east germany 
wegener said officials of the western alliance can very much 
imagine a transitional model where the transition times could be 
long of dual stationing of forces in the two halves of germany 
one belonging to the soviet union and the other to the nato 
alliance 
all of germany would be politically part of nato and none of 
its parts belonging to the warsaw treaty organization he said 
his suggestion prompted discussion in the soviet delegation 
which included gen vladimir lobov chief of the sevennation 
warsaw pacts general staff 
falin said later it was improper to think beforehand that you 
will be better at reading our own interests than we are and 
asked wegener 
would you like this option the warsaw treaty organization 
includes politically the entire united germany and takes on a 
commitment not to place its own military forces on the territory 
of west germany 
how would you like that 
wegener replied i challenge you put it to the test with the 
german electorate in each country and later on in both of them 
together and then lets see what comes out of it 
us gen john galvin the top nato commander in europe said 
earlier there was definitely precedent for a nation staying 
within the north atlantic alliance under special considerations 
he did not mention possible arrangements for a united germany 
but noted that some nato members have special status 
spain and france refuse to link their forces to the joint 
military structure 
norway one of two nato nations bordering the soviet union is 
in the military structure but does not allow foreign troops to be 
stationed on its soil or let alliance forces conduct maneuvers in 
the extreme north near the soviet frontier 
no nato forces are stationed in turkey the other member on the 
soviet border 
the point is there are many different arrangements that have 
been made galvin said i dont think we should forget that

fishermen and others whose 
business depends on a beautiful coastline fear the oil spill that 
is coating the beach with gooey alaskan crude will cost them their 
livelihood 
theres a lot of people who are going to sue said dan 
mccafferty of the dory fleet a cooperative of 20 fisherman at 
newport beach its ruined our business the fishing here will 
never be the same as it was 
mccafferty and several others plan to seek compensation from 
british petroleum america inc which owned the oil and chartered 
the american trader and the tankers owner american trading 
transportation co 
a classaction lawsuit was filed tuesday in los angeles seeking 
compensation for damage and economic losses caused by the spill and 
the alleged failure to properly clean up the oil among the 
defendants named were british petroleum and american trading 
fish sales in the huntington and newport beach areas have come 
to a virtual halt since the american trader spilled 400000 gallons 
of crude feb 7 as the tanker tried to moor about two miles 
offshore 
people heard about the oil spill and immediately assumed we 
were fishing in the oil said fisherman matt breneman 22 
weve had the freshest fish for years said mike steven 
long a linebaiter with dory fleet now our reputation is 
ruined 
oil had washed ashore and percolated as deep as 3 feet into the 
sand by wednesday along about a 12mile stretch from bolsa chica 
state beach to newport beach according to cleanup officials 
its a sad thing because theres these little sand turtles 
that the birds eat and theyre all dead said ralph gray 27 in 
balboa about 10 miles south of huntington beach 
volunteers and others had found 153 dead birds at last count 
and wildlife rescue workers were trying to save another 329 oiled 
fowl said tom paulek of the california department of fish and game 
by evening no oil was visible to coast guard boats at sea said 
newport beach police sgt andy gonis but a sheen was visible on 
coastline breakers 
many feared that a week of closed beaches had caused 
irreversible damage 
i lost my 750dollar apartment in costa mesa in just four 
days said newport beach linebaiter mike steven long usually 
in that time i make enough to pay my rent now im on the streets 
living here where i work 
trips to catalina and whalewatching excursions were halted as 
access to the ocean was cut off 
what happens if the beaches stay closed asked real estate 
agent dinah lewis are my customers going to get their money 
back 
business improved for some beachfront restaurants because of the 
influx of wrk crews journalists and officials 
i feel sort of like a vulture because my fishermen friends are 
suffering said mike leigh owner of the newport sea shack but 
its been real good for us 
cleanup workers also were benefiting from the spill making 
about 10 an hour and more at overtime rates 
one man capitalizing on the spill was larry sakhrani owner of 
michaels surf and sport in huntington beach for 1295 each 
sakhrani was selling white tshirts with bold black letters that 
read crude is rude dude

the united states should do more 
to control the export of semiautomatic weapons into colombia that 
end up in the hands of drug traffickers us ambassador thomas e 
mcnamara said thursday 
mcnamara acknowledged that the availability of these usmade 
weapons aggravates the drug problem 
president bush has voiced opposition to new laws controlling the 
manufacture or export of semiautomatic weapons claiming laws 
already on the books are adequate 
at the same time he has acted to ban the import into the united 
states of the same type of weapons 
mcnamara speaking with reporters covering bushs visit to a 
fournation drug summit in nearby cartagena said i think we can 
do more to control the export of firearms and colombia can do more 
to monitor imports 
he said that the problem of us guns reaching colombian drug 
traffickers was mainly a smuggling operation us law 
generally limits sale of such usmade weapons only to other 
governments although there is a process under which others can 
acquire the weapons by obtaining end use certificates from the 
us goverrnment 
mcnamara said thursdays conference among bush and the 
presidents of colombia bolivia and peru went beyond just symbolism 
you have all four presidents sitting down for a day talking 
about the drug fight thats more than symbolism he said for 
the first time well have a coordinated strategy in the four 
countries involved 
mcnamara said the colombians were taking pride in being able 
to host a quiet calm meeting

sophia loren and husband carlo 
ponti have found a new residence in this village after having to 
quit the tiny apartment listed for tax reasons as their official 
home 
their landlord alois blaettler confirmed thursday he gave the 
couple notice to leave the furnished two rooms plus kitchen and 
bath because his daughter wanted to move in 
they hardly ever saw the place anyway blaettler said 
village secretary ernst minder said the couple easily found a new 
equally modest home in the village which has a population of 4000 
fan letters to the new address are unlikely to be answered

the state department rebuked nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega on thursday for threatening to seize 
opposition leaders property including an antisandinista 
newspaper if his party wins national elections this month 
deputy spokesman richard boucher called on ortega to commit his 
leftist sandinista party to respect the political civil and 
human rights of opposition parties 
if we win ortega told a campaign rally wednesday night i 
say we will hand them a complete bill so they will be left without 
a newspaper la prensa and the homes of the candidate and the 
vice presidential candidate will be converted into childrens homes 
on the day after the elections 
boucher expressed concern about the statement and said that 
under international agreements signed by ortega elections are 
envisioned as a first step in a national reconciliation process 
ortegas threat was in response to a recent speech by opposition 
vice presidential candidate virgilio godoy who said if the 
14party opposition coalition wins the feb 25 election we are 
going to make the sandinistas pay the bills one by one for 
alleged violations of human civil and political rights 
the opposition newspaper la prensa is owned by the family of 
ortegas main rival in the election violeta chamorro 
about 17 million voters will choose a president and vice 
president a national assembly municipal councils for 144 towns 
and two regional councils for the atlantic coast 
meanwhile president bush said in an interview with usa today 
that he would not try to oust ortega as he did manuel antonio 
noriega in panama even if he concludes ortega has stolen the 
elections 
no he said in response to a question theres a lot of 
nonelected leaders around the world that can sleep comfortable 
pressed on that point bush called the line of questioning too 
hypothetical but the answer is no 
if youre talking about an effort to protect american life or 
something the signal should be loud and clear ill do whats 
necessary to protect american lives but if youre saying i dont 
like the results of an election and will be use military force the 
answer is no

about 5000 teachers skipped school 
thursday staging a rally on the capitol steps laying siege to the 
house of delegates and picketing the governors mansion in their 
battle for higher pay 
state troopers were called in to patrol the aisles of the house 
after teachers pounded on the doors of the chamber and chanted 
let us in 
at a rally on the capitol steps the teachers criticized gov 
gaston caperton for not including teacher pay raises in his 15 
billion budget proposal for 199091 
caperton said he was not surprised by their frustration but 
you cant pay people when you dont have the money 
the governor invited union leaders to meet with him thursday 
but they refused a spokesman said instead the governor met 
informally with about a dozen teachers allowed into the mansion 
while hundreds of others stood outside 
the union said west virginia ranks 49th in the nation in teacher 
pay the average teachers salary in the state is 21904 
teachers are also upset with what they say is inadequate funding 
of the teachers retirement system which has a deficit estimated at 
up to 3 billion and with proposals to charge premiums for health 
coverage

researchers using an intricate manipulation 
of genes and transplantation of bone marrow have produced a mouse 
that suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia giving 
scientists a new way to test therapies against the killer disease 
in a report to be published friday in the magazine science 
researchers at the whitehead institute for biomedical research said 
they have discovered a way to give chronic myelogenous leukemia 
cml to laboratory mice cml is a form of leukemia that usually 
attacks adults and is only rarely cured 
with this new animal model experimental therapies that might 
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these 
mice said george daley lead researcher in the study at 
whitehead you obviously can do more with the mice than you could 
with human patients 
daley said the study also proves that cml is initiated by the 
fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes a finding that had 
been suggested by earlier studies in other laboratories those 
parts have been identified as the socalled abl gene from 
chromosome 9 and a gene called bcr from chromosome 22 
cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein called 
p210 that changes healthy cells into cancer cells 
daley said his study showed that transferring the bcrabl gene 
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into 
healthy mice could produce cml in those mice 
it answers a question of basic science that is what causes 
the disease said daley we now know that the bcrabl gene is 
sufficient to induce the leukemia 
he said it is still not known precisely what causes the two 
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene but a high 
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor 
dr george canellos chief of medical oncology at the 
danafarber institute in boston described the whitehead finding as 
an important advance in understanding the disease 
he said the new animal model of the disease possibly may help 
scientists find ways to block the action of the p210 protein 
produced by the bcrabl gene thus preventing the disease 
daley said that the mouse can be used to test biological 
inhibitors that would prevent the p210 protein from transforming 
normal cells into cancers such inhibitors formally could only be 
tested on human patients a process that could take years with a 
mouse model of the disease experiments can be speeded up and can 
be more extensive 
to create the mouse model daley said he and his collegues 
inserted the human bcrabl gene into a virus normal mouse bone 
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus which transferred the 
gene into the marrow cells 
thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone 
marrow cells the bone marrow carrying the bcrabl gene was then 
transplanted into the 30 mice 
within five months 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease 
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia 
cml in humans can be controlled by chemotherpy for 3 to 5 years 
this remission period usually ends with the sudden increase in 
abnormal cells a disease phase called blast crisis that 
usually results in death the only successful therapy now is to 
kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with 
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor but even this 
treatment often fails 
daley said that continued studies of the cml mice shows that 
many of the laboratory animals develop the blast crisis phase 
of the disease this he said is further verification that the 
course of the disease in the mice is similar to cml in humans 
coauthors of the study with daley were richard a van etten and 
david baltimore both of the whitehead institute science which 
published the study is the journal of the american association for 
the advancement of science

opposition leaders accused chancellor 
helmut kohl on thursday of using the east german crisis to enhance 
his political standing and secure a place in history as the man who 
unified germany 
during a raucous insultfilled parliament session kohl in turn 
accused the opposition of being allied with the old communists who 
ruled east germany with an iron fist 
the chancellor also came under fire in east germany where the 
communistled government accused kohl of exaggerating the countrys 
economic and political problems to speed reunification 
the verbal brawl in parliament gave west german voters a preview 
of what is likely to be a bitter campaign for west german elections 
in december and the pivotal role reunification will play 
the west german campaign is even influencing the campaign for 
east germanys first free elections march 18 in anticipation of 
eventual reunification west german parties have been aligning 
themselves with and in fact influence the fledgling political 
parties in east germany 
kohl outlined to parliament his weekend talks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on reunification he said both 
agreed the march 18 elections when the communist government 
likely will be ousted were a key to reunification 
i was able to underscore my firm belief to gorbachev that 
the result of the elections will not only be a democratic and 
negotiationscapable government but also a government program with 
the clear goal unity as soon as possible said kohl 
kohl said his talks set the course for unification 
never before since the division of our land have we been 
so close to our goal kohl told parliament 
hansjochen vogel head of the main opposition social democrats 
accused kohl of providing too little financial help for east 
germany and of using unification for his own political benefit 
you have talked awakened hopes set conditions and 
meditated over your place in the history books but there hasnt 
been much help said vogel 
vogel also said kohl was wrong to speak about a historic 
breakthrough from his talks with gorbachev and said that 
gorbachev already had said the soviets supported germans right to 
selfdetermination before the talks 
if we are to speak about a historic breakthrough then it was 
this decision of mikhail gorbachev said vogel 
kohls address was interrupted several times as he lambasted the 
social democrats for having close contacts with east germanys 
nowdisgraced communists during years past 
you were allied with these people said kohl also charging 
that the social democrats did not favor german unification until it 
became politically expedient 
vogel reminded kohl that his own christian democrats are now 
supporting the east german christian democrats who for years were 
allied with the communists 
mr chancellor whoever supports the east christian 
democrats which for 40 years went along with everything the 
communists said has no right to point the finger at the social 
democrats said vogel 
in east berlin east german government spokesman wolfgang meyer 
also accused bonn of overdramatizing the political and economic 
situation in east germany in an attempt to speed unification 
the kohl government has said that more than 2000 east germans 
daily are fleeing west as the east german economy nears collapse 
a key issue to reunification is whether a new german state would 
be neutral east germany is a key member of the soviet warsaw pact 
and west germany is a strategic component of nato 
kohl and the united states want what at least is now west 
germany to remain in nato while the soviets want a neutral germany 
earlier this week the germanys and the four world war ii allies 
the soviet union the united states britain and france agreed 
to talks on reunification that will deal with the alliance issue 
in east berlin government spokesman wolfgang myers attacked 
kohl for failing to assure poles that a united germany will not try 
to reclaim large chunks of formerly german land was assigned to 
poland after nazi germany was defeated during world war ii 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher rejected 
polands request to be included in the talks but he said the 
discussions will address polish concerns 
kohl eager to garner the rightwing vote has failed to give an 
unequivocal rejection of any possible territorial claims 
in the latest nationwide polls kohl was leading the social 
democrats by about six points a poll last august before the 
historic developments in east germany showed the leftleaning 
social democrats and kohls conservative christian democrats nearly 
even 
but the social democrats overwhelmed kohls christian democrats 
in recent saarland state elections and the chancellors party is 
still trying to recover from the defeat

vice president dan quayle often the voice of 
skepticism within the white house toward the soviet union said 
thursday he has changed his opinion about the communist state 
i would say anybody that has not changed their mind over the 
last six or seven months is not thinking correctly he said of 
the fastchanging reforms that mikhail s gorbachev has ushered in 
in moscow 
of course you change your opinion quayle said after a 
reporter asked if he remained suspicious of gorbachevs intentions 
a lot of things have happened and i have a different 
assessment of where the soviet union is heading and where it may or 
may not go than i did six months ago or a year ago 
quayle spoke outside the greater southeast community hospital 
where he visited a ward filled with boarder babies infants 
abandoned at birth by drugabusing mothers 
quayle made the hospital visit on the same morning president 
bush was off at the drug summit in colombia to dramatize what the 
vice president called the end of the drug pipeline 
this is the end of the pipeline right here as it comes out of 
the fields in peru or colombia or bolivia of elsewhere and comes 
through the system the end result is a baby that is born dependant 
upon drugs said quayle 
what i have just seen is the human tragedy of drugs 
anybody that advocates the legalization of drugs saying it is a 
victimless crime i suggest that they go up and tour this hospital 
and see those boarder babies with me he said 
at the hospital quayle picked up 5monthold kevin and held a 
19monthold boarder baby dougie who was rescued from an unsafe 
home five months ago the hospital has 11 boarder babies whose care 
can cost up to 100000 a year apiece most were born inheriting 
their mothers addiction to cocaine or other hard drugs 
hospital officials voiced concern that they were having 
difficulties making ends meet especially due to cuts in the 
medicaid and medicare programs 
quayle said i reassured them of our commitment wouldnt we 
like to do more of course we would but were dealing with a 
strained budget environment 
quayle who has generally struck a skeptical and hardline view 
toward the soviet union said in a dec 4 newspaper interview after 
bushs summit with gorbachev at malta that i dont think theyve 
changed much in foreign policy and youre still dealing with a 
totalitarian government 
he later said that authoritarian was a more fitting 
adjective than totalitarian to describe the soviet union 
gorbachev this week agreed to bushs proposal for dramatic 
reductions in us and soviet forces in europe limiting both sides 
to 195000 troops in central europe and allowing the united states 
to keep 30000 elsewhere in europe 
quayle also visited jacqueline mitchells home in a largely 
poor black neighborhood north of the us capitol where she and 
other neighbors have banded together to keep drug dealers and 
customers from the suburbs out of their street 
after chatting in the mitchell living room with members of the 
neighborhood watch group quayle shook hands with residents out on 
the street and advised three young men dont let the 
drugdealers in just keep them out

the agriculture department said thursday that 
fertilizer prices are going up as spring planting approaches but 
probably wont be as high as a year ago 
according to a preliminary report by the departments economic 
research service fertilizer prices may be up 4 percent from last 
fall but despite the increase spring prices may be down about 4 
percent from yearearlier levels 
planted areas of corn and wheat the major fertilizerusing 
crops will probably increase by 1 percent to 5 percent the 
report said decreases in planted acreage are anticipated for 
soybeans 
analysts said supplies of nitrogen phosphate and potash should 
be enough to meet 1990 requirements although greater nitrogen 
imports will more than make up for lower domestic production 
nitrogen prices will likely show the greatest increase since 
last fall as domestic supplies tighten the report said 
phosphate supplies should be sufficient to meet demand at 
moderately higher prices than last fall even with a slight 
reduction in domestic production 
potash inventories are expected to be available at stable to 
slightly lower prices than last fall if price cuts initiated by 
canadian producers continue the report said

african national congress movement and other black opposition 
groups de klerk has said he wants to negotiate a powersharing 
agreement with south africas black majority which currently has 
no voice in national affairs

the government said thursday it would 
have the flight data recorder of a crashed indian airlines jetliner 
analyzed in a country other than france where the airbus a320 was 
manufactured 
at least 91 of the 146 on the 3monthold jetliner were killed 
when it crashed wednesday in clear weather short of the airport 
at bangalore officials said there were no signs of an emergency on 
board 
the times of india quoted unidentified aviation sources as 
saying the sophisticated plane which had logged 366 flying hours 
may have crashed because the pilot tried to change the mode of 
control from computer to manual or viceversa 
it said the response time of the inflight computer for doing 
this is five to six seconds and indicated that amount of time 
could be crucial in landing 
another paper the hindustan times of new delhi said the 
instruments may have indicated the wrong altitude for the jet both 
the pilot and the copilot died in the crash 
science report said the a320 has a preprogrammed envelope 
protection software that tells the computer and not the pilot 
to make judgments 
if the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision 
the report said the system would not let the airplane respond 
beyond a certain rate 
aviation minister arif mohammed khan told a news conference in 
bangalore southern india since the airbus belongs to france we 
would like to send the data recorder to some other country for 
decoding 
the plane was made by airbus industrie a european consortium 
based in toulouse france 
khan said preliminary reports on the cause of the crash would be 
available within 36 hours united news of india reported he has 
ordered separate inquiries by a high court judge and aviation 
authorities 
this kind of crash can happen either because of equipment 
error or human error or navigational error khan said the 
cockpit voice recorder is being sent to delhi and its contents will 
be known within 36 hours 
a us embassy official in new delhi said one american on the 
plane was killed one was missing and five were known to have 
survived the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
identities would not be released until their families had been 
notified 
john mancosky 28 of chicago said the plane began to shake 
about five minutes before the crash and he thought at first the 
pilot had made a hard landing 
then we heard a loud booming noise and soon we were enveloped 
in a ball of flame said mancosky who suffered a broken leg 
like most of the survivors he escaped through the rear door 
this was the second accident involving an a320 and the first in 
commercial service three people were killed and 50 injured when an 
a320 crashed at an airshow in eastern france in june 1988 
the twinengined narrowbodied jet is the first civilian 
airliner with a fully computerized flight control system

private property was a hated concept for 
generations of communists but soviet lawmakers were asked by 
government leaders on thursday to legalize it not condemn it 
if we want to have a market economy and take part in the 
international marketplace then we need such a law justice 
minister veniamin f yakovlev said in defense of a bill designed to 
establish private property rights 
mikhail s gorbachevs nearly fiveyear tenure as soviet leader 
has led to numerous upheavals in politics and society but few 
official proposals have the ideological sweep of the proposed 
property law submitted to the supreme soviet legislature 
citizens who were taught for generations that in the words of 
19thcentury french philosopher pierre joseph proudhon property 
is theft are now being asked to accept private ownership along 
with two other forms of property already in existence collective 
and state ownership 
because of ideological squeamishness the 35article bill 
debated on the second day of the supreme soviets 1990 winter 
session never uses the words private property outright 
instead it speaks of the property of citizens 
the words private property cause an allergy in us all one 
lawmaker acknowledged from the tribune 
fellow deputy leonid i sukhov a taxi driver from the ukrainian 
city of kharkov said the measure would provoke such a turnabout in 
law and lifestyle that it should be put to a nationwide referendum 
we have to ask the people sukhov said the people know 
better 
the driver said he would vote against the measure because it 
would worsen the lives of average soviets already hardpressed to 
cope with chronic shortages of food and consumer goods inadequate 
salaries and inflation 
in 1848 marx and engels the ideological fathers of communism 
said they could sum up their theory in a single phrase the 
abolition of private property for decades soviet orthodoxy has 
forbidden the private ownership of farms factories or equipment on 
a large scale seeing in such ownership the roots of economic 
exploitation 
but the proposed property law legalizes individual ownership of 
means of production without defining that term and says 
foreign firms once scorned as agents of imperialism or 
neocolonialism can own factories and buildings on soviet soil 
the bill would allow foreigners to enjoy the same rights as 
soviet citizens in owning property citizens could own stocks and 
bonds 
it follows last weeks historic measures by the communist party 
leadership to allow other parties to compete for power the party 
also laid the groundwork for the property bill by approving the 
concept in its revised platform 
the law is designed to spur the stagnating soviet economy 
through the greater productivity that private enterprise is now 
recognized to offer over stateowned factories and businesses and 
by encouraging western capital 
a companion bill on the legislatures winter agenda the law on 
land provides for the private ownership of land 
after its first reading before the 542member supreme soviet 
last fall the property law underwent substantial revision with at 
least 10000 changes suggested the official tass news agency said 
despite the revisions the bill drew fire from 30 lawmakers who 
demanded a fiveminute chance to air their views 
vavil nosov a machineoperator from the komi region of northern 
russia said he feared that if the buying and selling of land is 
allowed the beneficiaries will be black marketeers with illegal 
fortunes 
a lawmaker from soviet central asia worried aloud that if water 
resources like rivers and lakes become the property of local 
administrative bodies water might be diverted from his parched 
homeland 
conflict also arose over who now owns natural resources the 
national government or the individual soviet republics the issue 
was skirted in the draft in favor of phrasing that says the land 
and its resources belong to people living on a given territory 
that issue is critical because the legislature in lithuania has 
already adopted laws allowing the sale of land to individuals 
debate was to continue friday with the law on land also on the 
agenda

imports accounted for an alltime high of 54 
percent of the nations petroleum consumption last month the 
american petroleum institute said thursday 
although the recordhigh level was spurred in part by a bitter 
cold snap across much of the nation in december that increased 
demand for heating fuel officials said they feared it could signal 
a trend toward monthly imports of at least 50 percent 
imports last accounted for more than half of the countrys 
petroleum consumption in july which marked the first time they had 
crossed the 50 percent level in 12 years 
the surge in petroleum imports last month comes during a 
continued slowdown in domestic drilling activity prompting a call 
for congressional consideration of a plan to ensure that the united 
states does not become dependent on foreign sources for more than 
half its oil consumption 
monthly oil imports have exceeded 50 percent only four times 
last july when they reached 504 percent in march and july 1977 
when they hit 518 percent of consumption and in may 1977 when 
the level reached 505 percent

a pilot admitted thursday to flying 800000 in 
cocaine profits from florida to panama in 1983 becoming the first 
of manuel noriegas codefendants to plead guilty in the drug 
trafficking case 
noriegas lawyers said their client had nothing to fear from 
information the panamanian pilot eduardo pardo might give 
prosecutors 
if he tells the truth he cant hurt us said noriega 
attorney frank rubino 
pardo 44 was arrested by drug enforcement administration 
agents in panama city after the us invasion his attorney 
william meadows and assistant us attorney michael sullivan said 
there was no plea bargain in the case 
noriega and pardo were among 16 people indicted in miami in 
february 1988 on charges of taking part in a conspiracy that made 
panama a way station and processing center for colombias medellin 
drug cartel 
shaken and occasionally close to tears pardo who faces up to 
five years in prison and a 10000 fine at sentencing april 25 on a 
single count of illegal travel admitted to prosecutors account of 
the 1983 drugmoney flight 
pardo and codefendant daniel miranda flew a lear jet fitted 
with secret compartments so that money could be hidden 
sullivan told the court they were worried that the secret 
compartment made the plane unsafe to fly but they were assured it 
was ok 
pardo received 40000 for the flight and knew it was drug 
money the prosecutor said 
meadows said he had no idea whether pardo would testify against 
noriega or any of the other defendants 
the defendant most immediately threatened by pardo should he 
testify for the prosecution appeared to be miranda who allegedly 
accompanied him on the flight 
but mirandas attorney michael okane said his client did not 
know the money came from drugs i guess pardos guilty that 
doesnt mean that miranda is okane said 
richard sharpstein attorney for brian alden davidow the only 
defendant free on bail said outside court that even without an 
agreement to testify for the government pardos plea made him a 
likely witness 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from the 
cartel the panamanian leader who surrendered to us troops after 
the december invasion of his country has disputed the right of a 
us civilian court to judge him 
he and the other defendants except for davidow are being held 
in the metropolitan correctional center south of miami 
in new orleans attorneys for crewmen of a panamanian freighter 
that carried 12000 pounds of cocaine want noriega to testify at 
the crewmens trial the coast guard seized the freighter in the 
gulf of mexico in october 
the defense has argued that us authorities didnt have the 
permission of panamanian authorities to board the ship prosecutors 
say panamas president eric delvalle gave blanket authorization 
before his term expired sept 1 
us district judge charles schwartz jr has denied the request 
for noriegas appearance but asked lawyers wednesday for detailed 
memos

thirtyfive million americans report suffering 
from arthritis and 6 million admit they havent seen a doctor about 
it according to a nationwide survey released thursday by the 
centers for disease control 
people are seeing painkiller ads on tv and treating their 
arthritis themselves and very possibly doing damage to 
themselves said steve erickson spokesman for the arthritis 
foundation the problem will probably get worse if pain relievers 
are the only treatment he said 
erickson said too few people are aware of the warning signs of 
arthritis such as joint swelling early morning stiffness 
recurring joint pain or inability to move a joint that lasts for 
more than two weeks

at least 14 deaths and 1269 cases of a rare 
painful blood disorder known as eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome have 
been attributed to the health food supplement ltryptophan the 
centers for disease control reported thursday 
the disorder marked by an abnormally high number of white blood 
cells causes severe muscle pain and can cause death the median 
time between use of ltryptophan and the onset of symptoms was 152 
days 
the fda issued a recall request for ltryptophan on nov 17 and 
expanded it four days later to block importation of the product a 
protein component widely taken as a nutritional supplement 
last month the fda cautioned consumers against buying 
ltryptophan products from a california company that did not comply 
with the recall request

researchers using an intricate manipulation of 
genes and transplantation of bone marrow have produced a mouse that 
suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia giving scientists a 
new way to test therapies against the killer disease 
in a report to be published friday in the magazine science 
researchers said they have discovered a way to give chronic 
myelogenous leukemia cml to laboratory mice cml is a form of 
leukemia that usually attacks adults and is only rarely cured 
lead researcher george daley said the study also proves that cml 
is initiated by the fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes a 
finding that had been suggested by earlier studies cells 
containing the hybrid gene produce a protein that changes healthy 
cells into cancer cells 
daley said it is still not known precisely what causes the two 
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene but a high 
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor

a study of airlinecabin environment found 
that even with the smoking ban that takes effect in 10 days 
passengers and crew still face a health risk from increased 
radiation from the sun and stars 
the study released thursday by the transportation department 
recommends that airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will 
reduce their risk to cosmic radiation especially those crews who 
regularly fly near the north pole and south pole or at higher 
altitudes 
the study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation 
comparable to the risk of death from exposure to smokefilled 
cabins although estimates of cancer caused by cosmic rays had a 
wider range because of uncertainty over the effects of low doses of 
radiation 
it also recommended a total smoking ban but was superceded by 
congressional action banning smoking on all flights of six hours or 
less beginning feb 25

the communist party newspaper thursday accused 
chinese media of failing the party during the spring prodemocracy 
movement and said in the future they must never veer from the party 
line 
the press was guilty of allowing the rotten ideology and way 
of life of the bourgeois class to corrupt the soul of the people 
during the spring uprising the peoples daily said 
hostile forces both at home and abroad continue to spread rumors 
to confuse the people it alleged 
even during the most arduous period of our struggle against 
the enemy our media should advocate the leadership of the party 
the party line and general and specific policies and should 
encourage people to continue the revolution despite all 
obstacles said the newspaper 
freedom of the press was one of the main demands of the 
studentled democracy movement and for a brief time in may the 
official press including the peoples daily broke with party 
ranks and published remarkably objective reports about the 
political turmoil 
many reporters from chinas main newspapers and radio and 
television stations marched in demonstrations and expressed support 
for greater press freedom 
the peoples daily said that at a critical time referring to 
the period before and during the democracy movement some papers 
even revealed the dark side of the party and talked about our party 
and socialist system as if they did not have any redeeming 
features 
the media beautified capitalism it said and as a result some 
people wondered how long the communist partys red flag would 
survive 
the article said it is strictly forbidden to deviate from the 
principles of the party and that critical articles should be 
secondary to positive reporting total control must be 
maintained it said 
the government quickly regained control over the media after 
martial law was declared in beijing on may 20 and troops launched 
their bloody attack on june 34 to crush the democracy movement 
the chief editor of the peoples daily was replaced by the head 
of the army propaganda department other editors were sacked 
shanghais outspoken world economic herald and other journals were 
closed and numerous reporters were arrested or fired 
since then articles on party corruption economic disasters and 
crime have been allowed only if they illustrate how the party is 
striving to eradicate such problems

mayor marion barry undergoing treatment in 
florida following his january arrest on a cocaine possession 
charge was indicted today by a federal grand jury on eight counts 
of perjury and possession of a controlled substance 
the 14month probe began after barry was discovered visiting the 
hotel room of an associate charles lewis who later pleaded guilty 
to conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine barry was said to 
have told the grand jury that he had never used cocaine lewis had 
testified to the contrary 
the indictment comes four weeks after barry was arrested on a 
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and on the same day that 
president bush and leaders of three latin american nations met at a 
drug summit in colombia 
barry is undergoing treatment for substance abuse at a florida 
clinic and has turned over the daytoday operations of the 
district government to the city administrator 
the lengthy investigation conducted by the fbi and the internal 
affairs department of the city police force moved toward 
indictment after onetime barry girlfriend rasheeda moore agreed to 
cooperate with authorities barry was videotaped in a hotel room 
with moore using crack cocaine authorities said 
barry has steadfastly denied using drugs i have never used 
any illegal drugs nor have i knowingly purchased or been given any 
illegal drugs nor have i knowingly been around anyone using 
illegal drugs barry said last august after lewis told 
prosecutors that he had smoked cracked cocaine with the mayor 
at an emotional appearance following his arrest jan 18 he 
admitted having a problem with alcohol but said nothing about drugs 
since his arrest barrys political support in the city has 
dwindled and several supporters have urged him not to seek another 
term there are four announced democratic candidates for barrys 
job jesse jackson who moved to the city last year fueling 
speculation that he would run for mayor has said he would not 
challenge barry 
the us attorneys office said in a statement that the 
indictment resulted from an ongoing investigation of public 
corruption and illegal narcotics activity 
barrys attorney r kenneth mundy was not immediately 
available for comment 
the indictment charged that during a jan 19 1989 grand jury 
appearance barry lied under oath by stating he was not aware that 
lewis was involved with drugs and by stating that the two men had 
not exchanged cocaine 
lewis who also is cooperating with the investigation was 
recently sentenced to 15 months in prison on drug charges 
four charges against barry involve alleged possession of cocaine 
between dec 1622 1988 the period when barry was with lewis at 
the downtown ramada inn 
the fifth drugpossession charge stems from barrys arrest at 
the vista international hotel where he was videotaped with moore 
each of the three felony false declaration charges carries a 
fiveyear prison term and a maximum fine of 250000 each of the 
misdemeanor possession charges carries a maximum sentence of one 
year in jail and a fine of 100000 
the indictment gave the following description of barrys 
appearance before the grand jury 
have you ever seen mr lewis with anything that indicated he 
was involved in drugs of any sort barry was asked 
no i have not the mayor answered the indictment charged 
that this statement was false 
have you ever talked to mr lewis about drugs the mayor was 
asked no not to my recollection barry responded in another 
statement prosecutors alleged was false 
in another count barry is charged with lying when he said 
ive never given mr lewis any cocaine or any other drug 
the prosecutor then asked i believe its safe to assume you 
did not ever give mr lewis any cocaine 
cocaine absolutely the mayor replied according to the 
indictment 
another count charged that barry lied when asked did mr lewis 
ever give you cocaine 
no the mayor replied 
have you ever received cocaine from anyone at the ramada 
no barry replied 
the threeterm mayor has been at a florida substance abuse 
clinic since jan 22 four days after his arrest on a misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charge he is scheduled to remain in the clinic 
past the normal 28day treatment cycle according to top city 
government sources 
us attorney jay b stephens has said the investigation of 
barry began in december 1988 after city police aborted an attempt 
to make an undercover drug purchase from lewis at a downtown hotel 
after learning that barry was in the room 
lewis testified under oath that he supplied barry with crack 
cocaine 
a district employee robert mcwilliams who was in lewis room 
with barry in december 1988 also has appeared before the same 
panel 
barry 53 told close advisers on the weekend of his arrest that 
he was abandoning his bid for a fourth fouryear term in november 
if convicted of a felony barry would be required to resign and 
city council chairman david clarke would become acting mayor a 
special election would be held within 120 days of any resignation 
unless that date falls within 60 days of the nov 6 general 
election

commission said at a news conference that a common purpose 
exists to combat terrorism and called for more sharing of 
information to protect travelers 
president bush created the commission on aviation security and 
terrorism in august as a result of the dec 21 1988 bombing of pan

antiterrorism policies 
at the news conference sen frank lautenberg a new jersey 
democrat urged western governments to strike back at any state 
proved to be involved in terrorist attacks on aviation 
we have to let these states know we mean business he said

a new study published thursday said high rates of 
leukemia in young people living near nuclear plants may be caused 
by radiation doses their fathers received before they were born 
the government said it was concerned and would refer the 
findings to its committee of experts on radiation for urgent 
consideration 
men who work at nuclear plants particularly those who received 
high radiation doses in the six months before their childrens 
conception had more offspring with leukemia than men in other 
jobs said the study published in the british medical journal 
one researcher radiotherapist michael snee said the radiation 
probably caused a mutation in the fathers sperm 
the researchers study headed by martin gardner professor of 
medical studies at the university of southampton examined 52 
victims of leukemia and lymphoma under 25 years old born in the 
west cumbria health district and diagnosed between 195085 they 
were compared with 1001 control children 
the sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant which has been 
plagued by radioactive leaks is in the district on englands 
northwest coast government studies have found a 10fold increase 
in childhood leukemia a mile from the plant 
one study by the medical research council and the imperial 
research fund reported in november that an increased risk of 
leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation with the 
possible exception of the sellafield plant 
the main finding was of a raised risk for those children whose 
fathers worked at sellafield in particular fathers with the 
highest recorded exposures to external ionizing radiation before 
their childs conception gardner told a news conference 
the risk was raised by sixfold to eightfold for fathers who 
had received total doses of over 100 millisieverts msv 
one millisievert equals half an individuals annual dose from 
natural radiation or 50 times the dose received during a single 
chest xray 
when researchers focused on the village of seascale near 
sellafield they found that the fathers of four of the five victims 
of leukemia and one lymphoma sufferer were employed at the plant 
and had higher radiation doses before their childs conception than 
all their matched controls 
gardner said other theories about concentrated high rates of 
leukemia such as viral infections did not apply to the sellafield 
area 
junior health minister roger freeman said the government noted 
the results with concern and recognizes the anxieties it must 
cause to those who might be at risk 
he said the findings were referred to the govenmentappointed 
committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment for 
urgent consideration and advice 
the atomic energy authority the government body responsible for 
britains nuclear industry said gardners study conflicts with 
previous studies and said more research is needed 
we will need to study this detailed report with care 
particularly as it does not seem to be emerging from other 
studies said chairman john collier there are many leukemia 
clusters distant from nuclear sites which cannot yet be explained 
so research must continue 
the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment 
said in 1988 the high levels of leukemia might also be due to 
exposure to chemicals viruses or even chance 
martin bobrow a geneticist on the committee called the latest 
findings a very important step forward 
he said larger studies would be needed to confirm the results 
but the idea that a cancercausing gene mutation could be passed 
from father to child was theoretically possible 
these children would then have a head start in terms of 
developing leukemia bobrow said 
british nuclear fuels plc which owns the sellafield plant said 
gardners conclusions were unexpected and backed the call for 
further study 
a spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom said the conclusions conflicted with evidence from the 
japanese victims of the world war ii atomic bombs gardners 
researchers attributed the conflict to the short but intense burst 
of radiation at hiroshima and nagaski vs the longterm radiation 
experience by nuclear plant workers 
leukemia clusters occurrences of the disease statistically 
higher than normal have also been found in southern england near 
the atomic weapons research establishment the royal ordnance 
factory and the atomic energy authority

the latvian parliament on thursday condemned the 
1940 declaration that made the baltic republic part of the soviet 
union tass reported 
the parliament or supreme soviet said the declaration was 
taken without making clear the will of the people and led to loss 
of latvias independence 
the vote was 17740 with 33 deputies abstaining or absent said 
valdis birzens of the latvian popular front newspaper atmoda 
the parliament also voted to restore the redandwhite flag and 
the national anthem of independent latvia birzens said the 
independence flag replaces one with the communist hammer and sickle 
emblem 
the action follows a similar but stronger resolution in the 
parliament of neighboring lithuania last week lithuanian lawmakers 
declared unlawful and invalid the 1940 act that incorporated 
their republic into the soviet union they demanded talks with the 
kremlin on restoring lithuanian independence 
all three baltic republics latvia lithuania and estonia say 
they were forced to join the soviet union while occupied by the red 
army 
tass the official soviet news agency described the lithuanian 
action as a step toward full secession 
the latvian parliament also said thursday that measures must be 
taken to transform latvia into a free and independent state in a 
union of states following a path of humane democratic socialism 
and building its own relations with other states on a foundation of 
agreements tass said 
some latvians want a completely independent nation others would 
rewrite the treaty to allow the kremlin limited powers in latvia 
while keeping most of the authority in riga the latvian capital 
lithuanians enjoy an 80 percent majority in their homeland but 
immigration from other parts of the soviet union has left latvia 
with a population only half native latvian

more than 3000 bottles of an antibiotic 
distributed by goldline laboratories doxycycline hyclate are 
being recalled because one bottle was found to contain a muscle 
relaxant federal officials said thursday 
doxycycline hyclate is used to treat a wide range of infections 
including venereal diseases acne and lifethreatening pneumonia 
the food and drug administration said the mislabeled muscle 
relaxant carisoprodol could harm patients because it would not 
treat their infections and could impair their mental and physical 
abilities making it dangerous to drive a car or operate heavy 
machinery 
the recalled bottles of goldline doxycycline hyclate 100 
milligrams are in six lots the bottles carry lot numbers 824039 
844059 863069 882079 883079 and 919099 
the carisoprodol tablets are white and round with the bolar 
pharmaceutical co inc logo on one side a b over an inverted 
b and the number 0094 stamped on the other side 
the fda said patients who find that they have the mislabeled 
product should stop using it contact their physicians and return 
the prescription to their pharmacy 
the distributor goldline laboratories discovered the 
mislabeled antibiotic and notified bolar the supplier which is 
voluntarily recalling the drug according to the fda 
bolar said more than 3000 bottles may be in the hands of 
pharmacists or consumers 
the copiague nybased bolar has been under fire for giving 
false test data to the government it has recalled many of its 
products including its largest seller a generic version of the 
antihypertensive drug dyzaide 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the doxycycline recall did not 
appear to be linked to bolars other problems with the agency

the agriculture department on thursday 
announced a steppedup program to help curb the spread of a 
foodpoisoning organism in poultry flocks that produce table eggs 
for consumers 
salmonella enteritidis which has a number of strains has been 
identified with food poisoning in humans who have eaten improperly 
cooked contaminated eggs 
assistant secretary jo ann r smith said the 68 million 
control program will focus on testing and certification of breeding 
flocks that produce the tableegg layers and on tracing and 
testing commercial egg flocks if and when they are implicated in 
human cases of salmonella enteritidis 
the interstate movement of chickens eggs and associated 
articles from flocks infected or associated with the bacteria will 
be restricted she said 
smith said the organism is a growing problem in the nations 
32 billion egg industry and has emerged as a serious public 
health concern as well 
strains of the organism are entrenched in northeastern and 
midatlantic states and are expanding into the midwest and 
northwest she said 
in humans the bacteria can cause cramps diarrhea fever and 
sometimes nausea and vomiting five to 72 hours after eating 
contaminated food smith said some people such as the elderly or 
those with poor immune systems can suffer serious and 
lifethreatening effects from eating contaminated eggs or other 
food 
an interim rule will put the program into effect friday smith 
said public comments accepted through april 17 may be sent to

redoubt volcano erupted anew thursday 
sending a jet of ash and steam nearly seven miles high and 
scattering grit that led authorities to cancel classes for 2000 
students 
the moderate to strong eruption the first significant 
eruption since jan 15 began around 4 am and was over in minutes 
the ash cloud headed for the gulf of alaska away from the more 
populated cook inlet area said tom miller a spokesman for the 
us geological survey 
the federal aviation administration warned aircraft to stay at 
least 20 miles from the mountain which is about 115 miles 
southeast of anchorage 
but ken burdette manager of anchorage international airport 
said no airline had canceled or diverted flights because of the 
ash which can damage or shut down aircraft engines 
redoubt should not affect any carriers international and 
domestic burdette said the clouds going away from the major 
airways that come and go into anchorage 
classes were canceled for health reasons at more than a dozen 
schools from nikiski southward on the kenai peninsula which got a 
pretty good dumping of ash said dale sandahl superintendent 
of the kenai peninsula borough school district 
the mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions 
began in middecember disrupting air travel in and out of 
anchorage during the holidays ash clogged all four engines of a 
klm boeing 747 on dec 15 causing the aircraft to fall more than 
two miles before the engines could be restarted 
redoubt showed more earthquake activity a couple of days ago 
leading seismologists to believe another eruption was coming said 
john davies state seismologist but not this soon he said 
more than two dozen workers were evacuated early thursday from 
the drift river oil terminal a tank farm just a few miles from the 
mountain 
we got them out just before the eruption said larry 
duncanson with cook inlet pipe line co which operates the storage 
terminal

the last traces of oil from an 
eightdayold tanker spill washed ashore thursday but the 
blackened coastline was still off limits to beachgoers and boaters 
we dont want to paint too pretty of a picture said coast 
guard petty officer dennis hall we dont want to give the 
impression well open up all these areas i cant really say its 
done and over 
the 400000gallon spill which occurred feb 7 when the tanker 
american trader apparently punctured itself on its own anchor has 
soiled a 12 to 14mile stretch of beach cleanup crews were 
focusing on the huntington beach and newport beach areas where 
concentrations were thickest 
warning signs remained posted along the sand and booms placed 
to guard against drifting oil continued to block entrances to the 
long beach marina newport harbor and santa ana river hall said 
with only a light sheen of oil remaining offshore thursday 
experts considered reducing resources said james l obrien 
cleanup coordinator for british petroleum america inc which had 
leased the tanker 
equipment such as skimmers which are useful only when oil is 
thickly concentrated offshore might be released obrien said he 
said any such decisions would be made in consultation with local 
state and federal agencies 
obrien owner of an oil spill cleanup firm declined to 
estimate when work would be finished this early in the game it 
would be bad for me to even try to predict he said 
about 36 percent of the oil some 144600 gallons was recovered 
through skimming according to the coast guard fortysix percent 
or 184800 gallons was estimated to have evaporated or dispersed 
in the ocean 
a claims office was set up in huntington beach on wednesday to 
field calls from fishermen charter boat owners and others whose 
livelihoods have been disrupted by the spill 
weve had the freshest fish for years said mike steven 
long a line baiter with dory fleet a cooperative of 20 fishermen 
at newport beach but now our reputation is ruined 
wildlife experts said the environmental impact would be 
shortlived 
this is not an environmental disaster said john grant a 
marine biologist with the state department of fish and game two 
wetland areas populated by endangered species were protected from

a man was sentenced to life in prison thursday 
for the murder of his girlfriends 4yearold son who was beaten 
burned stuck with pins and forced to hang upside down in a closet 
the woman was sentenced to life for letting it happen 
in sentencing johnny campbell and alicia abraham circuit judge 
michael b getty said if he had let emotions dictate his actions 
the two would have received the death penalty for the vicious 
brutally sadistic torture and murder of lattie mcgee 
but he said he could not do so under illinois law the life 
sentences carry no possibility of parole the couple also received 
30year sentences for the abuse of latties brother cornelius 
lattie described as a quiet boy with dark eyes died in 1987 of 
a severe blow to the head authorities said 
in the last 2 months of his life lattie was starved burned 
with a hot iron stuck with pins and needles singed with 
cigarettes beaten with a tree branch hair brush belt and hands 
scalded with hot water and tied up with a clothesline in the 
familys south side apartment 
cornelius now 8 testified that campbell tied latties wrists 
to his ankles and hung him upside down in the closet once 
cornelius said his mother helped tie up lattie cornelius too 
was tied up in the closet once for two days he said 
he told about seeing campbell throw a screaming lattie into a 
bathtub of hot water scrubbing the boy with a rag until his skin 
started peeling off 
campbell a 40yearold former steelworker pleaded guilty but 
mentally ill in december he said he beat the boys to curb what he 
thought was homosexual behavior 
ms abraham 28 contended she never actively abused the 
children getty convicted her in a nonjury trial jan 11 
prosecutors had argued that death was the only just penalty for 
the defendants but getty said the evidence that campbell is 
mentally ill and that ms abraham had not participated directly in 
the death made them ineligible for the death penalty 
clyde lemons jr ms abrahams attorney called the sentence 
unfair and said he would appeal but marijane placek campbells 
lawyer praised the judge for sparing her clients life and added 
if you kill a sick person you never find out why they did it 
among the spectators was lattie mcgee sr the boys father who 
lived with ms abraham several years ago and now has custody of 
cornelius 
i got justice today i wish he did get the death penalty

price supports for peanuts grown under 1990 
quotas will be 63147 per ton an increase of 1560 from last 
year the agriculture department said thursday 
officials said the increase was mandated by law which requires 
annual adjustments in the national support level for quotatype 
peanuts based on costs of production as costs increase so does 
the peanut support level 
production of nonquota peanuts which can be grown for peanut 
oil and meal and for export will be supported at 14975 per ton 
unchanged from last year 
the bush administration has asked congress to eliminate the 
escalator in the peanut support formula and put the program in line 
with other farm commodity supports

most companies targeted by animal rights 
groups for their use of animal testing in consumer product research 
have significantly reduced their use of animals according to a 
private study released thursday 
however a leading animal rights group said it wants 
corporations to release internal information to back up the 
findings 
i would challenge the companies to substantiate the claims 
that the numbers are down said susan rich special projects 
director for people for the ethical treatment of animals the 
nations largest animal rights group 
by looking at the figures of animal use in their inhouse 
laboratories does not give us the true picture rich said 
the report by the investor responsibility research center 
examines data submitted to the agriculture department by us 
companies reporting animal use in fiscal years 1986 1987 and 1988 
it also offers indepth profiles of animal testing from 198488 
of nine companies that introduced shareholder resolutions on animal 
testing after being targeted by peta 
the study shows six of nine companies targeted by peta cut 
animal testing by 42 percent from 198688 
two of the companies avon and greyhound say they no longer 
use animal testing for cosmetic and household product research the 
report said 
other companies highlighted in the study were american home 
products bristolmyers products colgatepalmolive gillette 
johnson amp johnson proctor amp gamble and scheringplough which 
produces maybelline cosmetics 
only american home products showed no reduction in animal 
testing during the period bristolmyers had an increase from 597 
to 743 tests between 1987 and 1988 after an earlier decline 
the study said gillette closed its inhouse laboratory in march 
1987 and declined to reveal how many animals have been used in 
testing by contracted outside labs in 1988 figures for 1988 also 
were unavailable for scheringplough 
we have not increased the number of animals just to increase 
the animals said carol emerling spokeswoman for american home 
products the kinds of drugs and number of drugs that were 
testing dictates the amount of testing that we do 
she said most of the companys testing is for pharmaceutical 
products where she said elimination of animal testing is not likely 
the study said companies are turning to nonanimal methods of 
testing 
heidi welsh author of the irrc study said usda reporting 
requirements dont cover rats and mice an estimated 80 to 90 
percent of all animal use and do not include animals uses at 
contract laboratories 
consumer product testing studied by irrc included toxicity 
testing of nonmedicalrelated cosmetic and household products such 
as soaps and eyeshadow 
overthecounter and prescription drug testing was not included 
cosmetic and household testing account for less than 10 
percent of the estimated 2070 million laboratory animals used 
annually in the united states welsh said 
in a related matter peta on thursday filed a 3 million lawsuit 
against writer katie mccabe for an article on animal testing in the 
february issue of washingtonian magazine the organization 
alleged that the story showed malicious intent to damage its 
reputation 
in 25 years of publication weve never lost a suit for 
anything weve published said washingtonian editor jack limpert 
were confident and well fight and win

the red army will start leaving 
czechoslovakia on feb 26 and an agreement on complete soviet 
withdrawal from hungary may come within a month officials said 
thursday 
gen anton slimak czechoslovak chief of staff said the soviet 
withdrawal would begin next week in bruntal 160 miles east of 
prague the official news agency ctk reported 
later however ctk said soviet and czechoslovak delegations 
meeting in prague agreed the withdrawal would begin feb 26 the 
day president vaclav havel starts his first visit to moscow 
czechoslovakia had sought total withdrawal by the end of this 
year but slimak said that would not happen moscow wants until the 
end of 1991 and sources in prague said earlier this week june 1991 
was a likely compromise 
no final date was agreed at thursdays talks in prague but 
talks will continue in the nearest future to nail that down 
ctk said 
in budapest a senior hungarian official was quoted as 
predicting agreement within a month on ending decades of soviet 
military presence 
soviet soldiers arrived in hungary to suppress the 1956 
antistalinist uprising and in czechoslovakia to crush the prague 
spring political liberalization of 1968 
with their first free elections in more than 40 years nearing 
hungary and czechoslovakia are on the threshold of full democracy 
and see removal of soviet forces as a symbolic affirmation of 
independence 
havel hinted tuesday that a personal letter he received from 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev might help resolve the question 
of how soon all 73500 red army soldiers would be out of 
czechoslovakia 
talks on the withdrawal began in prague in january foreign 
ministry spokesman lubos dobrovsky told journalists tuesday a 
deadline agreement could be reached by sunday which means havel 
could sign it when he goes to moscow after a visit to washington 
magyar nemzet a hungarian daily quoted foreign ministry 
official ferenc somogyi as saying hungary could count on working 
out the agreement within a month 
czechoslovakia has insisted the soviets withdraw whatever the 
results of eastwest talks in vienna on reducing conventional 
forces in europe but hungary has not 
officials on both sides appear confident of a vienna agreement 
this year now that the soviets have accepted president bushs 
proposal to reduce the number of us and soviet soldiers in 
central europe to 195000 for each side 
hungary wants all 50000 soviet soldiers off its territory by 
early 1991 but somogyi said compromise was possible because of 
kremlin concerns about transportation and providing facilities for 
the returning soldiers 
we have to take into account our negotiating partners 
position he was quoted as saying 
slimak said withdrawal from czechoslovakia could not be 
completed by the end of 1990 for technical and social reasons 
both governments have mentioned the bottleneck likely to be 
created by withdrawing large numbers of soldiers from neighboring 
countries simultaneously through one soviet border point where 
trains would have to be changed because of different track widths 
soviet officials also cite a lack of housing for most of the 
16000 families of soviet soldiers and civil workers based in 
czechoslovakia slimak said 
a preliminary agreement indicates about 35 percent of the 
soldiers will be withdrawn by the end of may along with 40 percent 
of the tanks 30 percent of other combat vehicles and nearly 
onethird of helicopters and artillery he said 
czechoslovakia has asked that a substantial part of the soviet 
forces be out before elections scheduled for june

president bush complained testily 
thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as 
deceptive declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and 
initiate a new approach toward reporters 
from now on its going to be a little different so weve 
got a new relationship bush told reporters traveling with him 
aboard air force one to the fournation colombia drug summit 
it will be pleasant it will be fun but its different 
said the president who has averaged one question and answer 
session with reporters each week since taking office 13 months ago 
later bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
president was just kidding in asserting that he would have 
fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of 
questions 
he was having fun fitzwater said 
the president who apparently read a wire service account of his 
testy mood on the plane protested to reporters later im not 
fuming 
bushs pique apparently was triggered by an abctv report 
wednesday night recapping instances in which bushs words were 
belied by subsequent events the president was criticized on the 
same score in a feb 26 article in the new republic entitled the 
deceiving line 
most recently bush told a news conference on monday that it 
wasnt time yet for a conference among the united states the 
soviet union britain and france on the future status of germany 
not at this juncture he told the news conference 
yet the next day a major agreement was announced in ottawa by 
secretary of state james a baker iii on a german reunification 
push that would include a summit among the four powers that 
vanquished germany in world war ii 
when i told you that i didnt think thered be a deal and 
there shortly was a deal then im hit for deceiving you bush 
groused thursday 
bush a onetime cia director has conducted much of his foreign 
policy in secrecy 
two missions to china by national security adviser brent 
scowcroft came despite a bush announcement in the aftermath of the 
tiananmen square crackdown that he was barring highlevel exchanges 
between the two countries the president later insisted that 
scowcrofts trips to beijing were visits and not exchanges 
and thus not covered by the bush edict 
bush who usually maintains a bantering relationship with 
reporters said i think weve had too many press conferences it 
overdoes it its overexposure 
by answering few questions directly he said im not going to 
be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive 
the president who slept the night before on air force one so he 
would be wellrested for thursdays predawn flight here even gave 
a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good nights sleep 
i had a very good nights sleep i cant get into the details 
of that because some will say its too much sleep some will say 
its too little he said 
bush parried a series of questions from reporters most of them 
dealing with the drug summit 
im not going to discuss what im going to bring up bush 
said when asked about his agenda for the days conference in 
cartagena with the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia 
im not going to discuss whether theres any surprises or not 
this is a new thing this is a new approach 
he then said his nonanswers were a trial run for later 
dealings with the media 
in fact bush who answers reporters questions about once a 
week planned to finish his day in colombia with yet another news 
conference 
bushs comments with reporters came shortly before his jet 
touched down here where a us press center was set up at the 
airport bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to cartagena and was 
returning here before flying home to washington 
asked about an nbctv report that colombian president virgilio 
barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to 
extradite them to the united states if they turned over drug labs 
bush snapped i have no comment whatsoever on that i have no 
comment on whether i know about it or not i cant comment on 
whether its true or not 
bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him 
the most 
however thursdays editions of the washington post had a story 
on what it called the debate between president bush and the press 
over secrecy and deception 
and abctv had a news report on wednesday night by white house 
correspondent brit hume on the same subject 
hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the 
record lunch at the white house with bush at which the subject 
reportedly came up 
news accounts said that bush told the reporters at the lunch 
that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions like 
scowcrofts clandestine visits to china 
then the next day it was disclosed that deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to london 
to notify us allies of bushs latest plan to reduce troops in 
europe 
bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his 
surprise seaside summit at malta in december with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the president in september had said that there were no plans for 
a superpower summit before 1990 but he later revealed that the 
session had been arranged as early as last july

a defense attorney has acknowledged for 
the first time that his client arrested seven months ago is john 
list the subject of a worldwide manhunt after the 1971 slayings of 
five members of his family 
a prosecutor said thursday that will make no difference in the 
case against list who was arrested on a tip after an americas 
wanted tv broadcast that included a plaster bust of how he might 
look 17 years after the slayings 
weve got to prove the identity anyway said assistant 
prosecutor brian d gillet 
list is charged with murder in the 1971 slayings of his mother 
wife and three children in their 19room westfield home 
he was arrested in june in suburban richmond va but told 
authorities he was robert p clark his second wife delores said 
her husband was a victim of mistaken identity 
but investigators identified list through fingerprints from his 
army record 
lists attorney elijah miller jr said at a hearing wednesday 
that the defendants identity was not at issue the only thing we 
said before was that they the state had to prove it was john 
list said miller now they dont have to prove it 
the fbi and prosecutors maintain that list assumed a new 
identity after the slayings working as an accountant in colorado 
and virginia he remarried in 1983 and was known to neighbors as a 
quiet churchgoing man 
the defense is seeking to keep prosecutors from using as 
evidence a fivepage letter in which list is alleged to have 
confessed to his church pastor that he killed his family because 
they were veering away from god 
miller contends the letter should not be allowed into evidence 
because of the confidentiality that exists between priest and 
penitent 
jury selection begins march 20

preliminary results of a survey show that many 
hospitals fail to protect patients rights when trying to determine 
whether patients are infected with the aids virus researchers said 
thursday 
if you are about to be admitted to a hospital ask your doctor 
what he intends to do with the blood he draws and if he plans to 
test for aids what he intends to do with the results said dr 
charles e lewis who analyzed the results of the survey 
lewis a professor of medicine public health and nursing at the 
university of california school of medicine in los angeles said 
around 17 percent of hospitals dont have policies to protect 
patients rights on the aids issue and of those that do a 
distressing proportion are inadequate 
lewis declined to say how many are inadquate or discuss some 
other aspects of the study because his analysis of the data has not 
been published 
he and one of his coworkers on the survey howard e freeman 
who has a doctorate in sociology and is a professor at ucla 
discussed some of their preliminary results at an aids conference 
the survey of 716 hospitals about 14 percent of the nations 
nonfederal shortterm general hospitals was conducted between 
january and august of last year by louis harris amp associates of new 
york 
lewis said about half the hospital administrators surveyed were 
unaware of the guidelines put out by the federal centers for 
disease control which recommend that hospitals establish policies 
the cdc guidelines also recommend that if hospitals test patients 
for hiv they first get their consent 
freeman said the survey found that about 15 percent of hospitals 
do not always inform patients they will be tested for the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids and a third do 
not always counsel a patient about the disease before they are 
tested 
about 4 percent of the hospitals surveyed dont always inform 
patients of hiv test results and twothirds of the facilities put 
the results in the patients file he said 
in addition about a quarter of the hospitals said they 
sometimes or always transfer to another hospital patients 
identified as being hiv positive he said some hospitals say the 
reason for transfer is that they are not familiar with hiv and aids 
treatment procedures and other say they are concerned about 
transmission of the virus to hospital workers 
freeman said that while precautions must be taken to guard 
against hospital workers becoming infected through contact with an 
infected patients blood the chances of transmission are small 
it has more to do with fright and fear of the virus he 
said

the communist government on thursday 
ordered a halt to the construction on a nuclear power plant on the 
danube river after nearby residents staged a general strike 
also thursday premier andrei lukanov met a delegation 
representing 23000 workers at sofias giant kremikovtsi steel 
plant who are threatening to walk off the job monday in demand of 
higher pay and better working conditions

the talks friday at the plant whose red smoke wafts across the 
capital daily 
the government ordered construction halted on the countrys 
planned second nuclear plant at belene on the danube which is on 
bulgarias northern border with romania 
the decision came after reports that svishtov a town 18 miles 
east of belene was paralyzed by a general strike thursday in 
protest of a parliamentary decision to continue building the plant 
public protest has flared over belene because it is in an area 
believed susceptible to earthquakes 
a parliamentary commission traveled to svischtov 125 miles 
northeast of sofia to try to calm public fears governmentrun 
media said 
the new openness in bulgarias media since hardline leader 
todor zhivkov was forced from power in november has produced a 
series of articles about mishaps at the countrys currently 
operating but troubleplagued nuclear plant at kozloduy the plant 
75 miles north of sofia also lies on the danube 
construction work on belene which like kozloduy is based on a

chicagoans danced a winter ballet thursday amid 
inhospitable weather that made the hardiest midwesterners leap to 
avoid slush puddles shuffle to keep from slipping on ice and dive 
to escape bus splashes 
this is treacherous john peeples said as he failed in a 
daring attempt to jump a slush puddle i feel like im 
maneuvering through an obstacle course 
chicagoans like residents of other parts of the midwest spent 
much of their day digging out from up to 10 inches of snow that 
began falling on valentines day the storm stranded many 
commuters knocked down power lines and briefly closed both major 
city airports 
rain started falling thursday afternoon 
theres cold theres snow theres rain and heres where im 
going to stay today said john renier pointing to his home in 
the citys lincoln park neighborhood 
renier a native of arkansas said this was his first winter in 
chicago in which snow forced him to shovel out his walk and his 
car both buried under a mountain of snow 
i was really looking forward to the first time i would have to 
shovel this he said as a fine rain fell i can see i havent 
missed much 
farther down the block university of chicago law student ken 
simpler frustrated many neighbors struggling to dig their cars out 
of the snow when he jumped into his fourwheeldrive vehicle and 
pulled right out 
this thing is good two seasons of the year one when it 
snows like this and then in the summer when i can take the top off 
and enjoy myself he said 
the storm ended an unusually balmy sixweek period when 
temperatures rose above freezing almost daily occasionally 
climbing into the 60s 
restaurant owners in the city and suburbs lamented the foul 
weather that sent potential customers scurrying for the comforts of 
home 
it was more like the valentines day massacre said denise 
ellis coordinator of the dining room at kendall college culinary 
school and restaurant in north suburban evanston 
its normally one of our busiest days of the year and we had 
only 17 couples all night ms ellis said in a telephone 
interview and i think we got lucky because were near peoples 
homes im sure the downtown chicago restaurants did even worse 
hardier midwesterners however claimed the storm was just a 
drop in the bucket compared to other bad weather 
now the snowstorm in 67 that was something said 
josephine woods of rogers park as she stood on an elevated train 
platform lecturing other morning commuters on the proper way to 
dress in such conditions 
theres nothing nobody can do about the snow but youve got 
to try to wear enough clothes to keep you warm said ms woods 
who pointed to the two jackets she wore on top of a fulllength ski 
suit and thermal underwear 
bill lederer of lincoln park took the day off from work to enjoy 
a little crosscountry skiing after spending seven hours trying to 
get home from work the previous evening 
its normally an hour drive lederer said miniature icicles 
hanging from his cap but i dont think this is so bad 
it relieves the monotony of winter and gives everybody 
something to talk about

presidents at the drug summit on thursday 
called anew for latin american farmers who grow coca to switch to 
other crops but bolivian authorities have tried that for years and 
found it a tough row to hoe 
it has been only recently that the program here showed signs of 
progress 
president jaime paz zamora who attended the meeting in 
cartagena colombia says coca leaf must be reduced in exchange 
for development 
it is not just a question of substituting one hectare of coca 
for oranges or coffee but the development of the country because 
coca is an integral part of the economy 
it means transforming bolivia economically so that it will no 
longer depend on cocaleaf farming and cocaine production for a 
large share of its export earnings 
a hectare is slightly less than 2 acres coca leaf is the raw 
material that becomes cocaine after processing 
in their communique on the warondrugs presidents bush paz 
virgilio barco of colombia and alan garcia of peru noted that 
persuading andean farmers to turn from coca production to legal 
crops would have significant immediate and longterm economic 
costs on colombia peru and bolivia 
it said bush pledged to request an economic aid package from 
congress for fiscal 1991 to 1994 to help offset these losses 
bolivian farmers have begun in recent months to eradicate 
significant numbers of coca plants but only after increased drug 
enforcement programs in colombia and bolivia led to a sharp drop in 
cocaleaf prices 
the united states believes the two policies must go 
handinhand urging farmers to grow substitute crops and cracking 
down on the illegal drug trade itself 
the chapare is a tropical region in the heart of bolivia that 
produces an estimated onethird of the leaf used to make cocaine 
past efforts to eradicate coca plants there failed farmers were 
unwilling to switch to other crops that were not profitable and for 
which markets did not exist 
before colombia began its drug crackdown last august farmers 
destroyed an average of 200 hectares 494 acres of coca a month 
under the bolivian crop substitution program 
but the overall area devoted to coca cultivation increased from 
34135 hectares in 1988 to 38250 hectares in 1989 us government 
figures indicate 
farmers harvested four crops of coca leaf a year and had no 
problem marketing their leaves to coca paste producers coca paste 
is flown from the chapare to northern bolivia colombia or brazil 
where it is processed into cocaine base which becomes refined into 
pure cocaine 
following the crackdown in colombia however and an intense 
cocaine interdiction program in bolivia farmers have been unable 
to sell their leaves to paste producers and traffickers as a 
result cocaleaf prices have fallen and farmers are flocking in 
increasing numbers to government agencies to sign up for crop 
substitution programs 
in december and january farmers destroyed 1266 hectares of coca 
in exchange for 2000 for every hectare destroyed 
in early february 100 pounds of coca leaf was selling for 5 to 
8 while the cost of production is estimated at 30 
the us ambassador to bolivia robert s gelbard told the 
associated press on thursday 
the fact that the voluntary eradication program has begun to 
show significant progress in the last two months proves that 
interdiction eradication and alternative development programs are 
three interdependent parts of an integrated strategy and must be 
pursued simultaneously and with equal strength

the president said the united states will provide 22 billion 
worth of aid over a five year period to help underwrite the drug 
war and to promote crop substitution in the andean coca growing 
nations 
at his airport news conference bush said he had told the other 
leaders that the united states is making headway in dealing with 
drug demand at home he said im not satisfied with it but the 
situation is improving 
the president said he will work with the latin american 
cocaproducing countries to encourage other crops these 
economies are hurting because of the kind of export problems they 
are encountering he said but he said trade problems are not 
onesided that they involve the united states as an importing 
nation too bush said none of that should be an excuse for growing 
the illegal crop behind cocaine 
bushs security against the possibility of terrorist attack by 
the drug cartel had overshadowed the drug meeting in the days 
before it was held the president said hed had full confidence in 
his safety all along at his final appearance in colombia bush 
said he wasnt surprised that the journey and the meeting had been 
secure and without incident

argentina and britain agreed thursday to 
restore full diplomatic relations nearly eight years after they 
fought a 74day war over the falkland islands 
after two days of talks in madrid the announcement was read in 
spanish by lucio del solar ambassador at large for argentina and 
in english by sir crispin tickell british ambassador to the united 
nations 
britain agreed to lift a 150mile military protection zone it 
has enforced around the south atlantic islands since a task force 
sent by prime minister margaret thatcher defeated argentine 
invaders in june 1982 
new security arrangements for the archipelago 300 miles off 
argentinas southeast coast which are home to about 1900 people 
and thousands of sheep are to involve advance notice by both sides 
of military maneuvers in the area 
the presence of an estimated 2000 british soldiers at mount 
pleasant outside port stanley the falklands capital was not 
mentioned in thursdays agreement although argentina had 
previously called for a reduction 
argentina and britain also agreed to consult on relations 
between the european economic community and latin america and to 
establish a working group on south atlantic affairs 
in london foreign secretary douglas hurd said of the agreement 
it underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with argentina 
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty so 
its a very good agreement and i hope its a turning point and will 
lead to a new relationship 
president carlos menem of argentina told reporters in buenos 
aires everything is resolved aside from having eliminated 
definitively i believe the possibilities of an armed conflict 
it opens wide possibilities for us in the european economic 
community 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral declared 
i very much welcome the decision by both governments to 
reestablish diplomatic relations this immediately creates an 
atmosphere of confidence 
the battle for the south atlantic islands which argentina calls 
the malvinas cost the lives of 712 argentines 255 britons and 
three islanders dissatisfaction over the war which argentinas 
military government claimed to be winning until shortly before the 
surrender contributed to the end in 1983 of nearly eight years of 
military rule 
thursdays agreement stiplulated that talks would continue on 
fishing rights and that the international red cross would arrange 
visits by argentines to war cemeteries in the falklands 
garcia del solar called the accord very satisfactory and 
tickell said the decision to end the military zone by the end of 
march set a new base for relations between our two countries 
there is no secret understanding no confidential 
memorandum he said its all here 
a breakthrough in october provide for renewed consular ties 
resumption of air and maritime links and moves toward lifting all 
trade restrictions 
by mutual consent the latest talks did not touch on sovereignty 
claims 
britain says it colonized the islands in 1766 when john macbride 
founded port egmont spain gained control but permitted the british 
to remain until 1774 then abandoned the islands when it ceased to 
govern argentina in 1810 
argentina traces its claim in the treaty of tordesillas which 
assigned new world territories to spain and portugal in 1494 it 
says the british occupied the islands by force in 1833 when capt 
john onslow expelled the argentine population

nearly half of working american adults do not 
believe social security will be able to pay them benefits when they 
retire according to a survey released thursday by a private 
research institute 
the december survey of 1001 adults found that 49 percent of 
those who had not yet retired were confident social security would 
be able to pay them benefits 47 percent did not expect to get 
benefits and 4 percent were unsure 
the survey conducted by the gallup organization was 
commissioned and released by the employee benefit research 
institute a nonprofit nonpartisan research group 
the institutes president dallas salisbury said the results 
indicate people are unrealistically pessimistic about the 
social security system and that they have not been well educated 
about how it works 
salisbury said confidence in social security could drop further 
as public debate continues on a proposal by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny to cut social security taxes to keep the 
government from using social security revenue for general 
government operations 
the debate is bringing into question the ability of the system 
to pay future benefits salisbury said 
president bush has criticized the moynihan proposal and claims 
that it could jeopardize benefits for future retirees 
the survey found that confidence in social security benefits was 
highest among those who were closest to retirement with 76 percent 
of those aged 55 and older expecting to receive benefits compared 
with 46 percent of those aged 1834 
in other results 50 percent of those who had not yet retired 
planned to retire by age 62 and 11 percent said they planned to 
retire by age 50 just 29 percent were aware that the age at which 
full retirement benefits are paid gradually will rise from 65 to 67 
beginning in the year 2000 
the survey also found that 53 percent of those who had not yet 
retired planned to continue working after they begin collecting 
social security benefits however 18 percent of those people 
changed their minds after being advised that social security 
benefits are reduced for workers whose earnings exceed a specific 
threshold 9360 in 1990 
the survey had a margin of uncertainty of about three percentage 
points either way

store owners in israel australia and switzerland 
pulled bottles of perrier sparkling water from the shelves thursday 
as a general worldwide recall got under way 
but beverage industry analysts remained divided about whether 
the tony brand in the distinctive green bottle will ever recover 
its prestige 
the recall affects 160 million bottles of the water in 120 
countries and could cost the company up to 200 million francs or 
35 million officials said 
perrier president gustave leven announced the worldwide recall 
wednesday after traces of the cancercausing chemical benzene were 
found in recent weeks in some bottles shipped to the united states 
canada west germany denmark and the netherlands 
premier michel rocard saluted perriers move to withdraw some 
160 million bottles of its water from sale as a courageous 
decision 
marketing and beverage experts in the united states disagreed on 
whether the brand will be able to recover 
the answer is a qualified yes said neil berlant managing 
partner of water research associates a los angelesbased merchant 
banking firm specializing in investment in the water industry 
the qualification he said was that they dont determine that 
the problem is indeed with the spring 
tom pirko president of bevmark inc a management consulting 
company based in los angeles said the companys altered 
explanation of what caused the contamination of some of its bottles 
hurt chances for recovery 
company officials initially attributed the contamination with 
benzene to cleaning equipment that had been cleaned improperly but 
later in the week said it resulted from a dirty filter that was 
designed to remove benzene 
we do a lot of work in the water business and i dont know of 
any single source with benzene in it pirko said i think 
perrier has seen its day 
jesse meyers who publishes the newsletter beverage digest in 
greenwich conn said that barring any new negative surprises in 
the recall story the brand could come back stronger than ever 
i think perrier has done as much as any company could in 
eliminating the problem meyers said 
in another development the investigative commission des 
operations de bourse announced that analysis of heavy options 
trading volume in the companys shares last friday turned up no 
evidence of insider trading 
perrier bottles had been pulled from the shelves in the united 
states canada west germany denmark and the netherlands before 
wednesdays general recall bottles were also withdrawn in japan as 
a precautionary measure 
on thursday thousands of bottles were taken off the shelves in 
switzerland and israel when health officials in those countries 
said traces of benzene had been found in test samples 
the waters australian distributor cocacola amatil withdrew a 
further 960000 bottles to comply with the recall though tests for 
benzene had not been completed 
benzene a chemical used in cleaning solvents turned up in 
tests on perrier water run by the us food and drug administration 
early this month and prompted a weekend recall of 72 million 
bottles 
managing director frederik zimmer of perrier said wednesday that 
benzene entered the bottled water due to a dirty pipe filter at the 
underground spring at vergeze in southern france 
the company separates the water from natural carbon dioxide gas 
in the spring and both are piped separately to the bottling plant 
where the gas is reinjected into the water zimmer said 
a filter on the gas line that cleans the carbon dioxide of small 
amounts of naturally occurring benzene was not changed for several 
months zimmer said allowing traces of benzene to slip through 
the filter should be replaced every six weeks zimmer said 
blaming negligence by workers zimmer said investigators found the 
filter was the cause of the benzene traces on sunday 
other company officials had said monday that contamination 
occurred when a worker used benzene solvents to degrease equipment 
zimmer said that was false 
the company waited three days to notify the public of how the 
benzene entered the bottled water because it wished to run further 
tests and be sure of its evidence zimmer said 
perrier has advised distributors to dispose of the water on site 
and return the bottles to france where they will be cleaned 
refilled with fresh water dated and exported the company hopes to 
be back to normal on the global market in 2 months

mayor marion barry was indicted thursday on 
eight charges of possessing crack cocaine and lying repeatedly to a 
federal grand jury questioning him about drug use i know that 
when a trial is held i will be exonerated barry declared 
barry was undergoing treatment at a florida substance abuse 
clinic when the grand jury returned the indictment to a federal 
magistrate he enrolled in the clinic after his arrest last month 
in what authorities say was a videotaped hotel drug sting 
he said in a statement that the indictment represents a 
continuation of the political lynching and excesses that the 
justice department in this multiyear multimillion dollar effort 
to investigate me and the barry administration 
barry said he had no plans to resign his lawyer r kenneth 
mundy said barry would return from florida for arraignment within 
10 days and plead innocent 
mundy said the charges arent as devastating as harsh as i 
expected them to be but that a felony conviction would be 
disastrous for the mayor 
in the face of rumors that have dogged him the past several 
years barry steadfastly denied ever using drugs in his statement 
thursday barry said he was undergoing treatment for the disease 
of alcoholism 
only one of the charges filed thursday stems from the videotaped 
hotel room encounter between barry and rasheeda moore a onetime 
barry girlfriend who is cooperating with investigators the other 
charges result from his association with charles lewis who has 
pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges 
the 14month investigation has focused on barrys ties to lewis 
barry has told top political aides he would abandon his hopes 
for a fourth term but sources close to the mayor have said he 
would refrain from making any quick public statement about his 
political future any time soon 
the mayor has turned the daytoday operations of the district 
of columbia government over to a top deputy 
the felony perjury counts all stem from questions a grand jury 
asked him about visits to lewis washington hotel room in december 
1988 four of the five misdemeanor possession charges result from 
the same investigation the fifth possession count represents the 
formal lodging of a charge in connection with his jan 18 cocaine 
possession arrest 
us attorney jay b stephens said of the perjury charges mr 
barry falsely testified that he was unaware of any narcotics 
activity by mr charles lewis when he stated that mr lewis had 
never given him mr barry any narcotics and when he stated that 
he mr barry had never given any narcotics to mr lewis 
stephens would not take questionsafter reading a brief statement 
to reporters 
each of the three false declaration charges carries a fiveyear 
maximum prison term and a maximum fine of 250000 each possesion 
charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in a jail and a fine 
of 100000 
if convicted of a felony the 53yearold mayor would be 
required to resign with city council chairman david clarke 
becoming acting mayor a special election would be held within 120 
days of any resignation unless that date fell within 60 days of 
the regularly scheduled nov 6 general election 
clarke one of four announced democratic candidates vying for 
barrys job described the legal developments as a tragedy for 
marion and for the city 
jesse jackson also has been considered a possible candidate for 
the post but has said he will not run against barry 
since his arrest barrys political support in the city has 
dwindled and several supporters have urged him not to seek another 
term there also have been calls for his resignation 
council member betty ann kane said the grand jury indictment 
certainly undermines all the excuses being made that this was 
some sort of plot by the us attorney to get the mayor and she 
said barrys resignation might be in his best interests and the 
citys best interests 
stephens has said the investigation of barry began in december 
1988 after city police aborted an attempt to make an undercover 
drug purchase from lewis a longtime friend of the mayor after 
learning barry was in lewis room 
lewis who pleaded guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges last 
november testified that he supplied barry with crack cocaine he 
agreed to cooperate with the probe when prosecutors offered to drop 
more serious drug charges against him 
rumors of barry drug use have followed him for much of the past 
decade 
in one episode convicted cocaine dealer karen johnson was 
jailed in 1984 for eight months for contempt of court after 
refusing to tell a grand jury whether she used drugs with barry or 
sold them to the mayor or other top city officials 
barry who is married acknowledged having a personal 
relationship with johnson but denied using drugs with her 
another woman maria mccarthy of greensboro nc was jailed 
for contempt of court on tuesday after refusing to testify about 
her relationship with barry according to her attorney 
throughout barry steadfastly and sometimes angrily rejected 
all questions or suggestions that he was involved with drugs 
when he announced that he was entering the hanleyhazelden 
clinic the mayor only said that he was taking steps to heal my 
body mind and soul

abc news anchorwoman paula zahn bound for cbs 
this morning said goodbye on the air thursday to her good 
morning america colleagues not mentioning cbs but saying i 
have a wonderful opportunity to go into 
although cbs had no comment on reports she is joining cbs news 
her agent richard leibner confirmed she is headed there he 
declined to elaborate 
after a few tiny details are wrapped up theres no question 
that shell be at cbs said leibner who handled negotiations for 
diane sawyer when she left cbs last year to join abc as coanchor 
of primetime live 
zahns abc contract ended thursday a source close to her 
contract talks said abc hoped she would stay there but didnt make 
a counteroffer to cbs bid a fouryear pact paying about 11 
million annually 
zahn who joined abc news in the fall of 1987 has been 
coanchor of world news this morning and the news segments of 
good morning america since may 1988 the latter program is 
produced by abc entertainment 
a source familiar with negotiations for her services said that 
zahn would succeed kathleen sullivan as coanchor of the 
bottomrated cbs this morning and probably would start work 
feb 26 
friday will be sullivans last day on the program according to 
a memo sent staff members by the shows executive producer erik 
sorenson who said faith daniels would be her temporary replacement 
next week 
in a statement abc news president roone arledge praised zahns 
work and said we wish her all the best in her new assignment 
abc was terrific to her she loved it there and appreciated 
what arledge and others did for her leibner said but an 
extraordinary opportunity doesnt come down the pike that often 
its a sad departure to a new adventure 
zahns move to cbs has been expected ever since ron konecky 
sullivans agent said last week that cbs is taking sullivan off 
cbs this morning sullivan and harry smith have been coanchors 
of the show since it began in 1987 
in her farewell to viewers and good morning america cohost

reporter at los angeles tv station kcbs where sullivan began in 
1977 zahn started her career a year later at wfaatv in dallas 
sullivans cbs contract expires in november konecky said last 
week that cbs had given no specific reason why they wanted to 
replace her and had set no date for her to leave he said he was 
discussing other possibilities for her at cbs

the principles of this alliance 
in signing the document weve committed ourselves to the first 
common comprehensive international drug control strategy we in 
fact created the first antidrug cartel 
the document which creates a flexible framework under which the 
four of us will coordinate our activities covers the major issues 
of economic assistance demand reduction expanded law enforcement 
and interdiction activities the involvement of military resources 
where possible appropriate and the control of precursor 
chemicals automatic weapons and other key components of the 
narcotics trade the pursuit of profits and sharing of seized 
assets and a commitment on the part of all of us to continue to 
gather regularly to coordinate our activities 
in addition to signing this document of cartagena we begin the 
process of executing bilateral agreements in support of the 
document today secretary of state james a baker executed the 
agreements with peru on tax information exchange public awareness 
and extradition and with bolivia on public awareness and the 
export of defense articles director william bennett of the 
office of national drug control policy executed a bilateral 
agreement with bolivia on the control of precursor chemicals 
equally important the four of us today had an opportunity to 
discuss in total candor the problem that illegal drug trafficking 
and use presents to each of our societies 
i also had the opportunity to review with my colleagues the 
greatly expanded counternarcotics activities of the us 
government the 22 billion fiveyear program to which the united 
states is committed to support our partners in this struggle was 
discussed in some detail 
in addition i had the opportunity to explain our plans to 
expand the 75 billion inside the united states on treatment 
prevention and criminal justice support i believe they were 
impressed with the major increase in resources which weve 
committed to reducing demand in our country 
i must say i also listened very carefully to the challenges that 
each of the three countries face and have come away with the new 
ideas worthy of consideration with a better personal understanding 
and appreciation of the problems that my allies face in this 
struggle 
and i cannot leave this beautiful country colombia without 
once again emphasizing that president barco and all of his 
citizens who have joined him in this brave fight against drug 
trafficking are an inspiration to me and an inspiration to the 
american people i came here today to make the point as clear as i 
could that they do not and will not stand alone they will have 
the steady and sustained support of the united states i want to 
try to help them in the multilateral institutions help president

i want to thank him and his many colleagues for the most 
hospitable arrangements that we encountered here in barranquilla 
and over in cartagena it was a great pleasure to be here albeit 
very very briefly so thank you again president barco and i offer 
you my profound appreciation for your steadfast efforts in the 
fight against narcotics 
ill take just a few questions because were scooting on yeah 
helen 
q mr president how long do you think it will take to replace 
the coca plant and how much will it cost 
a well i know we did not go into replacement cost and i 
expect any program that tries to shape their economy to move it 
out of planting which is very difficult for those governments to 
control is going to take some time and i cant give you a time 
estimate on that 
terry and then well go 
q mr president are you surprised that the narcoterrorists 
didnt strike today that there was no either attack on you or any 
bombing in this country just to register displeasure with your 
visit 
a well you know i got a question at the press conference over 
there on security and i want to thank not only the security people 
here but our own security people secret service and others who 
were concerned with the security of the president and i am not 
surprised 
yeah britt 
q mr president i gather you chose to not to raise today 
that rather ticklish question of a us navy radar net somewhere 
off the coast here why not sir 
a well there was no discussion of a radar net there was so 
much misunderstanding over what was intended in the first time 
first place that its not timely to do that however there was 
discussion of interdiction and my reasserting to those countries 
all three of them my intention to interdict narcotics coming into 
this country but there wasnt the the stories on the us task 
force were so distorted that i felt it was better to keep talking 
in general terms about our military interdiction efforts rather 
than asking for support from any one of the three countries 
q do you feel now after this meeting that your understanding 
with these leaders may have been enhanced to the point where you 
might soon be able to raise that topic again 
a well it depends what in what way yes well in the first 
place i feel the understanding is enhanced and it was a frank 
meeting i mean they were very frank with us on things that maybe 
they wanted me to do more of or disagreed with but i think that 
the idea of working cooperatively for interdiction is very 
important you heard president barcos answer there in at 
cartagena on that question so were not going to push were not 
going to do something of that nature without a cooperative effort 
but there are efforts in terms of interdiction on the high seas 
that the united states will continue to do 
yeah these three right here these three 
q mr president you acknowledged in the document today that 
the us has a responsibility to help these economies wean 
themselves from the drug trade do you see that responsibility as 
jobforjob and dollaranddollar 
a no but i see us making every effort we can to help 
thembecause they do have some severe problems and i mention now 
trying to help colombia for example in the multilateral agencies 
for example theres a lot of ways to try to help but i dont 
think it is a jobforjob kind of approach 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900215-0172 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
i dont think we can do that i dont think theres a way the 
united states can do it or that any of the individual leaders can 
do it we had a long discussion about the supply and demand of 
cocaine how market prices affect what the farmers do in peru or 
bolivia so it isnt a jobforjob question 
q mr president any successful interdiction strategy would 
require increased militarytomilitary cooperation is the us 
already installing a ground radar system in peru i mean in bolivia 
or colombia im sorry or in any way helping the colombians now 
to install a ground radar system 
a no but id have to defer that question to someow nothing of it 
but i know there was a report that was written 
up that proved to be totally inaccurate because i was just told 
that there was a report saying there was some 200 people building a 
ground rbody here i 
knadar station but i simply dont know it if there is and 
id be surprised frankly 
q do you know to what extent the us and colombia are in fact 
cooperating militarily now in terms of interdiction efforts 
a well i yes i know that 
q can you share that with us 
a no next 
q why not sir 
a because i dont feel like it and because some of the things 
we do with colombia if i shared it with you maybe the drug 
narcotraffickers wo a disease that affects millions of americans 
including such notable and courageous individuals as former first 
lady betty ford 
i have derived great benefit from my stay here at the alcohol 
rehabilitation center in florida and i know that recovery is a 
lifelong process to which i have dedicated myself 
but for now as i go through this healing process i want to 
make sure that my wife and our son are psychologically and 
emotionally comfortable after all that we have through and will be 
going through as a family i do not want them badgered and dogged 
at every turn they do not suffer from the disease i do any 
consequences should be mine to bear not theirs 
i am extremely proud of the way my management team headed by 
city administrator carol thompson has handled the affairs of 
government in my absence i know this budget period is a tough time 
for carol my staff director maudine cooper deputy mayors bob 
pohlman and wylie williams director of special services tina 
smith and the agency directors who must explain the serious 
realities of the citys financial picture during an election year 
i know citizens need assurance that their needs will be met and 
that the same high quality government services will continue 
uninterrupted in spite of the meanspirited and calculating people 
who would like to see us fail as a local government i put a strong 
management team in place and i can reassure you that government is 
operating smoothly efficiently and effectively and under the 
barry philosophy of quality compassionate competent and caring 
service 
i want to say to all that when i decided to go away to deal with 
my health concerns my political decisions were placed on hold and 
will be determined within the next 60 days anita bonds is the only 
person designated and authorized by me to speak on political 
matters 
my lawyer kenneth mundy and i are now preparing to go to court 
and win this case i will have no announcement about my political 
future at this point 
i hope the media will respect my right to continue my recovery 
in private and allow me to obtain the full benefit of treatment 
for this disease during my absence i urge you to respect the 
rights of my wife and my son to lead private lives as we go forward 
during this highly political legal procedure i ask that you 
confine your questions about the legal case to my attorney any 
other questions about me should be directed to my press secretary 
lurma rackley 
to all of you who continue to remember me my family and this 
city in your prayers i sincerely thank you

q mr president how can we expect the bolivians and peruvians 
not to grow coca if we block their exports of flowers citrus 
sugar 
a well i dont know if you heard the question the question 
is how can we expect them not to grow coca if we have other trade 
problems and you mention sugar and flowers 
i think the leaders here recognize that growing coca for the 
international drug market is immoral and wrong and i think they 
believe that and so they need assistance if we have a flower 
problem and we do i think we take 80 to 90 percent of the cut 
flowers from colombia weve got to try to help on it i dont 
know that we can solve it 
coffee is a major problem for brazil and the other countries 
and were trying i mean for colombia and also brazil and the 
other countries with whom we met aside please just one minute 
im not going to get to you i dont think because this may be the 
last one 
and so we have to work with them very cooperatively but in 
trying to get a coffee agreement 
but what i did get from these people and i think i knew it 
ahead of time but had it reinforced was that these economies are 
hurting because of the kinds of export problems they are 
encountering i have a problem in trying to explain it to them that 
theres you know consumers in the united states the largest 
market for coffee they dont necessarily want to pay higher prices 
for it 
the same for flowers so weve got what we did on the flowers 
is explain the procedures at the commerce department and say that 
we would try to help in negotiating that but the point is it 
shouldnt be linked to whether to whether people you know 
condone the growing of a crop that is illegal and that theyre 
trying to stop as a matter of fact 
q will you 
q mr president will you address that 
a inaudible 
q off mike europe and japan in future negotiations 
a youre the guy yes were going to talk about that at the 
g7 group of seven economic summit meeting in houston just as we 
did in paris last year its a very important agenda item for the 
g7 and the more they get involved because theyre user 
countries the better it will be 
so ill give a full report to the g7 and other european 
countries on this icebreaking meeting here and you can be sure it 
will be on the agenda at the g7 summit in houston

minneapolisst paul at the head of working mother magazines top 
10 list of us metropolitan areas 
the magazine published the rankings in its march issue 
distributed to newsstands thursday saying the list was based on 
exhaustive research into every major city in the united states 
working mother said the minnesota twin cities region was 
especially attractive because the local government and business 
community take an active role in helping families particularly 
with child care 
the magazine said that minneapolis and st paul with their 
longstanding tradition of political progressivism have become a 
mecca of business and government support for working parents 
the other metropolitan areas on the list ranked in order are 
pittsburgh raleigh nc milwaukee orlando fla seattle 
phoenix boston san jose calif and san francisco 
the magazine said the last three on the list were considered 
models in terms of progressive attitudes toward families with 
working parents but that their high cost of living made them 
unaffordable for many 
it said the criteria for judging included affordable accessible 
child care and a quality school system afterschool programs 
parks and other leisuretime facilities and a cost of living low 
enough to make it feasible to enjoy shortterm pleasures and save 
for longterm goals like college 
in addition the magazine said the cities were ranked based on 
an abundance of job prospects decent salary levels and employee 
benefits opportunities for career advancement and the almost 
intagible involvement of the business community as well as state 
and local governments in qualityoflife and work issues

thirtyfive million americans report suffering 
from arthritis and 6 million admit they havent seen a doctor 
about it according to a survey released thursday by federal health 
officials 
this confirms our suspicions that people are seeing 
painkiller ads on tv and treating their arthritis themselves 
and very possibly doing damage to themselves said steve 
erickson spokesman for the arthritis foundation based in atlanta 
the highest incidence of arthritis was in florida 18 percent 
while the lowest was in alaska 9 percent 
more than 3000 people were asked in 1987 if they had 
experienced various arthritic conditions in the past year if they 
had consulted a physician about the condition and if their 
arthritis was limiting their work or their household lives the 
national centers for disease control said 
nationwide the survey found 146 percent of the population 
reported arthritis and 121 percent had consulted a doctor about

the feeling that nothing can be done for arthritis beyond 
taking overthecounter pain medication is a real big 
misconception erickson said there are a lot of things you can 
do 
the problem will probably get worse if pain relievers are the 
only treatment he said 
these findings indicate the need to determine why these 
persons have not sought medical care and to identify approaches 
for overcoming barriers to care the cdc said in its weekly 
report 
women reported higher rates of arthritis than men 18 percent to 
11 percent women also were more likely to have seen a doctor about 
their arthritis 15 percent to 9 percent and were more likely to 
report limits in their activity 4 percent to 2 percent 
overall 3 percent said arthritis was limiting their activities 
there was little racial difference in arthritis reporting 15 
percent for whites and 14 percent for blacks 
as might be expected arthritis rates increased with age eleven 
percent of respondents aged 3544 reported arthritis compared with 
23 percent of those 4554 by the 75andover group the rate was 
53 percent compared to just 3 percent in the under35 group 
the high rate of arthritis in florida is due to its relatively 
large population of elderly persons the cdc said 
alaskas low rate can be attributed in part to its high native 
american and pacific islander populations among whom the 
prevalence of arthritic conditions is low the report said 
erickson said too few people are aware of the warning signs of 
arthritis such as joint swelling early morning stiffness 
recurring joint pain or inability to move a joint that lasts for 
more than two weeks people with those symptoms should see a 
doctor the arthritis foundation said

officers demanding the firing of 
military leaders who served dictator nicolai ceausescu protested 
for a fourth day thursday joined by more than 2000 civilians 
the officers said they would continue until the dismissal of 
defense minister nicolae militaru interior minister mihai chitac 
and others who were in the military hierarchy before ceausescu was 
overthrown and executed in december 
fiftyeight officers who spent three nights inside government 
headquarters on victory square left the building early thursday 
after premier petre roman agreed to investigate militaru and chitac 
they continued their protest outside and about 2000 civilians 
joined them late thursday including hihai stanescu romanias 
bestknown cartoonist the crowd dwindled when heavy rain began 
alexandra marielise popescu a 34yearold translator who joined 
the crowd with several friends said the army helped us in the 
revolution and we must help them 
we think theyre in danger because of the securitate 
ceausescus secret police they are trying to penetrate into the 
old structure again and to hold positions 
silviu brucan of the national salvation front which took power 
during the uprising told the associated press the officers are 
almost 80 percent right but an army without discipline is not an 
army and all officers should understand this 
official media said seven securitate officers were sentenced in 
sibiu central romania for complicity in genocide by trying to 
crush the revolution 
col iulian rotariu securitate commander in sibiu got a 
20year prison sentence and sentences for the others ranged from 15 
to 18 years 
sibiu was governed by ceausescus son nicu who was captured 
dec 22 authorities have said he will be tried but he has not 
been seen by the public since his arrest 
officers in victory square said similar protests were under way 
in the western city of timisoara where the uprising began and the 
black sea port of costanta 
the bucharest protest which began monday was the militarys 
first challenge to the revolutionary government it helped create 
many officers said they felt the peoples victory was threatened 
because former communists in the military were trying to protect 
their positions 
roman said the new commission would investigate the role of 
individual officers during the revolution and reconsider military 
appointments and promotions made since dec 22 the day ceausescu 
was overthrown he was executed three days later 
dr david vasile who has the military rank of lieutenant major 
said rapid measures should have been taken immediately after the 
restoration of democracy to change all the top people in the 
army vasile was charged with insubordination under ceausescu for 
refusing to obey orders 
he said most of the top brass were agents of the securitate or 
cooperated with the agency the interest they have now is to 
cover themselves he said 
the officers have accused interior minister chitac of being a 
direct participant in repressive actions in timisoara citing 
unconfirmed reports that a videotape exists showing chitac shooting 
demonstrators 
they accuse militaru who came out of retirement to be defense 
minister of creating a state of tension in the army and 
demand he be replaced by a civilian

a court convicted three west german 
hackers on thursday of selling western military computer codes to 
the soviet kgb secret police and gave them suspended sentences 
ranging from 14 months to two years 
chief judge leopold spiller said sentences were suspended 
because it could not be proven that substantial damage had been 
done to west germany or its nato partners through the 
hackers actions but he also said the three purposely sold the 
computer codes for money to the kgb 
court records show one defendant peter carl made at least 25 
contacts with the soviets and received 54500 for the computer 
information which he split with the others 
carl 35 computer specialist dirk brzezinski 30 and computer 
programmer markus hess 28 were arrested in march 1989 after an 
investigation by us and west german officials revealed they had 
obtained passwords and codes giving them access to major military 
and research computers in the united states western europe and 
japan 
carl drew 24 months hess 20 months and brzezinski 14 months 
a fourth man karl koch 30 was arrested in the case but 
committed suicide last may 
us officials said last year that the hackers were stopped 
short of obtaining any highly classified information 
investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and 
passwords for computers in japan britain france italy 
switzerland and west germany were also obtained and sold to the 
soviet by the hackers 
all three defendants admitted guilt in obtaining codes to sell 
to a soviet kgb agent in east berlin 
at the trial which began on jan 11 carl testified he could 
identify the agent only as serge and said he did not wish to 
reveal anything more about the soviets in open court for fear of 
reprisals

colombian officials and the us 
embassy on thursday denied press reports that the united states 
sent radar equipment and troops to the city of bucaramanga to 
establish a radar network for drug interdiction efforts 
however columbia and the united states last year announced they 
were setting up a radar station on the colombian caribbean island 
of san andres to monitor air traffic and equipment for that 
station began arriving two months ago according to an embassy 
spokeswoman 
the united states is ready to help set up a series of radar 
stations in colombia bolivia and peru to interdict the small 
planes that fly tons of cocaine into the united states each year a 
us diplomat in bogota told the associated press last week 
the diplomat spoke on condition that he not be identified by 
name 
the diplomat said the united states had begun preliminary 
discussions with the latin american countries about setting up the 
net but added that the plan was still at an embryonic stage 
it was not on the table for president bushs summit meeting 
thursday with the presidents of peru bolivia and columbia he said 
crates unloaded by us soldiers at cartagena were not radar 
equipment as reported by nbc news but medical supplies said the 
embassy spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
she said the medical supplies brought in by military cargo plane 
on monday were for an agricultural corporation helping peasants in 
the northeastern state of santander 
the president of the corporation german enrique corzo 
confirmed the shipment was medical supplies as did colombian 
defense ministry spokesman col eduardo arevalo 
arevalo said members of the cargo planes crew were the only 
us military personnel who had arrived in colombia 
at his news conference following the drug summit president bush 
said he knew nothing of any such radar station being built 
asked to describe how the military services of the united states 
and columbia were cooperating to interrupt the drug traffic bush 
declined giving as his reasons because i dont feel like it 
and because some of the things we do with colombia if i shared it 
with you maybe the drug narcotraffickers would find out about it 
and i dont want to do that

attorney general yosef harish said thursday he 
was dropping an investigation into charges that a cabinet minister 
violated israels antiterrorism law by meeting with plo officials 
in january prime minister yitzhak shamir accused science 
minister ezer weizman of meeting with plo officials and forced him 
to quit the 12member cabinet it is unclear if weizman will be 
readmitted to the cabinet 
harish said he was ending his review of secret material gathered 
in a police investigation of weizmans meetings because there was 
no acceptable evidence that the minister knowingly met with plo 
officials 
an ammendment to israels antiterrorism law makes it illegal to 
knowingly hold unauthorized contacts with members or 
representatives of the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
organization 
in the occupied territories thursday palestinian activists beat 
and stabbed to death a fellow arab on suspicion of cooperation with 
israel arab reports said 
they identified the man as saadi ismail ellidawi 27 a taxi 
driver from rafah a town in the occupied gaza strip 
his death raised to 183 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs since the start of the 26monthold uprising against 
israeli occupation at least 656 palestinians have been killed and 
43 israelis have died during the rebellion 
in a fivepage official statement released by harish the 
attorney general stated that there is no acceptable evidence 
that minister weizman has committed any violations 
the statement also pointed out that weizman has parliamentary 
immunity from prosecution 
the statement said an investigation led by chief of police david 
krauss revealed that weizman had met the plos representative in 
geneva nabil ramlawi in june the statement also said in november 
weizman held a telephone conversation with ahmed tibi an israeli 
arab who was visiting tunis 
shamir had accused weizman of passing cabinet secrets to plo 
leaders in tunis during a telephone conversation 
harish said weizman had not violated the antiterrorism law 
because he met ramlawi by accident and did not know of his role in 
the plo he also said weizmans telephone conversation with tibi 
could not be considered illegal because tibi is an israeli citizen 
and not a member of the plo 
i feel justice has been done weizman told the associated 
press i am very satisfied 
weizman 65 a former defense minister who defected to labor 
from shamirs likud refused to comment when asked if he would 
demand to return to the inner cabinet

jurors in joseph hazelwoods trial 
heard a tape recording thursday of the skippers harried voice 
reporting the tanker exxon valdez had run aground and that he was 
trying to steer off the reef 
the recording was of conversations between hazelwood and the 
coast guard in the minutes after the nations worst oil spill early 
last march 24 
exxon valdez over began the first transmission of 
hazelwoods voice he said we should be on your radar weve 
fetched up hard aground evidently were leaking some oil and 
were going to be here for quite a while 
the coast guard responded youre about a mile north of bligh 
reef to which hazelwood said thats correct he promised a 
status report 
within minutes the captain of the port coast guard cmdr 
steven mccall was on the radio asking for more information 
were working our way off the reef hazelwood said right 
now were trying to steer off the reef 
mccall then urged hazelwood to take it slow and easy 
promising that help was on the way he warned against doing 
anything drastic to try to get under way and told hazelwood 
i wouldnt do much wiggling 
prosecutors allege hazelwood tried a potentially hazardous 
maneuver after the grounding which could have capsized the crippled 
ship 
other witnesses have said hazelwood ordered the engines of the 
ship restarted about 20 minutes after the grounding and gave 
commands to move forward hazelwoods lawyers maintain he was 
trying to stabilize the tanker on the reef not take the dangerous 
action of trying to move off the reef 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated if convicted the former tanker skipper 
could draw up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
earlier thursday the vessels chief mate testified he had 
warned hazelwood that the seaman who had the helm before the 
disaster needed practice in steering 
james kunkel corroborating earlier testimony by another officer 
in hazelwoods trial said hed sailed with seaman robert kagan 
four years earlier and on that voyage kagan could not perform a 
simple task such as painting a bulkhead without constant 
supervision 
he said he discussed kagans performance with hazelwood before 
the exxon valdez began its trip into prince william sound 
i mentioned id sailed with him before and i thought he needed 
extra supervision and extra practice in steering kunkel said of 
his conversation with hazelwood his steering ability needed to 
be watched 
kunkel said that after sailing with kagan in june and july 1985 
he wrote an evaluation that said kagan needed special attention and 
tended to drift off while steering 
he noted that when assigned to paint a bulkhead kagan was 
unable to proceed unless someone watched him to make sure he used 
the right paint and the right brush 
kagan was at the wheel of the exxon valdez when the tanker ran 
aground on jagged bligh reef spewing more than 10 million gallons 
of north slope crude 
kagan who was under the supervision of third mate gregory 
cousins testified he had been timid about steering since a 
previous journey when he had been reprimanded for oversteering 
cousins testified that kagan understeered the valdez failing to 
turn hard enough to avoid the grounding 
cousins said he thought kagan didnt understand the steering 
orders 
previous witnesses have said hazelwood was unaware of kagans 
problems but kunkel contradicted that 
kunkel who was in charge of loading the 987foot tanker with 
oil gave the first detailed description of the ships computerized 
oil measuring devices and of security systems designed to prevent 
spills 
he recounted racing to the cargo room after the tanker hit the 
reef and seeing the oil gauges dropping the smell of oil was 
everywhere he said 
kunkel said he sat down at a computer entered some calculations 
and received a message that the ship was no longer meeting 
required stability the ship should not go to sea 
in the first few hours he said the exxon valdez lost about 
138000 barrels and by the time the final calculations were made 
it spilled 260000 barrels or 1092 million gallons 
kunkel said he notified hazelwood of what was happening and 
discussed preparations for possibly abandoning ship he said the 
captain chose not to sound a general alarm immediately because he 
feared panic among the crew 
the prosecution contends hazelwood endangered the lives of crew 
members by not awakening them immediately after the accident 
ultimately it was not necessary for the crew to abandon the exxon 
valdez

americans are needlessly paying 20 million to 
30 million a year for useless hospital tests to detect organisms 
that cause diarrhea a new study says 
many doctors automatically order bacterial or parasite tests on 
patients who develop diarrhea while hospitalized even though most 
hospitalacquired diarrhea is caused by a toxin detected by a 
different test the study said 
doctors generally know this but are hesitant to omit routine 
tests in the absence of proof said the study led by dr don l 
siegel of the hospital of the university of pennsylvania 
siegel and his team analyzed test patterns on stool specimens of 
inpatients and outpatients with diarrhea at the hospital from 
september 1985 through august 1988 
they assumed that outpatients with diarrhea and inpatients who 
had developed it within three days or less of hospitalization 
brought the malady in with them while other cases developed while 
patients were in the hospital 
the researchers looked at two tests bacterial cultures and 
exams for parasites to detect the presence of organisms commonly 
brought in from outside such as salmonella shigella 
campylobacter and others 
results for the threeyear period showed that among 191 positive 
stool cultures and 90 positive exams for eggs and parasites only 
one occurred in a person who developed diarrhea in the hospital 
the researchers said 
the rest occurred in people who had brought the diarrhea in with 
them the researchers reported in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
yet half of the 3000 specimens sent to the hospital laboratory 
each year for the two tests came from patients who had been in the 
hospital more than three days the researchers said 
half the workload was for nothing siegel said in a 
telephone interview thursday 
overall about 22 percent of the tests were positive 
the researchers then compared those test patterns with ones for 
a test to detect the toxin manufactured by a bacteria called 
clostridium difficile which usually is responsible for 
hospitalacquired diarrhea 
they found that a quarter of those samples were positive for 
clostridium difficile toxin regardless of when patients were 
admitted 
clostridium difficile can be present in the digestive system 
without causing trouble because it is kept in check by the other 
bacteria that aid in digestion siegel said 
when antibiotics or chemotherapy kill the other bacteria the 
clostridium difficile multiply causing diarrhea he said 
the researchers concluded that the toxin tests were appropriate 
but that the cultures and parasite tests could be eliminated for 
patients who had been hospitalized for more than three days 
because they were useless 
even the one positive test among the cultures occurred in a 
person who was in the hospital for a kidney transplant three weeks 
after dining with her family at a restaurant where a salmonella 
outbreak had occurred the outbreak sickened all of the patients 
relatives indicating the patient brought the infection in with her 
the hospital subsequently eliminated routine stool cultures and 
parasite tests on patients who developed diarrhea after more than 
three days of hospitalization saving an estimated 25000 a year 
the researchers said 
a recent survey of 6500 hospitals nationwide indicated 2 
million stool cultures and 2 million stool parasite tests are 
performed annually 
at a cost of 20 and 10 each respectively if 30 percent to 50 
percent were eliminated because they are unwarranted resulting 
savings would total 20 million to 30 million the researchers 
said

soldiers wore camouflage uniforms and 
had automatic rifles at their sides helicopter gunships made 
passes over the city and its beaches while frigates patrolled the 
bay all part of an extraordinary security blanket thrown over the 
drug summit 
typifying the protective measures was a swarm of helicopters 
that accompanied president bush from barranquilla 60 miles 
northeast of here to the summit site at a heavily fortified naval 
base 
the helicopters rode fast and hugged the terrain in what was 
described as an evasionary tactic against any attack the 
presidential chopper landed fast it blew hats and helmets off 
security guards spaced around the parade grounds as a us 
counterassault team looked on its members wearing casual slacks 
polo shirts and huge backpacks 
first class weve got the best the best bush said at one 
point in boasting about the security detail 
asked at his news conference following the summit if he were 
surprised that the meeting was not attacked the president thanked 
everybody concerned with security arrangements and said i am not 
surprised 
the us security forces had taken extraordinary measures to 
guard bush following a report in december that colombian drug lords 
had taken a 30 million contract on the presidents life and 
reports that surfacetoair missiles had been acquired to shoot 
down his plane 
two us warships the nassau and the sampson were cruising off 
the colombian coast the nassau carries a marine amphibious assault 
company that can be used in the case of an emergency 
colombian navy frogmen checked the bay apparently looking for 
explosives near the spanish fortification where the presidents were 
meeting 
the air corridor between the caribbean coastal cities of 
barranquilla and cartagena was closed to civilian aircraft two 
american blackhawk helicopters belonging to colombias army joined 
in the security cover enveloping cartagena bay 
there was no apparent sign of danger to bush or to his summit 
partners presidents virgilio barco of colombia alan garcia of 
peru and jaime paz of boliva 
and yet apparently protesting the bush visit young people 
burned a cocacola truck and a commuter microbus in the 
northwestern city of medellin in front of the university of 
antioquia the colombian radio network caracol said 
in the central colombian town of barancabermeja a toll booth on 
the highway was blown up with dynamite and a wall near the booth 
was painted with the message in spanish gringos get out of 
colombia 
also near barranquila airport a small bomb damaged a voltage 
regulator on a power line that fed the air conditioning of the 
airport where bush landed two hours later 
later thursday an armed group kidnapped an american roman 
catholic priest as he and some nuns were heading to a nearby church 
to celebrate a mass the rcn radio network reported 
the rev francis amico was kidnapped as he and nuns of the 
mother theresa order were leaving the saint andres st andrewsw 
parish in the eastern part of cali the network reported 
quoting a parishs priest 
rcn report said no group or organization had immediately claimed 
responsibility for the abduction the priest works for a canadian 
religious order 
in advance of the thursday summit security had been heightened 
in cartegena bay near the finger of land where bush and the others 
held talks in a presidential guest house 
a colombian frigate had stationed itself just off the coast of 
the peninsula and small patrol boats were speeding along the shores 
with machine guns pointed inland 
across the bay from the peninsula authorities had forced the 
fishing boats that normally crowd cartagenas docks to leave and 
except for some decrepit ships too damaged to move the wharves 
were empty 
naval authorities closed off cartagenas bay to private boat 
traffic and were guarding it with frogmen frigates highspeed 
patrol boats and at least one submarine helicopters hovered above 
highrise luxury hotels where guests were being required to submit 
to fingerprinting 
cartagenas streets normally packed with traffic and 
pedestrians in the early morning hours were practically abandoned 
scores of troops also surrounded the convention center where 
much of the international press watched barcos welcoming speech 
broadcast on a giant screen television from the guest house across 
the bay 
soldiers stood on the roof of the convention center as military 
patrols roamed the sunbaked streets below

prime minister bob hawke on friday 
called a general election for march 24 in a bid to gain a record 
fourth consecutive term for his labor government 
hawke 60 said the electorate faced clear and stark 
alternatives in a vote for his governments record on managing 
the economy 
we can as a nation make the choice to continue on the path of 
steady growth or under the conservatives we can choose to forsake 
the future in a traumatic rerun of the late 70s and early 80s 
he said 
hawke consistently rates as one of australias most popular 
leaders ever despite his tearful confessions on national 
television about infidelity many years ago his daughters onetime 
heroin addiction and his problems with alcohol 
recent opinion polls show support for the ruling australian 
labor party at 45 percent compared with the conservative 
liberalnational party coalition of 42 percent 
labor currently has 85 seats in 148seat house of 
representatives which chooses the government the liberal party 
has 45 seats and its coalition partner national party has 18 seats 
the coalition now led by andrew peacock was in power from 1975 
to 1983 
hawke in his announcement also targeted the environment as an 
issue warning a return to a coalition government would lead to 
environmental degradation 
we as a nation simply cannot afford to go back to the 
blinkered ideology of our conservative opponents he added 
hawkes announcement at a news conference left 36 days for 
campaigning three above the minimum required by parliamentary law 
he said the countrys 10 million voters could not have withstood 
a longer campaign adding we would have collectively gone 
bonkers 
hawke said he expected to be victorious and lead the government 
to an unprecedented fifth term before retiring the labor party 
under hawke was first elected to government in march 1983 and was 
reelected in early polls in 1984 and 1987 
an announcement of elections had been widely expected and the 
deadline for calling the poll was may 12 term of government is 
three years 
the timing of the election comes at a time of generally low 
credibility for the government over the high 17 percent interest 
rates that have hurt home buyers and small businesses

friday to singapore host of the next asiapacific economic 
cooperation meeting japan is not on his itinerary

ousted communist chief erich honecker took 
blame for the east german crisis and admitted that countrywide 
local elections in may were manipulated according to a statement 
thursday night on east german tv 
outrage over the municipal elections was a major factor in the 
peaceful popular uprising headed by prodemocracy forces that led 
to honeckers ouster oct 18 
the 77yearold ailing former leader has been accused of 
widespread abuse of powers and fraud during his 18year stalinist 
rule and faces trial next month for high treason and corruption 
rainer eppelmann of democratic awakening a prominent east 
berlin cleric and one of eight opposition officials added to 
communist premier hans modrows caretaker government on feb 5 
read the following honecker declaration on tv 
according to my earlier declarations i admit being 
politically responsible for the crisis in which the state and the 
people of east germany are suffering now this extends to the 
circumstances that led eventually to the manipulation of the 
election results on may 7 1989 
at the same time i want to stress that i never in my life 
made political decisions out of egoistic motives and that i feel 
free of any guilt in a juridical sense 
honecker tried to hold out against the tide of reform that 
coursed eastern europe last fall but thousands upon thousands of 
people from his frontline soviet bloc state began escaping to the 
west in august through hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
that set off rallies inside east germany that finally forced 
leadership changes huge protests marked the 40th anniversary of

vassar college students upset over a 
remark allegedly made by sen daniel patrick moynihan ended their 
35hour occupation of a campus building thursday after officials 
agreed to hear their grievances 
jeff rosenberg a member of the vassar student union which 
helped organize the occupation said about 100 protesters also left 
the building because moynihan has relinguished an honorary chair 
and the 1000 stipend it carries 
the students began their occupation wednesday to protest an 
offensive remark allegedly made by moynihan dny to a black 
jamaican woman he did not know was a dutchess county official 
falomi gray head of the county youth bureau claimed moynihan 
made a racial remark after she challenged him during a jan 29 
lecture for his comment that the united states is a model of a 
reasonably successful multiethnic society 
gray said moynihan told her that if she doesnt like it in the 
united states she should pack her bags and go back to where she 
came from 
moynihan has said he does not remember making the remark 
the students left vassars main administration building around 
415 pm said college spokeswoman dixie sheridan 
we are committed to negotiating the issues they presented 
she said

only when college president frances fergusson apologizes for 
appointing moynihan to the eleanor roosevelt chair an honorary 
lecturing post 
other student demands included establishment of an 
intercultural center for minority meetings a rabbi for jewish 
students and complete access for the disabled to all buildings

that the issues raised are being fully addressed by the campus 
community fergusson said in a statement

the social democratic government of 
prime minister ingvar carlsson resigned after parliament rejected 
its economic austerity program on thursday 
the five opposition parties combined to defeat carlssons bill 
190 to 153 came after a nationally televised sixhour debate six 
members were absent 
the measure aimed at ending strikes and controlling inflation 
now at nearly 9 percent would have frozen wages prices corporate 
dividends rents and local taxes for two years 
the bill was drafted after a bitter strike closed all of 
swedens banks earlier this year major cities also were threatened 
with strikes that would close down bus and subway operations 
preschools and other municipal services 
right after the vote thursday carlsson went to the office of 
speaker thage g peterson to hand in the governments resignation 
carlsson stays on with a caretaker cabinet 
the social democrats have governed sweden for 51 of the last 57 
years but their prospects were jolted later thursday when swedish 
radio confirmed that finance minister kjellolof feldt would not 
stay on in any event 
carl bildt leader of the centerright moderates commenting 
before the report was confirmed if its true it means the end 
of the government 
reports circulated for days that feldt a politician held in 
high esteem even by the nonsocialist opposition would leave 
the swedish news agency tt tidningarnas telegrambyra quoted an 
unidentified government source as saying government lack of support 
for feldts economic policies was the apparent reason he decided to 
step down 
social democratic deputies told tt on conditiion of anonymity 
that feldts imminent resignation was more serious for the social 
democratic movement than the government crisis itself 
the speaker later met privately with opposition leaders to sound 
them out about a new government another round of meetings is set 
for friday morning 
the governments resignation plunged sweden into political 
confusion with no party or alliance apparently able to form a 
workable government without major compromises 
political analysts said the most likely outcome would be a 
reconstituted social democratic government with the tacit support 
of the communists the social democrats control 156 seats and the 
communists 21 in the 349member riksdag 
but that would require a major revision of the economic plan 
which carlsson argued was necessary to put a lid on inflation 
without jeopardizing the cornerstone policy of full employment 
a possible alternative would be an alliance with the 20member 
environment party which took a tough bargaining position in 
earlier negotiations the greens demanded heavy outlays for ecology 
and public transport and the scrapping of a new jet fighter under 
development 
bildt said the alliance of social democrats and communists 
effectively blocked a nonsocialist alternative unless new 
elections were staged 
carlsson and his policy have failed and he has resigned at 
the same time hes afraid to face the voters bildt said 
opinion polls published before the political uproar began gave 
the social democrats their worst showing in more than 45 years 
with a 34 percent approval rating 
but the three centrist parties which governed in coalition from 
1976 to 1982 also would not gain a majority in a new election the 
polls predicted 
if no one succeeds in organizing a new government an election 
will be called 35 to 90 days after efforts break down the next 
scheduled election is september 1991 
in the debate carlsson told parliament his program was aimed to 
defend full employment which he called the basis of a fair 
society he said the opposition criticized the wageprize freeze 
without offering an alternative 
he said swedish products would soon be priced out of world 
markets a disaster for a nation of 85 million people relying 
heavily on exports 
independent economists blame the unemployment rate of about 1 
percent for driving up prices and encouraging labor unrest

youd never confuse miss margarida with mr 
chips or miss dove those saintly molders of impressionable minds 
created by the hollywood dream machine 
or even with miss grundy the crotchety nemesis of archie 
veronica jughead and all the rest of those perpetually teenage 
students found only in the funny papers or comic books 
miss margarida has more ferocious predecessors try attila the 
hun or nero with a dash of hitler stalin and just about any 
tinhorn south american dictator of the last 50 years miss 
margarida could hold her own 
she is the centerpiece of miss margaridas way roberto 
athaydes scathing political comedy about a tyrannical teacher who 
terrorizes her eighthgrade students and the audience as well 
the play first done on broadway in 1977 was revived thursday 
night at the helen hayes theater with the same star estelle 
parsons the years havent diminished parsons awesome performance 
shes a hurricane an actress riding a whirlwind of a part and not 
once falling off 
the evening begins with a shattering school bell as miss 
margarida strides to the stage a simple setting of desk and 
blackboards from the back of the theater 
theres no good teacher without a good class she intones 
unctuously you must cultivate obedience obedience is what 
miss margarida is after in the course of athaydes play shell get 
it any way she can the woman will flirt coo and carry on if 
thats what it takes learning is only incidental 
a lesson in biology becomes a lesson in seduction as miss 
margarida fluffs her hair applies makeup with a shovel and sashays 
around the stage but when things dont go her way she turns ugly 
miss margaridas way works on two levels athaydes play has 
obvious political connotations the teacher can be seen as a 
metaphor for any repressive authority the playwright who is 
brazilian counted on that when his work was done in his own 
country in the early 70s but it can also be seen as an absurdist 
comedy an exercise in black humor about a teacher who gives 
lessons in the futility of life 
nobody asked your opinion about getting in and now you cant 
get out miss margarida says to her class about what to expect 
from school and life 
the script allows for a certain amount of giveandtake between 
actress and audience and parsons brilliantly takes anything 
theatergoers give and then throws it back at them not all of the 
shenanigans are spontaneous there is also an actor planted in the 
audience but his contribution is minimal in all the ruckus parsons 
stirs up 
the play gets a little messy and repetitive at times the 
harangues turn shrill occasionally but the star can pull out of a 
downward screech before it stops the show cold 
a few words of warning dont show up late for school if you 
do you might find yourself on stage sitting in a corner and 
wearing a dunce cap and dont sass the teacher miss margarida 
takes no prisoners

lech walesa said thursday poland must be 
present at german unification talks where polish borders are 
discussed and president wojciech jaruzelski called it a question 
of life or death for polish citizens 
it is onethird of our territory onethird of the population 
and 85 percent of our access to the sea jaruzelski said 
for germany the former german territories that now belong 
to poland are rather a question of history and sentiment and 
sometimes a card in a electoral game he told the german ard 
television network in an interview excerpts of which were also 
broadcast on polish television 
he said he recognizes germanys right to selfdetermination but 
a parallel right should exist for poland which has had heavy 
historic experiences and for which guarantees of stable borders are 
a question of life or death 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki insists that poland be at 
talks on reunification planned by east germany west germany and 
the four occupying powers of world war ii the united states 
soviet union britain and france 
mazowiecki said wednesday that poland could not tolerate such 
talks being held without being there itself to make sure that a 
reunified germany would respect polands western border which 
some germans have challenged 
rightwing german politicians have never abandoned claims to 
40000 square miles of territory poland was awarded from germany at 
the end of world war ii compensation for an even larger area 
taken from poland by the soviet union 
after meeting privately with mazowiecki and discussing the 
german question solidarity leader walesa endorsed his demand about 
polands attending talks 
i think one cannot discuss polish borders without polands 
presence walesa told reporters 
he differed with mazowiecki however in demanding on thursday 
that the red army withdraw from poland this year 
mazowieckis solidarityled government has adopted a more 
tolerant attitude saying the 40000 soviet troops in poland should 
leave only after creation of a new security arrangement for europe 
defense minister gen florian siwicki cited stormy processes 
going on in germany in issuing a statement thursday which said 
withdrawal of soviet troops from poland must be approached very 
carefully 
west german foreign minister hans dietrichgenscher rejected on 
thursday polands request to be included in the talks but he 
repeated that no polish territories would be included in the 
reunited germany 
such assurances have been unconvincing for many poles whose 
homeland was the victim of a united germany in two world wars 
nothing about us without us government spokesman henryk 
wozniakowski said wednesday quoting a polish proverb to push the 
point that poland should be at the german reunification talks 
president francois mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl agreed on thursday at a meeting in paris that a european 
summit on german reunification would be desirable probably in 
april after march 18 elections in east germany 
the german question can only be solved under a european 
roof said kohl ruling out a neutral germany as envisioned by 
east germanys communist leader hans modrow 
kohl rebuffed a statement by mitterrand that the oderneisse 
line should immediately be recognized as a united germanys eastern 
border with poland 
when we have a common government and parliament this 
government and parliament will have to give the answer he said

the soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze told canadian lawmakers thursday that the 
restructuring of soviet economy and politics was a peaceful 
revolution that will succeed despite its foes 
in a 40minute nationally televised address to a joint session 
of parliaments defense and foreign affairs committees 
shevardnadze said of president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
it is a vexed process a highly troublesome process there are 
people who would prefer to see a different path of development and 
there are radicals on both sides 
but it is on the whole a peaceful revolution its the 
development of a new society a new sense of civic 
responsibility he said we believe in the success of 
perestroika 
legislation is being drafted for a total reform of economic 
relations which will include the right to private property 
shevardnadze said 
we are excluding the exploitation of man by man everything 
else is permitted the foreign minister said 
he conceded that the soviet union is indeed sick with ethnic 
strife and economic problems but said it is beginning to recover 
and ethnic clashes will be brought under control 
we continue to think that in the very near future we will be 
successful in stabilizing the country we understand that this is 
not just a concern for the soviet people but also for the whole 
world we recognize our responsibility to our own people and to the 
world the soviet minister said 
speaking in russian through an interpreter he admitted that 
past soviet leaders sometimes hoped to squeeze the united states 
out of the european arena but said the kremlin now wants canada 
and the united states highly involved in drafting new security 
disarmament and economic arrangements for europe 
shevardnadze indicated that moscow wants the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe to plan a new peaceful order in 
europe and believes it can serve as guarantor of soviet security 
interests 
the conference which produced the helsinki accords on human 
rights has as members all european countries except albania plus 
canada and the united states 
he said the conference must hold serious discussions on new 
military doctrines for europe that would be based on defense not 
offense 
shevardnadze challenged washington to be more flexible with arms 
control on the high seas and in space 
the minister said the soviet union welcomes the dramatic changes 
sweeping other east bloc countries and that imposed distorted 
socialism there could not have continued indefinitely 
he made clear it was up to the people of the two germanys to 
decide their future but suggested that europe the united states 
and canada might hold a referendum on german unification so german 
leaders could see how others view the issue 
shevardnadze was in ottawa for the open skies conference 
negotiations between nato and the warsaw pact to allow unarmed 
surveillance flights over each others territory 
he stayed for a twoday official visit returning to moscow 
after his appearance at the parliamentary committees

president bush and three latin 
american leaders conducting a tense summit under an air sea and 
land security shield forged agreement thursday on a new joint 
drugfighting strategy bush called it the first antidrug 
cartel 
flanked by the leaders of the three largest cocaineproducing 
nations bush called the summit an icebreaking event he vowed 
to step up attempts to curtail the demand for narcotics at home 
saying we are making progress but that more needs to be done 
a joint communique signed by bush and presidents virgilio barco 
of colombia jaime paz zamora of bolivia and alan garcia of peru 
apparently ruled out the use of us military forces in the andean 
region each country may involve its armed forces in this fight 
within its own national territory it said 
in their meeting they steered away from some of the most 
controversial drug initiatives such as the idea of a naval cordon 
off colombia and chose instead to deal in broader themes that 
helped keep harmony among sometimes differing leaders 
extraordinary security precautions were taken to protect bush 
and his three summit partners with some 5000 uniformed troops 
watching over the proceedings battleships presented an imposing 
force off shore and helicopter gunships hovered nearby 
but colombian guerrillas made their own point one of defiance 
they kidnapped an american priest in cali the third us citizen 
taken prisoner by rebels this week also a small bomb exploded 
thursday morning 4 miles from barranquilla airport damaging a 
voltage regulator of a line that fed the air conditioning of the 
airport where bush landed two hours later 
summing up his talks with the latin american presidents bush 
told reporters i owe it to the children of america the united 
states to these three presidents to guarantee them that we 
will do everything we can to cut the demand for narcotics in 
the united states 
that was a message that had been awaited by the three andean 
president who came to the summit complaining that the united 
states had not done enough at home to curtail demand for drugs 
back in washington dc the us capital federal prosecutors 
sent a separate message announcing the indictment of mayor marion 
barry on eight counts of perjury and possession of a controlled 
substance 
every tactic and every weapon pales into insignificance 
compared to the need to reduce demand barco said the only law 
that the narcoterrorists do not break is the law of supply and 
demand 
zamora with a nod to the sweeping reforms that soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev had introduced to his part of the world said a 
new openness had been attained here a perestroika has begun 
he told reporters at a windup news conference 
zamora said the leaders had talked about creating an alternate 
economy so the peasants of the cocagrowing and processing 
nations would not be dependent on the crop for their livelihoods 
after the meetings he said we understand the true magnitude 
of the problem and how to face it 
bush returned to washington on air force one without incident 
william bennett director of the office of national drug control 
policy told reporters on the return flight that the session was a 
success in that it developed a clearcut consensus between the 
united states and the three andean drugproducing nations on 
developing a common drugfighting strategy 
this could be the day these things came to maturity he said 
assistant secretary of state bernard aaronson said this is a 
real seachange in the international debate about drugs 
at the end garcia who once threatened to boycott the summit to 
protest the us invasion of panama spoke of the need for a 
vigorous crop substitution program and with a smile asked 
wheres the beef 
said garcia what has changed here is concepts so that we 
never go back a better relationship between latin america and the 
united states 
barco said no when asked if colombia would be willing to 
have us naval forces patrolling in international waters off 
colombias coast to keep track of drug shipments it is not 
necessary he said 
responding to colombian complaints that us trade policy has 
harmed its major legal exports such as coffee cut flowers and 
sugar bush promised to work to help open more us markets 
in their communique the summit nations called for a world 
conference against illicit drug trafficking in 1991 the four 
nations agreed to hold a highlevel followup to thursdays session 
within six months but specified no level of us aid to help the 
south americans 
bush previously had pledged 22 billion over five years to aid 
the andean countries economically and militarily in waging the drug 
war he said thursday he did not foresee any immediate increases in 
that commitment 
but he did say the four had taken significant steps to work 
together on the problem we in fact created the first antidrug 
cartel 
the statement recognized that persuading andean farmers to 
substitute legal crops for coca the leaves of which are used to 
make cocaine would have significant immediate and longterm 
economic costs on the three south american countries 
responding to colombian complaints that us trade policy has 
harmed its major legal exports such as coffee cut flowers and 
sugar bush promised to work to help open more us markets 
us officials also reached agreement with bolivia to help stem 
the movement of us firearms into south american nations and 
signed tax accords with both bolivia and peru aimed at establishing 
a system to trace drug profits and moneylaundering schemes 
gunboats patrolled cartagena bay the sparkling blue waterway 
was closed to harbor traffic frogmen checked the bay helicopters 
buzzed overhead some 5000 security guards roamed the nearly empty 
streets a squadron of fighter bombers and a fleet of warships 
stood by dogs sniffed for bombs 
the bomb at barranquilla airport exploded at a hightension 
electricity tower in the village of soledad the manager of the 
electric comany for the state of atlantico eduardo berano de la 
rosa told the associated press 
he said he could not estimate how big the bomb was but from the 
little damage that it caused it could not have been very powerful 
no group has claimed responsibility for the bombing he said 
the president was ready to offer summit partners the use of navy 
ships to cast a radar screen over colombia to detect drugcarrying 
aircraft 
but that idea aroused latin american sensitivies last month when 
it was portrayed as a blockade as a result us officials said 
bush would not even mention the ship idea unless it was raised by 
someone else 
us officials warned in advance that bush was not bringing more 
money beyond the aid package already presented calling for 423 
million for fiscal 1991 in military law enforcement and economic 
assistance for the three countries 
bushs trip here was regarded largely as a gesture of solidarity 
with barco who has waged an unrelenting sixmonth war against the 
drug lords 
colombian forces have seized tons of cocaine and hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of property they killed gonzalo 
rodrigues gacha a leader of the infamous medellin cartel 
it has not been a war without casualties 
there have been 262 terrorist acts blamed on drug bosses since 
the government crackdown began aug 18 the attacks mostly 
bombings have claimed 209 lives

sheep now feed off grass and overgrown 
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to 
seal off albania today the fight against the worlds corrupting 
effects takes a different form 
western culture although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and 
intellectuals seeps through the increasingly porous borders of 
europes most isolated nation 
western ideas contrast sharply with albanian orthodoxy but there 
is little open evidence of any grassroots disaffection threatening 
to topple the last european refuge of stalinism 
reports of anticommunist riots in the northern city of skhoder 
in january apparently were unfounded officials here charge they 
were fabricated by the statecontrolled media in yugoslavia which 
is at odds with albania over the fate of millions of ethnic 
albanians in the yugoslav province of kosovo 
we do not want to assimilate we want to preserve our national 
identity said ymer minxhozi general secretary of the albanian 
union of journalists 
we have no homosexuality no prostitution no drugs and no 
black market he told a group of visiting western journalists 
the bunkers first built during world war ii to guard against a 
land invasion were vastly expanded after the sovietled warsaw 
pact marched into czechoslovakia in 1968 now they are falling into 
disuse 
no one knows exactly how many bunkers there are but one 
official estimated at least one for every albanian 3 million 
the bunkers in albania do not move they have no feet or 
wheels they do not threaten anyone deputy foreign minister 
socrat placa said in an interview 
during its 45year history as a stalinist state albania has had 
little to do with the world beyond its borders it still reveres 
the memory of josef stalin and adheres strictly to marxistleninist 
doctrine 
albania cut ties with the soviet union in 1961 because of its 
destalinization program and with china in 1978 because of chinas 
perceived deviation from marxistleninist policies after mao 
tsetungs death 
enver hoxha the founder of the communist state in albania died 
in 1985 but his policies and personality cult survive a hoxha 
museum opened last year a marble and glass temple among tiranas 
dilapidated and windowless buildings 
hoxhas successor ramiz alia is credited with introducing some 
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the albanian 
system mistrust and hostility toward moscow and washington remain 
however 
placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard 
a western news report on a visiting reporters radio of an 
explosion at a soviet military base in czechoslovakia 
good good very good of course it may have some 
consequences but is a good lesson for gorbachev placa said 
nevertheless placa said discussions were under way to further 
increase ties with both east and west 
albanians are able to view italian yugoslavian and greek 
television scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in tirana 
were the words iron maiden a leading british heavyrock band 
in another part of town someone had repeatedly written liri 
freedom on a kiosk wall an uncommon slogan in a country with a 
powerful secret police the sigurimi 
activities of the sigurimi were assailed last year however in 
a bestselling novel by writer neshat tozaj who works as a 
criminal investigator in the ministry of internal affairs 
the novel thikat knives portrayed the sigurimi as 
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions 
publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could 
indicate a relaxation of censorship or as some western observers 
suggested a power struggle to restrict the sigurimi 
the artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it 
touched on certain themes in our society life must be 
reflected in literature said nasi lera secretary of the 
albanian union of artists and writers 
authorities still want to stop controversial material about 
albania from reaching abroad 
visiting finnish television journalists found on their return 
home evidence of tampering with an interview with foreign minister 
reiz malile which had been filmed by a local crew 
malile had acknowledged on camera that albania had some 
political prisoners but added its not a problem that section 
of tape was replaced by a segment of an albanian song contest 
modern western literature is translated into albanian and 
william faulkner ernest hemingway saul bellow and truman capote 
are better known than spanish italian or french writers said 
ismail kadare albanias bestknown modern author 
we dont approve of pornography and our greatest problem 
is mediocrity but thats a worldwide problem kadare added in an 
interview 
the west definitely has a corrupting influence even though 
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements 
and progress a 21yearold woman said 
she added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange 
program then said but things are so good here

asya gomelsky says she survived two pogroms in 
her 83 years but never expected her jewishness to be called into 
question in israel 
that is what happened when mrs gomelskys 50yearold son boris 
asked the interior ministry for identity papers for his family now 
that it has arrived from the soviet union 
the gomelskys were turned down on grounds that they had no 
documents proving they were jewish birth certificates for 
example 
those who are rejected can get rent subsidies and other benefits 
as immigrants but their id cards do not say jewish without 
that word the they may have trouble with marriage divorce or 
other personal matters controlled by israels ultraorthodox 
establishment 
the gomelskys story and similar tales surfacing with the new 
rush of soviet immigrants have sparked protests by soviet activists 
and complaints by four israeli liberal parties over policies of the 
interior ministry which is controlled by the ultraorthodox shas 
party 
do you know what it is to question the jewishness of those who 
have suffered for generations in the soviet union for being 
jewish robert golan head of a soviet activist group told the 
jerusalem post 
mrs gomelsky who appeared on israel television after the 
rejection touched many israelis with the tale of her sufferings 
during russias 1917 revolution and civil war 
i survived two pogroms and was persecuted as a jew and here 
in israel they tell me im not jewish mrs gomelsky wept in 
1919 they wanted to rape my elder sister and when my father 
tried to protect her they cut him with sabers and we ran away to 
hide in the fields 
after the broadcast several ministers questioned interior 
minister arye deri a member of shas in a cabinet meeting soviet 
activists warned the following day they would take to the streets 
over deris policies 
but on a visit to interior ministry offices here a reporter 
found several recent soviet arrivals who came for identity cards 
still were being turned away under the same policy 
go home and come back when you have papers showing you are 
jews an official told them 
while law requires documentation some israelis maintain that in 
the case of soviet immigrants it is better to risk the few who 
might be frauds than to humiliate the many who are not 
for years the interior ministry also has been ruled by the 
ultraorthodox for whom the mostly secular wave of soviet jews can 
mean change 
the expected arrival of up to 300000 soviet jews in the next 
three years could undermine israels delicate balance of internal 
political power in which three ultraorthodox parties and a 
religious one usually hold the key to forming coalition governments 
neither of the countrys two major parties the rightwing likud 
bloc or centerleft labor party has ever won enough seats in the 
120member knesset the israeli parliament to govern on their own 
that means each scrambles to bring the religious parties into 
coalitions 
over the years israels religious community used this power to 
pass laws favoring the orthodox and enforce rules forcing 
businesses and entertainment spots to close from sundown friday 
till sundown saturday the sabbath 
the ultraorthodox fear this may change with the soviet jewish 
immigration wave which they claim includes many couples of mixed 
marriages and even nonjews 
in midjanuary the ultraorthodox weekly publication yom 
hashishi claimed that israeli officials in moscow reject 
immigration requests of elderly religious jews preferring young 
intellectual couples in spite of a large percentage of mixed 
marriages among them 
this selection will change in the coming years the face of the 
israeli society 
religious affairs minister zevulun hammer fueled the controversy 
by saying up to 30 percent of the soviet immigrants were nonjews 
trying to find a way to get out of the soviet union 
israels law of return grants automatic citizenship to jews 
including descendants of jewish men and their spouses even if 
they are nonjewish 
the orthodox establishment recognizes as jews only descendants 
of a jewish mother or persons who underwent an orthodox conversion 
it wants the law changed to include this definition 
to back up their case religious affairs ministry officials 
announced they found 30 nonjews who allegedly used false papers to 
come to israel last year when some 12000 soviet jews immigrated 
each day therere infiltrations of nonjewish immigrants 
complained yigal bibi of hammers national religious party 
in protesting the interior ministry policy on birth 
certificates yair tzaban of the leftist mapam party said it was 
better to risk accepting a small number of nonjews 
disguising themselves as jews rather than humiliate thousands of 
others

about a dozen roman catholic parishes in 
downtown milwaukee pooled resources to form a centralized school 
system with four campuses also on the citys south side plans 
are mapped to link 42 parochial schools into a regional system 
with a joint board budget and shared facilities and staff 
the aim is both to combine resources to strengthen the schools 
and effect economies through interparish distribution of costs 
said the the rev ralph c gross chancellor of the milwaukee 
archdiocese 
were trying to take some of the school pressure off 
individual parishes so they can be more fruitful worshiping 
communities he added 
such changes in many cities signal a gradual but farreaching 
transformation in the churchs patterns for educating the young 
under strains of financing and personnel the singleparish 
parochial school is fading before the larger cooperative 
enterprises but with special efforts to preserve an intimate 
atmosphere and close ties with parents 
all sorts of new patterns are emerging said sister 
catherine t mcnamee president of the national catholic 
educational association in washington 
she said the restructuring of schools including 
consolidations mergers for different grade levels and other 
collaborative configurations have come as populations shifted among 
city areas and to suburbs 
however the combinations seek to maintain a basis in 
geographical proximity she said such as urban ethnic parishes a 
few blocks apart of french polish and italian origins for 
example forming a joint school 
now theyve combined for the whole neighborhood she said 
various difficulties have cut catholicisms elementary and 
secondary schools in half over the last quarter century reducing 
56 million students in 12300 schools in 1965 to 26 million 
students in 8800 schools now 
but despite continuing problems including added expenses of lay 
teachers that pervasively have replaced the once lowcost but now 
scarce teaching sisters the school shrinkage seems abated 
its pretty much stablized sister mcnamee said noting that 
some enrollments are edging back up expanding rapidly in the lower 
grades were holding up fairly well now 
similar comments came from several dioceses where checks found 
many of them consolidating former singleparish schools past 
decline is tapering off said the rev george norton of the 
rochester ny diocese 
realignments connecting some schools or prospects of it were 
reported in st louis baltimore green bay wis newark nj 
cleveland and brooklyn among others 
in erie pa the dioscesan chancellor monsignor robert smith 
said a newly established advisory board was weighing various 
linkages of schools and parishes its the challenge of the times 
for being viable he said 
the churchs huge outlay for schools for the nations young 
parallels the efforts of public schools but with one glaring 
difference no help from community taxes 
sister mcnamee pointed out that families of children going to 
catholic schools pay full taxes for public schools but get no 
benefit from it or any relief in maintaining the alternative 
system 
she said it would cost public schools an estimated additional 
10 billion annually to take on the load of enrollments in catholic 
schools but catholics alone have to bear it while also paying 
public school taxes 
not only that she said but 123 percent nationally of 
youngsters in catholic schools are noncatholics the proportion is 
much higher in inner city catholic schools whose enrollments run 
from 60 percent to 80 percent noncatholic 
the rev philip j murnion director of the national pastoral 
life center said catholic financing of a major alternative 
school system for whites blacks chinese or whatever without 
public help is a whole new mission 
its a remarkable process funded by the catholic conscience 
he said noting that it also undergirds freedom of choice in 
education 
studies indicate that academic effectiveness of catholic schools 
surpasses that of public schools 
what has greatly increased the costs of church schools is the 
steep prolonged decline in sisters who in the 1940s provided 92 
percent of the teachers with only 8 percent lay people now its 
about reversed 
eightyfive percent now are lay people their pay necessarily 
considerably higher but still very modest and way back of public 
schoolteachers sister mcnamee said its nowhere near where it 
should be 
the turnabout from religious sisters to lay teachers came as the 
total number of nuns in the country fell from a peak of 181400 in 
1965 to only 104400 now a decline of 76000

joseph doherty who has fought british rule in 
northern ireland with rocks rifles and machine guns has a new 
weapon of choice clipped to the breast pocket of his orange prison 
overalls 
ive come to believe that the pen is mightier than the 
sword he said in an interview at the federal jail where hes 
spent 6 years 
thats my message when i do an interview or answer a letter i 
dont say up the ira or send more arms i dont mention the 
ira i stress what you can do politically to change things 
doherty who pronounces his name dockerty has ample time to 
reflect on the advantages of the ballot box to the bomb he has 
been at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan longer 
than any inmate in its history longer even than most of its 
guards he has done his time under three wardens and four captains 
dohertys path to the mcc began a decade ago with a gunfight in 
belfast between his ira unit and british troops doherty was 
captured and convicted of murdering a british officer facing two 
life terms he escaped from jail and fled to new york city where 
he was arrested by the fbi in 1983 
the british demanded his extradition but a federal judge 
accepted dohertys argument that the killing was not a common crime 
but a political act part of the iras campaign to drive the 
british from northern irelands six counties and reunite the 
province with the irish republic doherty could not be extradited 
dohertys case has since bounced from court to court the 
british have not been able to get him back but he has not been 
able to go free despite more than a halfdozen court rulings in 
his favor his case has become a metaphor for his homelands 
intractable troubles 
to irish nationalists and human rights activists doherty is a 
symbol of the battle against tyranny according to paul odwyer 
former new york city council president and an activist for the 
irish cause dohertys prison visitors have included cardinal john 
j oconnor the rev jesse jackson and 10 congressmen in his 
victory speech mayor david dinkins demanded justice for joe 
doherty 
more than 100 members of congress have signed resolutions 
supporting his requests for bail and asylum and similar measures 
have passed several dozen state county and local legislatures 
but dohertys musings about the limits of armed rebellion have 
upset some irish nationalists 
late last year the new york daily news quoted him as saying that 
the iras armed rebellion cant go on that its strategy 
hasnt worked and that it should consider a unilateral 
ceasefire 
i see another soldier shot dead by the ira and i think i read 
this five years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago he said if we 
carry this war on another 20 years itll be such a waste of life 
in an interview two days after his 35th birthday last month 
doherty smiled ruefully and shifted in his chair when he was asked 
about the reaction to his relatively dovish comments 
a lot of people have said to me youre in prison joe 
youre away from the situation 
one of his critics is michael flannery an elderly ira veteran 
and its bestknown american supporter he said dohertys emphasis 
on political rather than military tactics shows he doesnt know 
irish history 
politics and diplomacy have failed the irish in the past 
flannery said because they lend legitimacy to britishcreated 
institutions yet do not strike at the source of british power 
doherty said some of his remarks have been taken out of context 
he still supports the ira and does not regret having fought the 
british 
but he also said that since his imprisonment his views have 
changed he described himself as part of a generation that is 
determined to end the war that flared 20 years ago when british 
soldiers sent to protect northern irelands catholic minority from 
protestant attacks clashed with a revived ira 
my generation is taking over now and were more flexible 
more willing to compromise less nationalistic he said 
one summer doherty was visited by an 11yearold nephew who was 
about to return to belfast doherty said that when he asked the boy 
what he was going to do when he returned home he replied im 
going to join the ira and shoot british soldiers 
i dont want little sean to be sitting at the kitchen table 
stripping a thompson machine gun like i was doherty said i 
dont want this to get passed to another generation 
doherty repeatedly expressed optimism rare in discussions of 
northern ireland that political and diplomatic initiatives could 
soon bring peace 
look at eastern europe the worlds changing so fast he 
said snapping his fingers this puts a lot of pressure on the 
british theyll soon be the only nation in europe with troops on 
the street 
he said the consolidation of the european economic community in 
1992 will make the border between northern ireland and the irish 
republic seem all the more absurd and offer the british a 
convenient excuse to go home 
the ira should consider a ceasefire he suggested and measure 
the british response the british he predicted would grab a 
chance to negotiate a gradual pullout 
doherty states his case calmly and eloquently since the age of 
17 he has spent all but 18 months of his life on the lam or behind 
bars and the jailhouse has been his schoolhouse virtually 
illiterate when he left school doherty learned gaelic irish 
history and debating in a camp for ira prisoners outside belfast 
dohertys education has continued at the mcc even though his 
maximum security status forbids classroom attendance he subscribes 
to many publications answers 20 to 30 letters a day and writes 
messages for rallies and meetings many of them related to his 
defense 
he also writes poetry two of his poems have won prizes in 
federal prison system competitions one brought him a check for 25 
courtesy of edwin meese iii whose decision as attorney general had 
kept him in jail 
despite his frustration over his case which now is before the 
us court of appeals in new york doherty is confident about 
northern ireland 
the war is coming to an end after 800 years he said as 
soon as the british leave ill burn my ira beret the ira is 
only the symptom the product of a situation that never worked

kathy blackburn perches on a stool in 
front of 28 bowed heads bullhorn in hand repeating the lords 
prayer 
a burst of giggles erupts but the mother of this brood 17 
boys and 11 girls is a picture of tolerance 
i hear kids from the time i wake up until the time i go to 
sleep she says then she adds there are times ive been 
frantic 
mrs blackburn 42 and her husband dan 45 came home to 
indiana at the end of december the two christian missionaries and 
their wards all orphaned or abandoned haitian children ranging in 
age from 3 to 14 are temporarily living in a drafty church camp 
about 50 miles southeast of indianapolis 
the blackburns who have two grown children of their own began 
taking in homeless children shortly after becoming missionaries in 
1969 and at one time thought about opening an orphanage now they 
plan to adopt all the children four of whom are mentally retarded 
in 1987 violence in haiti forced the blackburns to flee to the 
dominican republic last december they finally received permission 
from the us immigration and naturalization service to bring the 
children to the united states 
the children are rosie and mary both 14 becky yvonne and jim 
12 tom sam bobby cheryl and jo anna 11 steve marva and liz 
10 jemima abigail aaron jeremiah benji noah and gideon 9 
matthew and jake 8 rachael 7 thaddeus 6 mike and caleb 4 
and andy and mark 3 
in haiti the family had a house in indiana they sleep in a 
dormitory heated by a wood stove and use an outdoor privy 
down the lane is the chow house the hub of the familys 
social life a handmade sign posted on the refrigerator saysa 
late meal is a hardship with 28 kids please have consideration for 
the cook thanks 
blackburn does the cooking and supervises the older boys who 
wash dishes and sweep floors the girls do the laundry and care for 
the younger children giving baths and changing clothes 
mrs blackburn says the secret to managing 28 children and a 
household is not to fear mistakes 
parenthood is something you cant cram for at the last 
minute she says we do it by making mistakes by trial and 
error its just something you keep working at 
the blackburns have many of the same dreams other parents have 
id like them to have music lessons learn to ride a bike 
know history and know it well and be welleducated within their 
own bounds mrs blackburn says 
the children are taught by the blackburns and volunteer 
teachers who come to the camp to give lessons in math science 
reading writing and sign language the last a device to keep the 
noise level down 
these kids arent overstimulated mrs blackburn says 
they enjoy stuff more a jet going overhead and a beautiful 
sunset is a really big deal they not only appreciate but they 
comment on it 
rosie recently went with blackburn to a department store where 
she took her first elevator ride 
its continual questions even getting into a car is a big 
deal for them blackburn says 
as part of their arrangement with immigration authorities the 
blackburns may not accept government support instead they rely on 
regular donations from about 20 churches and whatever else comes 
in local businesses have donated secondhand clothes and leftover 
baked goods the family has received clothes food toys and money 
from strangers who have heard about them in news reports 
were not taking a vow of poverty but one of the things i 
want to discourage is excess the mindset that you dont need one 
thing you need 10 mrs blackburn says 
the blackburns most pressing need is permanent shelter the 
church camp opens may 1 and they must be out the rev lee creech 
who has supported the blackburns missionary work for 20 years 
heads a committee seeking a home for them 
more people are in awe than anything else that someone would 
attempt to do this says creech pastor at new bethel united 
methodist church in decatur county i think its the best way for 
someone else to say i am my brothers keeper

abcs miniseries the kennedys of 
massachusetts begins so slowly that viewers who tune in the 
first episode are likely to tune out the rest mores the pity for 
there are worthwhile things in this production 
what saves the miniseries from hollywoods usual kennedy 
hagiography is splendid acting not william hanleys dramatization 
of doris kearns goodwins best seller the fitzgeralds and the 
kennedys 
the best performance is that of william petersen as joseph p 
kennedy sr an unusual stretch for an actor best remembered for 
the film manhunter in which he played an emotionally maimed 
fbi agent tracking a serial killer 
petersen creates a living breathing joe sr from scant 
material and his aging of the character is much more than makeup 
an underrated actor petersen can only boost his reputation with 
work like this 
praise also goes to william weber who plays the weedy young jfk 
from the inside out webers effective performance hauntingly 
captures jfks manner and characteristic charm without forcing the 
lacecurtain irish accent 
a startlingly mature tracy pollan plays the rebellious debutante 
kathleen kick kennedy who defied her parents to marry outside 
the roman catholic church pollan creates a believable kick and 
when her character is killed in a wartime plane crash a great deal 
of energy leaves the miniseries 
as rosemary kennedy deidre lovejoy plays with strength and 
dignity the mentally retarded daughter drowning in a family of 
overachievers randle mell with perhaps five minutes on screen 
evokes a genial bobby kennedy who was a poised astute political 
operative 
praise goes also to production designer jan scott and 
cinematographer laszlo scott who filled lush interior locations 
with golden light and detailed period touches letting the actors 
dominate the foreground 
all that said the kennedys ultimately fails under director 
lamont johnsons misguided attempt to keep faith with a 1000page 
history of 55 years of private and public kennedy lives its too 
much material even for a miniseries 
the kennedys has triumphs and tragedies aplenty but its 
stuttering episodic pace forces a simplistic narrative and paints 
details with a broad brush creating a false history from what is 
only historical drama 
the seeming eternal first episode focuses on mayor john honey 
fitz fitzgerald charles durning and publicanward boss pj 
kennedy pat hingle and the courtship of their children rose 
fitzgerald annette otoole and joe 
durning and hingle two of americas great character actors 
have six minutes to evoke bostons bloody ward politics from a 
script that only casually implies honey fitzs redhanded role in 
them 
and there is a stupid anachronism it is 1906 and rose asks 
harvard freshman joe if hes read the jungle by upton sinclair 
isnt that one of those tarzan of the apes books he 
facetiously replies 
no joe tarzan of the apes wont be published until 1914 
if youd said kipling eh we might have bought it 
the kennedys picks up steam when joe who is becoming one of 
the richest men in america extends his business and extramarital 
ventures to hollywood 
after his notorious love affair with actress gloria swanson 
excellently played by madolyn smith osborne ends and joe wraps up 
his hollywood interests the kennedys sinks into another trough 
in its sinewave emotional scheme 
another sustained peak arrives with joe srs appointment as 
us ambassador to britain and the young adulthood of jack kick 
and joe jr played by campbell scott as the world plummets into 
war 
sadly jacks reluctant entry into politics and his rise to the 
presidency seem to take up only about 15 minutes and the story ends 
at his inaugural speech in 1961

when prime minister toshiki kaifu toured europe 
last month he demonstrated japans economic might by announcing 
almost 2 billion in aid to poland and hungary dwarfing what the 
united states has committed 
in contrast private japanese industries known for their 
aggressive expansion elsewhere are reluctant to plunge into a part 
of the world they see as inexperienced illequipped and still 
emerging from 40 years of communism 
a few prominent deals have been done suzuki motor co for 
example recently agreed to set up an automobile plant in hungary 
the first japanese company to enter a joint venture with eastern 
europe since the tumultuous political changes there 
but eastern europe remains virtually untouched by japanese 
business in 1988 japan trade with the region totaled about 147 
billion excluding the soviet union thats less than 1 percent of 
japanese trade worldwide 
although many japanese firms have offices in eastern european 
nations only about a dozen joint ventures have been established 
no japanese company has yet invested in poland east germany or 
czechoslovakia 
japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back 
high inflation rates a heavy debt burden and inconvertible 
currencies make it difficult to profit in eastern europe in their 
view 
restrictions on exports of high technology to the east bloc a 
vestige of the cold war that remains entrenched also have reduced 
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the japanese who are 
leading exporters of hightech items 
nonetheless the changing political and economic landscape of 
eastern europe has piqued japans interest the government has 
allocated 750 million for export insurance to encourage japanese 
firms to trade there 
to daihatsu motor co however economic reform and japanese 
government aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees 
one of japans smallest automobile manufacturers daihatsu has 
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in 
poland although it developed an ambitious plan to build a 
12000vehicleayear plant with polish automaker fso daihatsu 
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed 
last fall fso approached daihatsu again this time said 
spokesman wataru shindo the company has considerably scaled down 
plans it will export about 6000 unassembled charade models to 
poland 
we dont know whether well be able to meet our costs at a 
scale of 5000 to 6000 cars even if we fail there will be little 
damage done shindo said 
japans largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution 
asahi glass co has been negotiating with poland to set up a plate 
glass factory in the southern city of sandomierz 
the risks remain high said asahi official shigehiko tomita and 
no commitment has been made 
tomita said trade insurance and other japanese government 
support was necessary but stability in eastern europe was more 
important 
the political and economic situation in poland is still fluid 
and the risks great the country has high inflation and even 
though we think that democratization will proceed we need to have 
some protection he said 
shigeki ura a senior officer with merchant trader c itoh and 
co in eastern europe doubted japanese firms will attempt any 
largescale investments 
nevertheless he added as businessmen specializing in the 
eastern european market we should not be so optimistic but not so 
pessimistic economic reform and democracy will give us chances 
ura said japanese firms differ fundamentally from european firms 
in their attitude toward developing the eastern european market 
the japanese want clearcut laws in place specifying what is 
permissible for foreigners but some european investors are willing 
to overlook legal vaguenesses ura said 
despite japans reluctance its neighbor south korea seems eager 
to exploit opportunity in eastern europe yoo changsoon chairman 
of the federation of korean industries south koreas largest 
business organization said recently that prospects are bright 
for direct investment there 
some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct 
investment in communist countries he said 
south korea established diplomatic relations with hungary 
poland and yugoslavia only last year and has a 91 million trade 
surplus with those countries

why get all hot and sweaty 
thrashing about the dance floor to a lambada when you can grind 
your hips and still keep your cool to the beat of a funana a 
tabanca or a coladera 
attention music lovers the next dance craze could very well 
come from cape verde one of the worlds original musical melting 
pots 
we cape verdians take our music at least as seriously as our 
politics but its difficult to talk of original and indigenous 
here said tober da silva a high school teacher in praia and a 
music historian 
over the course of time music has profitted though some 
people would say suffered from our crossroads position between 
africa and america added mario bettencourt who as russo 
plays bass with cape verdes top pop group os tubaroes the 
sharks 
weve drawn influences from every people that has passed 
through here he said 
and those peoples are many 
jutting out of the tropical atlantic 385 miles off the west 
african coast the 10 formerly portuguese volcanic islands first 
flourished as a trading post for african slaves bound for the 
americas the slaves left behind basic african rhythms before 
exporting them to brazil where the angolan semba became the samba 
the islands eventually became a midocean crossover point for 
whaling ships then cargo steamboats and more recently jets from 
three continents 
crew and tourists from south american ships reimported the 
altered syncopated beat also lured to south america were cape 
verdian musicians who had adopted strains of portugals melancholy 
fado folk songs and fused everything into what russo calls cape 
verdes mournful afrolatin sound 
theres been a growing western interest in international or 
ethnic music in recent years american and european musical tastes 
have made stars of such musicians as senegalese singer youssou 
the lion ndour brazils milton nascimento polish singer 
basia and salsas ruben blades and in recent months the 
frenchmarketed brazilian lambada a sexy gyrating dance to a 
latinrock beat has become an international commercial success 
the lambadas success should help us get a more international 
projection said zeca couto keyboard player for tubaroes 
the band consists of seven musicians whose regular jobs range 
from importexport clerk to chief of protocol at cape verdes 
parliament tubaroes has a new contract with a lisbonbased 
recording company to release two new discs this year 
their last album bote broce e linha what fishermen say 
in portuguese crioulo when casting their lines sold around 10000 
copies the group considers that to be a heady success shared only 
by cape verdian musicians who have emigrated 
but the tubaroes deeprooted belief in music of the people for 
the people and by the people wont let success go to their heads 
they still jam four nights a week in a ramshackle storeroom before 
singing weekends in their di nos nightclub in praia where cape 
verdians dance the funana and coladera 
i dont agree with living abroad people abroad dont 
experience the daytoday life here and so they cant make real 
cape verdian music said ildo lobo the groups frontman and 
vocalist 
the group sing mornas slow melancholy songs about typical 
problems of island life but even their uptempo funanas and 
coladeras have bitingly critical texts 
according to da silva those songs traditionally accompanied 
only by accordion and a two metal bars scraped together and called 
ferrinho were banned before independence from portugal in 1975 
we deal with problems faced by women with emigration 
every house in these islands has some sort of problem linked with 
emigration lobo said 
some 700000 cape verdians have left the islands in search of a 
better life more than 350000 live and work in the united states 
primarily in massachussetts and rhode island the tubaroes have 
played in boston five times 
were still subject to imported influences our people abroad 
send us all types of music and we are changing but what you hear 
most here is cape verdian lobo said 
but cape verdians dont ignore culture from other parts of the 
world 
at one main crossroads in downtown praia a group of 
schoolchildren sporting bob marley shirts and rastafarian hair 
styles dance to the latest craze zouk music from the french 
antilles on the wall behind them graffiti artists have written 
the names madonna and michael jackson

treatment in most states combines two approaches one teaches 
offenders to sabotage deviant fantasies by sniffing something 
unpleasant like ammonia or by imagining the consequences such as 
police breaking into a bedroom and catching a child molester in the 
act 
the second approach uses group and individual therapy to break 
through the wall of denial and rationalization sex offenders use to 
convince themselves their behavior is ok 
more intrusive techniques have been tried including shock 
therapy and socalled chemical castration the use of hormones to 
reduce sex drive 
but no treatment has produced anything better than inconclusive 
results petrella said and even methods that are encouraging by 
medical standards say a treatment that keeps twothirds of sex 
offenders from repeating their crime are unacceptable by social 
standards 
in the end letting a single earl shriner back on the streets is 
a risk few are willing to take 
since shriners attack on her son helen harlow has learned a 
lot about sex crimes shes learned that people who abuse others 
often were abused as children she even looked at shriner once in 
court and wondered how he must feel to have a jury deciding the 
rest of his life 
but compassion goes only so far doctors say corrective surgery 
performed on the boy since last may and additional operations as he 
matures should make him physically whole again but the family may 
never be rid of the emotional pain inflicted by shriner 
a lifetime sentence is a lifetime sentence harlow said 
we were given one and i think he deserves one too

entering the decade of the brain congress 
which so designated the 1990s is thinking about curbing its habit 
of passing resolutions to commemorate days weeks months and years 
for causes somebody deems worthy 
the thinking probably will go on for quite a while because 
commemorative measures are a quick cutrate harmless way to do a 
favor for a constituent a contributor or an interest group 
while the brains behind this minireform say all those 
resolutions waste time and money and make congress look silly 
passing them is one of the things the house and senate do most 
efficiently 
in the first year of the current congress they cranked out 88 
including the brain decade national library card signup month and 
the international year for bible reading 
some are a bit tricky congress voted to designate last july 14 
as national day to commemorate the bastille day bicentennial it 
also set aside national tap dance day which was may 25 although 
the measure marking that occasion didnt pass until five months 
after it was over that parliamentary lapse was not typical most 
nametheday measures pass quickly and unanimously 
somewhere along the way weve let our zeal for commemoratives 
get out of hand said sen ernest f hollings dsc 
introducing a bill to restrain the practice 
reps dave mccurdy dokla and claudine schneider rri 
proposed similar measures last year and there are more than enough 
cosponsors to pass a bill should it get to a house vote reform 
after all is as safe and popular a pursuit as passing 
commemorative resolutions 
a decade ago congress adopted only 34 commemorative 
resolutions in the 100th congress the count was up to 258 
hollings said the current 101st congress probably will produce more 
than 300 
at a house hearing earlier this month mccurdy said the practice 
feeds the public perception that congress wastes too much time on 
trivia schneider called it an embarrassment and said it makes 
members of congress look foolish 
to cut the crop of congressionally endorsed observances the 
bills propose creation of an advisory commission on national 
commemorative events to sort through all the proposals and decide 
which ones deserve to be designated 
the panel would be authorized to recommend its chosen days 
weeks and months directly to the white house that way such an 
occasion as national pledge of allegiance day last observed on 
sept 8 1989 could be proclaimed without further action 
the commission would be patterned on one that now screens the 
thousands upon thousands of commemorative stamp proposals the 
postal service gets each year helping to winnow them to the 40 or 
so that finally are issued 
it would have 11 members including two from the house and two 
from the senate that sounds like the makings of a new if 
miniature bureaucracy 
the sponsors of the bills say not and insist the system they 
propose would cost less than congress is spending now to produce 
process and print its flood of commemorative resolutions 
hollings said the commission members would be reimbursed for 
their expenses when they met but would operate without any paid 
staff 
but advisory commissions do have a way of hiring help and 
posting claims on the budget the congressional budget office 
thinks any savings on commemorative resolutions would be more than 
offset by the cost of the new panel 
hollings argues that the current way exacts other costs 
diverting the time and energies of congress members and aides from 
substantive work we should honor our constituents not by passing 
commemorative after commemorative but by spending our time working 
on legislation that will make a real difference in their lives 
hollings said 
meanwhile the occasions to be noted in the new session of 
congress are accumulating federal employees recognition week 
drinking water week be kind to animals week just to commemorate a 
few 
and about that brain decade which began jan 1 it was 
designated in connection with the 160th anniversary of the birth of 
a silas mitchell credited with founding the science of neurology 
the decade of the brain said rep silvio o conte rmass 
when he proposed the resolution think about it

rock n roll kids love it parents hate it 
and as the music industry celebrates itself at the 32nd annual 
grammy awards on wednesday parents groups religious organizations 
and state legislatures have declared war on rock 
some rock lyrics they say advocate sex drugs subversion and 
violence and they aim to put a stop to that 
for more than 30 years rock n roll has been a 
multibilliondollar winner for record companies 
but for every tune welcomed by parents such as billy joels we 
didnt start the fire which has been praised for offering 
youngsters an instant history lesson others are condemned as unfit 
for children 
legislators have stepped in with a direct message its a small 
yellow flourescent sticker on records compact discs and cassettes 
warning may contain explicit lyrics descriptive of or 
advocating one or more of the following suicide incest 
bestiality sadomasochism sexual activity in a violent context 
murder morbid violence illegal use of drugs or alcohol 
thats what a bill recently passed by the pennsylvania house of 
representatives would require for records containing any of the 
above in song lyrics a proposed missouri law would add nudity 
to the list florida would include sexual activity 
iowa arizona maryland and oklahoma have also drawn up 
legislation and virginia alaska new mexico illinois delaware 
and kansas are considering similar measures 
while rock n roll and all its lyrics go prime time on the 
grammys record stores around the country are being pressured to 
keep things clean 
the 450store national trans world chain now sells stickered 
products in its florida stores only to those 18 or older as the 
result of a sting operation by florida attorney jack thompson 
in which minors purchased unedited versions of rap group 2 live 
crews records 
the 52store specs music chain based in florida and the 
70store nashville tennbased sound shop chain have adopted 
similar policies 
last year tommy hammond a record shopkeeper in alexander 
city ala was convicted of obscenity for selling 2 live crews 
move something lp which contains a tune titled sampm 
although the customer was a local police officer hammond was told 
by the arresting officer nobodys old enough to buy it in this 
state hammond was fined 500 by the city court and has appealed 
to a circuit court 
in may 1989 ouachita county sheriff jack dews seized a number 
of rap and heavy metal tapes from the walmart chain and hear the 
blues record stores in camden ark they had them displayed in 
open cases some on open counters dews said a 10yearold 
could buy them and they were clearly labeled as obscene 
rap and heavy metal are the prime targets but mainstream stars 
have also come under attack madonnas like a prayer commercial 
for pepsi was pulled after a threatened boycott by mississippi 
preacher donald wildmon who heads the american family association 
mick jagger said columbia records asked the rolling stones to 
delete words from the inner sleeve of their dirty work album 
one of the things that hitler was real good at and very shrewd 
in doing was developing the youth said mike shelton a police 
officer in union city calif and author of the training manual 
punk rock amp heavy metal the problemone solution 
much of that was about distinct uniforms distinct lifestyles 
and distinct music music can influence particular young people 
he said 
tipper gore president of the parents music resource center 
pmrc agrees she says youngsters are influenced by the 
glorification of violence 
a year ago multiplatinumartist bobby brown was dragged from 
the stage of the municipal auditorium in columbus ga and 
arrested for dancing suggestively in cincinnati rappers nwa 
and too hort were fined for giving obscene performances 
in april 1989 platinumselling metallica a heavy metal group 
was forced to cancel a show at notre dame university because of 
bad publicity 
ever since elvis presley appeared on the ed sullivan show 
censors have sought to confine rock n roll to the waist up 
rocks defenders insist the latest wave of criticism is simply the 
same old song 
to me the rock n roll attitude is live and let live said 
bill adler of rush artists management whose clients include 
rappers public enemy rundmc and ll cool j 
i dont believe the issue is a couple of dirty rap records 
whats going on here is theres kind of a cultural war in progress 
this music has always been under attack by elements of the 
christian fundamentalist right ever since it first surfaced in the 
mid1950s 
but organizations such as pmrc which pressures record companies 
to label products claim customers have a right to know whats in 
the stores pmrc insists its not looking to pull the plug on rock 
but merely to jiggle the wires 
pmrc prefers a voluntary system much like the rating system for 
movies between filmmakers and the motion picture association of 
america inc 
specifically were interested in material that is impacting 
children executive director jennifer norwood said we dont 
monitor every record it has more to do with than just a 
fourletter word we are dealing with material that is so graphic

in 1985 pmrc and the recording industry association of america 
reached agreement on voluntary labeling records with lyric content 
relating to explicit sex explicit violence or explicit substance 
abuse would carry the label explicit lyrics parental 
advisory or have lyrics visible on the jacket 
however the industry has not always honored the agreement 
norwood said 
the beastie boys didnt carry a label she said of their 
license to ill lp and it had 95 references to drugs and 
alcohol motley crue has never been labeled and they carry 
numerous references to sex and graphic violence 
voluntary legislation isnt enough for some state legislators 
rep don hermann of iowa has sponsored a labeling bill and said 
recently in an interview with billboard that hes sick of songs 
with lyrics outside the norm like this elton john song about 
sally that isnt a girl at all but about a homosexual 
judith toth a democrat in the maryland house of delegates has 
proposed a labeling law that would impose up to a 1000 fine and 
up to one year in jail for a first offense and 5000 and up to 
three years imprisonment for subsequent offenses 
theres just a movement within rock groups that doesnt 
care she said the movement includes most rap groups and 
skinhead music performers whose lyrics toth says degrade 
racial and ethnic minorities 
opponents to mandatory labeling include the record industry 
association civil liberties groups music critics a number of 
rock stars notably frank zappa and the national association of 
recording merchandisers which represents retailers 
beach boy mike love whose group was attacked by former 
secretary of the interior james watt for attracting the wrong 
element contributed money to the pmrc but donny osmond a 
mormon and longtime supporter of conservative causes has condemned 
labeling 
in the middle are the retailers themselves who insist their 
hands are tied between satisfying local complaints and respecting 
freedom of expression they have not hesitated however to point 
an accusing finger at the recording industry 
it would be our hope that the manufacturers would take it upon 
themselves to determine product that may contain objectionable 
material and choose either not to publish that or to affix warning 
labels to that product said jim williamson a trans world vice 
president 
id like to see the manufacturers take a responsible stand 
said vicky carmichael vice president of specs its a tough 
situation no matter what you do someone is going to be unhappy 
we want to do what is good for our business and do whats right we 
have some customers who purchase the explicit lyrics and some who 
are offended 
but what defines offensive or obscene should minors be 
permitted to purchase kurt weills satirical opera the threepenny 
opera which features murder bigamy and prostitution 
yes its sticky carmichael admitted i thinks this 
country is swinging back more conservatively i see it happening 
the penalties they want to have 
retailers also fear mandatory labeling would turn them into 
involuntary censors a record store owner might have to monitor 
every album in the store to make sure no explicit lyrics were 
left unmarked 
theres no way in the world a person could do that said 
hammond the alexander city record store owner even if i could 
do that who am i to try to tell another person what they can or 
cant listen to i cant even tell you what pornography is how am 
i supposed to tell others what it is 
labeling opponents have accused the record industry of caring 
more about dollar signs than yellow stickers critics note that the 
industry associations agreement with the pmrc came while the 
industry was lobbying congress for a tax on blank cassettes and 
insist that artistic freedom is still not a primary concern 
all the record industry wants is to be able to do business 
said lee ballinger an associate editor for the newsletter rock amp 
roll confidential they want to lobby the government for a 
uniform labeling bill they want to make money they dont care 
charles ruttenberg the general counsel for the retailers 
association denies this insisting that record industry people 
have the same concerns as anyone else 
i think that all the people ive talked with they all have 
families they have children i dont think theyre in it just to 
make money theyre trying to make sure children arent injured

the middlesex county nj prosecutors office 
monitors the music and literature of hate crime suspects as part of 
a special task force 
the component evaluates the effects of heavy metal lyrics on 
the acts of vandalism county prosecutor alan rockoff said about 
the joint unit to stop terrorism which was formed four years ago 
in response to an outbreak of racist and antisemitic incidents 
weve found not only the heavy metal influence but a 
progression from heavy metal music and the fixation or obsession 
with violence weapons and thunderbolts and knives things like 
that that has evolved as sort of a genesis into these white 
supremacists affiliations he said they seem to be putting 
graffiti on buildings now and attacking people solely on the basis 
of color 
rockoff said that when a hate crime is committed the procedure 
is to find probable cause and then obtain a search warrant for the 
suspects home 
with that search warrant we make observations in the homes 
and particularly the rooms what motivates them what literature do 
they read 
but the new jersey branch of the american civil liberties union 
objects to the procedure 
i think that its unconstitutional because what someone reads 
or listens to is part of the private person said aclu legal 
director deb ellis its not a crime to be part of an aryan 
organization or read aryan literature what youre looking for is 
evidence of the actual illegal act 
but said rockoff there is no apology that has to be made by 
law enforcement offcials for trying to uncover the motivation or 
commission for criminal acts 
you want to know why he picked on the particular icon you 
look for evidence whether its rope or whatever when you are in 
the inner sanctuary you have a perfect right to try to learn what 
motivated that young person 
the prosecutor cited a case in which a group of young people 
were indicted for placing swastikas antisemitic slurs and 
statements such as 6 million more why not on the walls of the 
bnai brith hillel foundation at rutgers university in new 
brunswick 
we have learned that some of the individuals involved had 
affiliations to a white aryan supremacy organization from that 
literature we have gained a great deal of insight into skinhead 
culture 
were not looking at any idealogical movement or political 
movement or liberal or conservative or civil rights or law 
enforcement rockoff said nor do i want to be called a zealot 
it is not an idealogical police force i am not a censor i am 
just a cop trying to do his job

wilfred lepage saw his first zebra mussel feb 1 by september 
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water 
treatment plant he manages cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly 
sparking a water emergency 
there is no cheap solution to it and theres no real cure to 
the problem said lepage water treatment superintendent in 
monroe mich on lake eries western edge 
at the eastern end of the lake in dunkirk ny the 
greenandyellow striped shellfish first appeared oct 3 and now 
infest a niagara mohawk power corp generating plant decembers 
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they 
quickly settled inside the plant 
they like it where its dimly lit they like it where its 
warm and they dont like a lot of turbulence this place is ideal 
for them said robert c henderson a chemical lab supervisor at 
the plant by july were going to have a massive problem with 
them 
three years after they were introduced to north america and 
after only one year in lake erie zebra mussels have spread 
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to lake 
ontario and along the st lawrence river its an invasion 
scientists say could affect farming fishing and daily life along 
virtually every body of fresh water in north america in the next 
few years 
the mussels are mostly about a halfinch long although they can 
reach 2 inches during their fiveyear lifespans they eat by 
filtering microscopic food particles from the water and love 
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings 
them a steady supply of fresh food 
a mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour said r 
warren flint a scientist with the great lakes program at the state 
university of new yorkbuffalo as a result they will leave water 
cleaner than before from an aesthetic perspective that would 
certainly be a benefit i guess he said 
europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algaechoked ponds 
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed said 
charles oneill with the sea grant program at the state university 
college at brockport 
the mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and 
some kinds of fish including sturgeons and eels flint said but 
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food they 
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the 
billiondollar walleye and bassfishing industry 
and the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline 
farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes 
can expect problems and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because 
of the shells oneill said 
it can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet 
to the water at your tap oneill said its not just an 
environmental problem 
like their distant cousins the blue mussels zebras ought in 
theory to be edible by humans flint said but when canadian 
researchers tried steaming a bunch oneill said what they got 
was a stench that cleared the lab 
the mussels have plagued europe for more than a century and are 
believed to have arrived in north america on a freighter that 
emptied its ballast tanks in lake st clair upstream from lake 
erie in 1986 
scientists are studying the possibility that the lake erie 
infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986 
event oneill said but flint said one colony could have infested 
the lake because one mussel can lay 30000 to 50000 eggs a year 
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells 
they could easily get across lake erie or lake ontario in that 
period of time he said 
for public water systems controlling the mussels is a matter of 
applying chlorine ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the 
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the 
plant say scientists and plant operators like lepage who have 
already faced the problem 
power plants have a different problem because officials are 
reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in 
cooling water discharged back to the lake henderson said niagara 
mohawk and the state department of environmental conservation are 
negotiating a solution 
james sell chief operator of the dunkirk water plant is 
studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipes mouth like 
building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine 
pipe out through the intake were better off than the people in 
the western end of the lake sell said 
at least we have some time to do something by spring 
the city council hasnt been persuaded to pay up to 100000 for 
the plans but sell who keeps three living mussels in a jar to 
show visitors said i dont see much option for them if they 
want a water supply 
farther inland many water officials are unaware of the problem 
or not prepared to do anything about it michael burke director of 
the state health departments bureau of public water supply 
protection said the department was studying the problem but 
doesnt see the need to issue warnings i think the words 
getting to them particularly those with large surface intakes in 
the great lakes it is coming out in industry papers and things of 
that sort 
oneill and other scientists said the state should do more to 
get the word out because it is only a matter of time and not 
necessarily very much time 
the chances of them getting into the western reach of the erie 
canal is good oneill said the canal is an ideal place for 
them to live its warm its shallow most of it has rock riprap 
to attach to 
pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their 
engine housings and other places where water collects 
once the mussels get into lake michigan they will almost 
certainly spread through the chicago river and into the mississippi 
river basin oneill said any area in north america that is 
utilizing surface water should be concerned

a mysterious aids outbreak has killed 
33 infants or toddlers since july and stricken 20 others in a 
country not prepared to prevent the spread of the fatal disease 
the victims are from 4 months to 3 years old and come from three 
areas bucharest in the south southernmost giurgiu and constanta 
on the black sea coast to the southeast said dr ludovic paun of 
the infectious diseases department at the victor babes hospital 
here in the nations capital 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first diagnosed in 
romania in 1985 but it wasnt until july that it began showing up 
in young children he said it was a big surprise for us for 
everybody its incredible 
since 1985 69 people have been diagnosed with aids in romania 
and 45 have died fiftythree of the cases and 33 of the deaths 
were in children 
a total of 371 romanians have been shown in initial tests to be 
carrying the aids virus paun said of those 268 are children 
victor babes hospital which specializes in infectious diseases 
is treating 65 patients with aids or aidsrelated infections in an 
isolated threestory building at the edge of the 600bed complex 
paun said 
the three adult aids patients have separate rooms but the 
infants are crammed into wards crowded with whitepainted iron 
cribs separated into rooms for those with confirmed aids and those 
with related infections 
in one room with the word confirmati or confirmed on the 
door 10 infants stared out from cribs spread with blue brown or 
plaid blankets one about a year old had sunken cheeks and thin 
white hair 
we have to keep them together because we can only heat so many 
rooms and to have them in a controlled situation for the staff to 
handle said paun 
authorities do not know how so many children became infected 
since a thorough epidemiological investigation has not been 
completed paun said all these children came from institutions 
from orphanages or hospital units for children who are undersized 
for their age 
it might have been possible for the disease to spread through 
instruments that were not properly sterilized he said aids 
cases among soviet children have in at least two instances been 
traced to infected needles many east bloc nations do not have 
disposable syringes that are common in the west 
authorities are now investigating individual orphanages and 
hospitals said dr dan daiculescu a colleague of pauns whats 
important is how they contracted it this is a tragic problem 
in only five cases did parents of the infected children have 
positive blood tests for aids but not all parents were tested 
paun said he added that since the children were at least several 
months old when first tested doctors were uncertain how many of 
the victims might have been born with aids 
more than 15000 blood tests conducted since 1985 do not 
indicate there is a special community of aids victims in 
romania the way that homosexuals and drug users are at greater 
risk in the west paun said 
romanian doctors are only beginning to learn about aids he 
said and the public knows almost nothing of the disease that 
damages a bodys immune system since little was published during 
the rule of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
as part of ceausescus program to increase romanias population 
from 23 million to 30 million by the turn of the century condoms 
were only available on the black market at high prices until the 
dictators downfall in december 
daiculescu said a radio and tv campaign was needed to warn 
romanians of the dangers of aids but that no money was available 
for such a project we dont have the material suport we need 
paun agreed adding that the hospital did not have azt or other 
uptodate drugs for treating aids patients 
at one point during a tour the children in one ward were all 
crying and daiculescu explained they just had injections 
antibiotics 
the romanian health ministry is organizing five regional centers 
to test for aids to more carefully measure how widespread the 
disease is paun said doctors are managing to cope with the spread 
of aids he said but there are fears that they might be 
overwhelmed by many more cases we dont have very many patients 
but in the future we may have a problem 
the virus is present and the danger is present

james sorg can visualize the bearings and 
wheels spinning flawlessly and is convinced that one day theyll 
do the same in real life a machine churning endlessly powered 
only by gravity 
gravity is an energy source that does not pollute does not 
need storage does not need transportation said sorg 53 
everyone in the world has an adequate supply no country would 
need what another country has got 
the farmer and airline worker says that after 46 years of 
figuring and tinkering he has found a way to disprove a basic law 
of physics in his barn the 12foottall wheel studded with 
barbells and rollerskate parts only rotates a couple times before 
coming to a stop but its just a rough draft 
bureaucrats and scientists scoff but they laughed at 
christopher columbus too sorg said they cant understand they 
say youre crazy get out of here mentality of that nature used 
to teach that the world was flat 
sorgs gravityoperated machine shares the barn with a 
restless calf on his 100acre farm where he also is developing a 
new breed of cattle im always thinking about something he 
said 
when i was 7 years old my uncle bought an old brass candy 
scale i thought if you could just bring the weight across from one 
side to the other you could keep it swinging back and forth 
forever 
sorg who never went to college or studied physics said he made 
dozens of stabs at perpetual motion before deciding on the flywheel 
design in 1980 after a long struggle it was patented in march as 
an energy conservator because the us patent bureau wont even 
consider perpetual motion machines 
perpetual motion can never occur said joseph chalmers head of 
the physics department at the university of louisville the laws of 
thermodynamics say any engine will lose energy through friction 
ultimately coming to a stop we dont just enunciate these laws 
to hear ourselves talk he said 
human nature being what it is of course theres no shortage of 
people who over the years have been willing to attempt what others 
say is impossible 
sorgs machine has an 8footwide metal wheel with 12 weights on 
axles mounted around the perimeter each directly opposite another 
and linked to its mate by a cable as the wheel turns and a weight 
rises to top center an arm connected to it meets a cam causing 
the weight to move away from the wheel 
the cable between the opposite weights raises the one at the 
bottom which makes the one at the bottom weightless at the bottom 
of the flywheel and places its weight at the top of the flywheel 
which adds force at the top of the flywheel which causes the 
rotation sorg explains 
as he sets the weights in the proper position his machine 
strains forward and when the brake is released it begins turning 
slowly making two revolutions before a weight sticks in the wrong 
position 
if the machine was precisely balanced it would spin until it 
wore out sorg said they say its not supposed to move on its 
own but it does they say its not supposed to turn even one full 
revolution but it does 
chalmers said the device might be useful as a way of conserving 
energy but lifting the weights will use the same amount of energy 
as is given by the opposite weight falling at the same time 
energy is lost to friction 
a similar machine was proposed well over 100 years ago with 
levers and whatnot around a circle you give it a spin and it 
probably spins for a long time but in terms of going forever its 
certainly not going to do that 
although every scientist he seeks to convince rejects his ideas 
sorg is steadfast he continues to work on two models and plans a 
third 
somebody someplace will be interested enough to come out here 
to see it just out of curiousity he said and theyll be able 
to help me find a machine shop to build it the way it needs to be

teenagers and young adults are most vulnerable 
to suicide clusters in which one suicide seems to trigger at least 
one more a study suggests 
analysis of federal records for 19781984 found that clustering 
occurred some two to four times more often in the age groups 1519 
and 2024 than in older age groups researchers said a cluster was 
defined as two suicides in the same county within seven 14 or 30 
days each time period was analyzed separately 
for the sevenday period for example researchers found 1420 
such pairs of suicides among teenagers 15 to 19 6 percent higher 
than would be expected by chance 
clusters account for relatively few suicides among young people 
but they may be particularly preventable wrote the researchers 
from columbia universitys college of physicians and surgeons and 
school of public health the new york state psychiatric institute 
and the federal centers for disease control 
the cdc has developed recommendations for a community plan to 
prevent and contain suicide clusters they said

birth control pills may offer some protection 
against pelvic inflammatory disease caused by chlamydia the most 
common sexually transmitted disease in the nation but not pid 
caused by gonorrhea researchers say 
chlamydia a bacterial infection is blamed for about half the 
cases of pid in women it can lead to chronic pelvis pain 
miscarriage and infertility and infants born to infected mothers 
can suffer pneumonia and eye infections 
this is a little different than previous studies that have 
said that birth control pills protect aginst pid period said 
dr paul wolnerhanssen of the university of washington this is 
kind of a good news bad news result what we say is yes its 
true it does protect you aginst pid if you have chlamydia but it 
does not protect you against pid if you have gonorrhea 
the researchers led by wolnerhanssen studied 141 women with pid 
who attended one of three clinics at the universitys harborview 
medical center and 739 randomly selected sexually active women 
with no signs of the disease 
a comparison of women who had chlamydia and pid with those who 
only had chlamydia showed that those who had chlamydia but took 
oral contraceptives were five times less likely to get pid than 
those who used another or no method of birth control 
wolnerhanssen said the results were not significant when women 
with gonorrhea were compared suggesting the pill does not protect 
them 
the results did not differ appreciably when adjusted for age 
race years of education age at first intercourse frequency of 
intercourse or history of the sexually transmitted diseases but 
the researchers noted the study could have been influenced by 
factors such as willingness to seek health care 
the study was published in the journal of the american medical 
association

a new technique could increase the 
storage capacity of compact disks by 1666 according to its 
developer who says it would allow 18000 encyclopedia britannicas 
or 10 days worth of music on one cd 
a 12inch compact disk using the technology could hold a 
terabyte a trillion bytes or characters of information says 
tuan vodinh a physical chemist a conventional cd can hold 600 
million bytes the equivalent of about 270000 typewritten pages a 
terabyte would be nearly 450 million pages 
an set of encyclopaedia britannica has about 25000 pages 
conventional cd storage uses lasers essentially to burn holes 
into a disk a computer needs only ones and zeroes to work 
the burned bits could be zeroes and the untouched reflecting 
bits ones or vice versa 
even the hole burned by a laser is bigger than the 1000 
molecules vodinh says he can alter the number needed to store a 
bit eight bits make a byte could be cut to 100 or so the 
theoretical limit is one molecule but you would need a very 
sensitive detector to see just one molecule 
vodinhs technique called surface enhanced raman optical data 
storage is based on a phenomenon discovered in the 1920s called 
the raman optical effect which says the lightemitting properties 
of molecules can be altered 
serods lends itself to confidential data storage because it can 
reflect signals at a particular frequency said guven yalcintas 
director of technology for oak ridge national laboratory where 
vodinh works 
a selective frequency is very difficult to decifer 
yalcintas said adding that serods also holds the potential for 
threedimensional data storage increasing its capacity and 
versatility even further 
yalcintas estimates it will take about 5 million and two years 
to make a commercially viable product but says there already is 
interest 
the navy is interested in sending out paperless ships nasa is 
interest in using it to store images and bring them back to earth 
the national archives are interested the air force is thinking 
about it to store a very large amount of information a picture of 
the surface and present an image to the pilot he said you 
can count on and on and on

service on delaware amp hudson railway 
lines were to be cut back today pending a hearing friday before a 
federal agency to consider a proposal to keep the bankrupt railroad 
on the tracks according to a bankruptcy trustee 
francis p dicello courtappointed trustee for damph said he had 
not seen the order issued by the interstate commerce commission 
wednesday night but was told it reduced service for the next two 
days pending the outcome of the hearing no other officials could 
be reached for comment on the order 
the icc is expected to consider a proposal to keep damph running 
for at least 30 days the proposal was submitted by the new york 
susquehanna and western railroad a subsidiary of delaware otsego 
corp in addition canadian national railroad said it will help 
cover some of the costs nysampw will incur if the proposal is 
approved 
nysampw and canadian national both lost in efforts to purchase damph 
during proceedings in us bankruptcy court in wilmington 
dicello who was appointed trustee in 1988 chose canadian 
pacific ltd as the successful bidder for damph in january over nysampw 
and four other bidders canadian national wanted to make a bid in 
court last friday but lost its financial backing before the 
hearing 
cp had agreed to purchase the ailing railroad for 35 million 
but the transaction was contingent on whether it could obtain track 
rights from conrail from harrisburg pa to hagerstown md an 
agreement could not be reached and cp withdrew its purchase offer 
damph faced shutdown proceedings at midnight wednesday if there had 
been no action by the icc 
during an emergency hearing in bankruptcy court wednesday to 
determine damphs fate walter rich nysampw president and chief 
executive officer said if damph is allowed to continue to operate 
it could continue to provide service with no disruptions to 99 
percent of its shippers 
damph is the nations oldest continually operating railway the 
icc designated nysampw to operate damph after the rail line went into 
chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988 creditors have about 100 million in 
claims against the railroad 
nysampws proposal to keep damph operating has the backing of the 
federal railroad administration 
weve been fighting to try to save the railroad for weeks 
now said gil carmichael federal railroad administrator 
carmichael said he was encouraged to see a partnership formed 
between canadian national and nysampw to finance continued operations 
of damph instead of the states of new york and pennsylvania using 
taxpayers money to keep damph running 
he would not speculate on whether nysampw and canadian national 
would make a bid for damph but carmichael did say he has known 
rich wanted to buy damph for a long time and cn wanted to be a 
player in it based on last weeks failed attempt to bid for the 
line 
the conrail tracks at issue with cp are on a route that connects 
with csx and norfolk southern railroads at hagerstown damph already 
connects with the two railroads at philadelphia and buffalo ny 
cps purchase agreement was to have expired at midnight tuesday 
but was extended in the absence of a purchase agreement and with 
no pending bids wednesday dicello said officials had planned to 
begin shutting down shipping over damph rail lines if the icc had not 
intervened a complete shutdown would have taken four to five days 
according to stanley samorajczyk an attorney for dicello 
plans would then be made to begin selling off damphs assets 
damph which began in 1824 as a canal company runs 20 to 25 
trains daily in new york maryland pennsylvania new jersey and 
quebec it owns 550 miles of track and has traffic rights to 
another 1000 according to ken willsey delaware otsego spokesman 
a shutdown would put 672 employees out of work and eliminate the 
hope of return for 100 to 150 others on furlough he said

entergy corp parent of utilities in 
arkansas louisiana and mississippi says it lost nearly 500 
million last year mainly because of a thirdquarter 900 million 
writeoff of the unfinished grand gulf 2 nuclear power plant in 
mississippi 
the companys fourthquarter income tumbled 741 percent 
entergy which last year changed its name from middle south 
utilities abandoned grand gulf 2 in 1985 when it was only 34 
percent complete 
the 1989 loss came to 231 a share entergy said 
because of the scrapped plant entergy took a loss of 6793 
million or 332 per share in the third quarter 
fourthquarter 1989 results also were hurt by the grand gulf 2 
writeoff 
net income slumped by 741 percent to 151 million compared 
with 583 million in the fourth quarter of 1988 pershare 
earnings fell from 29 cents to eight 8 cents 
total operating revenue rose 22 percent to 883 million from 
8635 million 
energy sales to retail customers climbed 27 percent to 54 
million for the year from 5258 million in 1989 
entergy reported that total electric sales in the quarter 
increased 24 percent that was mostly a result of an 181 percent 
jump in wholesale revenues the company said 
the grand gulf writeoff is a onetime hurdle that will benefit 
us in the long term said john cowan an entergy executive the 
writeoff did not materially affect our cash position nor did it 
impact our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock 
each quarter at the current level 
writing off grand gulf 2 was part of a settlement entergy 
reached with various state and local officials in return for 
entergy accepting its losses on the abandoned project local 
officials agreed to drop all challenges to the wisdom of building 
and operating the grand gulf 1 plant 
grand gulf 1 supplies electricity to and increased rates for 
customers of arkansas power amp light louisiana power amp light 
mississippi power amp light and new orleans public service inc 
the challenges if the findings went against the utility and 
were upheld by the courts could have forced entergy companies to 
absorb more of the grand gulf 1 costs 
the settlement also resolved a federal energy regulatory 
commission audit case involving grand gulf

said wednesday that boeing hopes to complete the deal by the end of 
this year thornton spoke at the opening of singapores asian 
aerospace 90 air show

manufacturers have been going on for more than three years

while some big real estate companies have 
collapsed during a sharp decline in the market others have avoided 
trouble by redirecting their business and showing more restraint 
experts say 
if companies are well managed they may not raise as much 
money but at least theyre surviving said fuhrman nettles vice 
president of robert a stanger amp co a firm that follows the real 
estate investment industry 
on tuesday vms realty partners in chicago announced it was 
suspending most payments to creditors and investors because of 
severe cash flow problems at the same time integrated 
resources inc in new york once a major seller of taxsheltered 
real estate investments filed for bankruptcy protection 
their troubles followed the fall of southmark corp in dallas 
another major real estate company that filed for bankruptcy last 
year 
the decline in the industry however became apparent after 
1986 when federal tax law revisions made real estate investments 
less attractive that year real estate companies raised more than 
10 billion from investors by 1989 the figure had dropped to an 
estimated 35 billion 
officials at first winthrop corp in boston saw the changes 
coming and redirected investments from those that offered tax 
breaks to those that focused more on cash returns said bruce 
guzowski chief operating officer for the company 
for example where the company previously got investors to put 
their money into subsidized housing which provided tax credits 
first winthrop in 1986 bought a portfolio of hotel and other 
commercial properties on the resort island of nantucket 
the benefits of real estate from a tax perspective went away 
with the 1986 tax act guzowski said 
first winthrop also cut its operations across the board he 
said declining to elaborate 
i think we saw the market was shrinking and saw a need to 
shrink the company he said 
other companies however apparently tried too hard to keep 
growing despite the tax law changes and real estate slumps that 
were hitting the southwest and about to hit the northeast 
human enthusiasm takes a long time to wear down nettles 
said 
regarding the developments this week with vms realty and 
integrated resources nettles said it appears as though they 
didnt respond well it appears both companies followed an 
expansionist policy 
a common source of trouble for some companies was the highyield 
junk bond market the same risky financing mechanism that helped 
the downfall of the wall street investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
integrated resources deprived of tax shelter investments moved 
aggressively into insurance and mutual funds financed largely 
through junk bonds 
southmark used junk bonds to finance rapid growth but the 
company was crushed by debt when the real estate market collapsed 
in the southwest 
first winthrop however avoided the junk bond market 
fortunately its not something we used guzowski said 
weve always financed with equity not debt 
lets just say i think we made a wise decision he said

after a multimilliondollar investment 
and retraining program ford motor co has begun fullscale 
production of its new explorer sportsutility vehicle 
sportutility vehicles are the fastestgrowing segment of the 
truck market and with the explorer we will be fully competitive 
in that segment incoming president philip benton jr said during 
ceremonies marking the startup at the assembly plant here 
weve bet nearly 600 million on that outcome benton told 
employees and state and local officials wednesday 
benton who drove the first explorer off the assembly line said 
his company may become much more truckoriented in the future 
especially in europe 
i cant tell you exactly how or when this truck expansion in 
europe will take place but im convinced that it will and that 
ford with worldclass products such as the explorer will be a 
leader said benton who is scheduled to become the companys 
president march 1 
benton predicted that the explorer available in two and 
fourdoor models will sell at perhaps twice the volume of the 
bronco ii which it is replacing the bronco ii came in only a 
twodoor model and ford officials conceded that climbing into the 
back seat almost requires gymnastic talent 
the plant is expected to turn out 85 explorers an hour with 
sales to the public beginning next month the first three vehicles 
off the line wednesday were purchased by employees 
the explorer is a family of compact five or sixpassenger 
utility trucks available in either two or fourwheel drive with 
an improved electronically fuelinjected v6 engine and either 
manual or automatic overdrive transmissions 
referring to the european market benton said ford expects it to 
adopt the american idea that trucks are for carrying people as 
well as cargoes trucks constitute fully onethird of the 
industrys volume each year and are 40 percent of the ford 
divisions north american volume 
benton said that percentage is climbing because as part of its 
strategy the company will be building more and different kinds 
of trucks for our customers and for our international partners 
later this year ford will build twodoor 4x4 vehicles at the 
louisville plant for its partner mazda to sell as the navajo 
through its us dealer network 
it marks the first time a usbased vehicle manufacturer will 
make a product for a japanese company benton said

ibm unveiled a line of computer workstations 
today that experts say should help the computer giant win a stake 
in an important market it never has mastered 
the opportunity is big its growing at over 30 percent a 
year and its mostly a new opportunity for ibm president jack 
d kuehler told a news conference 
kuehler said the new workstations designed for business users 
outperform the newest and best that our competitors offer 
international business machines corp aides showed reporters 
nine highperformance workstations and computer fileservers with 
prices ranging from 13000 to more than 74000 
industry analysts say the machines are impressive for their 
operating speed and features and should be received favorably by 
engineers their target market 
workstations are desktop machines that are much more powerful 
than personal computers some even match the power of mainframes 
they are used for such processingintensive tasks as computer 
modeling of new products 
while the workstation market is a small segment of the overall 
computer industry it is among the fastestgrowing and uses for 
the machines are expanding 
ibm introduced a workstation line several years ago the rt 
line but it captured less than 3 percent of market experts 
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced 
the workstation field is dominated by sun microsystems inc 
digital equipment corp and hewlettpackard co 
the new ibm machines like the workstations they replace are 
based on a version of the unix operating system the underlying 
software that directs basic computer functions 
unix developed by american telephone amp telegraph co is 
becoming the computer industry standard allowing machines from 
different manufacturers to be linked together 
until now ibm had not wholeheartedly embraced unix preferring 
its own proprietary operating systems instead the fact that the 
workstations are unixbased shows ibm is serious about this market 
analysts say 
like the older ibm workstations the new models also are based 
on reducedinstructionset computing technology or risc which 
simplifies the circuitry of a computers central processor to 
increase speed and offer cost savings the powerful machines are 
expected to offer color 3d graphics capability 
analysts say one factor in the success of the new line called 
the risc system 6000 will be the availability of applications 
software or the programs that provide the actual uses of a 
computer such as engineering modeling 
though the machines are unixbased ibm uses its own version of 
unix called aix that is not compatible with unix applications 
programs written for other companies machines that means programs 
must be rewritten for the ibm workstations 
ibm has been working with software companies for some time to 
develop programs for the new machines

eaglepicher industries inc says it is 
preparing a missouri plant to produce batteries for electric 
vehicles later this year for what the company hopes will be a 
growing market for the vehicles 
you could say we have high hopes for it john w painter 
president and chief operating officer of eaglepicher said 
wednesday the diversified manufacturing company has its 
headquarters here 
the plant at joplin mo would initially employ about 50 people 
and possibly more later painter said the 40000squarefoot plant 
will operate as part of eaglepichers joplin electronics division 
which makes batteries for use in toys computers and the nations 
space program and does research of new battery products 
the joplin plant will make nickeliron batteries for 
electricpowered vehicles gaspowered vehicles use conventional 
leadacid batteries 
the joplin division has been working on a nickeliron battery 
since 1980 under costsharing contracts with the us department of 
energy and has produced limited numbers of the batteries as 
research prototypes eaglepicher has spent several million dollars 
on the research painter said 
eaglepicher and a consortium of utilities supporting the 
project plan to spend a combined 4 million on the joplin plant 
painter said eaglepicher will contribute about 300000 he said

with help from the marlboro man an 
enormous advertising budget and growing demand overseas the no 1 
cigarette maker is selling more smokes than ever despite a 
shrinking market at home 
in many respects the success of philip morris usa reflects the 
scrappy tenacity of the domestic tobacco industry which has taken 
an aggressive some critics would say hostile and unethical 
approach to selling cigarettes and combating health groups that 
want to restrict smoking 
there are 55to60 million adults in this country who have 
made the choice to smoke said steve weiss a philip morris 
spokesman 
whats frightening is that these antismoking groups are 
attempting to impose their own morality on the adult american 
public by trying to control the information they receive 
philip morris hasnt been immune to the growing antismoking 
movement in the united states which has played a role in reducing 
the market by about 2 percent a year 
that shrinkage is partly why philip morris usas new yorkbased 
parent philip morris cos acquired kraft inc and miller brewing 
co years ago to protect itself by diversifying 
nonetheless the tobacco arm of the conglomerate has been 
strengthening relative to competitors with weapons that range from 
intense advertising to lobbying in washington to a sales assault on 
virgin territory abroad 
nearly half the roughly 636 million in domestic cigarette 
advertising in 1989 was spent by philip morris the trade newspaper 
advertising age has reported 
philip morris held almost 42 percent of the us cigarette 
market last year said john maxwell jr who follows the industry 
for wheat first securities in richmond the company had a 393 
percent market share in 1988 up from 378 percent the year before 
overseas too philip morris is doing extremely well in japan 
for example the company has benefited from a relaxation on imports 
and a demand for the mild virginian tobacco it uses to be blended 
with japanese cigarettes 
pavlos alexandrakis who follows the industry for argus 
research an investment advisory firm in new york predicted that 
bigger and betterfinanced tobacco companies such as philip morris 
will get even bigger 
they can advertise more alexandrakis said they can throw 
more money behind product development and research 
by contrast philip morris closest domestic competitor rjr 
nabisco inc may have little leeway in throwing money at new 
products partly because it was sold last year in a record 25 
billion takeover financed largely by debt 
the one major new cigarette rjr has attempted primarily aimed 
at blacks generated a storm of accusations that the company was 
contributing to the health problems of minorities rjr abruptly 
scrapped plans to test its uptown brand last month in what was 
widely seen as a marketing catastrophe 
philip morris brands are so selfsustaining that the company is 
not as pressured to concoct new ones analysts say among the best 
known are marlboro virginia slims benson amp hedges and parliament 
of those marlboro is king and is the strongest among new smokers 
one out of four cigarettes smoked is marlboro maxwell said 
marlboro outsells the next largest international cigarette over 
two to one 
the rangetoughened marlboro man has been an icon of philip 
morris ads since 1955 when it introduced the macho smoker with the 
butt dangling from his lips the company has reacted angrily to 
recent efforts by antismoking groups to do away with him 
the american cancer society for instance is promoting 
legislation to be introduced in congress this year that would limit 
cigarette ads to the brand name the product and text about it 
people are being lured into something that kills them said 
joann schellenbach an american cancer society spokeswoman in new 
york one in six people that start smoking are going to die from 
something cigaretterelated thats worse than russsian roulette 
the surgeon general estimates that cigarettes cause an estimated 
390000 deaths a year in the united states 
weiss said he saw little chance that congress would further 
restrict advertising by tobacco companies already proscribed from 
peddling cigarettes on television and radio and forced to put 
health warnings on other ads 
theres a tremendous amount of opposition in this country to 
tinkering with the commercial free speech rights of any 
manufacturer weiss said 
perhaps more than other cigarette makers philip morris has 
seized upon the free speech issue as a tool to defend its business 
the company even got its name on tv with an ad campaign about its 
sponsorship of a bill of rights commemoration which some critics 
saw as a subtle way of promoting cigarettes 
philip morris has promoted cigarettes in other unconventional 
ways at the companys cigarette factory in richmond for example 
adult visitors are offered free cigarettes and all visitors can 
write friends on philip morris postcards with companypaid postage 
the company also writes thankyou notes to visitors who sign the 
guest register hazards of smoking arent mentioned 
smoking critics have become increasingly galled at what they see 
as the sleazy tactics used to peddle cigarettes by philip morris 
and other companies many say they are particularly angered by 
subtle appeals to the young 
the tobacco industry has agreed to a code that it will not use 
models under 25 to promote cigarettes but many antismoking 
activists say the industry subverts that code by using over25 
models who appear to be kids 
others complain that cigarette makers intentionally place 
advertising billboards in places frequented by children 
we have photographs of billboards near schoolyards and theyre 
really showing youthfullooking people said harold freeman 
president of the american cancer society naturally theyre 
appealing to young people 
weiss denied philip morris targets young people or nonsmokers 
the company participates in a program in the schools to reinforce 
the fact that smoking is an adult choice weiss said 
if you look at our advertising youll see that the marlboro 
ad is somebody that is in their late 30s and 40s he said

its chemicals business 
bp which owns standard oil co of cleveland ohio said its net 
profit for the three months ended dec 31 came to 448 million 
pounds or 709 million converted at an average exchange rate for 
the period compared with 272 million pounds or 484 million in 
the same period a year ago 
earnings per share rose to 83 pence from 45 pence 
the companys financial statement is based on british accounting 
methods and cannot be directly compared with those of most american

345 million pounds or 546 million from 304 million pounds or 
541 million pershare earnings rose to 64 pence from 5 pence 
revenue for the three months rose 31 percent to 833 billion 
pounds from 637 billion pounds 
higher crude prices helped exploration and production earnings 
and offset lower production volumes and increased taxation bp 
said average per barrel north sea brent crude prices rose to 
1918 in the quarter from an average of 1356 a year ago alaska 
north slope crude prices averaged 1727 a barrel vs 1169 in the

of 390 million pounds for the year compared with a 232 million 
pound loss a year earlier 
bp said its historical net profit for all of 1989 came to 174 
billion pounds compared with 121 billion pounds in the previous

repositioning itself in 1989 to become more profitable and 
competitive in the future it refocused on its core businesses and 
completed a major restructuring early this year that included the 
sale of exploration and production assets for 13 billion 
the company also moved to improve its worldwide retailing image

federal regulators let the parent company of 
drexel burnham lambert inc slide into bankruptcy reorganization in 
part because they felt they didnt have to save it 
while federal banking and securities watchdogs closely monitored 
drexels woes ultimately they decided the collapse of one of the 
nations largest investment banking houses posed little or no 
danger to the financial markets and banking system 
i dont think there was any movement to do something said 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corporation which insures bank deposits and acts as the nations 
top banking regulator 
i think there was a general sense that we ought to monitor it 
carefully but there was no great push to do something once it was 
found the bondtrading unit and the brokerdealer unit were 
solvent seidman said wednesday 
drexel burnham lambert group the parent of the securities 
subsidiaries filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy code protection from 
creditors tuesday night after defaulting on 100 million in 
shortterm loans 
the securities and exchange commission which regulates the 
stock and bond markets noted that while it oversees the drexels 
brokerdealer arm it had no legal mandate to assist the parent 
company 
the holding company which is not regulated by us is what 
filed for chapter 11 said an sec spokeswoman mary mccue 
the sec today postponed a scheduled public meeting on potential 
rules changes because of drexel were contiuing to monitor the 
drexel situation closely but there is no emergency we think its 
prudent to postpone the meeting an sec spokeswoman said 
drexel previously sold off its retail brokerage business and 
in this situation there doesnt appear to be much consumer 
involvement said seidman 
he acknowledged that the nations savings and loans hold about 
8 billion in junk bonds a drexel speciality if drexels woes 
drive down the already ailing market in junk bonds seidman said 
that will make sampls that hold them insolvent quicker and force 
regulators to take the thrifts over sooner 
the sec is seeking authority from congress to obtain information 
about the financial health of the holding companies of 
brokerdealers information currently denied the agency 
bills that would give the sec such authority are pending in both 
the house and senate and have the support of the treasury 
department 
the continuing problems in the junk bond market point to the 
need for more complete disclosure and reliable asset valuation 
sen donald riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate banking 
housing and urban affairs committee said in a statement issued by 
his office 
congress is not in session this week but several staff aides to 
key committees pointed out that unlike the savings and loan 
industry the target of a massive taxpayerfinanced bailout 
securities firms are not federally insured to guarantee investors 
losses 
the staffers also noted that unlike drexel there was a 
political impetus to rescue individual corporations like chrysler 
corp and lockheed corp because of the tens of thousands of people 
across the country their collapse would have thrown out of work 
drexels downfall marked the largest securities industry 
bankruptcy filing ever and one of the first exceptions to a 
longheld regulatory policy that some financial institutions are 
too big to be allowed to fail that thinking was behind the 
government rescue of continental illinois national bank amp trust co 
theres been a toobigtofail doctrine that has included 
chrysler lockheed and other industrial units plus some banks 
there has always been discussion about how broad it is and when it 
will be applied said seidman 
clearly in this case the judgment was the failure would not 
imperil the system he said calling the health of drexels 
federally regulated units a key factor 
brokerdealers are required by the sec to maintain enough 
capital to offset the risk of the securities they trade in 
drexels subsidiaries that trade in stocks and bonds offer merger 
advice and buy federal bonds from the us government had adequate 
capital even though the parent company dbl group couldnt obtain 
loans to staunch a cash crisis 
the secs refusal to allow the transfer of excess capital to the 
parent company from the brokerdealer unit helped trigger the 
bankruptcy filing

settlements procedure to ease payments on foreign exchange dealings 
involving drexel burnham lambert incs british unit 
the british central bank said that drexels trading clients may 
make all payments due to drexel up through thursday to the bank of 
england the bank said it would hold the money until it was 
satisfied that drexel had made counter payments to clients 
this arrangement is a stopgap measure to avoid liquidity 
problems stemming from market reaction to drexels bankruptcy 
filing in the united states on tuesday 
on wednesday drexel burnham lambert trading ltd arranged with 
the bank of england to allow it to delay settlements on its foreign 
exchange and gold trading for one day 
the move by the bank wasnt a direct effort to prop up drexels 
operations but merely to ensure that drexels dealings were matched 
up 
however the banks involvement should calm nerves in the 
markets resulting from uncertainty surrounding drexel 
the bank of england said it would hold payments from drexels 
clients until 1600 gmt next tuesday awaiting counterpayment from 
drexel 
if drexel fails to make the payments the bank will return the 
funds to the initial party it said

individual circumstances 
the bank said it wouldnt get involved in any claims brought 
against drexel

truckbuilder navistar international corp today 
reported a loss of 18 million in the first quarter of its new 
fiscal year and attributed the red ink to lower demand for its 
products and higher production costs

million or 12 cents per share for the same period a year ago 
revenue for the period totaled 886 million a 12 percent 
decline from the 1 billion reported for the first quarter of 
fiscal 1989

mainly from a slowdown in demand for medium and heavy trucks and 
engines for such vehicles

navistar the nations largest maker of medium and heavy trucks 
said shipments of such vehicles by all north american manufacturers 
fell 21 percent during the first fiscal quarter to 66000 units

quarter the nations biggest automakers reported today in results 
that reflect their industrys recession

million in the three months ended dec 31 compared with earnings 
of 14 billion during the fourth quarter of 1988 gms 
fourthquarter earnings tumbled to 101 per share of common stock 
compared with 212 the year before 
earlier ford posted a profit of 314 million or 68 cents a 
share during the fourth quarter compared with 116 billion or 
242 a share in the yearearlier quarter

linked to the sale of its rouge steel co subsidiary but even 
without that factor fords fourthquarter earnings were down 363 
percent 
together with chrysler corp which tuesday reported a 
664million loss during the fourth quarter the nations big three 
automakers made 3702 million in the period down 877 percent 
from the 3 billion the companies reported in profits in 1988 
the earnings reflect the slump the auto industry entered in 
october as the 1990 model year opened and the costs of incentives 
the automakers used to try to spur sales 
automakers have closed plants and laid off thousands of workers 
as they cut production to bring it more in line with slow sales 
the industry began a rebound in january but that mainly came 
about because of incentives which cut directly into profits 
gms fourth quarter earnings came on revenue of 277 billion 
during the 1989 period compared with 2885 billion in revenue a 
year before 
fords revenue in its automotive and financial services business 
for the quarter amounted to 2415 billion compared with 2391 
billion in 1988 its automotive revenue fell 4 percent while 
financial services revenue rose 402 percent

during the period but the company did not immediately provide 
figures

486 billion on revenue of 11023 billion in 1988 annual

billion or 822 a share from 53 billion or 1096 a share 
during 1988 in the united states the companys profits for 1989 
were down 56 percent indicating that hourly workers will receive 
sharply lower profitsharing checks this spring than the average of 
2800 each received last year 
the company reported yearend revenue of 9615 billion 
compared with 9245 billion the year before 
overseas earnings which have bolstered fords worldwide profit 
for years fell 3 percent in 1989 to 21 billion mainly because 
of increased newproduct development costs 
on tuesday no 3 chrysler corp reported a fourthquarter loss 
of 664 million largely because of a onetime 577million charge 
for two plant closings and the costs of trimming its salaried work 
force by 2300 jobs or 8 percent 
that compared with a 433million profit during the 
fourthquarter of 1988 
for the entire year chrysler posted a 359 million profit 
including the 577million charge in the fourthquarter and a 
onetime 309million profit in the third quarter from sale of

great northern nekoosa corp battling a 
38 billion bid by georgiapacific corp suffered another setback 
today as a federal judge rejected its motion to block the hostile 
offer 
us district judge gene carter rejected great northerns 
arguments made in a hearing monday that its suitor and rival 
paper manufacturer should be stopped for violating federal 
securities laws great northern had accused georgiapacific of 
concealing plans to sell maine mills and woodlands if its bid 
succeeded 
the ruling came as great northern looked for a friendly buyer in 
what georgiapacific called a lastditch effort to resist its offer 
great northern said wednesday its investment banker goldman 
sachs amp co had received inquiries from companies but the firm 
would not say how many comapnies or identify any of them 
great northern said it had directed goldman sachs to seek bids 
higher than georgiapacifics tender offer of 63 a share 
earlier wednesday georgiapacific returned to federal court to 
ensure it was included in the bidding 
although great northern would not identify any of its potential 
buyers one new york securities analyst said the only other 
domestic paper companies that would probably be capable of entering 
the bidding were weyerhaeuser co based in tacoma wash and 
international paper co based in purchase ny 
what i dont know is if there are other companies domestically 
who might be willing to diversify into the paper business said 
sherman chao of salomon brothers inc 
however he added the probability is high that gp will 
prevail 
a weyerhaeuser spokesman had no comment on great northern a 
spokesman for international paper said he did not believe his firm 
has any interest in great northern but even if it did it would 
not comment on any merger talks 
when great northern announced tuesday night that it would seek 
other buyers it also said it was postponing until march 20 a 
previously scheduled march 2 meeting at which its shareholders were 
to consider a georgiapacific proposal to oust the great northern 
board of directors and install candidates nominated by 
georgiapacific 
georgiapacific filed papers in us district court wednesday 
accusing great northern of violating maine corporate law through 
lastditch efforts to manipulate gnns own corporate machinery 
for the benefit of the companys selfinterested management and 
directors 
georgiapacific asked carter to restore the march 2 meeting and 
oversee and supervise the auction for great northern 
great northern also said it had amended its bylaws so that in 
the event georgiapacifics candidates ended up controlling the 
board they still would be forced to use great northerns poison 
pill defense against hostile takeovers a poison pill drives up 
the cost of a hostile bid by allowing great northern to issue extra 
stock at a discount 
there can be no doubt that gnns attempt to restrict the power 
of future directors is in blatant violation of maine statutes and 
wellestablished principles of corporate law georgiapacific 
said 
great northern vowed to contest georgiapacifics challenge

whittle communications said today that more than 
2500 schools have signed up for its commercially sponsored channel 
one news program for the classroom which is scheduled to debut 
nationally on march 5 
christopher whittle chairman of knoxville tennbased media 
company also said the company has sold 200 million in advertising 
for the first three years of the program including about 65 
million for the first year that amounts to about twothirds of the 
revenue that the company hopes to earn from ad sales 
at a news conference whittle said the daily show will be seen 
in 400 schools with 300000 students on the launch date and that 
1000 schools should be showing it by the end of march 
whittle said the number of schools will rise each week as the 
company installs television monitors and other equipment in the 
schools he said was confident of reaching his goal of signing 
7000 to 8000 schools with six million students by december 
whittle who was joined by former us education secretary th 
bell who heads a committee of educators advising channel one and 
others said the service was the most significant educational 
idea that is going on right now 
he said his company had awarded a 900000 grant to the 
university of michigans institute for social research and the firm 
interwest applied research to study channel ones contribiution 
to education over the next three years 
and whittle struck back at critics who say commercialfree 
programming being made available by the cable tv industry is more 
suitable for use in the classroom saying a recent poll his company 
commissioned indicated few students are being exposed to the cable 
programming he blamed lack of equipment and said the channel one 
system alone addresses that issue 
channel one has generated considerable controversy because it 
would include two minutes of commercials within each 12minute 
daily news program critics have said it is wrong to allow 
advertisers to pitch their products in ads to a captive audience of 
teenagers in the classroom 
whittle has argued that teens are exposed to plenty of 
commercial messages every day and that the ads were a fair price to 
pay for getting the news show plus the whittleprovided television 
monitors and other equipment needed to show the program 
state education officials in california and new york have banned 
channel one from their public schools 
the state board of education in north carolina recently 
prohibited schools there from signing up for the program saying in 
part that it forces students to watch commercial advertising that 
decision will not invalidate contracts that about 100 schools in 
the state already have signed to get channel one provided the show 
does not infringe on the 5hour school day but the contracts 
cannot be renewed when they expire 
channel one had originally set a goal of being in 1000 schools 
at the launch date and announced in november that 1050 schools 
had signed up 
equipment installation reportedly began in january 
in september whittle announced it had signed contracts for 51 
million in advertising for the first year of the service more than 
half of its firstyear goal of 90 million in ad revenue 
cynthia kalish samuels a former planning producer for nbcs 
today show was named executive producer of the channel one 
staff in october winter said she has assembled a news staff which 
has begun producing stories

never mind that cigars have become 
passe in americas board rooms and the tobacco industry is under 
siege bill finck isnt about to snuff out the family business 
his grandfather henry william finck started finck cigar co in 
1893 with 1000 he borrowed against a life insurance policy 
establishing a handrolling cigar operation in part of an old house 
automation wasnt added until 1963 my father didnt like 
machines finck 59 explained as he puffed a travis club cigar 
while walking between clanging machines and shoulderhigh tobacco 
crates at the companys downtown san antonio plant 
today the company runs the only automated cigar factory in 
texas or any of 19 other midwest or southwest states the institute 
of texan cultures says 
the factory employs 76 workers who sort tobacco operate cigar 
wrappercutting and fillerpacking machines and oversee cardboard 
box packaging 
it used to be that every big town had its own cigar factory 
finck said i guess there was just too much competition for a lot 
of the little guys 
the dozen members of the cigar association of america account 
for about 90 percent of the 25 billion cigars produced in the 
country each year 
although finck cigar co is not in that elite group the fincks 
dont consider themselves small the company produces millions of 
cigars a year but finck declined to reveal the exact number or 
disclose other financial details 
i dont tell he said weve got to have a little aura of 
mystery surrounding us 
most finck employees are women a cigar factory tradition 
because female hands are said to be more delicate with the 
meticulous work some have devoted their lives to the factory 
liberata fernandez has spent 73 of her 86 years working for the 
fincks fellow worker rafaela sanchez has 72 years of service 
i like everybody around here ms fernandez said its 
easy for me 
finck credits the tobacco blends and techniques the company has 
developed throughout the years with keeping its reputation rolling 
i guess my grandfather knew what he was doing finck said 
nobody can do the combinations that we do 
the travis club brand marketed regionally includes 14 types of 
cigars varying in size quality and cost 
travis club senators are perhaps the most popular while travis 
club churchills thick 7inchers are among the highest quality 
finck said 
the fincks also are concentrating on a mail order business and 
producing cigar combinations requested by other companies 
finck cigar co buys a variety of tobacco for creating the 
blends that go into its products the huge brown tobacco leaves 
are shipped in from such faraway places as brazil honduras and the 
dominican republic as well as from the states of connecticut 
virginia and north carolina 
finck has his own quality control methods 
the most important element is uniformity and the best test is 
to simply look at the tobacco he said but finck also likes to 
burn a spot with his cigar in a tobacco leaf to check the color of 
the ash 
fincks penchant for the tobacco business has influenced his 
27yearold son billy a texas aampm university graduate who helps 
run the cigar company and also enjoys puffing a stogie while 
roaming the factory some of fincks other children also have 
worked there 
i let all of them come and learn how to lay cigar wrappers 
he said i think its good for them they didnt like it too 
much 
finck himself got involved with the cigar business as a child 
and even started chomping on a butt at a young age i smoked the 
first one in front of my parents when i was 8 they thought it was 
cute 
though the cigar company occupies much of his time finck also 
has been involved in ranching and is a lawyer he keeps a set of 
law books in his cigar factory office and does legal work related 
to investorowned water utilities 
long known as a political maverick finck served in the texas 
legislature from 1967 to 1972 and became chairman of the powerful 
house appropriations committee when redistricting took effect in 
1972 finck lost his office in a democratic runoff 
that didnt keep him out of politics he later ran for county 
treasurer with the promise of abolishing the office he won he 
kept the promise setting fire to one of his paychecks with what 
else a cigar 
politics and making cigars kind of blend together finck 
said

for the dreaded stb the 
czech acronym for the now disbanded secret police zak is under 
orders to stay home while an interior ministry commission mulls his 
fate 
in keeping with the philosophy of love and dignity preached by 
president havel its a mild punishment for years of repression zak 
helped carry out under the communist government 
the routine leaves zak and countless other former functionaries 
across eastern europe hours to ponder the fate that has wrenched 
power from their hands 
a year ago the burly balding zak confidently rasped out 
testimony that sent havel to jail for four months on charges of 
obstructing a police official in an interview with the associated 
press zak seemed deflated 
seated in his neat apartment in a shabby block on the outskirts 
of prague he groped to describe the change that has torn him from 
the 20 years of intelligence work he clearly relished 
it was a bit of a shock he finally conceded during an 
hourlong interview 
when unrest broke out after the nov 17 police attack on 
peaceful students some official structures did not act at all 
some went beyond their authority and the result was what 
happened he said 
as head of a 30member department dealing with what he calls 
extremism in independent initiatives zak was among those who 
best knew havel foreign minister jiri dienstbier and an array of 
other dissidents catapulted by revolution into positions of power 
in his classic bolshevik we lostthey won view this 
transformation was less surprising for zak than for a startled 
world watching czechoslovakias rapid makeover 
he had long gathered information by interrogating the 
dissidents listening to informers who he insists were unpaid 
and conducting surveillance easily observed by every visitor to 
dissidents homes 
zak claimed the dissidents long ago drew up a schedule of 
events for 1989 that foresaw the eventual assumption of power and 
hes sure things wouldnt have happened so fast without certain 
international support for his opponents 
there were a few mistakes on the communists side too he 
admitted one was a failure publicly to acknowledge or perhaps 
even play upon differences between the various dissident groups 
another was that we were forced more and more to carry out 
preventive measures and not our own intelligence work 
it was during these preventive measures the only term zak 
used to describe detention or interrogation that he spent hours 
in discussion with havel dienstbier and others puffing on 
petra cigarettes the cheap brand smoked by all three men 
if they had something constructive to say or something i 
didnt know before i was ready to accept or tolerate it zak 
said 
why then was no public action taken to open dialogue with the 
dissidents ask the politicians zak replied 
zak believes the communists should and will play a significant 
role in czechoslovakia he refused to talk about differences among 
the former leaders over what to do about the dissidents saying 
only that four groups fought for control 
equally loyally he refused to criticize the decision on jan 
16 1989 to arrest havel zak was one of those who detained the 
playwright after a small demonstration on wenceslas square which 
havel observed without taking part 
the arrest finally drove thousands of intellectuals who had 
refused to side openly with the dissidents into signing petitions 
for havels release 
it was the start of a revolt that moved with furious pace after 
nov 17 
many former communist functionaries have found th changes 
unbearable 
at least six people closely associated with the old rulers 
including two policemen and former slovak communist leader viliam 
salgovic long reputed to be a kgb agent have committed suicide 
since the revolution 
scattered reports in state media indicate many communists are 
being fired and finding it hard to get work at even the most menial 
tasks 
zak said his children met some resentment at school when they 
refused to join in certain actions of protest of the authorities 
and i suppose he said i was also punished by what is 
happening to me

barbary pirates once lurked along egypts 
coast to plunder mediterranean shipping their modernday 
counterparts lurk in egyptian video stores plundering us 
copyrights 
videocassette piracy has gotten so bad in egypt that the united 
states has warned it will respond with trade sanctions unless the 
violations stop by april 
egypt is among a few us trading partners like taiwan south 
korea and thailand that because of video piracy risk retaliation 
under the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 
egyptians in the purloined video trade said the americans are 
concerned particularly about egypt because of its history as a 
cultural trendsetter for the arabs 
in egyptian video shops every us film is pirated said 
walid nasser an antipiracy official of the motion picture export 
association of america who has a special office in egypt 
some video dealers said the high cost of going legal could put 
them out of business but that is no justification for piracy in 
the view of us ambassador frank g wisner who recently warned 
that the problem has become an important issue on the egyptianus 
agenda 
wisner said by 1986 video piracy already was costing the us 
film industry 23 million a year in egypt where the business began 
in the early 1980s 
cairos video shops and small rental clubs are crammed with 
grade b american movies with titles ranging from magnificent 
warriors to fists of steel favorites in workingclass and 
rural areas 
but more exclusive video rental shops like those in the citys 
swank sporting clubs frequented by expatriates and the egyptian 
elite offer tapes of the latest hollywood films often just 
released in the united states 
many are of abysmal technical quality that reveal bootleg 
copying and the work of moslem egypts sexconscious film censor 
is intrusive 
but the price is attractive generally the equivalent of 1 or 
less for two nights rental and a censored scratchy batman or 
indiana jones remains a blockbuster 
dealing in such pirated videos violates an international 
convention on copyrights that cairo signed in 1977 but egypts 
laws protecting films books and intellectual properties are 
outdated and ineffectual providing for penalties no higher than 
40 or three months in jail for repeat offenders 
if fines are strong enough and if someone is taken to court 
and put in jail he wont do it again said the motion picture 
export associations nasser but the law as it is has no teeth 
a tough proposal to amend egypts 1954 law on intellectual 
property has been in the works for two years it would penalize 
piracy with fines of up to 4000 and three years in prison 
despite us pressure the amendment has yet to be taken up by 
parliament because of other legislation that members consider more 
pressing 
ambassador wisner appearing at a seminar with videopiracy 
fighter nasser warned that egypt risks joining at least seven 
other countries on the priority watch list of governments lax 
on piracy he said hollywoods annual worldwide losses to piracy 
are estimated at about 1 billion 
wisner said the united states invokes trade sanctions only if 
the situation is grave it is very important to the united states 
sanctions could mean barriers to egyptian textiles in the us 
market for example which would be a major blow us figures show 
such exports to the united states have been doubling each year 
since 1986 and now total more than 120 million a year 
under the competitiveness act the office of us trade 
representative carla a hills must tell congress by april what 
egypt is doing to fight video piracy wisner said 
egypt organized an antipiracy squad a decade ago but the group 
of a dozen tax department officers assigned to regulate 3000 video 
dealers nationwide is considered a symbol of weak enforcement 
its leader brig hussein abdelrahman denied nassers 
contention that all us films are pirated but conceded that at 
least 60 percent probably were the rest are transferred legally 
from 35mm film onto videotape by production companies with legally 
purchased copyrights he said 
moreover only 20 percent of the 300 piracy cases filed in 1989 
involved american and other foreign films he said 
we are not encouraging or neglecting piracy he said 
unless a film producer complains to us we dont have the means 
to control every video store and club

ibm unveiled a line of computer workstations 
thursday that the company says outperform and underprice the 
competition and should help it snare a major stake in a 
fastgrowing market where it never had success 
the opportunity is big its growing at over 30 percent a 
year and its mostly a new opportunity for ibm said president 
jack d kuehler 
the machines called the risc system6000 also mark the first 
time that the worlds largest computer maker has wholeheartedly 
embraced the unix computer operating system that is fast becoming 
the industry standard 
international business machines corp also announced its 
intention to provide ways to link the new machines with ibm 
computers that run on its proprietary operating system 
an operating system is software that controls basic computer 
functions such as executing commands from the keyboard and opening 
computer files 
kuehler told a news conference that the new machines designed 
for use by engineers outperform the newest and best that our 
competitors offer 
ibm announced four highperformance workstations and five 
fileservers which are used to link computers in a network the 
machines range in price from about 13000 to more than 74000 
ibm said the lowestprice model is the most powerful desktop 
workstation on the market beating the offering of sun microsystems 
inc considered the workstation leader the ibm model performs 
275 million instructions per second or mips compared with 125 
mips for the sun model it also is slightly cheaper than suns 
industry analysts say the workstations are impressive for their 
performance pricing and features 
from the customer standpoint i think its going to get ibm 
into the door in ways it didnt before said peter burris an 
analyst for international data corp in framingham mass 
workstations are desktop or sideofdesk machines that are much 
more powerful than personal computers some even match the power of 
mainframes they are used for such processingintensive tasks as 
threedimensional computer modeling of new products 
the workstation market is small but is among the 
fastestgrowing computer segments and uses for the machines are 
expanding 
a lot of things start in the scientific market and gravitate 
out toward other markets said barry bosak an analyst for smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
ibm introduced a workstation line several years ago the rt 
line but it captured less than 3 percent of market experts 
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced 
we made a mistake kuehler said in an interview 
the workstation field is dominated by sun digital equipment 
corp and hewlettpackard co 
unix developed by american telephone amp telegraph co allows 
machines from different manufacturers to work together until now 
ibm had promoted its own operating systems basing the workstations 
on unix shows ibm is serious about this market kuehler said in the 
interview 
it also is recognition of the huge library of unixbased 
software available for workstations he said 
the machines are based on ibms own version of unix called aix 
but are a new generation of the operating system analysts said the 
new aix is even more compatible with industry standards 
unixbased applications programs the software that provides 
the actual uses of computers such as word processing must be 
rewritten for aix 
ibm has been working with software companies for some time to 
develop programs for the new machines by the end of the year 
about 1500 application programs worldwide will be available it 
said 
ibms embrace of unix has broad implications for the operating 
standard said louise rehling a senior vice president at spss 
inc a chicago software company that was among those recruited 
we think ibm is going to bring a lot of credibility to the 
unix markeplace she said the size of the pie will grow as 
well as the ibm share 
like the older ibm workstations the new models are based on 
reducedinstructionset computing technology or risc which 
simplifies the circuitry of a computers central processor to 
increase speed and offer cost savings but ibm said the risc system 
in the new machines is greatly improved 
shipments of the workstations will begin within 90 days ibm 
said 
bosak said the workstations would have little shortterm impact 
on ibms earnings but they represent an important signal that the 
company is working to improve its fortunes 
last month ibm reported its 1989 profit slipped 35 percent from 
the year before the company also has embarked on a costcutting 
program that involves the elimination of thousands of jobs

embattled great northern nekoosa corp 
suffered another setback thursday as a federal judge refused to 
block georgiapacific corps 38 billion hostile bid for the 
rival paper company 
great northern argued in a hearing on monday that the 63 a 
share tender offer should be stopped because georgiapacific 
executives lied about plans to sell great northerns assets in 
maine if the merger goes through 
great northern also asked us district judge gene carter to 
halt georgiapacifics efforts to oust the great northern board in 
a proxy fight saying the purported coverup violated federal 
securities laws and as a result its suitor should not be allowed 
to continue the proxy battle 
carter refused saying in a 20page ruling great northern had 
not proved any of its charges 
not only has great northern failed to meet its burden of 
showing that georgiapacific had a plan to divest great northern 
assets which would make its securities and exchange commission 
filings and other public statements untrue but there is 
significant evidence suggesting that georgiapacific affirmatively 
decided not to develop or adopt such a plan the judge wrote 
great northern had not had time to study the ruling so had no 
immediate comment spokesman stephen m hill said thursday from the 
companys headquarters in norwalk conn 
atlantabased georgiapacific has steadfastly denied any plans 
to sell the great northern mills in millinocket and east 
millinocket or great northerns 21 million acres of the northern 
maine woods 
but great northern produced various memos and notes that it 
claimed showed georgiapacific has been considering the acquisition 
of great northern since at least 1984 and selling the maine assets 
were always part of its strategy 
georgiapacific accused great northern of forming its arguments 
out of isolated snippets of information in response to great 
northerns charges georgiapacific produced affidavits and 
depositions from 14 witnesses including georgiapacific 
executives bankers and consultants 
all the documents disputed great northerns contentions about 
georgiapacifics plans 
great northern said the testimony produced by the witnesses 
could not be believed because it appeared to contradict the memos 
and notes which were written before possible sales of the maine 
assets became an issue in the state 
carter dismissed that argument saying since notes are by 
their very nature abbreviated and sometimes cryptic an explanation 
of them is often helpful to the court in determining their 
significance 
carter went on to say he was satisfied that the affidavits 
accurately reflect georgiapacifics intent because all the 
evidence indicates that georgiapacific strongly resisted an asset 
sales plan as part of the financing package 
great northerns latest defeat came two days after it announced 
it had begun soliciting buyers who would offer more than 
georgiapacifics 63 per share 
securities analysts said great northern realized it had lost its 
battle to remain independent because of a ruling from the court 
last week that would make it easier for georgiapacific to oust the 
great northern directors 
great northern would not comment on any of its potential buyers 
hill said thursday

gillette co said thursday its 1989 earnings grew 
6 percent compared with the year before while fourthquarter 
earnings climbed 29 percent for the worlds leading razorblade 
maker 
in the quarter ended dec 31 gillette had earnings of 794 
million or 68 cents a share compared with 615 million or 63

the company said sales in its north atlantic division which 
covers north america and europe were moderately higher for 
1989 while the operating profit was virtually unchanged 
dave fausch a gillette spokesman said the profit for this 
division was hurt by the performance of the companys toiletry 
products in december the company realigned its toiletry 
operations merging them with the shaving division gillette also 
has sold some personal care product lines in europe 
fausch said gillette is encouraged about 1990 as the company 
promotes its new sensor razor which was introduced last month with 
much fanfare the hightech razor priced higher than previous 
models is designed to offer a closer shave 
the sensor is part of gillettes strategy to persuade customers 
to switch from disposable brands to higherpriced razors with 
replaceable blades

initiative

supplies said andrew lebow senior broker and analyst for

however energy brokers said the markets continued to rally in 
heavy trading even after news that the volcano might have only a 
minor impact on supplies around cook inlet but would not affect the 
crucial prudhoe bay supplies or the alaska pipeline 
traders attributed the strength in products to refinery

profits plunged by 50 percent at general motors 
corp and by 729 percent at ford motor co in the fourth quarter 
as the nations biggest automakers on thursday showed the impact of 
slow sales and costly buyer incentives 
the quarterly results completed a sharp drop in annual earnings 
for the nations big three automakers which have been struggling 
with an industrywide slump that has prompted plant closings and 
thousands of layoffs 
autoworkers will get more bad news this spring the decline in 
profits at gm ford and chrysler corp which on tuesday posted a 
664 million net loss for the fourth quarter will mean little or 
no annual profit sharing payments this year 
gm posted a 7002 million profit in the three months ended dec 
31 down from 14 billion in the same quarter of 1988 gms 
fourthquarter earnings tumbled to 101 per share of common stock 
compared with 212 the year before 
gms total sales and revenue during the octoberdecember 
quarter including nonautomotive subsidiaries fell to 3136 
billion from 3243 billion a year earlier 
ford reported fourthquarter profit of 314 million or 68 cents 
a share compared with 116 billion or 242 a share in the 
yearearlier quarter fords quarterly revenue in its automotive 
and financial services businesses amounted to 2415 billion 
compared with 2391 billion in 1988 
ford earnings decline reflected a 424 million loss linked to 
the sale of its rouge steel co subsidiary but even without that 
factor fourthquarter earnings were down 363 percent 
industrywide car and truck sales fell sharply when the 1990 
model year began in october mainly because of reduced buyer 
incentives and higher prices for the new vehicles 
throughout november and december auto companies funneled money 
into incentive programs which comes directly out of profits in 
an attempt to halt the slide 
compounding the problems the big three faced swelling 
inventories and prepared to lay off thousands of auto workers 
during the first quarter of this year those layoffs largely have 
been accomplished and inventories of unsold vehicles have shrunk 
from a 91sellingday level at years end to 70 days at the end of 
january 
ford treasurer david mccammon said the company spent an average 
of 800 in incentives for every car and truck it sold in the fourth 
quarter slightly more than double the figure for the yearearlier 
quarter 
he said that on dec 31 ford was spending about 1000 on 
incentives for each of its vehicles 
as production and inventories get more in line with demand 
mccammon said automakers should be able to rely less on incentives 
to control newcar inventory and sales 
for the first time since 1985 gms annual earnings outpaced 
those of no 2 ford 
gms annual profit fell 131 percent to 422 billion on total 
corporate revenue of 12693 billion compared with a profit of 
486 billion on revenue of 12364 billion in 1988 annual 
earnings per gm common share dropped to 633 from 717 
gms major subsidiaries reported earnings wednesday general 
motors acceptance corp and gm hughes electronics corp reported 
declines but electronic data systems corp said its profit grew 
with added dataservices customers 
fords annual earnings fell 276 percent to 384 billion or 
822 a share from 53 billion or 1096 a share during 1988 
annual revenue rose to 9615 billion from 9245 billion 
chrysler on tuesday said it lost 664 million in the fourth 
quarter mainly because of a onetime 577 million charge for plant 
closings and costs of cutting jobs from its whitecollar work 
force chrysler posted a profit of 433 million in fourth quarter 
1988 
chryslers annual profit plummeted 658 percent to 359 million 
each of the automakers said their performances in the united 
states suffered last year meaning no profit sharing for chrysler 
hourly workers no bonuses for the companys salaried employees and 
sharply lower profitsharing payments to hourly workers at gm and 
ford 
last year chrysler handed out an average of 720 to hourly 
workers gm gave out an average of 265 per worker and fords 
hourly employees got an average of 2800 apiece 
gm said thursday afternoon it would distribute profitsharing 
checks of about 50 apiece to its 443000 us salaried and hourly 
employees 
ford said it would make a profitsharing announcement friday 
united auto workers union vice president ernie lofton head of 
the unions ford department said while workers welcome profit 
sharing in any amount whats far more important to them and 
their union is securing existing jobs and creating new union jobs 
in us ford factories 
uaw contracts with each of the big three expire at midnight 
sept 14 and union leaders have said job security will be a top 
issue

the federated and allied retailing companies 
are making progress luring merchandise suppliers back during the 
chains bankruptcy reorganizations but sales have declined their 
president said thursday 
sales for the 260 stores that federated department stores inc 
and allied stores corp operate in 28 states were up 3 percent in 
december from the previous year but declined 9 percent in january 
and 4 percent in february said james m zimmerman president and 
chief operating officer of federated and allied 
were going to have a very poor fourth quarter zimmerman 
told reporters referring to the fiscal quarter than ended feb 3 
zimmerman declined to be more specific january sales figures 
will be released march 5 while fiscal fourthquarter and yearend 
results are to be released may 3 company spokeswoman carol sanger 
said 
under an ideal scenario federated and allied could emerge from 
their chapter 11 reorganizations in eight months said g william 
miller the former us treasury secretary hired jan 16 as 
chairman and chief executive officer of federated stores inc the 
newly created parent of federated and allied 
the two retailers filed jan 15 for bankruptcy protection from 
creditors listing 77 billion in debts 
miller addressing reporters with zimmerman and new 
federatedallied chairman allen i questrom said his optimistic 
projection could occur if federated and allied develop 
reorganization plans within the 120 days they are allowed the 
exclusive right to do so and creditors and the us bankruptcy 
court give quick approval to them 
but miller said i dont promise you that thats possible or 
even feasible 
he described both companies as viable and profitable but said 
they must adjust the staggering debts amassed when parent campeau 
corp of toronto acquired allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 
the capital structure is whats broke and is what brings us 
here today zimmerman said 
the chapter 11 filings have noticeably hurt confidence of 
customers and merchandise suppliers but federated and allied are 
making progress and are now receiving about 85 percent of the goods 
they order 
in the weeks prior to the jan 15 filing the stores were 
receiving only about 25 percent of their orders with merchants 
refusing to ship the rest zimmerman said 
the bankruptcy courts approval last friday of interim financing 
provided a critical boost for the two companies questrom said the 
court approved 700 million in debtorinpossession financing and 
17 billion in funds to allow the chargecard subsidiaries of 
allied and federated to buy chargecard accounts from the chains 
giving them a cash infusion 
questrom lured away from the neimanmarcus chain feb 2 with a 
fiveyear contract that will pay him 12 million annually said 
federated and allied face a challenge in trying to maintain market 
share against financially healthy competitors 
questrom said he will focus on luring back more of federated and 
allieds vendors and in adjusting merchandise inventories to keep 
customers coming in 
zimmerman said he expects no acrosstheboard layoffs among the 
combined 100000 federated and allied employees the companies have 
suffered no major employee losses because of the chapter 11 
filings but need to work on retaining employees questrom said 
i think the ball is in our court to run the kind of company 
where our employees want to work zimmerman said

occidental petroleum corps 91yearold chief 
armand hammer will be replaced as chairman by company president 
ray r irani if hammer retires or dies occidental announced 
thursday 
the los angelesbased petrochemical giant said however that 
the imperious hammer has no immediate plans to step aside 
the announcement said hammer is in very good health 
following heart surgery in november and the death of his wife 
frances in december he plans to continue as chairman and chief 
executive for the indefinite future it said 
irani 55 has been widely expected to replace hammer who has 
tried to emphasize in the past few years that occidental would be 
able to hold steady without him 
irani was named president and chief operating officer of 
occidental in august 1984 leaping over 14 other executive vice 
presidents after just 14 months at occidental he replaced hammers 
former heirdesignate a robert abboud who quit during a power 
struggle after four years on the job 
speculators believing occidental to be likely a takeover target 
without hammer at its head have repeatedly bid up its stock price 
on rumors and reports of ill health most recently following the 
implantation of a heart pacemaker in hammers chest in november it 
edged up 87 cents thursday in heavy trading on the new york stock 
exchange to 2825 per share 
hammer and irani declined interview requests asked about the 
timing of the announcement occidental spokesman frank ashley said 
this action was taken to put to rest any rumors about succession 
at occidental 
it was solely dr hammers suggestion to dispel any rumors 
ashley said noting that hammer who prides himself as a private 
ambassador for peace continues his globetrotting 
he was just in the soviet union ashley said he is 
keeping a full schedule and his health is fine 
when hammer attended a republican fundraiser feb 6 featuring 
president george bush he showed up at the century plaza hotel in 
los angeles in a wheelchair looking frail and raising his arm to 
acknowledge reporters he was wheeled around a secret service metal 
detector to a private reception he didnt speak to reporters 
hammer said he had requested that occidentals directors name 
irani his successor to provide for an orderly future management 
succession 
during iranis 5 years as president occidental has shifted its 
focus from foreign oil operations to domestic it has grown from 
revenues of 156 billion in 1985 to 201 billion in 1989 growth 
hammer attributed largely to irani 
results at occidentals chemical division which irani has 
headed since joining the company in 1983 improved from a loss of 
38 million on sales of 17 billion that year to 1989 earnings of 
more than 1 billion on sales of 52 billion 
ray irani has clearly earned this unanimous vote of confidence 
by the occidental board hammer said in a statement 
irani born in beirut lebanon has a phd in chemistry and 
began his career as a research scientist he came to occidental 
from olin corp where he was president joining occidental as 
chairman and chief executive of its occidental chemical corp 
subsidiary

federatedallied department store executives 
told creditors thursday that the companies didnt deceive them 
about the financial crisis that precipitated the biggest bankruptcy 
filing in retailing history 
but the executives said they doubted all the 77 billion in 
debt listed in their bankruptcy filings would be fully repaid 
much of the debt resulted from the junkbondfinanced takeovers 
of federated department stores inc and allied stores corp last 
decade by the campeau corp of canada a real estate developer 
g william miller chairman of the newly formed parent company 
federated stores inc and the top executives of the two retailers 
which operate 260 stores in 28 states spoke to creditors and 
reporters at a special meeting 
they sought to reassure creditors about the ultimate repayment 
of the debt but were cautious 
some of it will have to disappear miller said for those 
who hold the debt the market is no longer there we want them to 
get a reasonable recovery 
miller federatedallied chairman allen questrom and president 
james zimmerman read prepared statements and didnt answer 
questions 
zimmerman told the creditors that by september 1989 it was 
evident to senior managers that federated and allied could not meet 
their debt payments and that major financial restructuring was 
necessary 
but he said the decision to file for bankruptcy court protection 
was made in january to prevent further erosion in the value of the 
businesses 
there was no plot to deceive any creditors there was no grand 
scheme in toronto or elsewhere to trick anybody zimmerman said 
we regret that any of our creditors were left holding the bag 
with checks that did not clear prior to our filing 
it is my personal goal as well as our corporate expectations 
that the reorganization plan to be developed will maximize the 
return to all creditors 
i hope that all of our trade creditors will be paid in full 
and we anticipate working with all of our creditors toward that 
objective 
zimmerman pledged to creditors you will find us to be open 
honest and straightforward 
miller a former us secretary of the treasury said he assumed 
leadership last month of the parent company campeau us on 
condition that it be renamed and assured autonomy distancing 
itself from robert campeau the canadian real estate developer who 
engineered the debtfinanced takeovers of allied and federated

the united mine workers said thursday it 
will let its 1700 striking miners vote on a contract with pittston 
coal group rather than wait for a final ruling on 64 million in 
fines against the union 
the union had previously said it would withhold a rankandfile 
vote until all legal action taken against the umw for its strike 
tactics was resolved 
the union will continue to defend the interests of our members 
and the organization in the courts but will no longer defer the 
ratification vote umw president richard trumka said thursday 
our members at pittston fought long and hard to secure this 
tentative agreement and it is their right to see it and vote on 
it 
the tentative contract was reached new years eve with the help 
of william usery a mediator appointed by labor secretary elizabeth 
dole 
the result of the secret balloting monday should be known 
tuesday more than two years after the expiration of the old 
contract and 11 months after the start of the bitter strike by 
miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
the union and company have withheld the terms of the settlement 
but sources familiar with the agreement said the union won 
concessions on the two biggest concerns job security and health 
and retirement benefits 
the pittson strike drew wide attention because of the use of 
mass sitdown demonstrations to block coal trucks because the 
union contended pittston was attempting to break the union the 
sparked sympathetic wildcat strikes during the summer involving 
46000 umw members from appalachia and the midwest 
between 150 and 200 union district and local leaders began 
hearing details of the contract from umw officials thursday 
evening there were extensive questions about the tentative 
agreement which several miners refused to discuss in detail 
it takes a long time to go through it article by article and 
there are some new things in it said mike buckner director of 
research in the unions washington office 
we tried to go as slow as members want us to explain 
everything in the contract buckner said there are new job 
opportunity benefits in there and there are a lot of questions 
about that 
buckner declined to discuss any further details about the 
agreement the union wants to give the miners an opportunity to see 
the contract before releasing it to the media he said 
when the settlement was announced jan 1 trumka said a 
ratification vote would hinge on the settlement of all legal action 
connected with the strike 
on monday however circuit judge donald mcglothlin refused to 
dismiss 64 million in fines for hundred of violations of 
courtordered strike restrictions 
the wheels of justice are turning slowly in certain courts 
and our members at pittston have waited long enough trumka said 
thursday 
mcglothlin rejected arguments made by attorneys for the union 
and the company which joined in the motion to drop the fines and 
he refused the unions offer of 10000 hours of community service 
however he gave the attorneys 10 days to come up with another 
proposal to clear the contemptofcourt fines 
on wednesday us district judge glen williams agreed to reduce 
the fines he levied from 960000 to 280000

mesa limited partnership the oil and gas 
operation run by t boone pickens blamed lower natural gas prices 
and higher interest rates for losses in the fourth quarter and all 
of 1989 
the company which in december suspended quarterly payments to 
unitholders said it lost 4267 million or 25 cents a unit on 
revenues of 7784 million in the three months ended dec 31 
that compares with a profit of 1326 million or 14 cents a 
unit on 8185 million in revenues in the same 1988 quarter 
for the year mesa lost 6302 million or 24 cents a unit 
compared with profits of 4609 million or 52 cents in 1988 
revenues fell to 35602 million last year from 1988s 37061 
million 
the annual figures include gains from sale of oil and gas 
properties of 29 million last year and 13 million in 1988 
in december pickens said the company would quit paying its 
375cent quarterly distribution to maintain financial integrity 
while gas prices remain low 
in addition pickens said mesa would package its holdings in the 
hugoton natural gas field into a separate trust and sell shares to 
raise 300 million to help pay down its 15 billion in longterm 
debt 
previously mesa had maintained payments on units which are 
akin to common stock dividends by a corporation even though 
earnings from its oil and gas business didnt support the 
distribution 
instead the company made payments from profits gained on 
pickens celebrated stock forays against such companies as gulf oil 
corp phillips petroleum co and unocal 
mesa said it earned 501 million on securities last year 
compared with 201 million in 1988

a federal agency has ordered limited 
service be maintained on the delaware amp hudson railway until a 
hearing late this week to consider a plan to keep the ailing 
railroad running a bankruptcy trustee said 
damph the nations oldest continually operating railway had 
faced a midnight deadline to begin shutting down before the order 
was issued 
francis p dicello damph trustee said he had not seen late 
wednesdays order by the interstate commerce commission but was 
told it called for reduced service for 48 hours until a hearing 
friday to consider a proposal to allow two other railways to run 
damph for at least 30 days 
no other officials could be reached late wednesday to comment on 
the order 
the new york susquehanna and western railroad submitted a 
proposal earlier wednesday to operate damph for at least 30 days 
according to ken willsey spokesman for delaware otsego corp 
parent of new york susquehanna 
the proposal has the backing of the federal railroad 
administration 
weve been fighting to try to save the railroad for weeks 
now said gil carmichael federal railroad administrator 
the icc designated new york susquehanna to operate damph after the 
rail line filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988 
creditors have about 100 million in claims against the railroad 
damph faced a shutdown after the collapse tuesday of a planned 
sale of the railway to canadian pacific ltd 
an emergency hearing was held in us bankruptcy court in 
wilmington wednesday to decide damphs fate 
cp had agreed to purchase damph for 35 million but pulled out of 
the deal after failing to agree to terms with conrail on the use of 
conrail tracks that connect with damph lines 
in the absence of a purchase agreement and with no pending bids 
wednesday dicello said officials would begin shutting down damph if 
the icc did not grant a reprieve a complete shutdown would take 
four to five days according to stanley samorajczyk an attorney 
for dicello 
plans then would be made to begin selling off damphs assets 
walter rich president and chief executive officer of new york 
susquehanna said if the rail line was allowed to continue to 
operate it could provide service to 99 percent of its shippers 
canadian national railroad said it would help cover some of 
damphs operating costs if the new york susequehanna plan was 
approved canadian national tried to bid for damph but lost financial 
backing for its offer last week 
delaware otsego was among five earlier bidders who lost out in 
january when dicello selected canadian pacifics bid for damph 
carmichael said he was encouraged by the partnership between 
canadian national and new york susquehanna to keep damph running 
he declined to speculate on whether either company would make a 
new offer but noted that rich wanted to buy damph for a long time 
and cn wanted to be a player in it 
damph which began in 1824 as a canal company runs 20 to 25 
trains daily in new york maryland pennsylvania new jersey and 
quebec it owns 550 miles of track and has traffic rights to 
another 1000 willsey said 
a shutdown would put 672 employees out of work and eliminate the 
hope of return for 100 to 150 others on furlough he said

just over a year ago pinstriped investment 
bankers from drexel burnham lambert inc were zipping in and out of 
the tiny town of omak helping employees finance a 50 million 
buyout of their lumber mill 
now that the once cocksure investment house has filed for 
bankruptcy protection the workers who become owners and saved 
their jobs through drexels skills expressed sympathy for for the 
firms plight 
they were really a humanoriented company with us lloyd 
groomes head of the local lumber and sawmill workers union said 
wednesday they got on board right at the first and joined in 
with us 
the deal to purchase omak wood products inc was financed by 
junk bonds and loans to be repaid from future earnings the workers 
made no down payment and the plant itself was put up for security 
at the time drexel touted the deal as the first in which 
workers bought a healthy company using a significant amount of 
highyield highrisk junk bonds for financing the firm promoted 
junk bonds as a way to provide financing for ventures like employee 
buyouts that traditionally have had a hard time getting funding 
through banks or the stock market 
ironically drexels filing for protection under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws on tuesday was the result of a cash 
shortage triggered largely by a sharp drop in value of its own 
holdings of junk bonds 
drexels filing may put a temporary hold on future debtfinanced 
employee buyouts like the one at omak one banking analyst 
predicted 
this has to have a chilling effect in the short term said 
jay tejera of dain bosworth inc in seattle but you wont see 
the pendulum swing all the way back to where equity is preferential 
and leveraged capital is impossible to find 
the employee buyout in december 1988 capped a sixmonth blitz in 
which drexel which pioneered the use of junk bonds to finance 
takeovers and buyouts convinced british financier sir james 
goldsmith that the 630 employees of omak wood products were serious 
buyers goldsmith had acquired the mill as part of his 1985 
takeover of crown zellerbach co 
drexel provided a 50 million bridge loan to finance the deal 
until the employees could obtain permanent funding it also 
provided the business expertise mill workers lacked 
pat flanagan a vice president of the investment bank still 
serves on the mills board of directors groomes said 
without the help of drexel the omak plant would have been sold 
by goldsmith to one of several corporations interested in the 
profitable company groomes said 
the mill the largest employer in the town of 4000 located 150 
miles north of yakima had been sold three times to outoftown 
owners in the previous 32 years each sale resulted in job cuts at 
the plant which once had 1200 employees groomes said 
when workers got word in the summer of 1988 that another sale 
was coming they organized and groomes contacted drexel asking for 
help in financing an employee buyout 
soon drexel employees were jetting into spokane and driving the 
150 miles to omak he said 
they gave sir james a letter to assure him we wasnt 
whistling in the dark groomes said they said theyd 
underwrite 35 million before he considered us a serious bidder 
drexel eventually put up the 35 million purchase price plus 
nearly 15 million in operating expenses that money carried the 
employees until they were able to secure permanent bank financing 
just three months ago said bill kenny human resource manager at 
the mill 
were saddened by their current financial status kenny 
said we fully realize that we as an esop employee stock 
ownership plan would not be here without the help of drexel 
burnham 
were doing real well above our expectations groomes said 
of the company 
finding someone to do similar employee buyouts in the future may 
be difficult tejera said 
a lot of those deals are done already he said you dont 
have a backlog of deals to do 
but the technique remains sound especially in mature businesses 
that generate cash and dont have high research and development and 
capital costs he said 
tejera predicted that insurance companies pension funds and 
midsized regional banks would step into the void left by drexel

drexel burnham lambert group inc owes money 
from california to the bank of china but two of its largest 
potential creditors dont appear in court papers indicted junk 
bond maven michael milken and the federal government 
drexel does not consider milken who is believed to be owed more 
than 200 million by his former employer to be a legitimate 
creditor steven anreder a spokesman for the firm said wednesday 
largely responsible for drexels lightning growth in the 1980s 
milken left the firm last june after he was charged in a 98count 
federal fraud and racketeering indictment milken claims he is owed 
back compensation and payment for drexel stock that was required to 
sell back to the company 
drexel last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to 
pay 650 million to settle related charges 
but drexel still owes 150 million of the settlement to a 
securities and exchange commission fund established to repay 
investors who can prove they were harmed by drexels actions sec 
enforcement director william mclucas confirmed drexel owes the 
money but declined to comment further 
as drexel began to dismantle an operation that once was the envy 
of wall street fears that the collapse would cause turmoil in the 
nations stock bond and commodities markets proved unfounded 
prices of junk bonds rallied for a second straight day 
government bonds dipped only slightly and stock prices were stable 
i think the streets breathing a sign of relief that there 
seems to be an orderly liquidation said lewis glucksman vice 
chairman of smith barney harris upham amp co 
drexel was no longer the single dominant figure in junks when 
this happened he said thats one reason the street has been 
able to take his with equanimity there was no market they were 
going to rock apart 
drexel continued to shop its businesses around liquidate its 
securities holdings and plan benefits for thousands of employees 
likely to be fired 
bitter workers accused the company of concealing its problems 
security guards prevented many employees from taking personal 
belongings out of drexels new york headquarters 
maybe about a week and a half ago we had management telling us 
that even though times were hard at drexel they were the same 
troubles the rest of the street was having a drexel junk bond 
professional in new york said bear with us they said 
the parent company of drexel burnham lambert inc filed for 
chapter 11 protection from creditors late tuesday drexel already 
has liquidated billions of dollars worth of government securities 
junk bonds and other securities and is peddling entire divisions 
to other wall street firms 
its not clear whether it will find any buyers though unlike 
manufacturing companies that own plants and inventories an 
investment banks main assets are its people and client 
relationships with confidence in drexels ability to conduct 
business shattered its possible no buyers will step forward 
a lot of things that supposedly had worth as an entity become 
liabilities said a top executive at a competing wall street 
firm any buyer knows theres a forced seller on the other side 
drexel which financed some of the biggest corporate takeovers 
of the 1980s collapsed because of a cash shortage caused by a 
steep fall in value of its billiondollar junk bond portfolio and 
an erosion of confidence after the firm admitted to securities 
crimes 
they were terribly unprepared for this said a former drexel 
senior executive who still has close ties to the firm 
insiders said drexel failed to make even the most mundane 
preparations for the bankruptcy filing the firms new york car 
service refused to accept drexel vouchers for fear they wouldnt 
get paid at drexels beverly hills calif office one executive 
had to pay for a plane ticket personally to get to a meeting 
because drexels travel agency refused to extend credit 
drexels case will be handled by judge howard c buschman iii 
45 who has been on the bankruptcy bench since 1983 
the parent company listed liabilities of 289 billion and 
assets of 37 billion in the petition for bankruptcy court 
reorganization including subsidiaries total debt exceeds 3 
billion the papers show 
the filing affects only the parent company not the securities 
subsidiary under federal bankruptcy law brokerdealers are 
ineligible for chapter 11 reorganization 
drexel officials have made clear though that its securities 
business wont survive after the firms holdings of stocks and 
bonds are sold 
the largest unsecured creditor listed in the filing is taiyo 
mutual life of tokyo owed 697 million others include the state 
of californias retirement system at 25 million and bank of china 
at 20 million 
resumes and phone calls from drexel workers flooded other wall 
street firms executives reported drexel has not formally laid off 
its 5300 employees but is devising severance packages officials 
said

pilots and flight attendants who went back to 
work and weakened a lengthy strike now face the possibility of 
fines or other unspecified penalties imposed by their unions 
the air line pilots association is seeking fines of around 
10000 plus 1000 per day worked during the ninemonth strike for 
each returning pilot al gallo a spokesman for the eastern pilots 
union said wednesday 
the transport workers union which represents eastern flight 
attendants has disenfranchised some picketcrossers from voting in 
union elections but hasnt decided whether it will seek fines 
eastern is providing attorneys for the employees that have 
received penalty notices said spokesman robin matell in miami 
obviously a union regards crossing picket lines as an act of 
disloyalty said mark kahn a labor arbitrator in detroit 
under their constitutions he said most unions have the right 
to fine members expel them or consider them in bad standing 
alpa recently sent such letters to 700 to 800 returning pilots 
charging them with violating article 8 of the groups bylaws by 
crossing a picket line gallo said he said hearings have been held 
in washington on 200 to 300 cases some of which have gone to 
alpas appeals board 
if cases continue after that they could go to federal courts 
gallo said 
some of the returning pilots who work at eastern along with 
fliers hired to replace strikers have voluntarily resigned from 
the pilots union 
around 1600 to 2000 formerly striking pilots remain out of 
work gallo said 
alpa the legal representative of both working and nonworking 
pilots is seeking a return to work in contract talks with 
management but eastern says its pilot staffing needs have been met 
and is seeking to protect the jobs of newly hired fliers 
the pilots and flight attendants struck in sympathy with 
machinists last march 4 but called off the walkout in late november 
the machinists union remains on strike against the airline 
which is restructuring as a smaller carrier under federal 
bankruptcy court supervision 
hearings have been held on a number of flight attendants cases 
in miami atlanta boston new york and newark nj said sandra 
mickley recording secretary for the transport workers local at 
eastern 
some union members have been found to be in bad standing 
excluding them from voting in union elections or attending 
meetings ms mickley said

car buyers responded to aggressive incentives offered by the 
automakers said jeannette garretty an analyst at bank of america 
in san francisco 
after sales turned down in late 1989 carmakers offered stronger 
enticements including the guaranteed rebate program chrysler 
chairman lee a iacocca touted in super bowl television ads under 
that program buyers will receive the difference if chrysler 
increases incentives on an eligible vehicles any time through sept 
30 
with the economy sluggish incentives are likely to persist

chryslers truck sales so far this calendar year are up 272 
percent while car sales are off by 29 percent 
chrysler reported tuesday that it lost 664 million in the

trucks at an average daily rate of 19316 during early february

exchange are vowing to investigate 
we are obliged to investigate any claims that are brought to 
our attention merc spokesman andrew yemma said wednesday 
the statements attributed to robert h bailin one of 48 people 
indicted in a federal probe of trading fraud at the merc and the 
chicago board of trade surfaced tuesday in pretrial documents 
filed in us district court by the us attorneys office 
bailin is seeking to have the statements suppressed during his 
trial 
the court documents contain transcripts of fbi interviews of 
bailin in january 1989 six months before he was indicted by a 
federal grand jury 
the documents allege bailin told fbi agents that corruption at 
the merc was so widespread that on one day more than twice as many 
pork belly futures were illegally traded outside the pork belly pit 
as were traded inside it 
bailin also is alleged to have described kickbacks to the big 
guys upstairs brokers who telephone orders down to the exchange 
floor and allegedly told fbi agents that the 140yearold 
tradition of trading futures by hollering and signaling to other 
traders in a crowded recessed pit had been compromised by 
corruption 
the openoutcry system does not work at the merc bailin is 
alleged to have told the fbi 
bailin a 37yearold trader of japanese yen futures and two 
other indicted yen traders are seeking to suppress statements they 
allegedly made to fbi agents the traders contend they were 
illegally coerced into making the statements during interviews 
in a court hearing last month bailin said the statements 
attributed to him by the government were taken out of context said 
edward genson one of bailins lawyers 
but genson noted in an interview wednesday that the issue 
currently before us district judge william t hart is not the 
validity of the statements that were alleged to have been made the 
issue is whether the statements were properly taken 
twenty yen traders have been indicted so far in the sweeping 
government probe bailin and 15 others who have pleaded innocent 
are scheduled to go to trial may 21 according to a clerk in harts 
office 
meanwhile wednesday the mercs board of directors issued a 
blueprint for the 1990s that called for the exchange to regain 
public confidence and to develop several new sources of revenue 
in order to maintain our successful momentum there must be 
absolute confidence in the integrity of our markets the boards 
statement said 
the board also proposed a new business venture the cme resource 
and service co to develop new products and services for market 
users some of the ventures may include publishing 
telecommunications services accounting services and tradeclearing
