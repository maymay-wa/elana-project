a shark named megamouth with lips 
that glow in the dark washed ashore off the coast of western 
australia and scientists said it was only the third time such a 
specimen has been found 
in this day and age it is quite a remarkable find dr 
gerald allen of the fish department of the western australia museum 
said friday something like this doesnt happen every day 
the fish which measured 16 feet and looks like a cross between 
a whale and a shark swam ashore on wednesday near the resort town 
of mandurah locals pushed it back to sea but it beached itself 
again and died 
allen said only two other specimens had been found he said a 
megamouth as researchers call the shark was first discovered in 
1976 off hawaii a second specimen was caught in 1984 off the coast 
of southern california 
its the first time a megamouth has been found in the southern 
hemisphere allen said in a telephone interview with the 
associated press 
allen said the fish lives at depths of 660 feet to 3300 feet 
and has bioluminescent lips that glow in the dark to attract 
jellyfish plankton shrimp and other food 
we dont know very much about it other than that it swims at 
great depths apparently with its mouth open filtering food said 
allen he said the megamouth has a bulbous head with a mouth 
measuring 2 feet across and tiny teeth 
its definitely a shark and it is not prehistoric allen 
said 
allen also noted that the megamouth weighing about 1500 
pounds feels very flabby 
its sort of like jelly he said that is because it 
doesnt need strong muscles or a hard skeleton for the sort of 
environment in which it lives 
he said the museum planned to display the megamouth

the head of a federal employees union says a 
federal appeals court ruling will force the reagan administration 
to replace a civil service test that was found to discriminate 
against minorities 
the office of personnel management can no longer ignore their 
obligation to develop an alternative system national treasury 
employees union president robert tobias said friday following the 
ruling by the us court of appeals 
the threejudged panel ruled that opm acted arbitrarily and 
capriciously in not providing figures to back its claim that high 
costs rule out developing a new test for filling entrylevel jobs 
because the old test was found to be biased earlier in the 
longrunning court dispute the agency has been using a 
noncompetitive hiring system based on grades and performance in 
interviews opm spokesman dick mcgowan said the agency would have 
no comment on the ruling

firefighters struggled friday to encircle a 
27000acre forest fire that had destroyed 10 houses forced 
evacuations and killed cattle in rugged terrain before wind steered 
flames away from other houses 
the leading edge of the 10dayold warm springs creek fire moved 
out of the elkhorn mountains toward the small town of winston 
about 15 miles southeast of helena but that area of flames did not 
threaten houses or other building and no more evacuations were 
expected said art howell of the interagency fire dispatch center 
theres no more homes in the way he said friday but that 
depends a lot on the weather and the winds a big factor 
a weather inversion trapped cooler air smoke and flames in the 
lower valleys throughout most of the day and kept the 27000acre 
fires growth to only 600 acres said anne jeffery fire 
information officer 
elsewhere a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in 
wyomings bighorn national forest crashed friday killing one 
person and injuring three others firefighters also battled fires 
in california idaho and utah 
the warm springs creek fire grew by 7000 acres thursday night 
despite the efforts of 1700 heavily equipped firefighters but on 
two fronts the fire took turns that could help suppress it said 
fire information officer bob krepps 
he said westerly wind at about 20 mph late thursday pushed the 
fire back into itself on its western border depriving it of new 
fuel and lifting a threat to about 500 residents of the saddle 
mountain subdivision 
at the fires eastern edge friday flames moved out of forested 
high country and onto grassland thats a real benefit to us 
also krepps said because of the lighter fuel 
in addition its movement took it out of rough inaccessible 
terrain into gentler ground where firefighters could work more 
easily said jerry adelblue of the helena national forest 
barring a return of strong shifting winds he said 
firefighters should have just another day at the office out 
there 
although no new evacuations were expected broadwater county 
sheriff rich thompson said winstonarea residents were on the 
alert everybodys aware of whats going on he said if it 
comes down that mountain theyll have to get out 
at least three air national guard transport planes modified to 
drop fire retardant were brought in from wyoming and california on 
friday and were expected to begin flights saturday said krepps 
erratic wind late wednesday and and early thursday had caused 
the fire to quadruple in size destroying 10 homes and cabins 
scattered in the mountains one cabin owner lost 30 head of cattle 
about 40 people remained out of their homes friday while fire 
crews backed by bulldozers shored up lines along the north east 
and west sides of the fire 
adelblue said the fire was about 30 percent contained 
about 35 miles north of helena fire crews were expected to 
finish mopup work on a 110acre grass fire that initially 
threatened summer homes near wolf creek 
in southeastern montana about 1000 firefighters began 
disbanding friday after tightening a noose around three fires that 
had burned 13600 acres of scattered timber and grass near lame 
deer 
in northcentral montana 980 firefighters attacked the 
4500acre lost canyon fire on the rocky boys indian reservation 
it was about half contained by fire lines said fire information 
officer chris comstock 
comstock said the fire moved farther into thick timber and was 
not threatening any buildings i think were past that point 
he said 
about 60 smaller lightningcaused fires burned friday in the 
flathead river drainage of northwestern montana 
elsewhere officials had few details about the helicopter crash 
in the cloud peak wilderness area southwest of sheridan wyo in 
the bighorn national forest said larry thoney a member of the 
forests recreation lands staff 
forest spokesman harvalou buchanan said the helicopter was 
privately owned the affiliations of the people inside were unknown 
and their names were being withheld 
wind had pushed the lost fire in the bighorn forest past fire 
lines and it had charred 5400 acres approaching within a mile of 
a ranch and summer homes on its northern edge a wind shift later 
however helped firefighters pushing the fire to the west away 
from the area 
wind gusting to 30 and 35 mph hampered firefighters in 
yellowstone national park and park officials closed a road from 
grant village to lewis lake again friday because trees that had 
been left unburned earlier by the shoshone fire ignited sending 
flames into the road 
elsewhere in yellowstone wind pushed the north fork fire to 
cover about 74000 acres a growth of 5000 acres from reports 
thursday the norris junction and madison junction campgrounds were 
closed while firefighters worked to protect buildings in norris 
junction from the fire 3 to 4 miles south 
in southern california an arson brush fire in the san jacinto 
mountains grew to 1073 acres friday a fire spokesman said the 
fire between barker and cabazon peaks and on part of the morongo 
indian reservation was expected to be controlled during the night 
said tim spann of the state department of forestry and fire 
firefighters in southwest utah contained an 580acre brush fire 
believed to be mancaused that burned about 20 miles northwest of 
st george firefighters also controlled a 600acre blaze in 
northern utah 
firefighters in idahos challis national forest squelched a 
nearly 14000acre fire and were being sent elsewhere

an iranian official rejected us claims 
that his country was partly responsible for the us navys downing 
of an iranian jetliner and he said the navys presence in the 
persian gulf was to blame 
our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air 
corridor used five times a week by the same captain iranian 
ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said friday 
during a naval skirmish with iranian gunboats the crew of the 
uss vincennes misinterpreted radar and electronic signals from the 
civilian airliner and shot it down july 3 killing all 290 people 
aboard 
conclusions of a us defense department investigation released 
friday blamed human error by the crew but defense secretary frank 
c carlucci said iran bore a heavy responsibility for letting the 
plane fly over a battle 
the report said several of the crews assumptions about the 
approaching flight were wrong including that it was descending 
toward the vincennes and was flying off course 
of the crews mistaken beliefs which the defense department 
released immediately after the disaster mahallati said 
in the view of the american administration when such 
incidents take place at the price of the lives of 290 people first 
you cannot provide the american people with facts it is better to 
forge information to misinform them than to keep quiet and wait 
until the facts come out 
the iranian envoy laid the blame on the us navys presence in 
the gulf 
one should conclude that the mere presence of such highly 
dangerous equipment which cannot be controlled even by trained 
american personnel is the source of tension he said by 
itself it can cause miseries one ofter the other 
he called for the us fleet to pull out of the gulf saying the 
ceasefire between iran and iraq that started today makes it 
unnecessary 
mahallati also called on the united states to pay reparations to 
iran for the loss of the plane and its passengers and crew and to 
issue a formal apology 
president reagan sent americas regrets and the united states 
accepted responsibility for shooting down the plane but the united 
states blames iran for sending the flight over a combat zone and 
has not apologized 
reagan has approved the payment of damages directly to the 
families of the victims but not reparations to iran or any 
payment that tehrans government would receive

north province the same day 
there was no independent confirmation of the report by unita 
which is backed by the united states and south africa the reported 
fighting occurred despite a ceasefire declared by angola cuba and 
south africa unita is not a party to the talks that led to the 
truce 
on aug 12 unita said it had killed 42 angolan soldiers during 
the week beginning aug 8 when the ceasefire went into effect in 
the southern african nation 
cuba maintains an estimated 50000 troops in angola in support 
of president jose eduardo dos santos both south africa and the

the federal budget deficit climbed by 229 
billion last month after posting a rare surplus in june the 
treasury department said 
the new batch of red ink brought the deficit for the first 10 
months of the fiscal year that began oct 1 to 1420 billion only 
slightly less than the amount for the same period last year 
government ledger books were in the black with a 93 billion 
surplus for june mainly as a result of quarterly tax payments by 
businesses and individuals 
but the reagan administration is projecting the deficit for the 
fiscal year that ends sept 30 at 1523 billion that is above the 
administrations 1467 billion deficit estimate in february but 
below the 157 billion forecast by the congressional budget office 
at the beginning of the year 
the cbo revised its figures friday however to project a 155 
billion deficit james l blum acting director of the 
congressional agency said stronger economic growth than expected 
for the first half was responsible 
the cbo is not expecting acrosstheboard spending cuts to be 
triggered this month by a law calling for a balanced budget by 
1993 blum said 
he said cbo projections indicate there is no way the budget 
could be balanced by 1993 in the absence of further policy changes 
such as spending cuts or tax increases the agency in fact 
projects a 121 billion deficit in 1993 if present policies are 
unchanged 
surprising economic growth which has boosted government 
revenues and lowered government spending for such programs as 
unemployment benefits has been credited with reducing the deficit 
this year 
many economists believe the deficit will rise again in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 the administration however 
predicts it will drop to 1401 billion in 1989 when figured 
according to guidelines contained in the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
last months deficit was 27 percent higher than the imbalance 
in july a year ago 
government spending in july actually dropped 69 percent when 
compared to june spending fell to 836 billion but tax receipts 
dropped even more sharply falling by 388 percent to 607 billion 
tax receipts for the first 10 months of the fiscal year were up 
57 percent to 7417 billion while spending is up 46 percent to 
8837 billion 
as usual the largest spending categories were the military 
social security and other programs in the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 239 billion in july and 2371 
billion in the first 10 months of this fiscal year up 33 percent 
from the same period last year 
social security payments totaled 172 billion in july and 178 
billion so far this budget year an increase of 58 percent 
spending for other hhs programs amounted to 120 billion last 
month and 1308 billion this budget year up 33 percent 
interest payments on the 26 trillion national debt cost 145 
billion in july and 1836 billion so far this year

the third positive development for 
the space shuttle program in 10 days sealing a fuel line leak 
could lead nasa to announce a launch date soon for discovery on the 
first postchallenger flight 
the national aeronautics and space administration has been 
aiming for a late september or early october liftoff and hopes to 
be able to establish the date by late next week for the 
oftendelayed mission 
technicians bolted a clamshelllike device over the leak in a 
discovery fuel line friday and filled it with a sealing compound 
a subsequent pressure test showed no additional leakage but 
officials said they planned to monitor it for a few days the leak 
of nitrogen tetroxide was detected july 14 
officials originally thought they would have to move discovery 
off the launch pad and back to a hangar for repair a move that 
could have delayed the flight by as much as two months but 
engineers decided to cut holes in the rear wall of the shuttles 
cargo bay to gain access to the leak 
the holes were cut wednesday and the technicians finished the 
job friday 
the work was delayed until after the launch pad test firing of 
discoverys three liquid fuel main engines that critical test 
which certified the engines for flight was conducted successfully 
aug 10 
another milestone was passed thursday when an intentionally 
flawed solid fuel booster rocket was testfired for two minutes at 
the morton thiokol plant in utah 
officials said that while initial test results looked excellent 
it would be several days before all the data were analyzed 
the testfiring was the fifth and final prelaunch test for the 
redesigned booster two of which are already attached to discovery 
on the launch pad 
a faulty joint in one of challengers two boosters triggered the 
explosion that destroyed the shuttle and killed its sevenmember 
crew on jan 28 1986 
meanwhile engineers here continued to try to learn why a small 
amount of hydrogen leaked during the main engine test it was 
detected in an area where electrical and fuel lines join the 
shuttle with its external fuel tank 
the leak disappeared quickly and was not considered a flight 
safety hazard but officials said they would like to understand why 
it happened they expect to have test results next week

delegates from north korea and south 
korea deadlocked today on peace measures and on sharing the 
olympics during a second round of talks and each side blamed the 
other for lack of progress 
neither side budged from their positions during todays session 
at the truce site in the demilitarized zone separating the nations 
the communist north insisted on being a cohost at the olympics 
the south said it was impossible 
they did agree to meet again monday 
south korea was insincere throughout the meeting the 
norths chief delegate chon kum chol told a press conference 
the chief south korean delegate park joonkyu said any hope of 
progress depended on the north being more flexible 
park called on the north to give up its demand to be a cohost 
at the olympics and simply agree to participate in the games which 
start in seoul on sept 17 
i still think the chance of north korea participating in the 
seoul games is one in a thousand park told reporters 
the twp fivemember teams met in the south korean pavilion on 
friday they met in the north korean building they shook hands and 
smiled at the start of the talks but the mood was guarded 
the two koreas technically still at war are archenemies with 
hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150mile border 
the main purpose of the talks was to arrange a fullscale 
northsouth parliamentary session but the two sides disagree on 
what that session should involve 
south korean delegates continued to insist on small delegations 
for parliamentary talks instead of participation of the full 
legislatures of both sides as demanded by the north the south said 
the norths plan is unworkable 
the south said it would drop its demand for a presidential 
summit to be discussed north korea wants the meeting to urgently 
address drawing up a nonaggression pact and its demand to be a 
cohost at the olympics 
the north korean delegates were drawn from the rubberstamp 
supreme peoples assembly the south korean delegation consisted of 
two government national assembly lawmakers and a legislator from 
each of the three main opposition parties 
the north is demanding to be a cohost at the olympics to stave 
off a major political defeat both sides claim to be the sole 
legitimate government of korea the south sees its selection to 
hold the olympics as international recognition of its claim 
the international olympic committee says north korea cannot 
share the games because they are awarded to a single city south 
korean authorities fear the north may use terrorism to try to 
disrupt the olympics 
previous sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 
1970s failed to make progress the last talks collapsed in january 
1986 when north korea pulled out to protest annual south 
koreanus military exercises 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by soviet and us 
forces that ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being 
signed 
the south has evolved into a major economic power and started to 
move toward full democracy while the north has remained one of the 
most isolated nations in the world

louisiana looking to burnish its image 
should reap benefits for many years from the exposure its prize 
city received while hosting the republican national convention 
some of new orleans major boosters say 
new orleans has never looked better louisiana has never 
looked brighter said jim bob moffett head of the fortune 500 
company freeportmcmoran and a key convention fundraiser 
the city rolled out its plushest red carpet for the gop 
visitors with sumptuous parties tasty native cuisine riverboat 
rides and gov buddy roemer reminding everyone louisiana was 
polishing a tarnished image 
sooner or later the message was going to come across that new 
orleans is not strictly a party town or a place for good food and 
music said david jones president of the new orleans chamber of 
commerce we are starting to do the right things to make this a 
viable economic center 
it will probably have gains for louisiana for the next 20 
years said mervin trail a new orleans businessman and another 
key fundraiser 
complaints were few during the fourday convention that ended 
thursday 
but then new orleans handles mardi gras every year with 20 
times as many visitors and a different kind of crowd police said 
at mardi gras its a party crowd and there are a few more 
untoward incidents said new orleans police capt john hughes 
it was very good as far as were concerned 
suffocating humidity and 90degree temperatures also made it too 
hot to misbehave hughes said 
the subtropical weather and the sound system at the giant 
louisiana superdome drew most of the complaints 
technicians began adjusting the system after sen barry 
goldwater the gops 1964 presidential nominee said he couldnt 
hear a word of president reagans farewell speech monday 
the complaints diminished during the week but they didnt go 
away 
it is not the superdome system said dome manager bob 
johnson explaining that the republicans installed their own 
some of the more conservative delegates were not charmed by new 
orleans tolerance for the weird the drunken and the sexy 
now that we have visited sodom where is gomorrah one 
washington state delegate was reported asking 
but others were seduced by the citys history its laidback 
attitudes and the mighty mississippi river 
our goal was to put together one of the most successful 
conventions in history said jones 
lt gov paul hardy said he was hard pressed to find anyone who 
wasnt enamored of the french quarter the streetcars and the 
oaklined avenues 
i dont believe that we could have spent 1 billion in 
advertising and reaped the benefits equal to the fantastic free 
press the free media we are receiving hardy said 
fortunately weve been given the opportunity to redeem ourselves 
after the worlds fair fiasco 
the 1984 world exposition here was a delight for those who 
attended but a financial disaster because so many people stayed 
away 
the states image also has suffered because of the slump in 
louisianas energybased economy and its history of shady politics 
louisianas jobless rate has been no 1 or no 2 in the country 
the last three years the states storied corruption spans from the 
legendary huey p long whose life was chronicled in fictionalized 
form in the pulitzer prizewinning novel all the kings men 
to roemers predecessor edwin edwards who spent much of his third 
term successfully defending himself against federal racketeering 
charges 
hardy said the city already is looking forward to hosting the 
republicans the democrats or both four years from now 
its very seldom both parties have their convention in the 
same city he noted 
it happened in 1952 in chicago and 1972 in miami and hardy 
hopes new orleans will claim that fame at the next 20year 
interval 1992 
were hoping history repeats itself he said

two legislators from prime minister brian 
mulroneys conservative government say kickbacks are a way of life 
in the administration charges that could hurt mulroney in 
elections expected next month 
the allegations which surfaced thursday and friday are 
political fodder for opposition parties polls show the opposition 
liberal party with a narrow overall lead followed by the 
conservatives and the socialist new democratic party 
the government said the accusations by a disgruntled former 
cabinet member and another conservative member of parliament were 
unsubstantiated 
suzanne blaisgrenier a conservative member of parliament for 
montreal rosemount was quoted in the montreal daily la presse as 
saying that companies routinely pay kickbacks to get federal 
contracts in quebec 
another conservative member from montreal vincent della noce 
was quoted in the ottawa citizen as saying the most difficult part 
of his job was to stay clean 
ms blaisgrenier who resigned as junior transport minister in 
1985 in a dispute over aid to montreal oil refineries said she 
lacked the detailed proof for police charges but she called for an 
impartial commission to investigate federal contracts 
ms blaisgrenier is under pressure from party leaders in quebec 
not to seek reelection other conservative legislators from the 
province met friday to consider expelling her from the caucus 
della noce was quoted as saying i could put a dozen people in 
prison but on friday della noce said he had no proof and said 
he had not expressed himself clearly in the original interview 
mulroney was absent from the house of commons in ottawa when 
opposition leaders hammered the government about the alleged 
patronage 
he is expected to call an election next month a year before his 
fiveyear term expires because of liberal plans to hold up 
ratification of the canadaus free trade agreement which is to 
take effect on jan 1 
liberal raymond garneau a leading quebec legislator said 
ive never seen such serious admissions on the part of a 
government 
but solicitor general james kelleher said we as a government 
have no information whatsoever to substantiate the allegations 
the royal canadian mounted police interviewed ms blaisgrenier 
on friday and sgt george watts said she had no details of any 
activity which could permit the rcmp to initiate a criminal 
investigation 
he said the mounties had not yet spoken with della noce 
police confirmed they have asked the fbi to interview officials 
at metropolitan life insurance co headquarters in new york in 
connection with a 2yearold investigation of possible kickbacks in 
a 820000 canadian government contract to lease office space from 
the company 
liberal leader john turner poised to take over as prime 
minister if his party wins the election told the commons that a 
royal commission should investigate the whole course of conduct 
of this government 
but deputy prime minister don mazankowski dismissed the 
suggestion and said the government had moved quickly in the past by 
ousting ministers and ordering inquiries when there was clear 
evidence of wrongdoing

the lead plaintiff in a classaction suit 
against the fbi says bias is so institutionally ingrained at the 
agency that even he treated fellow hispanics unfairly 
bigotry is not the problem bernardo matt perez 
testified friday in us district court what were talking about 
is a system of discrimination as a supervisor ive been part of 
that system im not talking about a particular person im talking 
about an organization 
perez and the 310 hispanic agents who joined him in the lawsuit 
contend the fbi discriminates against hispanics in hiring 
promotion assignments and discipline they are seeking damages and 
changes in fbi policy 
about 400 of the fbis 9000 agents are hispanic 
fbi personnel director david rarity jr testified earlier that 
the agency does not discriminate against hispanics 
perez who filed the suit in january 1987 was one of the last 
witnesses to testify for the plaintiffs in what is scheduled to be 
a twoweek nonjury trial the plaintiffs rested friday after five 
days of testimony and about 40 witnesses the fbi is scheduled to 
start calling witnesses for its defense monday 
during the first week of the trial agents testified that 
hispanics are assigned a disproportionate number of 
spanishlanguage wiretaps and temporary outoftown assignments 
because those assignments are not considered as prestigious or 
difficult as street investigations hispanics are given lower 
performance appraisals than nonhispanics agents testified 
other agents testified that hispanics are more likely to be 
given dangerous undercover assignments but that they dont receive 
the same recognition for that work as nonhispanics 
hispanics are assumed to know spanish even when they dont and 
nonhispanic spanishspeakers are much less likely than hispanics 
to be assigned lowglamor or highly dangerous jobs according to 
testimony 
perez said he had no choice but to engage in such discriminatory 
actions because the fbi is structured that way and because the 
agency has not tried hard enough to hire bilingual agents or teach 
agents spanish 
every hispanic agent who testified expressed fear of retaliation 
for cooperating with the lawsuit 
during three hours of testimony friday perez described what he 
called a systematic pattern of discrimination against him 
perez secondincommand at the el paso bureau said he first 
noticed discrimination when he was attending the fbi academy at 
quantico va 
one time the assistant director called me into his office and 
said what would you say if i called you a blanketyblank blank 
blank mexican i said i would say youre an ignorant person 
he said he wanted to know because they would be handing me a 
weapon and he didnt want me flying off the handle and hurting 
people 
perez testified his problems intensified in 1982 after he was 
demoted from the top post in san juan and sent to los angeles 
where he was the no 2 man under agent richard bretzing 
bretzing kept perez uninformed about investigations and 
repeatedly harassed him perez said bretzing demoted perez twice 
before finally forcing him to el paso 
butte and el paso are considered dumping grounds for agents 
who are malcontents perez testified

the official tass news agency reported today that 
pakistani authorities suspect sabotage in the plane crash that 
killed president mohammed zia ulhaq but it did not mention that 
zias son suspects kremlin involvement 
zia and 29 others were killed wednesday when the c130 military 
transport plane they were in exploded and crashed the blast also 
killed us ambassador arnold raphel several pakistani generals 
and other senior military men 
it is supposed that this action was perfectly planned and 
faultlessly executed the newspaper muslim points out said 
tasss islamabad correspondent in a dispatch an explosive device 
might have been installed in the plane 
but tass was silent on comments made friday in london by zias 
eldest son concerning possible soviet involvement ijaz ulhaq 
said some of the superpowers may be involved in it naturally i 
would think about the soviets at this time 
zia was a strong supporter of guerrillas fighting the 
sovietbacked government of afghanistan giving them bases in 
pakistan to conduct military operations in afghanistan soviet 
officials had accused him repeatedly of violating geneva accords 
that provided for the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
tass also reported on some of the theories about the crash the 
dispatch said some officials believe the plane might have been hit 
by a missile fired from the ground 
but all officials believe the air crash was not accidental 
tass said 
tass also noted a soviet delegation arrived in islamabad for the 
funeral of the 64yearold leader the delegation was led by 
vitautas astrauskas vice president of the presidium of the supreme 
soviet

firefighters braced for 40 mph winds today 
as they battled an 11dayold 27000acre wildfire south of helena 
that consumed at least 10 homes and 30 head of cattle 
meanwhile dozens of other fires some of them potentially 
serious broke out in montana state and federal officials said 
in wyoming firefighters at yellowstone national park also were 
expected to encounter high winds and a team began investigating a 
helicopter crash that killed one person in bighorn national forest 
during firefighting efforts wildfires continued to rage in 
california utah and idaho 
the devastating fire near helena cooled somewhat friday after 
dramatic runs earlier in the week the fire turned just before 
reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of residences and 
surrounding ranches 
were looking pretty good said anne jeffery a fire 
information officer 
she said the fire had grown by 600 acres friday but that was a 
small increase compared with the 7000 and 15000acre runs the 
two previous nights 
with a part of the fire heading southeast toward flatter land 
officials said they would have more of a chance of checking its 
advance once it left the rugged mountain ridges another portion of 
the fire was moving into even rougher country to the south but 
there was no danger of damage to structures there 
theres no more homes in the way said art howell of the 
interagency fire dispatch center but that depends a lot on the 
weather and the wind is a big factor 
the national weather service forecast winds gusting to 40 mph 
today 
fires were burning over thousands of acres elsewhere in montana 
many of the blazes resulting from lightning strikes earlier in the 
week 
at least one summer residence was destroyed and others 
threatened in a small but dangerous blaze that erupted in logging 
slash friday afternoon about 12 miles northwest of butte said jack 
cullen of the deerlodge national forest 
other fires were reported in southeastern montana including one 
that threatened to overrun a ranch in southern bighorn county near 
the wyoming line 
some of the 1000 firefighters on three fires that have burned 
14000 acres of scattered timber and grasslands near lame deer in 
southeastern montana were released from lines friday and officials 
said those blazes should be controlled by sunday evening 
in northcentral montana 980 firefighters put finishing touches 
on a 4500acre fire on the rocky boys indian reservation 
spokesman chris comstrock said the fire should be fully encircled 
by tonight if the weather cooperates 
about 40 smaller lightningcaused fires burned friday in the 
flathead river drainage of northwestern montana 
in wyoming yellowstone spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said 
firefighters began removing debris and flammable materials from the 
structures in the norris junction area to prepare for the arrival 
of a 74000acre fire 
if the forecast brings winds as anticipated we expect the 
fire will reach norris today she said the blaze is one of 
several burning in the nations oldest national park 
in bighorn national forest investigators representing the 
agencies fighting a 5400acre blaze on friday reached the site of 
the fatal helicopter crash which left its three other occupants 
injured 
the privately owned helicopter under contract with the us 
forest service crashed in a rugged wilderness area west of the 
fires western boundary 
a wildfire set by an arsonist in the san jacinto mountains of 
california charred 1237 acres but firefighters encircled it while 
a blaze burning out of control blackened at least 300 acres in the 
san bernardino national forest 
the arson fire on part of the morongo indian reservation about 
95 miles east of downtown los angeles was contained friday night 
and full control was expected by early today the california 
department of forestry said 
firefighters contained a 580acre southern utah brush fire and 
hoped to bring the blaze under control by the weekend but crews 
were being sent to another fire burning in the wahwah mountains 
about 50 miles northwest of cedar city 
firefighters in idahos challis national forest squelched a 
nearly 14000acre fire and were being sent elsewhere

what began as a hometown salute to sen 
dan quayle and the republican ticket turned into mass catcalls and 
jeers as thousands of quayle supporters reacted angrily to 
reporters questions about whether he had strings pulled to avoid 
the draft during the vietnam war 
as the audience chanted quayle quayle the 41yearold 
senator said there was nothing improper in the way he entered the 
national guard in 1969 
the republican vice presidential nominee acknowledged that a 
family friend made calls on his behalf after he expressed interest 
in joining the guard but insisted i got in fairly 
quayle said he resented implied slurs on his patriotism by media 
reports of the controversy and said it should help not hurt him 
with the voters 
youre going to be surprised at how outraged people and 
families that identify with the national guard around america are 
going to be towards these accusations quayle said as the crowd 
cheered 
bush campaign officials denied that the event had been 
orchestrated to include the crowd in quayles first detailed 
answers to questions about his military record 
but the event provided another example of how vice president 
george bushs running mate has seemed to overshadow the campaign 
meanwhile the washington post reported in saturday editions 
that quayle passed an armed forces physical examination on april 9 
1969 which meant that he would have been eligible to be drafted at 
any time after his may 25 graduation day 
he was called to take the physical by his local draft board 
while he was still a depauw university senior the post said he 
entered the national guard on may 19 but the newspaper quoted 
guard officials as saying they were still reviewing quayles 
military records presumably showing when he applied to join and 
could not release them 
the senator had promised to respond friday to questions that 
have dogged him since he was picked by bush as his running mate 
but the opportunity provided by bush aides came at the end of a 
rousing rally for the popular senator at a courthouse square across 
from his fathers newspaper 
after quayle shook hands with his supporters aides brought him 
before a throng of reporters at an outdoor news conference which 
was piped over an public address system 
boos and hoots of boring sang out across the courtyard 
as quayle was asked about the sequence of events that led to his 
entry into the guard 
quayle said that during his senior year in college as he 
pondered future military service he turned to his parents for 
advice like any 22 year old he faced the loss of his college 
deferment after graduation 
the family discussed the matter with wendell c phillippi a 
former commander of the indiana national guard who worked for 
quayles grandfather at the indianapolis news quayle said in an 
account that was similar to that phillippi has provided to 
reporters 
i did not ask him to make any calls i told him i was 
interested in getting into the indiana national guard i would 
assume that calls would be made quayle said 
phillippi who has said he contacted the guard on quayles 
behalf knew that i wanted to get into the national guard and i 
hoped he would help me quayle said 
i did not join to avoid service in vietnam because by joining 
the indiana national guard i could have gone to vietnam if my unit 
had been called up quayle said 
the senator said he would not have done things differently if he 
had known he would be running for vice president he said he did 
not consider the matter an embarrassment for the ticket and had not 
offered to remove himself from the race 
vice president george bush agrees with me that it is patriotic 
to serve in the indiana national guard and hes proud of my 
service quayle said 
at the rally bush praised quayle as a young man of vision of 
character 
but it was quayle for whom the crowd reserved its greatest 
enthusiasm scores of residents dotted the road to huntington from 
the fort wayne airport and huntingtons police chief estimated the 
crowd at the rally to be as many as 20000 people 
quayle told them we have the values the character the work 
ethic of all small towns 
my roots my values my friends my neighborhoods it is 
indeed a proud day but most importantly i am just proud of 
huntington he said 
the crowd roared when he added we love the national guard

scientists in taiwan say a new material shows 
possible superconductivity at up to 66 degrees above the current 
record temperature but other scientists have reacted with caution 
the new report does not include a crucial test for proving 
superconductivity so the material should be considered only a 
possible superconductor the other experts said 
superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct 
electricity without loss to resistance if the materials can be 
made practical they may lead to such advances as smaller more 
powerful computers and magnetically levitated highspeed trains 
materials created so far must be chilled before they will 
superconduct researchers are trying to develop materials with as 
high a superconducting temperature as possible to minimize the 
expense of cooling and so make superconductors more practical 
the new report from taiwan says five samples of the material 
showed no electrical resistance at temperatures above minus 208 
degrees fahrenheit one sample showed no resistance at minus 168 
degrees the researchers said 
the current widely accepted record is minus 234 degrees 
the new research is disclosed in high tc update a 
newsletter published by the ames laboratory at iowa state 
university under contract to the us department of energy tc 
refers to the temperature at which a material begins to 
superconduct 
the newsletter obtained a copy of a paper by researchers at the 
industrial technology research institute and the national tsing hua 
university both in hsinchu taiwan 
the researchers reported their material includes the same 
ingredients as the current recordholding compound thallium 
calcium barium copper and oxygen 
some samples that conducted electricity without resistance at 
temperatures above minus 208 degrees eventually lost that ability 
others that could do so above minus 226 degrees still had that 
ability after a week the researchers said 
the reason for the changes in performance in some samples has 
not yet been pinpointed they said 
superconductivity researcher paul chu of the university of 
houston said he found no errors in the reported resistance 
measurements when he visited the researchers recently in taiwan 
but he also said he knew of no measurements of the magnetic 
characteristics of the new material superconducting materials give 
off a characteristic magnetic signal when exposed to a magnetic 
field and existence of this signal is considered a crucial test of 
whether a material is a true superconductor 
without a report of that measurement the material should be 
considered only a possible superconductor he said 
similarly physicist john clem at the ames laboratory said the 
manuscript from the taiwan researchers is very convincing but 
that the lack of magnetic measurements is disturbing 
clem said he wouldnt get excited about the new material 
until such measurements are reported and the experimental results 
are duplicated by other researchers

iraqi merchant vessels sailed the persian 
gulf and the gulf of oman for the first time in eight years today 
under protection of a ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
iraqi oil minister issam abdelrahim said the ain zalah a 
governmentowned 35338ton oil tanker took on cargo and left iraq 
to sail the persian gulf a few hours after the truce began at 7 
am 11 pm edt 
iran and iraq often attacked shipping during the war leaving 
hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf 
iraqi shipping through the gulf stopped shortly after the 
outbreak of the war in september 1980 it relied on pipelines for 
the export of its oil and on shipments via kuwait and jordan for 
its commercial trade 
in his statement carried by the official iraqi news agency and 
monitored in nicosia the oil minister did not say where the vessel 
was loaded or from where it sailed 
some people were betting that iraq would not be able to renew 
its oil exports through the gulf for months or years after the halt 
of the war he said but here we are and within a few hours 
already launching our first shuttle 
he did not disclose the destination of ain zalah nor mention 
another ship the khawla which shipping executives said sailed 
earlier today from a united arab emirates port in the gulf of oman 
toward the gulf 
the khawla honked its horns as it began its northbound voyage 
from the port of fujairah toward the iraqi port of basra almost 
immediately after the truce began shipping executives said 
one of the shipping executives monitoring spillovers of the war 
on gulf shipping said there has been nothing special everything 
is quiet lets see if it lasts 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit says 546 
commercial vessels have been damaged in the socalled tanker 
war 
iraq attacked iranianchartered ships and iran retaliated by 
attacking neutral shipping since iraqs port of basra was shut down 
during the war 
lloyds authoritative register of vessels lists the khawla as a 
3985ton cargo vessel that could also be used as a tanklanding 
troop ship the idrissi is not listed 
the khawla which the executives said has an iraqi captain and a 
21man crew on board would first sail through a 100mile stretch 
from the gulf of oman to hormuz 
the vessel would then sail up the gulf to the southern iraqi 
port of basra 600 miles from hormuz 
irans navy chief rear adm mohammad malekzadegan said iran 
will continue to search vessels in the gulf until the 
establishment of comprehensive peace between the two countries 
iranian and iraqi delegations are scheduled to begin 
negotiations in geneva next week 
iran has intercepted hundreds of commercial vessels in the past 
years searching for iraqbound warrelated cargo

a ceasefire between iran and iraq took 
hold this morning after hundreds of united nations observers moved 
into position along the war front to monitor the first truce in 
eight years of war 
peace officially began at 7 am 11 pm edt 
official media in the two countries carried no reports of any 
violations or other incidents along their common 730mile border 
for the first time in eight years iraq resumed shipping in the 
persian gulf 
iraqis marched in the streets of baghdad and in towns throughout 
their country late friday celebrating what iraqs media called 
that nations victory in the conflict 
in tehran acting commanderinchief hashemi rafsanjani warned 
that iraq might not want peace and that if it renewed hostilities 
it would face a much stronger iran 
iraq said it was reopening the international airport in the 
warbattered southern city of basra and announced that merchant 
ships will soon sail into the persian gulf for the first time since 
the early months of the iraniraq war 
as night fell friday tens of thousands of people took to the 
streets and public parks of baghdad many waving portraits of 
president saddam hussein and chanting slogans in praise of peace 
it is the happiest day in my life said alaa an 18yearold 
on karada street a main artery in downtown baghdad he said he was 
due to be conscripted to the front in january 
about 150 unarmed blue berets from the un iraniraq military 
observer group were deployed along the iraqi side of the border to 
monitor the truce worked out during talks between un secretary 
of state javier perez de cuellar and iranian and iraqi leaders 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said 200 un observers would 
monitor the truce from the iranian side 
the officers were drawn from 24 countries the united nations 
has set a 756 million budget for the mission 
rafsanjani who also is irans parliament speaker and a powerful 
protege of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said in a friday prayer 
sermon 
we are facing two paths war and peace we chose peace but we 
are not sure about iraq if the enemy wants to continue the war it 
will continue much more seriously 
rafsanjani also noted that iranian forces have become much 
stronger and more experienced this war was a great help to the 
export of our revolution and all the world realized that iran 
resisted without any help 
the iraqi general command in a statement carried by iraqi radio 
and television also said baghdads forces would abide by the 
ceasefire conscientiously and responsibly 
it expressed hope for better relations with iran but added 
our bitter experience and the sea of blood that the iranian 
aggression caused make it our responsibility not to deal with iran 
on the basis of wishful thinking but on the basis of reality so 
that we are not cheated again 
iraqs oil minister issam abdelrahim said ain zalah a 
governmentowned 35338ton oil tanker loaded up and sailed down 
the persian gulf a few hours after the truce began 
another iraqi ship the khawla left the united arab emirates 
port of fujairah in the gulf of oman and headed north for the iraqi 
port of basra in the persian gulf almost immediately after the 
truce began said shipping executives speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
iran and iraq often attacked shipping during the war leaving 
hundreds of vessels damaged or destroyed in the gulf 
direct peace talks between the foreign ministers of iran and 
iraq open thursday in geneva mediated by perez de cuellar 
the geneva talks will focus on the peace plan decribed in 
security council resolution 598 
the resolution calls for the ceasefire withdrawal of troops to 
their own territory exchange of prisoners of war direct peace 
talks and establishment of an impartial commmission to establish 
responsibility for the outbreak of the conflict 
the resolution was passed in july 1987 and accepted by iraq at 
that time iran finally accepted in last month clearing the way 
for the un talks that led to the truce 
most western estimates of the number of people killed since the 
conflict broke out in september 1980 range from a half million to 1 
million with some figures even higher

continental airlines plagued by losses in 
recent months is planning a layoff of up to 1000 pilots flight 
attendants and other employees its chairman says 
chairman frank lorzenzo disclosed the plan here friday outside a 
court hearing at which he defended plans for a major layoff at 
continentals sister eastern airlines 
lorenzo also chairman of texas air corp which owns both 
eastern and continental said a formal announcement of the 
continental layoff would come in the next few days along with the 
carriers new fall schedule 
he told reporters the layoff would involve 2 percent to 6 
percent of the companys 36000 employees and include flight 
attendants as well as some management personnel 
between 300 and 500 pilots would be involved lorenzo said 
continental posted a net loss of 231 million in the first six 
months of this year and announced earlier that there would be 
service cutbacks 
at the hearing lorenzo said its was necessary to lay off some 
4000 employees and cut back service at miamibased eastern 
the cuts which would curtail service to 14 cities were 
announced earlier but have been blocked thus far under terms of a 
temporary restraining order issued by us district judge 
barrington d parker at the request of three unions that represent 
eastern employees 
lorenzo said the cuts were needed to save the financially 
troubled line 
if easterns management is not permitted to take the actions 
to save this company then eastern may run out of cash lorenzo 
said 
he denied suggestions by attorneys for the employees that he has 
been attempting to engage in socalled union busting by 
transferring easterns assets to continental he also said there 
was no plan to merge the lines 
the cutbacks represent an effort to stabilize the company 
and decrease the losses lorenzo said 
union attorneys did question lorenzo about the draft of a speech 
that he was to give to japanese investors in 1986 after texas air 
bought eastern 
it said the purchase gave texas air leverage over the union 
easterns airplanes can be repainted and moved over to 
continental where they will be flown by nonunion pilots it said 
lorenzo said an investment banking firm prepared the speech it 
was unclear whether he ever delivered it

it took dozens of investigators and an elaborate 
police scheme but authorities say they finally caught a man who 
cheated manufacturers in at least eight states out of millions of 
dollars for years 
he was terribly terribly intelligent police lt john kelly 
said of 35yearold elliot keith offen who was nabbed friday as he 
tried to complete yet another alleged swindle 
through fancy phone work offen was able to steal and move on 
without getting caught kelly said 
offen would arrange for products such as light bulbs luggage 
sunglasses and packaging tape to be trucked to warehouses that he 
would rent for a few days kelly said before the end of the 30day 
period for paying for the merchandise offen would resell it then 
disappear with the money 
he was virtually a phantom a voice on the end of a line 
kelly said 
the scam ended when detectives moved in on him at 430 pm at a 
manhattan phone booth kelly said 
he was terribly surprised because hes very disciplined and 
very intelligent and thought he was above arrest said kelly 
commanding officer of the police departments special fraud squad 
offen who used as many as 50 aliases and a variety of voices 
was charged with grand larceny attempted grand larceny criminal 
impersonation and warrant for interstate flight to avoid 
prosecution kelly said 
offen is wanted by broward county fla police in connection 
with numerous fraud cases that authorities estimate amounted to 15 
million in losses for companies there said officer joseph 
gallagher 
other states where police say his schemes reached include new 
jersey ohio virginia wisconsin illinois and indiana 
by late friday police had not located any of the money and did 
not know where offen lived or what he did with the money kelly 
said 
offen who was last arrested in new york state on larceny 
charges in 1977 refused to speak to police and asked for an 
attorney kelly said 
to earn the trust of manufacturers offen would learn the names 
of key people such as warehouse managers and would haggle during 
the purchases like a legitimate buyer he said 
offen would use legitimate trucking companies and other 
unknowing gobetweens but would only pay for the relatively 
inexpensive rental of the warehouses kelly said 
rarely would offen meet anyone himself 
although it was not known how many years offen had been 
operating the national association of credit managers in 
washington issued an advisory about him in september 1986 kelly 
said 
the case broke on may 11 when police detective brian smith 
began investigating the theft of about 30000 worth of light bulbs 
from general electric co in queens kelly said 
offen later arranged for a shipment of 100000 in light bulbs 
but avoided a police trap in both instances by not showing up to 
collect the merchandise and not sending anyone else to collect he 
said 
if he felt something was wrong he would burn the operation 
kelly said 
on aug 12 a cooperating witness for police was contacted by 
offen and asked to warehouse 60000 worth of light bulbs the 
witness called police kelly said 
at the same time the fbi was investigating the theft of light 
bulbs from a richmond va company that were destined for new 
york said agent walter wright 
after learning that an additional shipment was destined for 
paterson nj police and the fbi arranged the help of truckers 
manufacturers a store owner and others in duping offen into 
thinking the shipment was on its way he said 
still offen suspected something was wrong and even hired a 
private investigator to find out about the light bulb delivery 
police said 
on friday he continued to try to verify by phone whether the 
light bulbs had actually arrived kelly said 
police traced the calls and arrested him he said 
he looks like a salesman kelly said he could be a light 
bulb salesman

deliberate sabotage by unspecified enemies to a bomb hidden in a 
basket of mangoes

press accounts nothing is known yet he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity the investigators are still at the 
scene 
zias eldest son ijaz ulhaq said he believed the plane was 
sabotaged and he told britains independent television news that

in the wake of the merger of eight insolvent texas 
savings and loans into one governmentowned unit analysts 
questioned whether the consolidation will lead to a longterm 
resolution of the states banking troubles 
the question is what have they accomplished by this asked 
bert ely an alexandria vabased consultant on thrift 
institutions 
i characterize this as throwing toether a bunch of minnows and 
sharks and getting one bloated whale he said of the 
consolidation announced friday by federal regulators 
similarly us rep charles e schumer dny said he was 
concerned such longterm commitments from the government might mean 
taxpayers eventually will have to bail out the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp 
resolving hopelessly insolvent thrifts like these once and for 
all takes real money no funny money notes and asset guarantees 
schumer said 
he called the deal a temporary bandaid that only serves as 
a delay to a taxpayer bailout 
the fslic estimated friday it will spend at least 55 billion 
over the next decade to create the new institution and combine the 
thrifts which include three of the largest institutions in dallas 
the merger announced by the federal home loan bank board is 
the biggest under the governments southwest plan which was 
developed to consolidate or close 120 ailing savings and loan 
associations of the 279 operating in the state as of jan1 
the thrifts involved include dallasbased sunbelt savings 
association of texas whose firstquarter loss of 12 billion 
ranked it no 1 for quarterly losses among the nations savings and 
loans this year 
also part of the consolidation are western federal savings amp 
loan association of dallas which ranked 12th in losses for the 
first quarter and independent american savings association of 
irving ranked 20th in firstquarter losses 
the other institutions are first city savings association of 
irving federated savings amp loan of brady multibanc savings 
association of alice texana savings amp loan association texarkana 
and summit savings association of dallas 
the eight thrifts have the most complex and troubled assets 
portfolios in the state said mary creedon of the dallas office 
of the fslic 
sunbelt savings fsb as the consolidated institution will be 
called will be headed by thomas j wageman now director of 
sunbelt savings association each of the eight merged thrifts will 
be operated as branches and depositors will be covered bank board 
officials said 
in the early 1980s sunbelt savings association thrived on real 
estate lending and according to federal regulators loose lending 
practices sunbelt and the seven other institutions had 
interlocking loans and investments often lending money for the 
same projects 
but as the texas property boom went bust in 1985 primarily 
because of an overbuilt market the fortunes of the eight 
institutions slid 
fridays announcement was the second in as many days of 
federally sponsored consolidations of troubled texas thrifts as 
part of the government plan to rid the state of mismanaged and 
poorly operating savings and loans thursday the fslic announced 
the consolidation of 12 troubled thrifts 
in utah a settlement was reached that would return 100 million 
to depositors in five failed thrifts 
the agreement announced friday night by gov norm bangerter 
would pay 100 million of the 106 million that was on deposit when 
the savings and loans collapsed in 1986 it also contained a 
provision to repay the remaining 6 million if and when the money 
is collected 
the five failed thrifts covered by the agreement which is 
subject to legislative approval were western heritage interlake 
copper state commerce financial and charter thrift and loan

workers at four more coal mines today went 
on strike and joined thousands of other miners dockworkers and 
transit workers in demanding legalization of the solidarity trade 
union federation 
at least 10 mines were crippled and the baltic port of szczecin 
was without dockworkers or public transportation in what appeared 
to be the nations worst labor unrest since 1981 unlike the 
nationwide strikes of 1981 however the current unrest was limited 
to two geographical areas 
we will not back down from our demands that solidarity be 
legalized said andrzej milczanowski a strike leader at the 
szczecin docks where about 2000 workers held an occupation strike 
the authorities must realize that if they want improvement 
they must restore solidarity he said 
reporters witnessed new strikes at the 3000worker krupinski 
mine in suszec and the 3500worker zmp mine in zory the staterun 
pap news agency said strikes also were under way at the first of 
may and borynia mines all the struck mines are in the southwestern 
region of silesia 
piotr hertig a spokesman for the intermine strike committee in 
jastrzebie said two other mines were on strike in the region 
brzeszcze and jaworzno mine officials reached by telephone denied 
the report 
since the strikes began tuesday poland has lost 110000 tons of 
coal production worth 55 million antoni pilny a spokesman for 
the jastrzebie area mining authority said friday the staterun 
news agency pap put the strikes cost at 222000 a day 
the council of ministers accused strike organizers of trying to 
take advantage of the material difficulties and hardships of 
everyday life 
instigators and organizers of the illegal strikes in which as 
a rule only part of the crew takes part not infrequently place at 
the top of the demands the issue of reactivating the former 
solidarity it is an unrealizable demand the council said 
solidarity leader lech walesa warned that workers at the lenin 
shipyard in gdansk would join the labor unrest unless the 
government legalizes solidarity the stikers are also demanding 
more pay and better working conditions 
the government says the strikes disrupt safety maintenance at 
the mines allowing potentially explosive methane gas to build up 
we appeal to our brother miners to their families youth and 
the whole population of the province to maintain reason and end 
the strikes the katowice provincial council said after a special 
meeting 
miners were told over loudspeakers they could be fired if they 
did not return to work but they ignored the warning dozens of 
police vans moved into the area around jastrzebie center of the 
labor unrest but there were no signs of immediate plans to end the 
strikes by force 
we are not afraid all the other miners are with us shouted 
an unidentified striker at the gate of the july manifesto mine 
where the coal strikes began tuesday 
we do feel danger said grzegorz stawski spokesman for the 
intermine strike committee but we get used to it 
walesa said at a gdansk rally that employees of the lenin 
shipyard where he works as an electrician were prepared to stop 
work monday 
fantastic we were waiting all the time for gdansk to join 
in said a woman at the intermine strike committee she spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a strike by gdansk shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth 
to solidarity the free trade union movement had a 15month legal 
existence before it was suppressed and outlawed after martial law 
was imposed in december 1981 
lenin shipyard workers struck in may to support steel workers 
who shut down the huge nowa huta steel mill the nowa huta strike 
ended with a predawn police raid and the workers later gave up 
without a settlement 
walesas call for a sympathy strike was applauded by the 500600 
workers at the rally who chanted there is no freedom without 
solidarity said slawomir majewski a solidarity activist in 
gdansk 
no talks with management were announced the strike committee 
said it was prepared to negotiate if its legal advisers and a 
priest were let into the july manifesto mine 
miners are treated as an elite sector of polands working class 
and earn the equivalent of about 177 a month nearly twice the 
national average but frequently are expected to work sevenday 
weeks under often hazardous conditions 
they say their pay is not enough to survive with polands 60 
percent inflation and nationwide price increases this year of 40 
percent 
this weeks strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in 
april and may which until then marked the worst labor unrest in 
poland since 1981 
production was stopped at the strikebound mines idling about 
40000 workers it was impossible to determine what percentage of 
the mine employees actively supported the strikes

president reagan lauded vice 
president george bush on saturday as a strong leader who has given 
him straightfromthe shoulder advice and offered voters a 
clear road map of his intentions if elected president 
im proud to stand with him reagan said in his weekly radio 
address delivered from his vacation hideaway in the santa ynez 
mountains 20 miles north of santa barbara 
the president will travel to los angeles on tuesday for a series 
of political speeches including a joint appearance wednesday with 
bush 
reagan who watched bushs acceptance speech at the republican 
national convention on television in his ranch house said after 
hearing his speech thursday night all americans could see what 
ive seen for eight years dedication integrity and commitment 
to principle a strong man and a strong leader 
and one other thing the president said george has always 
given me straightfromtheshoulder advice and counsel on how we 
could advance our vision for the future and hes always been 
candid with me when we disagreed 
he gave no examples 
the president drew a contrast between the detailed platform 
written by the republicans in new orleans and the relatively brief 
platform adopted at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
last month 
that document is a plethora of platitudes and it points up the 
difference between the two parties he said our friends in 
atlanta wont tell you what they will do if they get elected but 
george bush and dan quayle already have 
george and dan and our party have spread their road map out on 
the table for all to see while the other guys wont tell us where 
theyre going and wont even give us directions the president 
said it will take more than platitudes to convince the american 
people 
reagan also had praise for quayle the indiana senator bush 
chose for his vice presidential running mate he made no reference 
to the controversy over quayles service in the indiana national 
guard during the vietnam war 
the strength and wisdom of george bush was reflected this week 
in the strength and wisdom of the republican party itself just as 
the energy and enthusiasm of the party were reflected in the energy 
and enthusiasm of senator dan quayle he said 
dan was elected to the senate on the day i was first elected 
president dan shares with george bush and me a vision of an 
america and a world no longer threatened by the specter of nuclear 
attack thats why dan has labored with conviction for the 
strategic defense initiative 
and he shares a vision of opportunity for all americans and 
thats why hes stood with george bush and me throughout the fight 
to lower tax rates and increase opportunity for all americans 
in the democratic response to reagans remarks sen lloyd 
bentsen the democrats vice presidential nominee said the 
republicans have stood silent on major economic issues such as 
trade 
america is paying a heavy price for that republican neglect 
and indifference bentsen said in the radio remarks taped friday 
for broadcast saturday

attempt to provoke the ship 
irans islamic republic news agency quoted navy officers as 
saying the ship was intercepted and searched in the hormuz by 
naval units supported by helicopters it said the ship was 
found to be empty and allowed to proceed

dissent succeeded him 
tens of thousands of studentled protesters battled security 
forces across burma demanding sein lwins resignation democratic 
rights and an easing of economic hardships in a nation where rigid 
socialism and isolationism have spelled economic ruin 
sein lwin resigned aug 12 after 17 days in power the protests 
continued but focused on a demand for an end to oneparty rule 
on friday the nations attorney general maung maung succeeded 
sein lwin as state president and chairman of the burma socialist 
program party maung maung became the first civilian leader since 
ne win led a 1962 military coup and replaced democracy with a 
militarydominated oneparty system 
one of maung maungs first acts friday was to address the 
partys central committee he urged reconciliation noted the 
complaints of workers and students cautioned against anger and 
vengeance in seeking out those behind the violence and said every 
attempt must be made to prevent it from recurring 
the western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it was important that maung maungs speech did not rule out a 
multiparty system 
the diplomat described maung maung as kind of a compromise 
candidate who was not in the queue to be leader but who has 
shown concern over the students demands and is a civilian 
the asian diplomat reached by telephone in rangoon said 
burmese had a mixed reaction to maung maungs speech 
there is one group of people who say they will wait and see 
what he can do to meet the peoples desires and demands he said 
the other group of people say they arent satisfied with the 
speech and that they dont expect the ruling circle to keep 
whatever promise it makes 
it is too early to tell which group is the majority the 
diplomat said 
burmas parliament moved friday to defuse the situation by 
forming a committee to determine the wishes of the people 
people are waiting for the committee it has to report to 
parliament by the end of september and then we will see where the 
real power lies said the diplomat 
peaceful prodemocracy rallies were held almost daily last week 
observers say maung maungs real test will come monday when 
students have called for a nationwide strike to demand the 
oneparty system be dismantled 
radio rangoon quoting the ministry of health said 112 people 
were killed and 267 wounded in the riots in rangoon 
previous broadcasts had said about 95 people were killed and 240 
wounded in the aug 812 nationwide rioting during which security 
forces repeatedly fired to disperse crowds

a former top aide to lyndon b johnson portrays 
the late president as a fearful man whose world started slipping 
from his control in 1965 because of the pressures of political 
opposition and the vietnam war 
in a book titled remembering america a voice from the 
sixties former johnson senior speechwriter richard goodwin 
describes him as a president intensely fearful of his political 
rivals and wont to lapse into irrational ramblings about them 
the book soon to be published by littlebrown quotes johnson 
referring to blacks as niggers describing top foreign service 
officials as those damn kennedy ambassadors trying to get me and 
discredit me and accusing liberals and top newspaper columnists 
of being communists 
an advance chapter of the book provided to the associated press 
by an agent for the author focuses on johnsons behavior in 1965 
the year when he was at the height of his political power johnson 
was planning the first fullscale commitment of troops to vietnam 
while in congress he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty 
and civil rights 
goodwin although not a trained psychologist argues johnson 
exhibited paranoid behavior the conclusion is based on goodwins 
observations as well as discussions about johnson the author had at 
the time with a psychiatrist 
lyndon johnson had become a very dangerous man goodwin 
writes there is no question in my mind that both the atmosphere 
of the white house and the decisions taken until 1965 the only 
period i personally observed were affected by the periodic 
disruptions of lyndon johnsons mind and spirit 
although i never lost my affection and admiration for the 
man goodwin says johnsons world started slipping from his 
control in 1965 with pressures dissolving his confidence in his 
abilities to control events 
debate on vietnam at cabinet meetings was frowned upon and 
cabinet members warned senior aides not to offer any criticism of 
the war still johnson seemed well aware of the perils that 
awaited the nation there 
on july 14 two weeks before he ordered 100000 soldiers sent to 
vietnam goodwin writes johnson said of the war in southeast asia 
vietnam is like being in a plane without a parachute when all 
the engines go out if you jump youll probably be killed and if 
you stay in youll crash and probably burn 
the illfeeling the man who was president from 1963 to 1969 had 
toward robert kennedy liberals and the press has been well 
documented in past accounts goodwins book provides quotations of 
johnson from goodwins diary that support and elaborate on 
johnsons wellknown feelings 
johnson suspected kennedy of engineering civil rights 
disturbances to discredit him bobby saw his chance he saw i was 
in trouble so he put martin luther king on the payroll to rile up 
the negroes thats why we had the riots goodwin quotes him as 
saying 
shortly before delivering a major foreign policy address 
johnson ordered goodwin to delete several proposals on arms control 
because they too closely resembled ideas supported by kennedy 
i dont want one word in there that looks like im copying 
bobby kennedy johnson said according to the book 
kennedy made no secret of his dislike for johnson but said he 
was mystified by the presidents concern over his activities 
writes goodwin who was also a close friend of the new york senator 
and later a campaign aide 
goodwin a novelist freelance reporter and playwright said 
kennedy once told him after a private meeting with johnson that he 
couldnt stand the president but hes the most formidable human 
being ive ever met

like letters to a friend the feelings 
expressed in a survey of droughtweary retailers reveal the hurt 
despair and uncertainty gripping businesses as they struggle to 
survive the worst drought in decades 
i love my town and the people in it but if this continues we 
are not going to be able to afford to live here a cavalier 
county retailer wrote in response to a state tax department survey 
on the drought 
as the hot weather sucked the life from incomeproducing wheat 
fields and pastures across the state it dried up sales for many 
store owners who deal with farmers the surveys show 
some days you wonder if its worth turning on the lights 
said a williams county business owner you always wonder if tom 
dick or harry will still be farming next year by the same token 
we wonder if well still be here 
the way our books are looking at this time we are in the red 
and afraid of the long winter said a dickey county business 
owner 
the tax department mailed surveys to 700 retail businesses july 
27 trying to measure how much state revenues might decline because 
of the drought about 280 businesses returned the questionnaires by 
aug 10 
the numbers provide the evidence of the droughts effects 64 
percent of the respondents reported reduced sales from what the 
owners had expected 
tax commissioner heidi heitkamp agreed to make the surveys 
public but excluded the names of the businesses and any sales 
figures respondents were promised confidentiality 
it is just hard to see the hurt that is on these pages she 
said it is hard to see the despair in the small towns 
one barnes county business compared the states economy to the 
great depression the dirty 80s have not left us and i do not 
look for a big increase in sales for several years 
it takes two years to get back to normal after a drought in 
my opinion wrote a foster county retailer it is going to be a 
long hard winter for all of us 
well have to put all of our help on unemployment this fall 
and i had to take a second job we may have to refinance just to 
keep the doors open wrote a bottineau county businessman 
one business reported surviving tough times for years due to dry 
weather 
by 1983 even our business was beginning to slow down wrote 
the williams county store owner interesting note one week in 
july 1983 grossed more than the whole month of july 1988 
the drought is just another nail in the wooden box said a 
mountrail county business that has also been hit by hard times in 
the states oilproducing sector 
there were many pleas for help 
some place along the line someone is going to have to help us 
out a cavalier county business wrote if that doesnt happen 
then you might as it has been suggested turn this area into a 
great national park 
a handful of businesses sympathized with the farmers but said 
farmers always get bailed out of their problems 
what about the smallbusiness person we never get help a 
burleigh county respondent wrote 
three business owners used the surveys to write their companies 
obituaries 
our sales will drop to zero very soon as we intend to close 
this business and seek employment in another state one grand 
forks county retailer wrote 
but several retailers found a silver lining in the drought 
we have sold twice as many bird baths than we expected to 
people are feeling sorry for the birds it was a real different 
twist for our sales a ward county retailer wrote

hundreds of thousands of mourners 
jammed the grounds of the worlds largest mosque saturday and 
chanted praise as president mohammed zia ulhaq was buried 
acting president ghulam ishaq khan said he asked the united 
states to help investigate the dastardly crime of the crash 
wednesday that killed zia the us ambassador and 28 other people 
aboard a military c130 plane 
we do suspect that a c130 is such a stable plane that it 
doesnt disintegrate into thin air ishaq khan told reporters at 
his first news conference since taking office as president 
the enemy has penetrated the inner defenses of the country 
he said but he added that he had no proof that sabotage was to 
blame and that it would be pure speculation to cast suspicion 
on any group 
as zias funeral cortege moved slowly through the streets toward 
this citys white futuristic faisal mosque the nearly allmale 
crowd bade him farewell with chants from the koran the holy book 
of islam 
police would not give an estimate but reporters estimated more 
than 200000 mourners 
dozens of men clambered onto the mosques vaulted roof clinging 
to the soaring dome and pinnacle and shouted praise for zia an 
army general who ruled pakistan for 11 years 
other officials seemed certain the crash was no accident its 
generally felt that it was sabotage gen imranullah khan one of 
many senior army officers at the funeral told a reporter he 
refused to elaborate 
the crash of president zia ulhaqs aircraft was definitely 
sabotage but the investigation is still under way interior 
minister nasim ahmed was quoted by the urdulanguage newspaper jang 
as saying 
reports of sabotage have appeared in pakistani newspapers every 
day since zias plane crashed but most were unattributed and gave 
no details 
mourners many drenched in sweat from the 93degree heat surged 
for a final look as zia was buried on the mosques front lawn under 
a canopy of green and white the colors of pakistan officials and 
relatives threw handfuls of earth on the coffin to the sounds of a 
21gun salute 
mohammad khan junejo fired by zia as prime minister in may 
picked up a shovel and joined dignitaries in filling the grave 
us secretary of state george p shultz joined other foreign 
envoys in laying wreaths at the grave 
mourners began streaming toward the mosque early saturday 
morning many shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas and 
stopping for water at the gates of the swank villas lining the wide 
boulevard to the mosque 
my heart is crying for zia and i am praying for his 
salvation said mian ihtishamuddin 74 who came by bus from 
peshawar 100 miles west of the capital many expressed admiration 
for zias efforts to broaden the influence of islam in this country 
of 107 million 
the funeral cortege began its threemile journey from the 
presidents office shortly after noon with zias coffin inside a 
military ambulance 
the procession was broadcast live by staterun television and 
cameras focused briefly on the tearstained faces of zias widow 
shafiq and a son ijaz 
crowds standing as many as 50 deep on grassy knolls on each side 
of the road strained to catch a glimpse of the flagdraped coffin 
covered with tinsel and flowers soldiers with bayonets and riot 
police with bamboo sticks lined the streets 
among the mourners were at least 600 men sent by afghan 
guerrilla leaders who long have received support from zia in their 
fight against the sovietbacked marxist government in neighboring 
afghanistan 
strung cross the road in front of the mosque was a sign that 
read dear zia our hearts mourn and shed tears on your sad 
demise afghan mujahedeen guerrillas 
investigators were still searching for the cause of the crash 
that killed zia us ambassador arnold raphel and 28 others 
shultz landed friday night with robert oakley designated to 
replace raphel 
the 64yearold zia ruled pakistan since seizing power in a 
bloodless military coup in 1977 he was a staunch ally of the 
united states which appreciated the help he gave the afghan rebels 
shultz praised the smooth transfer of power to ishaq khan who 
as chairman of the senate was zias constitutional successor ishaq 
khan a 73yearold civilian so far seems acceptable both to the 
powerful military and to opposition politicians analysts here have 
said

iraqis crowded into stores and waved flags 
saturday on the first day of a ceasefire in the 8yearold war 
with iran but the government said iran violated the truce by 
killing an iraqi soldier 
un observers reported no violations on the front 
iraq also said that in the strait of hormuz an iranian 
helicopter gunship and a war vessel shadowed an iraqi merchant 
ship one of three sent into the gulf waters to test the truce 
the official iraqi news agency said an iranian soldier 
infiltrated an iraqi ground position and shot a private it did not 
say whether the iranian soldier was captured 
iraq did not retaliate for the iranian violation the iraqi 
agency said it was not clear exactly where the incident occurred 
and iran and the united nations had no immediate comment 
earlier maj gen slavko jovic commander of the un iraniraq 
military observers group said the ceeasefire was holding he said 
he had no information about violations and everything is going 
very fine 
most of the 350man observer group began patrolling the 730mile 
warfront at 7 am saturday capping a yearlong effort by the 
united nations to halt a war that has cost an estimated 15 million 
dead and wounded since it broke out in september 1980 
iraq accepted the ceasefire shortly after the security council 
approved it in july 1987 but iran accepted it only july 18 after a 
series of defeats 
jovics chief assistant canadian col john annand told 
reporters that a few technical hitches in transport and 
communications were the growing pains of a new mission with two 
countries who have absolutely no experience with this type of 
thing 
ceasefire celebrations continued into the morning processions 
of drivers honking their horns wound through the streets of this 
city of 35 million many waving iraqi flags 
many iraqis celebrated the ceasefire at shopping centers where 
they have suffered severe shortages of consumer goods over recent 
years 
minister of trade mohammed mahdi saleh termed the day an 
economic festival to mark celebrations of the great victories 
scored by our people 
in an interview published by the official army newspaper 
alqadissiya saleh said president saddam hussein ordered the 
ministry to flood staterun stores and local markets with goods 
the goods will be unlimited in quantity and that includes all 
kinds of goods available at the ministrys stores including such 
soughtafter items as televisions radios freezers and other 
electrical appliances saleh said 
iraqis lined up in front of state department stores by the 
hundreds to get first crack at the new goods 
iraqi oil minister issam abdelrahim said an iraqi merchant 
vessel the khawla sailed from fujairah in the gulf of oman and 
was later shadowed by an iranian helicopter gunship and a war 
vessel as it passed through the strait of hormuz gateway to the 
persian gulf 
the minister quoted by the official iraqi news agency said 
iran made an open attempt to provoke the ship 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
claimed iranian naval units backed by helicopters intercepted and 
searched the ship but let it go when no weapons were found 
iranian naval chief rear adm mohammad malekzadegan said earlier 
that iran would continue to intercept ships in the persian gulf 
until a comprehensive settlement was reached 
baghdad radio quoted iraqi naval commander rear adm abed 
mohammed abdullah as saying iraq would strongly resist such a 
measure which he called a serious violation of the ceasefire 
in a welcome sign of a gradual return to normal life an iraqi 
jetliner completed the first basratobaghdad flight since the 
early days of the war civilian traffic was halted at basras 
airport when iranian shelling devastated the southern port city 
iraqi soldiers continued to man antiaircraft batteries atop 
many of baghdads major highrise buildings and the government 
warned that the road to peace might be littered with hardships 
iraqi and iranian negotiators are to meet facetoface thursday 
in geneva to begin work on a comprehensive settlement of the 
conflict 
an unidentified iraqi military spokesman was quoted in 
saturdays newspapers as saying 
the ceasefire is likely to lead to comprehensive peace for 
which iraq has been endeavoring but there could be some who will 
try to hamper this process this requires that iraq should remain 
vigilant and not be complacent

a member of the chilean military 
junta says he would be willing to negotiate with the civilian 
opposition on farreaching political changes if the governments 
candidate is defeated in this falls plebiscite 
if the no wins in the yesorno vote there would have to 
be an accord between those who won the majority and the junta 
gen rodolfo stange told the fort lauderdale newssunsentinel in a 
story published saturday and if they want changes in the 
constitution well there would have to be an agreement on what 
those changes would be 
it was the first time a member of the fourman junta which 
includes the president gen augusto pinochet seemed to accept the 
oppositions argument that the defeat of the juntas nominee should 
be interpreted as a vote of no confidence that could lead to 
constitutional reform 
stange who is also commander of chiles national police made 
his comments friday in his office in santiago chile to reporters 
for the fort lauderdale newspaper and the independent of london 
pinochet has been in power since the bloody rightwing coup in 
1973 that overthrew electedmarxist president salvador allende 
pinochet has overall control of the nations political direction 
but shares power with the other three members of the junta 
sometime this fall probably in october chileans are slated to 
vote yes or no on a single candidate for president to be 
chosen by the junta late this month it is expected that pinochet 
will be that candidate 
according to the constitution which was enacted by the junta in 
1981 if the junta candidate is defeated then pinochet would stay 
in power for one year and hold open elections if pinochet wins the 
plebiscite he would stay in power until 1997 
stange put no limits on what could be negotiated between the 
junta and civilian political leaders in case of a no victory 
even the armed forces wide powers in the national security council 
could be discussed he said 
previously military authorities have rejected any suggestion 
that a possible defeat in the plebiscite might lead to major 
structural changes in the system 
stange even questioned whether pinochet should be the man on the 
ballot in the plebiscite the nominee should be someone who has 
the will and ability to unite all chileans so that the transition 
to democracy occurs in peace and stability he said 
asked if pinochet is best equipped to fulfill these 
requirements stange said that is a difficult question my 
responsibility is to find a candidate acceptable to the majority 
the ideal candidate should be a civilian stange said

a traffic patrolman who wrote more than 
1000 bogus tickets and gave some motorists a break will remain 
with the police department his superiors have decided 
ive lost 15 pounds over this its a hard way to diet said 
patrolman michael ghrist a 17year veteran of the louisville 
police department 
he was given a 25day suspension last month after the deception 
surfaced and officials decided last week to keep him on the force 
i just could not bring myself to write tickets i had a 
conscience l had a heart i started seeing the human beings behind 
the wheel the 36yearold officer explained in an interview 
thursday 
a computer listing indicated ghrist had written more than 1000 
tickets since 1981 to people for whom state employees could find no 
kentucky drivers licenses chief jefferson district judge donald 
smalley said 
initially officials thought only 100 tickets were involved but 
said later the number had been understated because of poor 
communication within the department 
there was no indication that he was shirking his duty city 
safety director tom kuster said he was just wasting a lot of 
paper and screwing up the courts statistical system 
ghrist said he started writing bogus tickets because if i 
gave too many people breaks my activity level would be too low 
police officials denied that there is a ticket quota system and 
said ghrist was motivated by selfimposed peer pressure

about 200 people gathered in 
pragues wenceslas square saturday on the 20th anniversary of the 
warsaw pact invasion that crushed reform in 1968 
they discussed the need for more freedom in czechoslovakia as 
uniformed and plainclothes police stood near the gathering and 
checked identity documents 
participants had responded to leaflets distributed to mailboxes 
by a group called the critical citizens 
earlier police detained the three spokesmen of the human rights 
group charter 77 as they walked to the soviet embassy with a 
statement demanding that the kremlin tell the truth about the 
invasion by soviet and warsaw pact tanks and troops on aug 2021 
1968 
the invasion crushed the prague spring of reform pioneered 
by thencommunist party leader alexander dubcek who was ousted in 
april 1969 and expelled from the communist party in 1970 
dubcek said in bratislava this week he planned to spend the 
anniversary quietly at his country cottage 
despite pouring rain about 200 people converged on wenceslas 
square the scene of fierce protests against the 1968 invasion 
the gathering reflected increased activism by a handful of 
independent groups formed in czechoslovakia since mikhail s 
gorbachev began implementing his reforms in the soviet union over 
the past three years 
a group of about 100 sang the czech and slovak national anthems 
then discussed what could be done to change the country some 
called for more religious freedom democratic elections and 
constitutional reform 
roman catholic believers in czechoslovakia have grown more 
active in recent months about a half million signed a petition to 
communist authorities this year demanding more bishops for vacant 
sees more priests and an end to alleged harassment of believers 
a young man who said he was from slovakia appeared to lead the 
hourlong discussion in which there was no specific mention of the 
1968 invasion western diplomats said those who had initiated the 
discussion were not known activists 
a group called czech children also distributed leaflets 
calling for a discussion on wenceslas square sunday 
charter 77 spokesmen stanislav devaty milos hajek and bohumir 
janat had announced plans to lay flowers on the square at the 
central committee building and at state radio to commemorate 
countrymen who were killed or injured in violence at those sites 
after the invasion 
but an unidentified man at the square told the crowd those 
with the stronger experience are not here they are in jail now 
the spokesmen of charter 77 are in the police station 
it was presumed the three spokesmen would be detained for 48 
hours and then released czechoslovak law allows detention for 48 
hours without charge 
police warned other leading group members before the weekend 
they would be detained and left town for the anniversary 
police presence was heavy in the capital saturday but few 
citizens were expected to make any public display of emotion over 
the anniversary 
commentaries in the staterun media continued to reflect the 
official view that the invasion was a painful but necessary move 
because dubcek and other leaders allowed reform to veer out of 
control threatening czechoslovakias ties to the warsaw pact

the government saturday announced a program to 
increase production of consumer goods said continuing shortages 
could undermine mikhail s gorbachevs reform efforts 
the council of ministers or soviet cabinet said it has ordered 
staterun industries to produce 38 billion more consumer goods in 
1989 and 1990 than originally planned the official tass news 
agency reported 
tass also reported the council plans an 18 percent increase in 
the total amount of consumer goods originally planned for 19911995 
it did not say what the original plans were 
the new economic directive also provides for an increase in the 
production of refrigerators and other electric appliances and 
promises to eliminate within two years shortages in automobile 
spare parts 
the council of ministers directed the soviet automobile industry 
to manufacture 23 million cars a year by the mid 1990s tass said 
in the first half of 1988 386000 cars were produced 
the newspaper moskovskaya pravda reported saturday that the 
black market price for a car is at least 28000 about triple the 
average official price accompanied by at least a oneyear wait for 
delivery after the order is placed tass said the number of 
refrigerators washing machines and kitchen appliances produced for 
every 100 soviet families is 20 percent less than in western 
countries the gap is even bigger in cars video hifi and radio 
equipment 
the new economic plan calls for production of 136 million 
television sets a year up from 10 million this year and 2 million 
video recorders compared to 70000 this year 
the government said it will buy western equipment for garment 
factories in order to increase by 50 percent the number of coats 
and jackets produced and shirts and knitwear by 20 percent tass 
reported it did not say how much western equipment would be 
purchased for the clothing industry or where it would be bought 
in the past the soviet union invested heavily in manufacturing 
equipment but many times has not been able to install or operate 
it properly 
shops selling fashionable clothes are rare in moscow and the 
more attractive goods often are sold out the same day they are 
displayed long lines form for many other goods that are of poor 
quality but are in short supply 
the ministers said the three years of gorbachevs reform efforts 
have failed to improve the supply of goods to soviet consumers and 
the kremlin leader himself has repeated the criticism many times 
the soviet leader has encouraged decentralization of control 
over local industry managers and better pay incentives for good 
work to try to improve the supply and quality of consumer goods a 
major goal of his reforms 
but gorbachev and his advisers acknowledge that consumers still 
are no better off than they were when the reforms began 
tass said a meeting of the policymaking central committee at 
the end of july pointed out that the ongoing scarcity of goods 
has an adverse impact on peoples attitudes to perestroika or 
restructuring subverts their trust in the reality of the 
transformations planned 
but the new government plan says nothing about improving the 
chronically poor quality of soviet goods which western economists 
say is the crucial problem they say production actually should be 
reduced in many cases to allow production of more modern and 
popular items

bank are no longer citizens of jordan but they may obtain 
temporary twoyear passports from the kingdom if they need a travel 
document officials said saturday 
it was the latest in a series of decisions by king hussein to 
sever links with the west bank and turn over responsibility to the 
palestine liberation organization 
all citizens residing in the west bank before july 31 are 
considered palestinian citizens not jordanians prime minister 
zaid rifai was quoted as saying by the official jordan news agency 
he said west bank residents can obtain temporary jordanian 
passports valid for two years if they desire 
the old fiveyear passports issued to west bank residents before 
july 31 the date that king hussein announced he was cutting links 
with the west bank will be valid until their expiration date 
but after then residents can obtain only the twoyear document 
another senior jordanian official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the new law would allow west bank residents to 
travel but not to qualify for jordanian citizenship 
about 850000 west bank residents carry a permanent jordanian 
passport valid for five years and renewable on demand for another 
permanent passport 
in addition a minority of the 650000 gaza strip residents 
already hold temporary jordanian passports valid for three years 
they will be replaced with the twoyear passports upon expiration 
hussein has dissolved the lower house of parliament half of 
whose members were palestinian dissolved the occupied territories 
ministry canceled a 13 billion development plan for the 
territories and laid off or retired thousands of state employees 
rifai said if schools in the west bank opted for the jordanian 
system the ministry of education in amman would make arrangements 
for exams to be held on the west bank 
but he said the tests would be corrected and grades would be 
given by the ministry in jordan 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war

as the 1988 olympics in south korea approach 
supermarket checker vicki mcclure vividly recalls singing to the 
world during the opening ceremonies of the summer games four years 
ago 
it was the most spectacular moment it was bigger than life 
she said it was a really magical experience 
ms mcclure a musical unknown sang the hit reach out and 
touch somebodys hand at the opening ceremonies of the 1984 
olympics at los angeles memorial coliseum 
but ms mcclure 34 who still works three days a week as a 
checker at a market in los angeles in addition to taking parttime 
singing jobs is glad in a way that her moment in the spotlight 
wasnt a springboard to a famous singing career 
i didnt have any expectations she said in a telephone 
interview from her santa monica home im not disappointed for 
what has happened because being thrust in at that level with my 
inexperience would have been a mistake 
i really wouldnt have had an inkling of how to handle it 
she added 
the 7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was 
staged before a capacity crowd of 90000 and an international 
television audience 
the show included a 1000voice choir a 750piece marching 
band a 100piece symphony orchestra 7500 athletes and 2500 
pigeons 
ms mcclure appeared as the lead singer for the los angeles jazz 
choir a position originally intended for a star of the caliber of 
diana ross or leontyne pryce 
she said she was first hired by the olympics as a musician who 
could serve as a standby soloist but after olympics officials 
heard her sing they chose her to perform with the jazz choir 
because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer in the 
spotlight 
it was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the 
olympics she said 
ms mcclure said she is happy working as a parttime 
professional singer performing solo at banquets and ceremonies and 
with the group daddys money which does nostalgic and rhythm and 
blues songs 
i havent really done a vicki mcclure act as of yet she 
said im still looking for a repertoire its hard to find 
material youre comfortable with by yourself 
she said that as long as she can support herself she is happy 
continuing with her current musical path 
it takes a lot of artistic development to find your niche

police raided a printing company to crack down 
on a newspaper that published an interview with perus bestknown 
guerrilla leader the newspapers editor said saturday 
luis arce told reporters that 40 police officers swept into the 
lima printing firm imprenta pedro leon before dawn friday arrested 
owner pedro leon and four employees and confiscated 100000 copies 
of el diario 
police sources confirmed the raid took place but refused to 
provide details 
arce charged the government with harassing the paper in an 
effort to force it out of business 
we have no guns not even a knife the government is trying 
to put us out of business he said 
the government alleges el diario is the voice of the shining 
path guerrilla organization whose insurgency to impose marxist 
rule in peru has claimed more than 15000 lives in eight years el 
diario is openly marxist but has denied links to the guerrilla 
movement 
but independent observers say el diario reflects the ideology 
and political objectives of the rebel group more accurately than 
any other publication 
the lima tabloid drew widespread criticism on july 24 when it 
published a 48page interview it claimed was the first with shining 
path leader abimael guzman since the rebels launched their 
insurgency in 1980 
four days later president alan garcia asked congress to pass a 
law empowering the government to close media believed to support 
terrorists lawmakers are studying the proposal 
el diario reprinted the interview july 31 the day on which the 
newspapers contract with its printer expired the agreement was 
not renewed according to arce 
since then el diario has had trouble finding another printer 
and has appeared only intermittently arce said adding that the 
government has intimidated lima printing companies into not working 
with the newspaper 
arce said the edition seized by police was a special third 
printing of the guzman interview 
in the article guzman was quoted as saying the shining path 
would not hold talks with the government until the rebels were 
ready to change from a guerrilla to a conventional war 
he was quoted as saying perus chronic economic problems 
eventually would foment a general insurrection led by the shining 
path but did not give a timetable for the revolt

nelson mandelas health has 
improved and the jailed black leader has an excellent chance of 
completely recovering from tuberculosis doctors said saturday 
leading newspapers meanwhile predicted the leader of the 
outlawed african national congress soon may be released from 
prison the star the countrys largest daily said mandela is 
one step from freedom 
the 70yearold mandela south africas bestknown black leader 
was diagnosed with tuberculosis and transferred aug 12 from 
pollsmoor prison to nearby tygerberg hospital in cape town 
mr mandela is responding well to our treatment said dr 
jgl strauss superintendent of tygerberg he is cheerful and 
is up and about 
strauss said the prognosis for mandelas full recovery was 
excellent 
mandelas family asked the government friday to release 
mandelas medical records to resolve nagging doubts about how 
he contracted tuberculosis 
the family questioned whether conditions at pollsmoor prison 
caused mandelas illness and whether prison doctors could have made 
a quicker diagnosis 
mandela first complained about his health july 28 but was not 
transferred to tygerberg hospital until two weeks later the 
governments prisons service has said 
the government insists mandela has been receiving the best 
possible treatment strauss said doctors who have seen mandela 
include the swiss president of the european society of pneumology 
dr heinrich hertzog 
meanwhile the star quoted minister of information stoffel van 
der merwe on saturday as saying security concerns were the main 
reason mandela remained imprisoned 
there is no reason to punish him further for the crimes of the 
1960s van der merwe told the star the government is now 
concerned with what the security implications would be for 
the country if he were released 
mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 he is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteled 
government 
botha said thursday that mandelas release was under serious 
consideration he indicated the government was trying to persuade 
mandela to accept its condition that he renounce violence 
the president has been making the same offer since 1986 
however mandela has said the governments 1960 decision to ban the 
african national congress which operated peacefully at the time 
left him no option but to fight 
mandela says he will disavow violence only if the government 
lifts its ban on his group dismantles the apartheid system of 
racial segregation and extends full political rights to the 
nations 26million member black majority 
the african national congress based in lusaka zambia is the 
main black group attempting to undermine the government and 
apartheid 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts 
schools and health services 
the progovernment newspaper beeld reported saturday that 
influential academics with close government contacts were urging 
authorities to bring the mandela issue to an end 
kurt von schirnding the countrys former un ambassador and 
head of the south africa foundation a private research group told 
beeld the government should try to avoid the appearance of bowing 
to international pressure 
but he added the issue must be resolved 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statements 
the government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations 
has not been comprehensive

a federal jury assessed the flamboyant hunt 
brothers more than 130 million in damages saturday after finding 
that they had conspired to corner the world silver market in the 
late 1970s 
the jury said the three hunt brothers and two other defendants 
had ruined the investments of the peruvian governments mineral 
marketing company minpeco sa by sending the price of silver to 
artificial heights 
all of the hunts but one lamar 56 owner of the national 
football leagues kansas city chiefs also were found to have 
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the 
silver market since the case is a civil one there would be no 
criminal penalties attached to the finding 
the verdict was a victory for minpeco which lost millions in 
the volatile silver market and a setback for the three sons of the 
late texas oilman hl hunt 
the jury found that international metals investment co and 
mahmoud fustok had participated in the conspiracy with the three 
hunt brothers 
fustok is a prominent race horseowner and brotherinlaw of the 
saudi arabian crown prince 
none of the hunts would comment but a lawyer representing them 
paul j curran said im disappointed and we disagree with the 
jury asked if the defendants would appeal he replied that the 
jurys verdict is just the first step in the process 
a lawyer for minpeco mark cymrot said the jury rewarded the 
companys perseverance and faith in the us system 
minpeco is very happy cymrot said 
another lawyer for minpeco shaun corette said he doubted the 
verdict had opened the door for criminal charges against the hunts 
since the statute of limitations would have run out 
the findings came on the jurys sixth day of deliberations and 
only after it appeared that there might be no verdict at all the 
jury of three men and three women sent a note to judge morris e 
lasker earlier saturday saying very sorry to say we have been 
unable to reach a unanimous decision 
when lasker asked them to read the findings they had reached 
the jury forewoman answered yes to everything except the 
racketeering charge against lamar hunt she answered no to that 
the judge ordered the jury to continue deliberations after it 
failed to determine damages in the case about two hours later the 
jury decided price increase the hunts had engineered cost minpeco 
63 million in short silver futures contracts 
the jury also determined that the hunts cost minpeco 245 
million in interest on loans to pay for its losses and 122 
million in future trades however the jury also said the damages 
should be offset by 334 million that minpeco earned in profits on 
silver it held during the same period 
because of the reacketeering charge some of the figures are 
trebled cymrot estimated the damages at 134 million but curran 
said he calculated them to be 1326 million 
minpeco had claimed that lamar and his two brothers nelson 
bunker hunt 62 and william herbert hunt 59 who also has 
extensive real estate holdings conspired unsuccessfully with 
several middle east businessmen to corner the silver market 
three others two arab sheiks and a lebanese businessman are 
living outside the united states and did not challenge minpecos 
court papers 
minpeco claimed the conspiracy violated antitrust commodity 
exchange and civil racketeering laws it sought treble damages 
some 450 million through the allegations that the conspiracy 
constituted a racketeering enterprise that used wire and mail fraud 
to achieve its aims 
because it was a civil lawsuit minpeco had to prove its case 
only by a preponderance of the evidence rather than the beyond a 
reasonable doubt standard required of criminal prosecutions 
six financial institutions originally named in the suit 
including some of wall streets biggest names settled out of court 
for a total of nearly 65 million before the trial began those 
defendants included merrill lynch amp co prudentialbache 
securities ef hutton amp co inc banque populaire suisse 
conticommodity services inc and aml futures 
testimony during the trial which began in february sometimes 
sounded like the script from a network miniseries witnesses 
described meetings at exotic locales around the world and the high 
finance world of swiss bankers arab sheiks and wall street 
commodities traders 
lawyers for minpeco charged the hunts and their codefendants 
were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about 9 
an ounce to more than 50 an ounce between september 1979 and 
january 1980 
minpeco claimed it lost more than 100 million due to 
skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about 10 an ounce in 
march 1980 when the hunts failed to meet a margin call for 100 
million in silver future contracts 
minpeco had a large short position in the silver futures market 
which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose 
money on rising prices

one of four andean condors en route to a 
wilderness area for an experiment on how to reintroduce endangered 
california condors into the wild died saturday 
the other three zoobred andean condors were safely placed in 
secret holding pens in los padres national forest and more will be 
brought to the area in october said joe dowhan of the us fish 
and wildlife service 
this was a real shock especially because the first three 
birds came through well said dowhan but except for everybody 
being down right now it has very little effect on the program 
the andean birds all female are being used to test techniques 
biologists hope to use to begin returning the california condor to 
nature 
the andean condor was chosen because its the closest relative 
to the california condor the andean condors also are endangered 
but they number in the thousands 
scientists are doing the experiment to see how birds hatched in 
captivity adapt to freedom fending for themselves in a region 
without native birds of their species as role models 
the four andean condors were transported in airlinestyle animal 
shipping crates 
two came from the san diego wild animal park one was from the 
us fish and wildlife service center in patuxent md and the one 
that died came from the los angeles zoo dowhan said 
were not sure why this particular bird died we discovered it 
died just before we released it so it happened somewhere in 
transit said dowhan 
the 3 and 4monthold birds will spend several weeks in mesh 
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northeast of los angeles 
scientists will prepare them for their first flights over the 
dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large population 
of california condors but whose numbers have dwindled to 28 all 
in captivity 
when the andean birds are able to fly sometime in november 
scientists will fit them with radio monitoring gear release them 
and monitor their progress

president lazarus salii was found shot to 
death in his home saturday the second president in a row to die by 
gunfire in this tiny isolated pacific island chain that has been 
split by a dispute over a proposed selfgovernance agreement with 
the united states 
it was not immediately known if salii 54 had killed himself or 
was shot by an unknown assailant police officer theodore obak at 
first said an unknown gunman had fired the shot but a government 
spokesman said later that a gun was found and suicide had not been 
ruled out 
chester pavlovski the us state departments representative in 
palau said investigators are going along the line its 
selfinflicted there are indications thats what it was 
pavlovski said he had no details on what evidence pointed to 
suicide 
vice president thomas remengesau sr who also was palaus 
minister of justice was sworn in as the new president remengesau 
57 will serve out the remainder of saliis term which ends later 
this year 
palau about 4500 miles southwest of hawaii and 600 miles east 
of the philippines has been beset by economic and political 
problems the chain with a population of 15000 has been 
administered by the united states since the end of world war ii 
salii was elected in august 1985 to succeed haruo remeliik the 
countrys first elected president who was gunned down outside his 
home two months earlier 
three men were convicted for the crime but were later acquitted 
on appeal two of the three were relatives of a political opponent 
of remeliik 
bonifacio basilius a special assistant to the president said 
salii was sitting alone in his house while his wife driver and 
maid were eating lunch outside 
the three heard what they thought was a shot about 130 pm the 
driver checked the grounds of the house and found nothing unusual 
about 20 minutes later mrs salii went into the house and found 
her husband shot once in the head basilius saidhe was pronounced 
dead at a hospital 
police found a 357caliber magnum revolver and a spent bullet 
he said 
asked if the death was a suicide basilius said were not 
ruling out anything he declined to comment further 
koror the capital was quiet 
the people are shocked but are very calm there is no 
problem everything is under control basilius said everywhere 
you go the people are talking in hushed tones 
both salii and remeliik were strong supporters of a proposed 
compact of free association with the united states which would 
provide for selfgovernance and continued us economic aid 
in the wake of world war ii the united nations placed several 
groups of pacific islands all previously held by japan in a 
unique strategic trusteeship administered by the united states in 
the past decade all of the island groups but palau have approved 
plans for selfgovernance 
since 1983 palauans have voted several times on the proposed 
compact of free association the proposal includes giving us 
warships the right to visit the islands 
palauan courts have held that the compact conflicts with 
antinuclear provisions of palaus constitution since those 
warships could contain nuclear weapons the constitution provides 
that the antinuclear provisions could be overridden by a 75 
percent majority vote however in several compact plebiscites the 
highest voter approval has been 73 percent 
last september the father of a man associated with a group that 
opposes the compact and wants to retain the antinuclear clause in 
the constitution was killed several anticompact activists said 
they were threatened by compact supporters 
palau has long been regarded as a possible fallback site in 
event the united states loses its military bases in the 
philippines one of the islands in the group peleliu was a major 
battleground in world war ii 
the us state department said fbi and other american law 
enforcement officials were present in palau at the time of saliis 
death in connection with a law training program 
they are cooperating with the ministry of justice in palau in 
the investigation of saliis death the state department said

michael dukakis said saturday that 
george bush is taking the republican party farther and farther 
away from the mainstream and questioned the republican vice 
presidents vow to create 30 million jobs if elected president 
the democratic presidential candidate linked up with his vice 
presidential running mate sen lloyd bentsen for a visit with 
lady bird johnson at the lbj ranch 
after having breakfast with mrs johnson dukakis paid tribute 
to her and saluted late husband for the passion and comitment he 
had to people especially to people who needed a helping hand and a 
leg up on the road to opportunity 
then they all visited lyndon b johnsons grave moving quietly 
beneath giant oak trees 
dukakis never referred to president john f kennedy by name but 
recalled that another son of massachusetts won the presidency 
in 1960 with johnson as his running mate 
it was an obvious effort to keep alive the bostonaustin 
connection that democrats hope will help them at the polls 
at a news conference at the 250acre ranch dukakis said bushs 
choice of conservative sen dan quayle of indiana as his running 
mate signaled an effort to bring gop policies further to the right 
my sense is that the republican party is moving farther and 
farther away from the mainstream while senator bentsen and i are 
campaigning on main street dukakis said 
the democratic ticket mates also appeared together at a rally in 
nearby johnson city before splitting up dukakis headed to a county 
fair in lebanon tenn on his way home to boston while bentsen 
traveled to a fundraising dinner in florida 
at the wilson county fair in lebanon dukakis inspected 
prizewinning cattle fed milk to a calf and rode on a mulepulled 
cart 
bentsen will fly to boston on monday to attend a national 
security briefing at dukakis home to be conducted by cia director 
william webster 
both were on the road during the republican national convention 
dukakis campaigned in several states while bentsen stayed close to 
home in texas except for one quick trip to arkansas 
on saturday they continued to pound away at the two issues they 
have accused bush of ducking the federal trade and budget deficits 
and dukakis was skeptical of bushs declaration that he could 
create 30 million new jobs if elected 
harold wilson once said never put a date and a number in the 
same sentence dukakis said i think its good advice i 
dont see any evidence that this republican ticket even understands 
how to create jobs especially in those parts of the country that 
are hurting and hurting badly 
he declined to predict how many new jobs he could help create as 
president 
dukakis predicted the democratic ticket would carry texas 
considered a bush stronghold until dukakis tapped bentsen to run 
with him 
bentsen in a message to his fellow texans praised dukakis 
integrity and record of economic development 
this man from new england really talks our language bentsen 
said and that language is one that is understood across the 
country 
dukakis and bentsen continued to criticize quayle by mentioning 
bentsens leadership role in the passage of several major bills 
including a trade bill president reagan is scheduled to sign this 
week 
on that trade bill this administration was no help 
whatsoever bentsen said ill bet theyll try very hard to do 
that the senator said when asked if he thought republicans would 
try to take credit for the bill 
there was a somewhat awkward moment at the ranch when dukakis 
with mrs johnson standing behind him discussed his opposition to 
the vietnam war president johnson escalated the us presence in 
vietnam 
it was a war that divided this country that in some ways 
were still recovering from dukakis said 
dukakis and bentsen accompanied by their wives and mrs 
johnson were greeted by mrs johnson when they arrived at an 
airstrip on the ranch she served them a country breakfast of 
bacon eggs grits biscuits peaches and figs 
i have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for 
these four folks mrs johnson told reporters gathered outside 
her home on the bank of the pedernales river hereford cattle a 
favorite of the late president roamed across a road as dukakis 
motorcade drove off

iowa cattle farmers in desperate need of 
hay to supplement droughtdepleted supplies would love to accept 
idahos offer of help but few farmers can take the time off to go 
and get it 
the iowa farm bureau is having trouble finding volunteers to 
travel to idaho and harvest hay because many farmers cant leave 
home for a week to 10 days the drought of 88 has forced them to 
haul water and feed to cattle that normally would be grazing and 
drinking on their own said don murdock a regional manager for the 
bureau 
a group of cattle farmers in parched southern iowa is to leave 
monday for a 37hour bus ride to orofino idaho but murdock said 
saturday that while transportation housing and meals all have been 
donated he still has only 20 farmers who can go he would like to 
get at least 40 
murdock said the idaho farm bureau offered unlimited hay to 
droughtstricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the 
harvest 
the venture is a cooperative effort of the farm bureaus in idaho 
and iowa with greyhound donating a bus for the trip the 
burlington northern railroad donating freight space for the hay and 
three banks putting up cash for meals along the way 
murdock said that while he is having difficulty finding farm 
workers with the time to spare for the harvest farmers were 
extremely grateful for the offer 
i have never worked on a project that has received the 
acclamation pleasure and impact this has he said people 
become emotional when they learn this has been donated

at the main gate of szczecins 
sprawling strikebound port a steady stream of women pushing baby 
carriages and carrying buckets of food has replaced the normal 
caravan of rumbling trucks 
the wives of the longshoremen who went on strike wednesday are 
visiting about 2000 men holed up on the docks of this baltic city 
on the odra river near the east german border 
weve got enough food stockpiled to last us a week said a 
beaming worker in his late 20s 
supporters of solidarity to which the men belong carried bread 
and vegetables through gates festooned with the flags and banners 
of the outlawed independent union federation 
shortly after the strike began negotiations broke down between 
management and workers who remain steadfast in their demand that 
the government grant legal status to their union 
in 1981 the communist government arrested many solidarity 
leaders in a military crackdown solidarity was outlawed in 1982 
solidarity leaders said the harbor strike and a walkout by the 
citys transit workers arose from growing dissatisfaction with the 
policies of staterun unions and anger over polands deteriorating 
economy 
the strikes have idled port operations and brought city transit 
services almost to a standstill 
at the july manifesto mine in jastrzebie in the southwest 
spirits also were high strikers sitting on makeshift wooden 
benches spoke bravely 
we wont go back to work until we get a second trade union 
shouted one miner tanned by the hot summer sun we will stay here 
until the end said another still others cheered 
we believe the government will have to recognize us because we 
are in the heart of polands industry said miner jan golec 
management for the first time saturday allowed three priests 
into the mine and a mass was planned sunday the strikers erected 
a 6foot white cross with a picture of pope john paul ii in front 
of the building where the strike committee meets 
mine officials also permitted workers to buy cigarettes food 
and bottled drinks at a lunchstand inside the mine 
meanwhile some miners expressed bitterness about their economic 
plight a miner is forced to work saturday and sunday to be able 
to support his family said jerzy nowosielski of the mines 
strike committee 
polands new wave of labor unrest began tuesday when coal 
miners at the july manifesto mine declared their occupation strike 
the mood quickly spread to szczecin a city of 395000 and the 
countrys largest port city after gdansk 
the strike began spontaneously when we got our paychecks last 
week said edward radziewicz a forklift operator who heads the 
interfactory strike committee representing dock and transit 
workers it became very clear that we had no one to stand up for 
our interest and that we were on our own 
workers here said they had no faith in the official unions 
ability or desire to represent them and complained that rampant 
inflation has cutting into their buying power 
the union represents management and its interest and not us 
said a young dockworker who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a 50yearold crane operator said he could barely make ends meet 
on his salary 
after 30 years on the dock i get paid 67 a month a 
blackandwhite television costs 156 dollars we got an 11 percent 
pay increase recently but prices went up by more than 40 
percent he said 
transit workers at a nearby bus depot had similar views 
reinstatement of solidarity is the first step in setting up 
further talks said romuald ziolkowski head of the depots 
strike committee we can negotiate wages later 
he said 1800 transit workers were on strike and were posted at 
the depots gates which were blocked by buses 
thousands of residents in outlying apartment complexes saturday 
trudged past empty bus stops into town to shop staterun food 
stores said sugar and flour were quickly disappearing from store 
shelves 
the run on staples indicated that residents were bracing for the 
possibility of more strikes and shortages 
city officials urged factory and tourist buses in service to aid 
stranded commuters but the transit strike has been a boon for the 
citys taxi drivers 
business is flourishing said one driver in downtown 
szczecin

thursday and friday found bush riding a favorable reaction to the 
republican convention which concluded thursday

crack cocaine addicts desperate for money to 
support their habits are breaking into already needy churches in 
north dade county and stealing everything from childrens toys to 
religious icons 
thirtyfive churches in the county have been burglarized an 
average of three times each this year 
we are attributing 90 percent of these robberies to drug 
addicts looking to turn over a quick buck on anything they can 
steal for a piece of crack they dont care about the sacredness 
of the church said metro special investigations unit detective 
don white 
besides toys and religious articles other items stolen have 
included toilet paper speakers microphones amplifiers food 
typewriters telephones adding machines and yard tools 
most of the churches are within walking distance of crack 
houses white said adding that the number might be even higher 
than reported because many ministers have told him they fear their 
insurance premiums will go up if they report burglaries 
new mount zion church has been hit 20 times this year but 
deacon danny swain has reported only one 
what can we do swain asked burglars break the windows 
and every time we replace one they just break it again that costs 
about 100 to 200 each time 
when the burglars hit the daycare center in june they stole 
toys and 200 worth of food and milk he said can you imagine 
stealing things that belong to children 
deacon herbert long of bethany seventhday adventist said his 
parishioners dug deep to put in a 3500 alarm system in july but 
that cut into the churchs limited resources 
before july we had deacons taking turns in twos to sit up at 
the church between 1 am and 6 am to see if they could spot the 
thief long said he would always strike afterward when the 
deacons would leave

republican george bush and the young vietnamera senator he 
hopes will share the white house with him pitched horseshoes 
saturday and bush said the flap over his running mates national 
guard membership is a tempest in a teapot 
the democratic contenders sought political solace at the grave 
site of lyndon b johnson 
despite the gop controversy vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle bush received some favorable news from a newsweek poll 
released saturday it said bush would defeat gov michael dukakis 
by 51 percent to 42 percent if the presidential election were held 
now 
the poll of 1000 registered voters found that 43 percent of 
those contacted said they were more likely to vote for bush because 
of what they saw or read during last weeks republican convention 
fifty percent said they were more likely to vote for bush after 
watching the vice presidents acceptance speech on thursday 
the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points 
bush joined quayle during an appearance at the ohio state 
fairgrounds to answer questions about the indiana senator joining 
the national guard during the vietnam war 
the current vice president said his reasoning in selecting 
quayle as his running mate was very sound and the american 
people are going to see that loud and clear 
bush conceding that questions about quayle had overshadowed 
their campaign plans but declared i think it will turn out to 
be a tempest in a teapot 
he said news media attention to the questions reminded him of 
bluefish when theyre swimming around all in a frenzy 
quayle defended himself for the second straight day at an 
impromptu news conference and also said he had not misled bush 
campaign officials in talks leading to his selection 
i told the bush campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my 
military record and im sticking to it he said 
on a lighter note at the fair both bush and quayle pitched a 
few horseshoes along with contestants in the state contest bush 
who pitches horseshoes for relaxation at his home in washington 
scored a ringer after several tries quayle did not 
it was still early in the day when michael dukakis signaled his 
determination to fight hard to get texas and other southern states 
in the democratic column on election day 
running mate lloyd bentsen confided to reporters that the greek 
immigrants son spooned picante sauce onto his grits seeming to 
like it during breakfast at the lbj ranch 
dukakis was stopping off in nashville tenn en route back home 
to boston for the night bentsen was swinging through florida on 
his return home to washington 
after breakfast dukakis and bentsen and their wives drove over 
to the bank of the pedernales river where former president johnson 
is buried in a family plot shaded by huge live oak trees 
i have great confidence and great pride and high hopes for 
these four folks johnsons widow lady bird told reporters 
reporters were kept well back while mrs johnson and her guests 
strolled near the grave 
earlier dukakis had saluted the man buried there for the 
passion and commitment he had to people especially to people who 
needed a helping hand and a leg up on the road to opportunity 
there was a somewhat awkward moment when dukakis with mrs 
johnson standing behind him reminded reporters of his opposition 
to the same vietnam war that johnson had escalated 
it was a war that divided this country that in some ways 
were still recovering from dukakis said 
there was a certain irony given the furor surrounding quayles 
acknowledgement that he sought assistance needed or not to get 
into the indiana national guard in 1969 while many other young men 
entering combat in vietnam the controversy over the war ultimately 
forced johnson to decide against seeking reelection in 1968 
quayle has said he is and was then at age 22 a supporter of 
us involvement in the war he also has said there should have 
been more of an allout effort to win the conflict 
although he figuratively passed the gop political baton to bush 
last week at the partys new orleans convention president reagan 
gave it another hearty wave saturday 
in his weekly radio address broadcast from his mountain 
hideaway in california reagan said bush as vice president never 
held back from straight talk 
george has always given me straightfromtheshoulder advice 
and counsel on how we could advance our vision for the future 
said reagan and hes always been candid with me when we 
disagreed 
reagan gave no examples

mrs wilhelm had been baby sitting with the boy and his 
6yearold sister sarah zins and was taking them home on a rural 
road about 8 pm when a rainstorm flooded salt creek 
two friends randy macyauski and william d effing happened to 
be watching the flooded creek and tried to warn the car to stop as 
4 feet of water gushed over a primitive bridge police said 
after the vehicle plunged into the stream macyauski ran 
downstream and dove in to rescue the girl who had climbed out a 
window of the car effing hung out over the creek on a tree limb 
and tried to grab the woman and boy but the limb broke and effing 
was swept downstream a few hundred feet before he managed to climb 
out 
the bridge consisted only of a concrete slab bare said adding 
that most residents of the area know to use caution with such 
bridges during sudden storms 
in the flash flood conditions such as existed last night its 
not at all uncommon for the water to go over the top of the slab 
he said saturday weve had several instances in the past where 
cars have been washed off 
the accident occurred about 6 miles north of batesville in

military leaders met in emergency session 
and troops moved across the southern region of silesia on saturday 
after workers at four more coal mines joined nationwide strikes to 
demand legalization of solidarity 
polands leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and the national 
defense committee reached appropriate decisions in connection 
with the present threats the staterun news agency pap said 
the brief dispatch gave no hint about what the government 
planned to do about the strongest challenge to communist 
authorities since solidarity the independent union federation was 
crushed in 1981 
opposition activists said police and army were on the move in 
silesia where the 10 coal mine strikes were centered 
unusual police movements also were reported in krakow and nowa 
huta the scene of a cripping steel strike last spring 
there are helicopters flying over jastrzebie and many army 
units near police are also erecting roadblocks at the towns 
outskirts just like during martial law said adam slomka a 
leader of the rightist opposition group confederation for 
independent poland in katowice 
we want to appeal to miners to be on the alert put on all 
possible lights and make sure they will not take them by surprise 
an associated press reporter saw long police convoys on the 
36mile route between the silesia city of jastrzebie and the 
provincial capital of katowice 
there are many armyandpolice patrols as if they suddenly 
ran short of police lech bosiak a jastrzebie resident said 
late saturday most of the patrols are two soldiers and two 
police 
a government spokesman asked saturday if he could rule out 
police intervention in the strikes said only its 8 oclock 
and well have nothing more for you tonight 
pap carried a dispatch accusing strikers of forcibly keeping 
some miners locked in at the strikebound mines and of having 
crowbars and other such objects for alleged defense action 
solidarity meanwhile observed its eighth anniversary this 
week the movement was suppressed with the imposition of martial 
law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982 
the government rejected the demand to legalize it and said the 
strikes harmed every pole 
about 40000 workers were participating in the coal strikes 
which were costing an estimated 13 million in lost coal 
production daily production was stopped but it was impossible to 
determine what percentage of mine employees actively supported the 
strikes 
spirits were high among 2000 cargo workers occupying the docks 
of polands secondbusiest port in szczecin since wednesday bus 
and most tram drivers there went on strike thursday and friday 
crippling public transport 
the four mines that joined the walkouts saturday were the 
3000worker krupinski mine in suszec the 3500worker zmp mine in 
zory and the first of may and borynia mines in jastrzebie 
authorities confirmed 10 coal mine strikes in the vital 
coalproducing region of silesia concentrated around jastrzebie a 
city of 100000 people near the czechoslovak border also 
solidarity activists said two more mines were on strike but the 
claim was disputed by mine officials 
solidarity activists from the nowa huta steel mill outside 
krakow issued a statement saturday announcing strike readiness 
workers said they would call a strike if police intervened against 
strikes elsewhere a similar warning came from activists of the 
ursus tractor plant outside warsaw 
on friday national solidarity leader lech walesa threatened a 
strike monday at the lenin shipyard in gdansk unless solidarity was 
recognized 
a 1980 strike by the shipyard workers eight years ago gave birth 
to solidarity the east blocs first independent trade union 
solidarity had a 15month legal existence and signed up 10 million 
members before being suppressed 
polands council of ministers said in a statement friday that 
legalizing solidarity was an unrealizable demand but workers 
said they disagreed 
we will not back down from our demands that solidarity be 
legalized said andrzej milczanowski a szczecin docks strike 
leader the authorities must realize if they want improvement 
they must restore solidarity 
i cant predict how or when it will end said edward 
radziewicz chairman of the interfactory strike committee in 
szczecin we may win or we may be removed by force but we cannot 
back up even one step because there is only water behind us 
the labor unrest began tuesday at the july manifesto mine in 
jastrzebie one of polands most modern mines producing highgrade 
coal for export 
staterun radio and television devoted heavy coverage to the 
labor unrest including reporting the demands for legalizing 
solidarity the reports emphasized the mounting cost of the strike 
the weeks strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages in 
april and may which until then were the worst labor unrest in the 
country since the 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
coal production is crucial to polands economy and a major 
source of hard currency to service its 39 billion debt to western 
creditors poland is the worlds fourthlargest coal exporter and 
its mining operations are essential to its steel power and 
shipbuilding industries

a jurys decision that the hunt brothers must pay 
over 130 million in damages to a peruvian company is the latest in 
a series of problems faced by the sons of the late texas oilman 
hl hunt 
after six months of testimony and five days of deliberations a 
federal jury in new york jury determined saturday that the brothers 
conspired to corner the world silver market in the late 1970s 
thereby ruining the investments of minpeco sa the peruvian 
governments mineral marketing company 
the ruling comes as the hunt brothers try to complete settlement 
of a twoyear 15 billion dispute with 23 lenders the dispute 
has absorbed much of the fortune left the brothers by their father 
hunt energy corp vice president tom whitaker said the hunts 
were disappointed by the verdict and obviously disagree with it 
however this is merely a first step in a long civil process 
that has been going on for nearly eight years whitaker said 
motions raising other issues will be filed to set aside or 
modify this verdict 
the brothers are confident that this wrong result will 
eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court system 
nelson bunker hunt 62 william herbert hunt 59 and lamar 
hunt 56 mortgaged much of their share of the family legacy to 
cover 11 billion in losses they suffered when the market crashed 
in march 1980 
the loss also prompted their sisters caroline rose hunt 
schoellkopf and margaret hunt hill and representatives of another 
brother haroldson hassie hunt jr to separate their fortunes 
from those of their brothers significantly cutting into the wealth 
of their trusts 
after the silver losses the hunts international resources co 
and great western sugar co went bankrupt and are now defunct 
in the spring of 1986 two hunt businesses placid oil co and 
penrod drilling co failed to make payments on a total of 15 
billion in loans in july 1986 after attempts to renegotiate the 
loans failed the three hunt brothers sued their banks and lenders 
charging them with negotiating in bad faith and trying to take over 
their offshore oil businesses 
soon after the hunts put the most valuable loan collateral 
placid oil and william herbert hunts trust into chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection to guard against foreclosure later the 
trusts of lamar and nelson bunker were put into chapter 11 for the 
same reason 
in the settlement they proposed to the lenders the hunts would 
pay 6635 million from funds raised through placid operations 
primarily in the north sea 
hearings on the settlement which must be approved by the 
lenders the internal revenue sevice other major creditors and the 
bankruptcy court were to begin this month

twentytwo members and supporters of 
american indian tribes walked singlefile up a sevenmile mountain 
road to president reagans ranch saturday seeking an ongoing 
dialogue on indian rights 
the walk was triggered by reagans remarks at the moscow summit 
in may when he spoke of indians living a primitive lifestyle 
and said that maybe we should not have humored them 
before the march white house officials met with representatives 
of the american indian action group and arranged for reagan to meet 
in washington with indian leaders probably in september 
i would like to thank president reagan for publicly inviting 
us to open up a dialogue wonono rubio a chumash indian from 
goleta calif told the group outside the gate of the ranch 
i hope that he keeps the door open and keeps a dialogue as 
long as he is president rubio added one meeting is not going 
to solve our problems and i hope that he keeps it in mind this is 
going to be an ongoing dialogue 
the walkers marched from refugio state beach on the pacific 
ocean chanting beating drums and playing other musical 
instruments as they walked up the steep winding blacktop road 
some wore elements of traditional indian garb as part of their 
costumes one was in the robe of a buddhist monk the leader of the 
march michael zarate wore a mickey mouse shirt 
when they reached the ranch they lined up across the road from 
the gate while members designated as elders of various tribes led 
them in prayers and songs 
the walk took about three hours 
earlier about 100 persons assembled at the state park north of 
santa barbara 
this is going to be a spiritual walk said michael zarate a 
leader of the organization i emphasize this because it is not a 
protest march 
an announcement of the walk issued on wednesday had referred to 
it as a protest against reagans remarks at the moscow summit in 
may when he said of american indians maybe we should not have 
humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of primitive 
lifestyle maybe we should have said no come join us be 
citizens along with the rest of us 
zarate said the reference to a protest was erroneous and the 
group had apologized to the white house 
on thursday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater telephoned 
zarate and offered to arrange a meeting between the indians and 
white house aides here to set up a session between reagan and 
indian leaders in washington 
on friday zarate said he met with fitzwater and mb oglesby 
the deputy white house chief of staff who said the meeting could 
probably be arranged for september 
they also informed us the president would not be able to meet 
with us today as we originally requested zarate said 
the president and his wife nancy were entertaining old 
friends mr and mrs earle jorgensen and mr and mrs william 
wilson at the ranch the wilsons and the jorgensens were giving a 
belated birthday party for the first lady whose birthday was last 
month 
the weather at the ranch which has generally been sunny since 
the reagans arrived on tuesday was cloudy and cool 
at refugio beach the indians listened to speakers on 
environmental and other issues and assembled under a eucalyptus

a un report released saturday said paraguay is 
not cooperating in efforts to return children of argentines 
detained under that nations military juntas 
referring to paraguay the report said it was inadmissible and 
a matter of serious international concern if a country becomes a 
hiding place for kidnappers and illegally appropriated children 
the report by dutch human rights specialist theo van boven said 
paraguay ruled since 1954 by president alfredo stroessners 
authoritarian government should take immediate measures for 
repatriating the children 
at least 9000 people suspected of being leftist subversives 
were seized by argentine security forces and disappeared during the 
dirty war of 197481 officials have said human rights group 
put the number closer to 30000 
van bovens report said pregnant detainees were placed in secret 
detention centers where they gave birth and were separated from 
their children 
his report said many of the children were turned over to 
supporters of argentinas junta through an unofficial adoption 
ring and some of the people who adopted the children fled to 
paraguay when argentine military rule collapsed the report said 
some of the kidnappers forged documents to register the 
children as their own 
argentinas military rule ended in 1983 with the election of 
president raul alfonsin 
van boven gave no figure for the number of children believed to 
be involved his report said three of 45 such children located to 
date were found by the argentine government and the 42 others were 
found by relatives and the grandmothers of the plaza del mayor a 
private relatives group 
that group has said 182 children were taken from their parents 
and at least 72 have been repatriated 
van boven said paraguay denied him entry to investigate the 
cases citing pending judicial inquiries 
he presented his findings to the un subcommission on 
prevention of discrimination and protection of minorities

republican presidential candidate george 
bush gave running mate dan quayle a vote of confidence saturday 
saying he is satisfied that there was no impropriety in 
quayles enlistment in the national guard in 1969 
joining quayle in answering reporters questions at the ohio 
state fairgrounds here bush defended his selection of the indiana 
senator for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
the premise for this decision was very sound and the american 
people are going to see that loud and clear he said ive 
made a good choice bush said so the fact that there is some 
flurry out there and a lot of rumors have to be run down i dont 
see that its detracting 
bush complained that stories suggesting the young quayle had 
enlisted in the guard to avoid being drafted at the height of the 
vietnam war were greatly overdone 
i think it will turn out to be a tempest in a teapot he 
said 
bush complained that the heavy focus on quayles national guard 
record by news reporters had interfered with some elements of his 
campaign operation during the republican national convention in new 
orleans last week 
please dont judge me by this moment he told reporters 
weve had to shoot down many unfair rumors there was this 
flurry you know like bluefish when theyre swimming around 
all in a frenzy youve made the charges and we felt we had to 
answer them 
quayle said he had not deceived the bush campaign about the 
circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the national guard 
nearly 20 years ago 
theres sort of a sentiment out there impugning the motives of 
people who sign up for the national guard he said i told the 
bush campaign there was nothing embarrassing in my military record 
and im sticking to it 
quayle said he could not immediately disclose the communications 
he might have had with his draft board at the time but he repeated 
that he had asked to have his full military record supplied to him 
so that he can release it and better answer questions about it 
bush and quayle on saturday marched together with their wives 
barbara and marilyn in the paper day parade in nearby west 
carrollton home of several paper plants 
standing on a freshly painted blue stage on a baseball field 
bush worked a highly partisan crowd into a frenzy with a 
restatement of his hardline opposition to tax increases 
he said that if congress tried to get a tax increase past him 
he would stare them right in the face and say what i said in new 
orleans the other night he then paused just along enough to get 
large numbers of people in the crowd of 5000 to 7500 to join him 
in a chorus of read my lips no more taxes 
quayle won cheers saturday from an oktoberfest crowd of 
germanamericans near cleveland when he said a bush administration 
would see the berlin wall come down 
bush and quayle watched german folk dances and drank beer from 
steins at the celebration in olmsted township near cleveland 
putting aside questions that had dogged them earlier in the day 
about quayles military service 
several hundred people jammed into a germanamerican cultural 
center cheered bushs call for the soviet union to demonstrate its 
reforms are real by permitting a little more freedom in eastern 
europe 
stuart spencer a senior campaign official said that while he 
thought news reporters would continue to ask questions about the 
circumstances under which the quayle joined the national guard i 
think its behind us we feel good we feel upbeat 
quayle has said he thought there was nothing inappropriate about 
having a mutual family friend make inquiries in 1969 about the 
possibility of the young 22yearold depauw university graduate 
joining the national guard 
at least he served said one placard held aloft at the ball 
field grounds several other signs among the crowd suggested that 
quayles enlistment in the guard was a nonissue 
bush emerging from a restaurant here friday night said that 
quayle had not misled the campaign about his military record 
this guy did the honorable thing and told the truth he said 
bush campaign press secretary sheila tate said quayles 
questionandanswer session friday had relieved a lot of the 
press pressure she said the interruption in getting the bush 
campaign message out was only temporary 
david prosperi a former white house press office official now 
at the interior department will join quayles campaign as press 
secretary on monday ms tate said

protestant lawmakers on saturday 
demanded that the government begin locking up guerrilla suspects 
without trial after a car bomb set by the ira blew up a busload of 
british troops killing eight 
seven soldiers perished in the friday night blast and one died 
saturday of his wounds the army said 27 survivors were injured 
the car bomb blew a crater 6 feet deep in the road and hurled 
mutilated bodies into nearby fields 
it was the deadliest single blow by the ira against the british 
army in northern ireland since 1982 it brought to 26 the number of 
british military personnel killed in a summer ira blitz in northern 
ireland mainland britain and continental europe 
british armed forces minister archie hamilton said in a 
television interview there was obviously a possibility that an 
irish republican army spy had managed to penetrate britains 
security forces and that is something that will have to be 
investigated 
the bus was an unmarked vehicle and supposedly its route and 
schedule was secret 
ken maginnis a protestant politician said i believe there 
must have been inside information for them ira guerrillas to 
pinpoint the attack 
what i want to know is who informed the terrorists this 
busload of men was coming through here he said 
the ira asserted responsibility for the attack in a statement to 
the irish media and declared we will not lay down our arms until 
the peace of a british disengagement from ireland is granted to our 
nation 
northern ireland secretary tom king said we have no choice 
but to fight and to stand and to defeat the men of violence 
at a news conference in northern ireland king said officials 
have evidence the explosives were part of several loads of libyan 
armaments reportedly smuggled onto the island in recent years he 
did not elaborate 
prime minister margaret thatcher broke off a holiday in cornwall 
and flew to london to meet with maginnis one of several northern 
ireland protestant members of parliament who demanded the return of 
selective internment a controversial policy of locking up 
guerrilla suspects without trial last used in 1975 
maginnis in whose county tyrone constituency the bombing 
occurred was among the first on the scene he tearfully described 
going to a barn and finding a young man gasping his last just 
dying he had crawled into the most available cover and died over a 
bale of hay 
with him at the thatcher meeting was alan rainey who lives near 
the scene of the bombing 
i heard screams of agony i shall never forget he said 
the road was littered with the dead and the dying they were 
scattered and sprayed across the road behind hedges and one poor 
soul i found wrapped around a telephone pole 
mrs thatcher met later with king lt gen sir john walters 
commander of the british army in northern ireland and sir john 
hermon chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary the 
provinces police force 
after two hours of talks king would say only that the possible 
reintroduction of the internment policy was still under review 
the predominantly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british 
rule in northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant 
province with the 95 percent catholic irish republic 
lately the outlawed ira appears to have shifted tactics away 
from attacking local police and militiamen and has concentrated on 
army personnel from mainland britain 
on june 15 a bomb killed six soldiers in their van in lisburn 
outside belfast five more have died in ira attacks this summer in 
belgium holland west germany and north london 
of the nearly 2700 people killed in irishrelated violence 
since 1969 76 have died this year compared with 93 in all of 
1987 the number of troops killed has gone from three to 25 
maginnis a member of the protestants largest party the 
official unionists said of fridays attack i and the people in 
this area know who detonated that bomb the police know he did 
not name those he believed responsible 
internment is the only alternative to a court system which has 
been unable to put murderers behind bars he said i believe 
that internment is the only way to deal with these people 
mrs thatcher has refused previous internment calls but armed 
forces minister hamilton said nothing was ruled out 
internment was last used between 1971 and 1975 to hold 1981 
people mostly proira suspects it damaged britains human rights 
record and moderate politicians warned saturday its reintroduction 
would givr the ira a propaganda victory 
the bomb in a car parked by the road blew up as the unmarked 
bus passed carrying soldiers of the first battalion of the light 
infantry to base at omagh 50 miles west of belfast they had just 
flown in from mainland britain after furloughs and were still in 
civilian clothes 
the army said seven of the dead ranged in age from 18 to 21 it 
withheld information on the eighth victim 
the ira said it used 200 pounds of plastic explosives 
the blast 10 miles from the base was the deadliest blow to the

the nations wildfire control center on saturday asked the us 
army to provide a battalion of infantry troops to help suppress 
fires in the western united states where nearly 13000 
firefighters are already on the lines 
the boise idaho interagency fire center requested the military 
assistance to provide relief for civilian firefighters some of 
whom have been on fire lines for more than two weeks and to 
release expert firefighters to build new lines and deal with more 
complex situations said spokesman arnold hartigan 
the fire center has sent 18 instructors to fort lewis wash to 
train 600 soldiers of the first brigade combat team of the 9th 
infantry division motorized on fighting wildfires 
after training on sunday and monday the troops will be deployed 
to fire lines in yellowstone national park in wyoming 
meanwhile military helicopters headed to yellowstone saturday 
to assist in the battle against huge forest fires and fire crews 
in montana fought against high wind to tighten their control over 
dozens of fires 
winds gusting to 60 miles an hour throughout the day and evening 
kicked up fire activity in yellowstone the campgrounds and park 
buildings at grant village were evacuated and several park roads 
were closed 
the norris pebble creek and madison campgrounds remained closed 
officials expected the 74000acre north fork blaze to burn 
across the parks norris canyon road and steps were taken to 
protect norris junction while crews removed debris and flammable 
materials from the area 
yellowstone officials had called in two military helicopters to 
assist other aircraft already making water and retardant drops on 
the 110000acre clovermist fire in the parks northeastern 
section 
outside the park in the bighorn national forest a fiveman team 
launched an investigation into a helicopter crash west of the 
6500acre lost fire that killed one and injured three the 750 
people working the fire hoped for a second day of relatively calm 
westerly wind that on friday supported efforts to protect a ranch 
and a group of summer homes 
in montana south of helena the devastating warm springs creek 
fire in the elkhorn mountains cooled friday night after dramatic 
runs earlier in the week dave turner fire information officer 
said saturday 
it looks pretty good here we had a real cool night he 
said there was very little growth in the fire there was very 
little wind 
about 2000 firefighters were battling to contain the fire 
shoring up fire lines on the northeastern flank turner said crews 
had encircled about 60 percent of the fire compared with only 30 
percent the day before 
the national weather service forecast wind blowing up to 40 mph 
but temperatures were expected to be somewhat cooler with possible 
showers in scattered areas of montana which is suffering through a 
severe drought 
it will be tenuous for the next 24 hours turner said 
saturday 
the warm springs creek fire destroyed at least 10 residences and 
killed 30 head of cattle late wednesday and early thursday but 
turned just before reaching a mountain subdivision with scores of 
residences 
the fire grew by about 200 acres friday night but that was 
small compared with the 7000 and 15000acre runs the two 
previous nights 
as the fire moved generally to the east flames headed onto 
flatter land near the community of winston and officials said they 
would have more of a chance of checking the fire once it left the 
rugged mountain ridges 
firefighters were backed for the first time by three air 
national guard transport planes used to drop retardant on the 
flames 
elsewhere in montana smaller fires were burning over thousands 
of acres many of them the result of lightning strikes earlier in 
the week including 46 in the flathead river drainage of 
northwestern montana 
elsewhere firefighters extinguished a 600acre southern utah 
brush fire near st george and on saturday declared contained a 
50acre blaze in the regions wahwah mountains

proindependence groups in new caledonia and 
residents who want the south pacific archipelago to remain a french 
territory reached agreement saturday on a transitional plan for the 
islands future 
but militants quickly denounced the accord last spring 30 
people were killed in political and ethnic violence in new 
caledonia 
the agreement provides for a referendum on independence in 1998 
during the intervening 10 years the territory would be divided into 
three provinces with more autonomy 
the referendum would be restricted to voters who have lived in 
new caledonia during all of the intervening 10 years 
native melanesians make up only 43 percent of the population 
separatists claim many settlers europeans asians and polynesians 
are shortterm residents who want to maintain links with france 
and outvote them in elections the ethnic melanesians known as 
kanaks also have had a higher birth rate in recent years and 
expect to form the majority again by the end of the century 
this is not the finish today this is a stage said louis le 
pensec the minister for overseas territories in the french 
government of premier michel rocard 
but pensec said the agreement was more than could have been 
hoped for if one remembers the situation the territory found 
itself in three months ago 
the breakthrough in negotiations following the violence in april 
and may came in june when the head of the kanak socialist national 
liberation front jeanmarie tjibaou and conservative jacques 
lafleur reached an agreement in principle during talks directed by 
rocard 
in the caledonian capital of noumea the farright national 
front issued a statement saturday saying profrench leaders who 
participated in the talks had committed treason it said the accord 
will lead the territory irreversibly to independence sooner or 
later 
yann celene uregei leader of the separatist united kanak 
liberation front that is a member of tjibaous alliance said 
tjibaou had no authority to sign an agreement he said the proposal 
should have been presented first to new caledonians for debate 
the plan drawn up as a law to be presented to the french 
national assembly will include constitutional changes that must be 
approved by french voters in a national referendum to be scheduled 
later this year

ferdinand marcos lawyer said 
saturday he will ask swiss authorities not to cooperate with the 
government if it refuses to allow the expresident to return to the 
philippines to face charges he kept money in secret swiss bank 
accounts 
the government believes marcos stashed millions of dollars in 
switzerland during his 20year rule which ended on feb 25 1986 
when a civilian uprising swept him from office 
president corazon aquino said on friday she will abide by a 
court order approving her ousted predecessors return from hawaii 
where he fled after his ouster 
on thursday an antigraft court said marcos or his attorney had 
the right to be present during testimony of a former government 
minister scheduled to give a deposition against marcos in november 
marcos who is a lawyer said he would demand his right to come 
home and conduct his own defense 
marcos lawyer rafael recto told reporters he would send copies 
of newspaper reports on the courts ruling to swiss federal and 
cantonal authorities who are involved in an investigation into 
secret bank accounts the former president allegedly opened in 
switzerland 
if the government should refuse to respect marcos human right 
to freely return to his own abode the swiss government might be 
forced to withdraw assistance to the philippine government recto 
said 
recto said that if the government still blocked marcos return 
it would be in violation of european human rights covenants which 
the swiss have signed those covenants state that a defendant has 
the right to face his accuser personally or with the counsel of his 
choice 
at a news conference saturday armed forces chief of staff gen 
renato de villa said the military command would respect the courts 
decision despite security risks 
certainly there are some security implications that may come 
about with the return of expresident marcos to the philippines at 
this time de villa said but as i said and i wish to stress 
a court order must be respected and obeyed by everybody 
de villa said marcos supporters include small numbers of 
soldiers who have been dismissed for involvement in previous coup 
attempts but he said they do not have the capacity to topple the 
government 
others have said marcos still commands the loyalty of a 
considerable number of low and middleranking officers and men

the modest white house with the pointedarch 
window that inspired grant woods painting american gothic was 
promised to the state of iowa on friday so that the major 
american icon can be preserved 
carl smith 81 of breckville ohio who inherited the house 
after his parents died signed an agreement providing that the 
state will take control of the sixroom frame house 18 months after 
his death 
its my vision that this agreement with the state of iowa will 
continue to preserve the american gothic home and make it an 
attraction smith said during a ceremony on the front porch of 
the house 
wood iowas most famous artist received national acclaim in 
1930 when the american gothic painting won a 300 first prize 
at the art institute of chicagos contest for american painters 
the painting which has inspired countless parodies still hangs in 
the chicago museum 
wood is said to have gotten the idea for the painting after he 
saw the house during a visit to eldon a town in southeastern iowa 
with a current population of 1250 
the painting depicts a dourfaced farmer woods dentist was 
the model holding a pitchfork and standing beside his spinster 
daughter who actually was woods sister nan wood graham 
mrs graham who lives in a nursing home in menlo park calif 
said im tickled stiff about the agreement to give the house 
to the state of iowa that house represents real americans 
people who are forthright hardworking just ordinary americans 
carl smith said his father bought the house at a tax sale in 
1942 which coincidentally was the year wood died 
i dont remember what he paid for it but it wasnt very 
much he said in an interview the taxes hadnt been paid on it 
so he decided to buy it 
the houses role in art history made no difference to his 
father smith said he bought it because he wanted a place for 
his brother wilber porter smith to stay 
smith currently rents the house for 50 a month to a couple with 
three children 
david crosson administrator of the iowa historical society a 
government agency said the agreement with smith will ensure the 
house will be preserved for posterity 
we will be able to continue to preserve what is one of the 
most important symbols in the world crosson said when people 
see american gothic they think of traditional values not only 
of the midwest but of iowa particularly 
the agreement guarantees both the preservation and 
interpretation of a major american icon crosson said 
the legislature has appropriated 50000 for development and 
operation of the site as a tourist attraction officials said they 
will improve the gravel road leading to the house and possibly 
build a parking lot across the street crosson said the house will 
not be moved

amtrak has agreed to pay the families of 15 
people killed in a january 1987 train crash 82 million on top of 
the 58 million settlement agreed to by conrail two months ago 
in addition to death claims amtraks and conrails settlements 
also create a 9 million fund to pay 330 passengers who filed 
claims for injuries or distress they suffered because of the jan 
4 1987 accident near chase md 
that makes this settlement on the death claims alone the 
largest group personal injury settlement in the country said 
read k mccaffrey an attorney for the victims families 
claims filed by the 16th victims family were settled earlier 
we think its a fair settlement and hopefully will put an end 
to the uncertainty and the waiting period a lot of people have gone 
through amtrak public affairs director john jacobsen said 
friday a day after the settlement offer was made amtrak feels 
it is in some ways as much a victim in this as anyone else is 
a plan has been formulated where a committee of attorneys 
representing injured victims will review the claims and recommend 
who should get from the 9 million fund mccaffrey said 
the amtrak passenger train collided with a conrail locomotive 
ricky l gates the conrail engineer who was at the controls at 
the time of the accident is serving a fiveyear prison term for 
manslaughter after admitting hed smoked marijuana shortly before 
the crash 
the total 662 million the train companies have agreed to pay 
on the death claims means each of the victims survivors will 
receive about 45 million mccaffrey said 
under terms of amtraks settlement the railroad did not admit 
responsibility for causing the crash or the deaths mccaffrey said

an orchestra played aaron coplands 
fanfare for the common man friday night as the 400foothigh 
louisville falls fountain billed as the worlds tallest floating 
fountain debuted before more than 60000 people 
paris has its eiffel tower london has big ben rome has the 
coliseum and tonight the worldclass city of louisville has the 
louisville falls fountain said mary ray oaken secretary of the 
state tourism cabinet 
the crowd lined the banks of the ohio river as the fountain was 
triggered 
it took 20 minutes for the computercontrolled fountains 41 
jets and red white blue and amber lights to complete its program 
of patterns which concludes when the fountain sprays a 
fleurdelis louisvilles official symbol about 400 feet above 
the river 
the fountain on an octagonal barge 39 feet across is a gift to 
the city from mary and barry bingham sr who donated 26 million 
for its construction and maintenance for three years bingham 
patriarch of a threegeneration media family died monday at age 82 
i know that he barry bingham sr is with us tonight in a 
spirit of joy and fulfillment barry bingham jr said 
gov wallace wilkinson said he would never see the fountain 
without thinking of the elder bingham and that the fountain would 
flow as an eternal flame would burn in his memory 
plenty of entertainment was on hand including dancers singers 
an orchestra and bands the 100th army reserve band country music 
and rock n roll 
a flotilla of at least 100 boats gathered near the george rogers 
clark memorial bridge which was closed to vehicular traffic and 
was packed with 8000 to 10000 people 
interstate 64 which skirts the ohio river at louisville was 
jammed as motorists stopped to watch the fountain dedication 
creating a massive traffic tieup 
i think the whole city is planning a party said john 
richards executive director of the mary and barry bingham sr fund 
electrical engineer frank gavuld who was aboard the barge said 
afterward it ran perfectly weve had it up to 429 feet but the 
420 feet tonight was right on target 
i thought it was excellent said greg schum of louisville 
who staked out his spot six hours before the fountain was turned 
on its like fireworks made out of water its something the 
city can be proud of 
the fountain proposed almost 30 years ago was built by pete 
serodino of chattanooga tenn a marine contractor who has built 
other floating fountains around the world this one sprays the 
highest backers said 
plans call for the fountain to operate primarily in the 
afternoons and evenings from early spring to early fall 
when operating fully it will spout 15800 gallons of water a 
minute more than the average louisville household consumes in two 
months 
the fountain is one of five of its kind in the world according 
to the louisville central area an agency promoting the city 
skip nelson a member of the development team of international 
fountain developers in cincinnati said the secondlargest such 
fountain is in fountain hills ariz that fountain was rated to run 
at more than 500 feet but is actually run at less than 400 feet he 
said each of the other four fountains nelson said is a single 
jet going straight up into the air

four andean condors that will serve as scouts 
for reintroduction of the gravely threatened california condor into 
the wild are headed for temporary pens in a rugged mountain range 
the 3 and 4monthold avian pioneers hatched and reared in 
zoos will spend several weeks in mesh enclosures as scientists 
prepare them for their first flights over the dry mountains and 
foothills that once supported a thriving population of california 
condors 
the california species a black vulturelike carrion eater 
with a wingspan up to 9 feet has dwindled to a mere 28 all in 
captivity 
two andean condors from the san diego wild animal park were 
loaded into airlinestyle animal shipping crates friday evening for 
a 200mile trip to the secret holding pens in the los padres 
national forest 75 miles northeast of los angeles tom hanscom a 
spokesman for the animal park said in a telephone interview friday 
they want to arrive and put the birds in their new home in the 
dark of night so the birds awaken the next morning thinking they 
are in the same place they were before hanscom said as his crew 
was ready to depart at 645 pm for the sixhour drive 
the birds were not drugged but were captured and wrapped in 
blankets by familiar handlers he said 
by moving them in the dark it basically minimizes the 
stress hanscom said 
a third andean condor hatched at the los angeles zoo will join 
the contingent along with a fourth flown in from a us fish and 
wildlife service center in patuxent md said michael wallace the 
los angeles zoo biologist overseeing the program 
the andean birds all females to prevent breeding in the wild 
will be used to test techniques biologists hope to use perhaps as 
soon as 1992 to begin returning the california condor to nature 
more andean condors will be added to the test flock later 
in a 440000 program overseen by the us fish and wildlife 
service the birds will be taken to a special mesh enclosure 
measuring about 20 feet by 40 feet and 15 feet high in rugged 
territory the exact spot is secret to deter the curious or the 
malicious 
about november when the birds are able to fly they will be 
fitted with radio monitoring gear and released its expected they 
will cover much of the california condors fivecounty range a 
land of bare grassy hills dotted with occasional oaks and rugged 
rocky cliffs and canyons in the mountains that ring the southern 
end of the san joaquin valley 
the purpose of the test hanscom said is twofold to see how 
birds hatched in captivity adapt to freedom and to see if such 
birds can learn to fend for themselves in a region without native 
birds of their species to serve as examples 
the program also will help scientists spot such possible hazards 
as poison bait illegally left for coyotes or lead shot in animal 
carcasses left by hunters hanscom said 
the andean birds will be captured from the wild when its time 
to release their california cousins hanscom said the first 
california birds could be released as early as 1992 if breeding 
programs are successful he said 
the andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is 
the closest living relative to the california condor though the 
andean species is endangered they number in the thousands 
the california condor north americas largest land bird once 
roamed widely along the west coast but its numbers had shrunk to 
40 when the fish and wildlife service launched a rescue effort in 
1976

pemex the government oil monopoly said 
friday it will raise prices for crude oil exports to its customers 
in the western hemisphere on sept 1 but prices will remain 
unchanged for exports to europe 
the announcement was made as the secretarygeneral of the

the price increases for countries in the western hemisphere to 
align prices for exports of mexican crude with those prevailing in 
the international market 
sales to customers in the western hemisphere averaged 717000 
barrels daily between january and july 54 percent of mexicos 
petroleum exports during that period according to pemex the 
united states is the main client 
pemex said the price increases will be 10 cents per barrel for 
light isthmus crude and 30 cents for heavy maya crude because of a 
technical adjustment in export formulas 
in july isthmus sold for 1378 a barrel and maya for 1121 a 
barrel in the western hemisphere 
subroto told a news conference that mexico reiterated its 
collaboration with the petroleum cartel not to increase its 
production and to search for the stabilization of the market

opec and he hoped soon the world petroleum market will be 
stabilized

has begun exports of special diesel fuel to the united states with 
a 30 millionliter shipment from the gulf of mexico port of

a series of mistakes by men not machines led 
to last months shootdown by a navy cruiser of an iranian 
commercial jet but iran must share some of the blame say the 
pentagons civilian and military leaders and an investigation into 
the july 3 incident 
the us vincennes fired at the iranian a300 airbus in the 
persian gulf because the cruiser mistakenly believed the plane was 
an iranian f14 fighter taking part in an attack in the strait of 
hormuz according to the report 
no navy personnel will be disciplined said defense secretary 
frank c carlucci and adm william crowe jr chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff as they released the report friday 
i believe that given the operating environment capt will 
c rogers iii acted reasonably and did what his nation expected 
of him in the defense of his ship and crew said crowe 
all 290 people aboard the airbus were killed when it was shot 
down after taking off from bandar abbas which iran uses as a joint 
civilianmilitary airfield crowe noted the incident came only 
minutes after the vincennes had fired at some iranian speedboats 
which had shot at the cruisers helicopter 
by any measure it was unconscionable for iran to ignore the 
repeated warnings of the united states and to permit an airliner to 
take off from a joint militarycivilian airfield and fly directly 
into the midst of an ongoing surface action battle crowe 
declared 
but iranian un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati rejected 
us criticism 
our civil airliner was using an internationally recognized air 
corridor used five times a week by the same captain he said 
friday 
the iranian envoy blamed the tragedy on the us navys presence 
in the persian gulf 
one should conclude that the mere presence of such highly 
dangerous equipment which cannot be controlled even by trained 
american personnel is the source of tension he said and called 
for the us fleet to pull out of the gulf 
the vincennes is an aegisclass cruiser containing the navys 
most sophisticated air defense system the investigators concluded 
the aegis combat systems performance was excellent it 
functioned as designed 
but the welter of information provided by aegis was evaluated by 
a crew seeing its first combat and who had been warned about the 
possibility of attacks from bandar abbas the investigators said 
stress task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may 
have played a major role in this incident concluded the 
unclassified 53page version of the report released friday 
the iranian plane was picked up by the vincennes as a radar 
contact and the crew then sought proof the plane wasnt part of the 
earlier attack the investigators noted 
the proof never came given the time available the commanding 
officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect his ship and 
crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies or 
ambiguities said crowe 
the united states has apologized and informed iran it will offer 
compensation to the victims families iran which was scheduled 
today to begin a ceasefire in its long war with iraq has accused 
the united states of deliberately shooting the plane down 
the investigative report dismissed that charge stating 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the uss vincennes did not purposely shoot down an iranian 
commercial airliner rather it engaged an aircraft the commanding 
officer believed to be hostile and a threat to his ship and to 
the nearby frigate uss montgomery 
crowe said that some of the mistakes by the vincennes crew 
included 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a conclusion the civilian airbus was descending rather than 
ascending as it approached the vincennes implying the plane was 
preparing to attack 
a conclusion the jetliner had transmitted a radio signal 
identifying it as a military aircraft 
a report the plane was outside a commercial air corridor 
crossing the persian gulf 
rogers also had a short critical decision window the report 
states only seven minutes passed from the time the ship detected 
the airplane taking off until its destruction 
and from the time the co rogers first became aware of the 
plane as a possible threat until he made his decision to engage 
the elapsed time was approximately 3 minutes 40 seconds the 
report states 
the fog of war and those human elments which affect each 
individual differently are factors that must be considered 
stress task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may have 
played a major role in this incident 
carlucci said the investigation would lead to a number of 
changes in operations including modifying the devices that display 
critical information on approaching targets in the cruisers and 
subjecting the operators of the aegis system to psychological 
testing to ensure they are ready for combat

soviet spelunkers joining explorers from 
the united states and two other nations have concluded a 10day 
probe of lechuguilla cave the thirddeepest cavern in the united 
states 
the cave is in a designated wilderness area of the carlsbad 
caverns national park and is known to be at least 211 miles in 
length that makes it the deepest cave in new mexico at least 
onethird of a mile longer than the surveyed length of the carlsbad 
caverns 
the two known deeper caves are in wyoming 
seventy cavers from 18 states canada switzerland and the 
soviet union participated in the expedition 
project leaders rick bridges and roy glasier said the group 
discovered a considerable amount of spongework or passageways 
that add to the caves complexity 
among other findings were a 30inch gypsum flower and gypsum 
formations resembling yarn and cotton balls 
the cave has a 90foot vertical drop at its entrance according 
to park officials explorers have known about the cave opening and 
entrance room since about 1914 at that time the cave was mined 
for guano or bat waste 
extensive exploration of the cave began four years ago

here are highlights of the pentagons report 
on the circumstances of the shooting down of an iranian commercial 
jetliner by the uss vincennes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the uss vincennes did not purposely shoot down an iranian 
commercial airliner rather it engaged an aircraft the commanding 
officer uss vincennes believed to be hostile and a threat to his 
ship and to the uss montgomery 
iran must share the responsibility for the tragedy by 
hazarding one of their civilian airliners by allowing it to fly a 
relatively lowaltitude air route in close proximity to hostilities 
that had been ongoing for several hours 
the downing of iran air flight 655 was not the result of any 
negligent or culpable conduct by any us naval personnel 
associated with the incident 
the aegis combat systems performance was excellent it 
functioned as designed 
stress task fixation and unconscious distortion of data may 
have played a major role in this incident 
the uss vincennes was adequately trained to perform her 
missions 
iran air flight 655 an airbus 300 was on a normal climb out 
of bandar abbas and was flying within the established air route 
a59 from bandar to dubai 
commercial air particularly commercial air from iran is 
at risk in the persian gulf as long as hostilities continue in the 
area unless an aircraft can be visually identified as a 
nonthreat any aircraft approaching a us navy ship could be 
considered a threat 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no disciplinary or administrative action should be taken 
against any us naval personnel associated with this incident 
the cno chief of naval operations direct that further 
study be undertaken into the stress factors impacting on personnel 
in modern warships with highly sophisticated command control 
communications and intelligence systems such as aegis 
that no changes be made to the existing roe rules of 
engagement 
revise the existing commercial air route structure over 
the waters of the persian gulf and require that all flights 
climb to at least 25000 feet over land prior to crossing the gulf 
and begin their descent over land 
that the commanding officer uss vincennes take action as 
required to strengthen the aawc antiair warfare controller 
position in the uss vincennes cic combat information center 
organization 
if we must operate in a lowintensity conflict and in the 
presence of comair commercial aircraft we must train to that 
environment real or simulated

a daylabor firm will be fined 60000 for 
violating the new federal immigration law a reduced fine that 
still is the largest ever levied for such violations federal 
immigration officials said 
the us immigration and naturalization service initially fined 
readymen a company that provides temporary help to construction 
firms and factories 308000 for hiring five illegal immigrants 
and committing more than 515 violations in recordkeeping 
after two months of negotiations however the two sides agreed 
on the smaller fine 
its not our intention to put anyone out of business ad 
moyer the chicago ins director said friday the moment that im 
assured that they are doing everything they can to comply with the 
law then im satisfied 
he said the company was now on the right track and that the 
settlement demonstrates the effectiveness of the law 
readyman president james heraty said he felt the sanction was 
fair and that his company would try to be a model company in 
the industry 
heraty did acknowledge that the new law makes his business more 
difficult and that he occasionally has trouble finding enough 
workers 
i have never found so many people who dont have the id they 
need to get hired he said at a news conference 
the immigration law passed by congress in 1986 initially allowed 
some illegal aliens to seek amnesty and apply for legal residency 
in the united states the yearlong amnesty ended in may 
the second phase of the law begun in june 1987 makes employers 
responsible for verifying that their workers are legal residents 
and provides for fines if companies knowingly hire illegal aliens 
before the law employers faced no sanctions for hiring illegal 
aliens

here are excerpts of remarks at a news 
conference friday by defense secretary frank c carlucci and adm 
william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on the 
results of a navy investigation of the downing of an iranian 
jetliner by the uss vincennes 
carlucci its important to bear in mind that this ship was 
engaged in combat with iranian boghammers armed speedboats there 
had been reports of sounds of metal hitting the side of the ship 
which we assumed and still assume today were bullets from the 
boghammer the ship had to turn a 30degree turn this turn 
took place just at the crucial decision point so it was heeling 
over at about a 32degree angle 
things were falling in the cic combat information center 
lights were flickering and in the background guns were booming i 
dare say it would be hard to even have this press conference under 
those conditions much less reach crucial decisions on a number of 
targets during a very short timeframe nonetheless the 
investigators found that the captain acted prudently on the basis 
of the information available to him both admiral crowe and i and 
general george crist head of the us central command concurred 
in that judgment 
crowe an examination of the events on 3 july leads quickly to 
the conclusion that iran must share the responsibility of the 
tragedy and the investigation so found by any measure it was 
unconscionable to ignore the repeated warnings of the united states 
and to permit an airliner to take off from a joint 
militarycivilian airfield and fly directly into the midst of the 
ongoing surface action in the strait of hormuz which the iranians 
themselves had initiated 
the tragic events of july 3rd did not occur in a vacuum as 
the secretary explained to you they happened in an area where 
3637 american sailors on board uss stark had been killed by an air 
attack in may 1987 and where our military has been tested by fire 
time and again over the last year the actions of captain will 
rogers and the vincennes crew must be judged in that context 
during the critical seven minutes that flight 655 was 
airborne captain rogers and his cic team were conducting a surface 
action tracking a multitude of contacts coordinating us units 
and trying to sort out friend from foe with spotty information he 
had a genuine dilemma 
the villains of the piece were six significant problems which 
plagued the captain and which he could not control or discount 
vincennes was engaged in intense surface action with iranian 
gunboats the unidentified assumed hostile contact had taken off 
from an airfield used by military aircraft 
the flight was heading directly at vincennes and its range 
was relentlessly closing the unknown aircraft radiated no 
definitive radar emissions seven vincennes warnings went 
unacknowledged and unanswered the compression of time gave him an 
extremely short decision window less than five minutes 
it was only prudent for captain rogers to assume that the 
contact was related to his engagement with the iranian boats until 
proven otherwise the proof never came given the time available 
the commanding officer could hardly meet his obligation to protect 
his ship and crew and also clear up all of the possible anomalies 
or ambiguities 
admiral fogartys investigation also revealed that mistakes 
were made on board vincennes that day that in itself is not 
surprising to anyone who understands the stress of hostile action 
in a lifeordeath situation no military combat operation is 
flawless even when there is a successful outcome 
our early washington briefings of the accident were based on 
information received from the ship shortly after the action some 
of which were found by the investigation to be incorrect 
questions have been raised about the ships initial report 
that the aircraft was outside of the air corridor the report was 
wrong perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call 
of flight 655 as descending instead of climbing 
in fact the investigation concluded that the time between the 
initial report of decreasing altitude and the decision to fire was 
in the neighborhood of 20 to 30 seconds it is impossible to say 
with assurance how those two inputs bore on the commanding 
officers final decision but it is important to keep in mind that 
the co had this information for only 20 to 30 seconds and that 
during this interval he was involved in other things as well as 
the preparations to fire 
singly the errors or mistakes were not crucial to the fateful 
decision even cumulatively they do not appear to change the 
picture in a decisive way the commanding officer never received 
the clear evidence that he felt he needed to establish that the 
iranian aircraft had not come to participate in the ongoing surface 
action 
i believe that given the operating environment captain rogers 
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in the 
defense of his ship and crew 
q what did the crew of the vincennes do right 
carlucci well the question is not whether mistakes were 
made mistakes are made in virtually every combat situation the 
question is whether the mistakes were made through negligence or 
whether there is culpability and the determination is that no 
these mistakes were not due to negligence or culpability 
q so the equipment itself and the procedures did contribute to 
the errors made 
carlucci no the equipment functioned as designed we cannot 
find any errors in the equipment and were taking this 
experience and trying to make some improvements that will make it 
easier for people to read the display and to communicate with each 
other once again who knows whether these would have been critical 
elements it does not seem to me that they are critical elements at 
all

a younger brother of the sovietbacked leader 
of afghanistan najib says he broke with his brother because he 
imposed an infamous regime on the afghan people by force of 
arms 
he is not being supported by anyone so far as the afghans are 
concerned sediqullah rahi told reporters friday at the state 
department the only support he has is the soviet union he has 
tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets 
the defection of rahi his wife sorayaand their two young sons 
is a propaganda coup for the united states which has provided 
stinger missiles and other weapons to guerrillas who are at war 
with the afghan and soviet armies 
rahi 37 who had worked for the kabul government as a banker 
broke with his brother several years ago and after serving some 
months in prison fled with his family to the mountains last winter 
they crossed into pakistan last month and arrived in washington 
this week where they were granted refuge immediately and given the 
protection of bodyguards 
rahi said the escape was arranged by ahmed shah massoud leader 
of one of the factions at war with his brothers forces and that 
they had to change getaway cars seven times and houses three times 
on their way from kabul to massouds mountain hideaway 
we were constantly under surveillance and they were following 
us mrs rahi said her bearded husband nodded his concurrence 
rahi denounced his brother as mentally deranged and the sadist 
type he said the governments strength is waning and its morale 
is very low 
the soviets are in the midst of withdrawing their troops from 
afghanistan where they had backed the kabul government in an 
8year war with the rebels 
once the red army is gone rahi said the government will fall 
he has tried to impose his regime by way of bayonets rahi said 
of his brother the rebels are the true fighters and defenders of 
our country 
rahi said he expected the soviets to try to rescue elements of 
the promoscow government by arranging a coalition with other 
afghan forces he said najib might be given haven in the soviet 
union or another communist country 
asked about the afghan presidents claims that his government 
can survive without the support of soviet troops rahi said 
sheer lies 
there are two younger brothers tradition binds them to najib 
even if they disagree with him rahi said 
he said the two brothers were trained in cuba and are working 
for the kgb secret police he said he broke with tradition 
mrs rahi offered assurances that the rebels were not the sort 
of fundamentalists who rule neighboring iran 
this is something the afghan people would repel and 
repudiate she said 
rahi meanwhile paid tribute to president mohammed zia ulhaq 
of pakistan who perished in an airplane crash wednesday as a 
staunch supporter of the rebels 
american weapons are funneled through pakistan to the rebels 
and pakistan has taken in millions of afghan refugees 
referring to reports of a bomb exploding aboard the presidential 
plane rahi said this makes one wonder whether this was arranged 
by the kabul regime and india in order to muddy up the situation so 
they could take advantage of it for some ulterior motive 
he added through an interpreter this could have possibly been 
one of the soviets intrigues and tricks simply they realized by 
trying some diplomatic maneuvers they could not move away gen zia 
from his support of the resistance so they decided this could be 
the last remedy 
asked if he had evidence to support the allegation rahi said 
we have no evidence we simply are thinking that because the 
soviets had given zia warning many many times that they will take 
proper action in due course if necessary

the centers for disease control disputes a 
study by the hudson institute that the number of americans infected 
with the deadly aids virus is actually twice the official estimate 
in a study released friday the hudson institute said that up to 
3 million americans are infected by the aids virus an estimate 
that is far above the calculation by cdc the primary federal 
agency monitoring the spread of aids 
kevin r hopkins a hudson mathematician said his study uses 
realistic assumptions not used by the cdc and as a result his 
estimate is closer to the true number of americans infected by the 
human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
the actual number of people carrying the hiv virus in the 
united states at the end of 1987 was not the 900000 to 14 
million the official sources estimate but probably more than twice 
that number the hudson report said 
there were between 2 and 3 million people infected with the 
aids virus with the most likely total of infections probably close 
to 24 million the report said 
dr timothy dondero chief of a cdc branch studying the spread 
of aids quickly disputed the claim however 
in a telephone interview from the cdc headquarters in atlanta 
dondero said he and his staff reviewed the hudson study and the 
methods used and said we do not feel a change in our data is 
appropriate 
he said that for the hudson model to be correct about 2 percent 
of the young adult population in the united states would have to be 
infected with hiv yet he said their figures are inconsistently 
high within segments of populations for which there are test 
results 
dondero said tests from hospital patients military recruits and 
prisoners show hiv infection rates of less than 1 percent 02 
percent to 066 percent among young adults 
hopkins admitted were all in a guessing game when it comes 
to estimating the number of people infected with the aids virus 
nonetheless he said he believed the hudson method is a more 
realistic model or mathematical estimate of the situation 
the cdc may be right and we may be wrong hopkins said 
until a national seroprevalence test is conducted we will not 
know the main conclusion is that we cannot be complacent about 
this disease 
the study by hudson a privately financed public policy research 
organization with headquarters in indianapolis used basic cdc data 
on the number of aids cases but hopkins said hudson used different 
computer models and more sophisticated statistical analysis 
techniques to estimate the rate of hiv infections 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which is caused by the hiv 
virus is the end stage of the disease and may not develop for 
years after a person is infected with the virus but an infected 
person can spread the virus before developing aids for this 
reason experts are attempting to estimate the rate of infection in 
order to gauge the future extent of the epidemic 
hiv infection is determined by a blood test which identifies 
antibodies in blood serum a person with such antibodies is known 
as seropositive 
hopkins said the hudson study also estimated that the number of 
heterosexuals infected by the virus may be three times higher than 
cdc estimates 
the cdc says the chief victims of aids a contagious disease 
that attacks the bodys immune system have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users 
the hudson study estimates that of the 850000 to 14 million 
heterosexuals infected with the hiv virus between 200000 and 
500000 are those who do not use drugs 
there are vastly more heterosexuals infected today said 
hopkins a breakout into the nonmonogamous population is 
unavoidable 
the cdc has estimated that the aids virus has infected only 
80000 to 165000 of the nondrugusing heterosexual population 
the hudson report said about 118000 of the heterosexuals 
infected are mainstream population members 
they are not poor and they are not iv drug users hudson 
said but they are nonetheless carriers of the virus and through 
their sexual contacts can proceed to spread the disease to others 
of their same class 
the cdc says that as of aug 15 1988 aids had been diagnosed 
in 70702 americans of whom more than half or 39898 have died 
since june 1 1981 no one is known to have recovered from aids

the military record of republican vice presidential nominee sen 
dan quayle dominated the campaign as the republican and democratic 
tickets launched road shows on the final stretch to the november 
election the political conventions now just a memory of balloons 
and patriotic music 
despite the controversy over whether quayle used family 
influence to get into the national guard and duck combat in the 
vietnam war the republican ticket led by george bush rode the 
crest of publicity from the justended gop convention in new 
orleans into a dead heat in the polls against democrats michael 
dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
a cnnusa today poll released friday of 842 registered voters 
put the race at 45 percent for bushquayle to 44 percent for 
dukakisbentsen the spreads for the survey conducted thursday 
night were within the polls 4 percentage point margin of error 
bush and quayle planned joint appearances today in ohio while 
dukakis and bentsen were scheduled to visit the lbj ranch outside 
austin texas 
the republican standard bearers were buoyed friday by a 
supportive crowd in quayles hometown of huntington ind where 
boos and hoots of boring greeted reporters questions 
about the guard issue at an outdoor news conference 
the conservative 41yearold twoterm indiana senator 
acknowledged that a family friend made calls on his behalf after he 
expressed interest in joining the guard in 1969 but he insisted 
i got in fairly 
youre going to be surprised at how outraged people and 
families that identify with the national guard around america are 
going to be towards these accusations quayle said 
according to an abc news poll released friday 63 percent of 613 
registered voters contacted thursday night said the fact that 
quayle entered the national guard at a time when others faced 
possible service in vietnam should not be a campaign issue 
twentythree percent said it should be a minor issue and 11 percent 
a major issue 
but if it turns out that quayle used family influence to get 
into the guard the poll results changed with 23 percent saying it 
should be a major issue 27 percent a minor issue and 47 percent 
saying it should not be a campaign issue the poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
quayle said he turned to his parents for advice during his 
senior year in college as he faced the loss of college deferment 
from the draft following graduation 
the family discussed the matter with wendell c phillippi a 
former commander of the indiana national guard who worked for 
quayles grandfather at the indianapolis news quayle said adding 
i would assume that calls would be made 
phillippi has said he contacted the guard on quayles behalf 
bush stood by quayle at the rally calling him a young man of 
vision of character 
meanwhile dukakis and bentsen took separate campaign trails 
before meeting up in dallas for a fundraising event friday night 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee took an indirect 
shot at bush and quayle telling a rally in bismarck mo the 
test of strong presidential leadership is strength the quality of 
the people you select to serve with you 
on a day that saw him in rural illinois missouri and arkansas 
the massachusetts governor said bushs convention address thursday 
night wasnt a bad speech actually but he criticized it for 
what it did not discuss 
he talked a lot about missions but i must have missed a 
page said dukakis who did not watch bushs speech but reviewed 
its text there was nothing in there about the two biggest 
economic challenges we face in this country he said 
we didnt hear a word from the republicans on the budget 
deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week and we know 
why they dont know how to deal with it they dont know what to 
do with it thats why were going to have a democratic president 
and vice president 
bentsen meanwhile stayed on home turf in texas where he 
criticized the republican national convention as a mardi gras for 
the moral majority that ignored the concerns of working people 
like dukakis the texas senator said bushs convention address 
did not deal with how the republicans are going to face some of 
the real problems of america including trade and budget deficits 
lets face some facts bentsen said in dallas what we saw 
was the republicans putting on a convention for the far right they 
had a mardi gras for the moral majority 
the hard right drove the republican agenda bentsen said 
there was no reaching out for the center as we have done in the 
democratic party 
bentsen confirmed a report in fridays washington post that his 
blind trust invested in his sons business after being steered 
there by the senator he said he reported the investment even 
though he didnt have to do so 
he said his wifes position as a trustee on a mutual fund 
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the 
blind trust

american indians are going ahead 
with a march to president reagans ranch to protest his remarks 
during the moscow summit about indians primitive lifestyle 
despite white house assurances that the president will meet with 
them in washington 
the american indian action group and the white house said friday 
that arrangements were being made for such a meeting the indians 
who already had planned todays demonstration said they would 
proceed with it because they had made a commitment and people were 
traveling distances to participate 
reagan told students at moscow university in may maybe we 
made a mistake in trying to maintain indian cultures maybe we 
should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that kind of 
primitive lifestyle 
the president also suggested that perhaps the government should 
have told the indians no come join us be citizens along with 
the rest of us 
american indians were made full citizens by an act of congress 
in 1924 
the presidents remarks were greeted with outrage by many indian 
leaders reagan said he would meet with them at any time but 
the indians said he failed to respond to letters and telephone 
calls from them 
a member of the american indian action group who said she used 
only the name pilula said that white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater telephoned the group thursday after plans for the 
demonstration had been announced 
fitzwater spoke with michael zarate a spokesman for the group 
and said that a letter would follow pilula said neither zarate 
nor fitzwater could be reached for comment friday afternoon 
pilula said she assumed fitzwaters call was prompted by the 
announcement of the demonstration as he would not have had any 
other reason to call us 
we did let him know that we would go ahead she said 
deputy white house press secretary bob hall said presidential 
aides would meet with the indians soon probably while the 
president is vacationing at his ranch to arrange a meeting between 
reagan and the indians after the president returns to washington on 
sept 6 
during his administration reagan has never met with indian 
leaders the group said in a statement the remarks he made in 
moscow were his first reference to american indians in eight 
years 
the group said more than 200 american indians were expected to 
rally at refugio state beach and then walk to the gate of the 
presidents ranch 20 miles north of santa barbara in the santa ynez 
mountains 
the reagans arrived at the ranch tuesday from new orleans where 
the president addressed the republican national convention they 
will go to los angeles next tuesday for a fiveday stay 
on the way to los angeles the president will stop at the marine 
operations building of the port of long beach to sign a landmark 
bill designed to reduce us deficits in world trade the president 
already has indicated that he would sign the bill and tuesday is 
the deadline for him to do so the long beach setting was chosen 
for the ceremony because of the ports role in overseas trade 
the bill would authorize us negotiators to reach agreements in 
the current uruguay round of international trade and talks and 
would streamline the government system of import curbs designed to 
protect american business and retaliate against trade violations

defendant in the irancontra case lost a bid to have criminal 
charges dismissed on the grounds that his congressional testimony 
was used against him improperly by prosecutors

motion to dismiss the charges against fernandez that accuse him of 
conspiring to ship arms illegally to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
and concealing the covert operation

former cia agent gave to the housesenate committees that 
investigated the irancontra affair 
fernandez 51 who operated under the pseudonym tomas castillo

robinson directed prosecutors to turn over to the court a list 
of all cia witnesses who were interviewed after fernandez gave his

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
was campaigning in texas today with running mate lloyd bentsen the 
man dukakis increasingly talks about as george bush defends his 
choice to fill the republican ticket 
isnt it great to have a democratic nominee for the vice 
presidency whose qualifications have never been questioned by 
anyone dukakis asked rhetorically friday evening at a rally in 
walnut ridge ark before he flew here 
the true test of leadership is to be able to make the big 
decisions to choose the best people and to inspire confidence in 
government dukakis told a crowd of about 2000 people thats 
the test of true leadership 
dukakis has been using lines similar to those since republican 
nominee bush chose 41yearold indiana sen dan quayle as his 
running mate a selection that was followed quickly by questions 
about whether quayle was qualified to step in as president and 
whether he used family influence to get into the national guard in 
1969 to duck combat duty in vietnam 
dukakis and bentsen appeared together friday night at a dallas 
fundraiser and were traveling today to the lbj ranch outside 
austin dukakis also was to stop in tennessee on his way home to 
boston 
the walnut ridge stop was the end of a dukakis whistle stop 
train swing friday through rural illinois missouri and arkansas 
he drew large crowds at all four depots he visited and was joined 
at each by numerous elected officials 
today we begin that journey to the future dukakis told the 
depot rallies and we begin it in the style of another great 
democratic president harry s truman he said at walnut ridge 
while he indirectly criticized bushs selection of quayle and 
the senators credentials dukakis aggressively attacked bushs 
acceptance speech at the republican national convention which the 
democrat said was missing a page because it failed to address 
how a bush presidency would deal with the budget and trade deficits 
nowhere in it was there a word about the two most important 
economic challenges that will face the next president of the united 
states dukakis said of the bush speech the first is eight 
years of running up budget deficits that have added more to the 
national debt than all of the presidents from george washington to 
jimmy carter combined and the second was a record trade deficit 
at his second stop friday in bismarck mo dukakis said bush 
or other republicans failed to mention the deficits during their 
convention because they dont know how to deal with it 
he labeled attacks by bush and other republicans on him the sign 
of a losing campaign 
i dont think that you can go to the american people and seek 
their support for the presidency if you spend 80 and 90 percent of 
your time cutting up the other guy dukakis said 
the duke express traveled through the heartland the day 
after bush accepted the republican presidential nomination 
the massachusetts governor at each of the rallies mentioned his 
states unemployment rate has been about 3 percent for several 
years while the jobless rates in each of the towns he visited was 
near 10 percent dukakis blamed reagan administration policies 
that he said fueled prosperity in some regions but ignored and 
exacerbated economic distress in others 
they may be satisfied but we arent dukakis said we can 
do a lot better 
dukakis repeatedly mentioned the deficits a lack of affordable 
housing the pentagon procurement scandal and the stewardship of 
former attorney general edwin meese iii he said republicans ducked 
those issues at their convention 
dukakis led the crowds in the refrain not a single word from 
the republicans after mentioning each of those issues 
the candidate drew laughs from reporters in bismarck when he 
joked about criticism from republicans that dukakis and his wife 
kitty show too much affection in public 
its true that democrats sleep in double beds and republicans 
prefer twins he said thats why there are more democrats 
bentsen meanwhile campaigning across his home state said 
bushs convention address didnt deal with how the republicans 
are going to face some of the real problems of america 
for example he said if youre worried about health care for 
the elderly or for children we didnt hear any of the specifics 
about how those concerns are going to be met 
lets face some facts what we saw was the republicans putting 
on a convention for the far right bentsen said they had a 
mardi gras for the moral majority

south and north korean delegates ended a 
second day of talks saturday but failed to make major progress on 
clearing the way for fullscale talks on a nonaggression pact and 
sharing the olympic games 
they agreed to a third meeting monday 
the two sides appeared far apart on all main issues as lawmakers 
from each side met in the south korean pavilion at the truce site 
straddling the demilitarized zone separating the two koreas on 
friday delegates met in the north korean pavilion 
the fivemember delegations shook hands and cracked jokes before 
beginning negotiations but observers described the mood as guarded 
chief south korean delegate park joonkyu in an opening speech 
offered a number of minor concessions on the terms for holding 
joint parliamentary talks the changes were basically rewordings of 
proposals and the south did not revise its main positions 
north koreas delegates said the south was making discussions 
more complex without making progress 
there is nothing new in your proposal said chief north 
korean delegate chon kum chol 
the north korean delegation continued to press for fullscale 
parliamentary talks on a nonaggression pact and allowing the north 
to cohost the olympic games that begin sept 17 in seoul 
south korea showed no willingness to back down on its position 
that the only solution for the olympics was for the north to 
participate in the games in seoul but that cohosting was 
impossible 
the meeting on friday also ended with no progress before the 
sides met park said he was optimistic an agreement could be 
negotiated but after the working meeting he rated chances for 
holding full talks at 5050 
park said he needs a little bit of glasnost using soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs catchword for openness from north 
korea before agreeing to full talks on easing their 40year rivalry 
the korean peninsula was divided north and south at the end of 
world war ii in 1945 the nations technically are still at war 
since no peace treaty was signed after the korean war of 195053 
north korean has called for a joint meeting of the two 
countries parliaments involving nearly 1000 lawmakers to 
discuss the olympics and a nonaggression pact 
south korea sought to call a representative meeting of 20 
lawmakers from each side whose main business would be to fix the 
agenda and work out other details for full talks 
the north koreans also proposed that both legislatures make a 
joint declaration of nonaggression bypassing their governments 
seoul maintains that military matters must be handled by the 
executive branches of the two governments park said the north 
koreans are trying to avoid dealing with president roh taewoo and 
get 42000 us troops withdrawn from south korea 
chief north korean delegate chon kum chol reinterated his 
countrys demand to share in the olympics he said the event is 
not a simple sports game but a serious political problem which will 
decide the destiny of the korean people 
park said the only solution was for north korea to participate 
in the games he said south korea would keep the door open for 
north koreas participation but noted the deadline for entries is 
sept 2 
north korea is demanding to be a ohost at the olympics to stave 
off a major political defeat both sides claim to be the sole 
legitimate government of korea south korea sees its selection to 
be host of the olympics as international recognition of its claim 
the international olympic committee says north korea cannot be a 
cohost because the games are awarded to a single city south 
korean authorities say north korea may use terrorism to try to 
disrupt the olympics 
sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 1970s 
failed to make progress on easing hostilities the last talks 
collapsed in january 1986 when north korea pulled out to protest 
annual south koreanus military exercises

the englishlanguage china daily quoting earlier press reports 
said consumer spending by government organizations totaled 10 
billion during the first seven months of the year up 198 percent

can cost the same as a factory workers monthly salary

vehicles color televisions motorcycles air conditioners sofas 
and carpets despite a government freeze on buying such items 
government offices are also spending large amounts on expensive 
gifts such as quartz clocks leather suitcases and cosmetics 
mainly to gain access to hardtoget goods and services the report 
said 
the communist party this week outlined a fiveyear economic 
reform package that said one top goal for 1989 was to reduce 
purchasing power of government organizations while countering waste 
and extravagance in the party and bureaucracy

nurses at six private hospitals rejected 
friday by a 21 margin a tentative contract that would have boosted 
their pay 20 percent over three years and halted a 2weekold 
strike that closed some emergency rooms 
about 65 percent of the 2200 striking nurses voted on the 
offer said maureen anderson spokeswoman for the california nurses 
association 
the strike is growing stronger which is unusual she said 
the nurses negotiating team had recommended the contract but 
not unanimously according to the union which had sought a bigger 
pay raise 
a spokesman for affiliated hospitals representing the six 
struck hospitals criticized the rejection as unreasonable and 
totally unjustified 
karen henry the hospitals chief negotiator said the offer not 
only would have made the nurses among the highest paid in the 
nation but also exceeded the unions settlements with other 
hospitals in the area 
responded anderson theyre also paying lower than any other 
hospitals in the area 
the agreement was reached early thursday after negotiators sat 
through two consecutive 17hour bargaining sessions 
the pact called for raises of 75 percent 65 percent and 6 
percent over three years bringing salary for top nurses on the 
night shift to about 50000 the union had originally raises of 
sought 11 percent and 10 percent over two years 
a lot of people out here are disappointed nurse gary 
cardiel said thursday of the tentative agreement its a slap in 
the face and i dont think im going to vote for it 
the hospitals affected by the strike are st francis 
childrens marshal hale st marys and mount zion in san 
francisco and seton medical center in daly city 
in addition to the nurses 1700 hospital service workers 
honoring the strike have stayed off the job 
john g williams board president of the affiliated hospitals 
acknowledged that the hospitals lost patients during the strike 
but he could not provide numbers or an estimate of how much the 
strike cost 
but anderson said income for the hospitals was 50 percent below 
normal and that the institutions were further hurt financially by 
paying up to 56 an hour to substitute nurses from texas and 
florida 
it was just an economic nightmare for them anderson said 
thursday it was just a lot of red tape and a lot of money for 
them

newly crowned presidential nominee 
george bush kicked off his general election campaign in the heart 
of middle america but the starspangled kickoff rally was marred 
by running mate dan quayles continuing defense of his military 
record 
bush and quayle came to the senators hometown to launch their 
campaign and a crowd of some 8000 to 10000 flagwaving and 
cheering townspeople greeted them but not long after the pair 
delivered standard campaignstyle speeches quayle was off to the 
side of the huntington county courthouse lawn answering reporters 
questions 
quayle in a giveandtake session that had been set up by the 
bush organization and piped to the crowd by loudspeaker system 
combatively defended his 1969 decision to join the national guard 
during the height of the vietnam war 
commenting on persistent reports that he used family connections 
to win a spot on a national guard unit roster quayle said i can 
assure you that i asked no one to break any rules and that i broke 
no rules at all 
i was on active duty for six months he said i could have 
been called to vietnam as many indiana units were and if i had 
been called i would have gone 
members of the crowd witnessing an extraordinary confrontation 
between a highprofile public figure and reporters booed lustily 
when quayle was asked repeatedly about his motives for joining the 
guard 
during his speech to the crowd here bush said he thought he 
would beat historical odds against vice presidents seeking the 
presidency 
he said that at the end of thursday nights acceptance speech 
i just couldnt help but think that old martin van buren was up 
there giving me the highfive sign he said van buren was the 
last vice president to win the top job and that was over 150 years 
ago 
bush and quayle appeared together in new orleans earlier friday 
at a meeting of the republican national committee 
the newly minted ticket got well wishes from party figures 
before flying to quayles home state of indiana 
quayle continued to poke fun at the uproar surrounding reports 
of his national guard involvement during his appearance before the 
rnc 
marilyn quayles wife and i are just getting used to how we 
are supposed to conduct ourselves on the campaign trail he said 
the 41year old senator strode to the podium following bushs 
speech and said i think i now know how to introduce myself 
he came to attention snapped his heels together and said 
name dan quayle 
rank sergeant 
serial number 303 50 4096 
status in the national guard six years and proud of it 
bush and quayle were in high spirits the morning after the 
conclusion of the republican national convention and both seemed 
eager to proceed with what bush called the countdown phase 
the pair scheduled campaign trips over the next two days to 
dayton cleveland and columbus ohio and to the illinois state 
fair in springfield 
in a brief talk to the republican party leaders before leaving 
new orleans bush said the convention amounted to another 
shifting of gears in the campaign and said that now were 
coming to the beginning of the end im convinced were going to 
win 
bush said he thought the convention had helped him get his 
message to the american people and beyond the filters that 
obscure his points he evidently was referring to fact that his 
speech was broadcast live 
he said his basic campaign message will be constituted in part 
by emphasis on maintaining world peace and security and the other 
half will focus on enlarging the prosperity so that everyone 
benefits 
we have a good message its an upbeat message he said 
saying most elections hinge on the pocketbook issues bush said the 
coming campaign gauge the innate optimism aand pessimism of the 
american people 
bush said that we have not yet captivated the kinds of 
public opinion poll numbers that would be reflected by a belief by 
people that theyre better off than they were eight years ago 
bush saluted quayle as that young spirit who relates to the 
changing decade were moving into

the federal government says it offered 
state authorities the use of an elite antiterrorist squad after 
two bank robbers set off on a murderous highway rampage but the 
crack unit was never used 
a young woman a 15yearold boy and a police officer died 
during the 54hour ordeal that began with a bank robbery escalated 
into a bus hijacking and ended with a bloody gunfight on a highway 
near bonn 
criticism of the state governments handling of the case 
heightened considerably on friday one day after two men and a 
woman were arrested 
michael butz spokesman for the federal interior ministry told 
reporters the countrys elite gsg9 antiterrorist force was 
offered to north rhinewestphalia state officials to help end the 
crisis 
instead north rhinewestphalia officials dispatched a police 
commando unit the commandos rammed the getaway car and a gun 
battle ensued that resulted in the death of one of two hostages 
asked if the federal government regrets that the gsg9 was not 
used butz replied only the legal situation in which the states 
have responsibility for police deployments must be respected 
the gsg9 rescued 86 passengers held by terrorists on a 
lufthansa airliner on oct 13 1977 at mogadishu the capital of 
somalia 
some politicians criticized north rhinewestphalia officials for 
not making use of the gsg9 which stands for 
grenzschutzgruppeunit 9 or federal border guard troopsunit 9 
state officials defended their actions during the ordeal which 
began tuesday when two men robbed a bank in the northwestern town 
of gladbeck authorities gave them a getaway car and they fled 
with two hostages 
the gunmen surfaced wednesday in bremen 125 miles to the 
northeast where they seized a bus with about 30 people aboard 
most of the ordeal occurred in bremen and in north 
rhinewestphalia state but the gunmen also drove the bus across 
the border into the netherlands then returned to west germany in a 
car provided by dutch authorities 
a federal official education minister juergen moellemann said 
north rhine westphalia interior minister herbert schnoor and bernd 
meyer interior minister for the city of bremen should resign 
it is totally unconceivable why actions were not taken sooner 
to stop the bandits moellemann was quoted as saying in the 
masscirculation bild newspaper 
schnoor said he takes political responsibility for north 
rhinewestphalia law officials handling of the crisis but he 
rejected allegations they bungled the job 
meanwhile officials said they are certain that hostage silke 
bischof 18 was killed by one of the bank robbers and not by 
police during thursdays shootout 
police identified the gunmen as dieter degowski 32 and 
hansjuergen roesner 31 and their alleged female accomplice as 
marion irma loeblich 34 
a second hostage in the getaway car identified by the zdf as 
18yearold ines voitelle was grazed by a bullet on the back while 
gunman roesner was shot in the thigh during the police shootout 
an italian teenager emanuele de giorgi was shot to death 
wednesday night after the busload of hostages stopped at a highway 
rest area near bremen 
the frankfurt newspaper abendpost on friday said the 15yearold 
was killed by the gunmen while trying to protect his little sister 
from them 
a police officer also died in a car crash while pursuing the 
bandits toward the netherlands 
all the hostages but ms bischof and ms voitelle either escaped 
or were freed after the bus arrived in the netherlands
