mozambiques president joaquim chissano said 
thursday his government is willing to start talks within several 
weeks with the renamo rebels on ending the countrys 10year civil 
war 
chissano said he was awaiting an answer from the rebels through 
mediators who have been trying to bring the sides together he 
praised the united states for a sevenpoint proposal it presented 
both sides last year to help them overcome their reluctance to 
negotiate 
we feel we can now go into talks chissano told reporters at 
a news conference summing up three days of talks with president 
bush top officials of his administration and congressional leaders 
if renamo gives us a quick answer we are ready to start he 
added negotiations could begin as soon as chissano returns from 
next weeks ceremonies marking the independence of neighboring 
namibia he said 
renamo had been reluctant to accept one of the points that deals 
with recognition of mozambiques government and its constitution 
chissano said but now the rebels appear willing to recognize the 
government and recognition of the constitution can be worked out 
during the actual peace talks he said 
mozambique which in recent years has renounced its marxist 
doctrine and shifted to a marketoriented economy is drafting a 
constitution that would allow independent candidates to run in 
elections he said individuals from renamo would be eligible to 
participate chissano said 
the people of mozambique will also vote this summer on a 
proposal to allow more than one political party if that happens 
renamo could compete in elections he said 
mozambique has been devastated by the fighting with renamo 
founded in the 1970s by white south africans to counter the 
governments support for the guerrillas of the african national 
congress the group has been accused by us officials and human 
rights monitors of savage attacks on innocent civilians 
chissano said he was satisfied that the south african government 
of fw de klerk had stopped all assistance to renamo he said 
south african authorities were cooperating with his government to 
stop aid for the rebels from inidividuals in south africa the 
organization also has wealthy rightwing backers in portugal and 
brazil 
while praising de klerk for progress he has made toward starting 
talks with his countrys black majority about the future of 
apartheid chissano also urged the united states to maintain its 
economic sanctions against south africa until everyone is sure 
the process is irreversible 
chissano said he had asked bush for additional financial help to 
rehabilitate his country and help an estimated 56 million refugees 
and handicapped people mozambique receives more than 100 million 
annually from the united states making it the largest aid 
recipient in subsaharan africa

john poindexter erased 5000 computer files at 
the time he was resigning as national security adviser during the 
irancontra scandal a computer expert testified today at 
poindexters trial 
kelly williams said poindexter deleted the files from his 
computer leaving just 50 of his own computer files behind when he 
departed the national security council in november 1986 
deleting the files would be comparable to taking a manila 
envelope and just throwing it away asked associate independent 
counsel louise radin 
yes that would be the effect replied williams who was in 
charge of the computer software section at the white house 
communications agency in 1986 
under questioning from radin williams noted that poindexter was 
logged onto the computer system for a 15hour span on nov 24 
1986 starting at 430 in the morning that was the day before the 
national security adviser resigned 
on nov 22 thenwhite house aide oliver north deleted 732 notes 
from his own computer file leaving a total of just one 
copies of some of the deleted computer files of poindexter and 
oliver north were recovered from backup computer tapes kept at the 
nsc and have been instrumental in tracing the irancontra affair 
the deletions are part of a conspiracy charge against 
poindexter he is accused of working with north to destroy nsc 
records in an attempt to conceal the iran initiative and norths 
military assistance to the contras 
earlier today irancontra prosecutor dan webb said north gave 
such valuable testimony that the government may conclude its case 
against poindexter by monday 
webb said norths testimony went well and that the 
government got a lot out of the former white house aide who 
testified that he witnessed poindexter tear up a politically 
embarrassing presidential document 
earlier during norths four days on the stand us district 
judge harold greene called north a hostile witness and said 
getting him to answer questions on the stand was like pulling 
teeth 
but webb said today that norths testimony cut off two or 
three weeks of the prosecutions work and that i could rest as 
early as monday 
during his testimony north said poindexter sent him to a 
meeting with members of congress where north lied by denying he was 
assisting the contras before the meeting poindexter assured north 
that he could take care of the matter 
after webbs remarks the prosecution called as a witness the 
former general counsel to the cia stanley sporkin who drafted the 
presidential finding that poindexter subsequently destroyed 
sporkin explained how he was contacted in late november 1985 by 
the cias deputy director john mcmahon and was briefed by agency 
staffers on a hawk missile shipment to iran that the cia was 
assisting 
it was my preliminary view that for the cia to provide 
help that i would require that the president of the united states 
sign a document approving the action sporkin testified 
federal law requires that before the cia can undertake such 
activity in a foreign country it must have a finding said 
sporkin 
the document wasnt drafted until after the hawks were 
delivered so sporkin included a sentence saying that all prior 
actions taken by us officials in the operation are hereby 
ratified 
the document which depicted the iran initiative as a straight 
armsforhostages deal was torn up by poindexter a year later when 
the arms sales were exposed 
sporkin is now a us district judge serving in the same 
courthouse where poindexter is on trial 
the hurriedly drafted document known as a finding depicted 
the us government as being involved in a straight 
armsforhostages deal with iran poindexter presented it to 
president reagan for his signature two weeks after the missiles 
were sent to iran 
poindexter tore it up when the administrations iran initiative 
was exposed a year later he destroyed the paper the same day he 
told the house and senate intelligence committees that he hadnt 
known about the hawk shipment until five weeks after it occurred 
the prosecution contends that poindexters knowledge that the 
document existed was his motive in concealing the us role in the 
hawk shipment from congress 
the former national security adviser also is accused of two 
counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements by allegedly covering up norths military assistance to 
the contras and concealing the us role in the missile shipment to 
iran

the bush administration said today a libyan 
chemical weapons plant had been extensively damaged by fire and 
apparently was unable to function 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater denied anew that 
the united states was responsible for the blaze at the rabta 
chemical plant 
we dont know the origins of the fire he said we dont 
know if it was sabotage we dont have any idea who did it 
somebody could have knocked over a kerosene lamp or something 
without revealing the source of his information fitzwater 
characterized the damage at the plant as extensive common sense 
would tell you its not functioning he said we assume its 
not functioning 
however he also said the building is there but is it all 
burned out inside we dont really know 
president bush was asked at a prest patricks day party thrown 
by house speaker thomas foley what information he had on the 
chemical plant blaze 
not much bush said 
asked by a reporter if the united states had been involved in 
the fire bush said no but weve already said that 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi threatened today to retaliate 
against west germany if its agents set fire to the plant west 
germany denied responsibility 
gadhafi said the heavily guarded plant was designed only to 
produce pharmaceuticals but said libya would be willing to pay 
millions of dollars to any company that builds it a chemical 
weapons facility 
president bush said wednesday the united states had heard rumors 
that the plant was on fire but that he did not know what had 
happened 
fitzwater said the united states was told of the fire by 
diplomatic sources who also said libya had sealed its borders 
we just dare not speculate on the cause fitzwater said 
mahmoud azzabi press secretary at libyas united nations 
mission in new york confirmed wednesday night there is a fire 
at the rabta plant 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
there is speculation that it was possibly sabotage somebody 
coming in from tunisia which borders on libya he said 
the british broadcasting corp quoted an unidentified spokesman 
for the official libyan news agency jana as saying there had been a 
fire in some machinery at the plant but that the building had not 
been damaged 
abc news quoted unidentified libyan security sources as claiming 
that the plant was burned to the ground by the action of us and 
israeli agents 
we have no information to indicate that roman popadiuk a 
white house deputy press secretary said of the abc report 
fitzwater said last week the white house was seriously concerned 
by evidence that the plant was producing chemical weapons after a 
year of little activity 
he said then that the plant is dangerous and becoming more 
so and called for vigorous efforts to stop the operation of 
the plant he refused to rule out military action to close it 
despite libyan denials us officials have said the plant has 
been producing limited quantities of mustard and nerve gases 
in the past libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has said the 
plant was designed to produce pharmaceuticals 
the united states engaged in hostilities with libya three times 
in the 1980s twice shooting down libyan fighter planes and bombing 
tripoli in 1986 in retaliation for what thenpresident reagan said 
was terrorism against americans in europe 
western journalists were invited to tour the plant in january 
1989 but they were not allowed to inspect it after they arrived in 
rabta 
the libyans built a small village of cement block apartment 
buildings schools and community buildings about a mile beyond the 
gates to the complex to house the workers 
the journalists did see that the area was protected with 
surfacetoair missile batteries tanks and soldiers a short 
distance away a radar station operated on a high barren ridge 
overlooking the highway that led to the industrial complex 
the west german government has investigated allegations that a 
west german company helped build the plant

hundreds of handicapped preschoolers arent 
getting the help the bureau of indian affairs is required to 
provide government investigators say 
only 838 of the estimated 3000 handicapped 3yearolds and 
4yearolds on reservations with bia schools were getting special 
education in the 198889 school year the general accounting office 
said in a report released this month 
at least a fourth of the children who are receiving some 
services werent getting all the help they need because of 
shortages of qualified teachers and the money to hire them the gao 
said 
there are a tremendous number of indian families who dont 
even know that the reason why their child is so slow is that they 
have a developmental disability said yvette joseph an aide to 
the senate indian affairs committee 
the interior department contended in its response to the report 
that the department which includes the bia had successfully 
implemented childfind activities for many years 
congress will consider legislation to require greater 
cooperation between states and federal agencies on special 
education programs for indian children she said thursday 
congress in 1986 required the government to make sure all 
handicapped indian children aged 3 to 5 on reservations with bia 
schools get a free and appropriate education 
the gao cited an acute shortage of qualified teachers in many 
areas 
for example only eight of the 28 head start teachers for 
children on the cheyenne river reservation in south dakota even had 
teaching credentials and none of them had training in special 
education 
the other 20 teachers had only a high school diploma 
although the staff isnt qualified to teach handicapped 
children there are no alternatives according to the bia 
coordinator 
when the reservation tried to hire a speech therapist and 
special education teacher the bia contacted 27 colleges 
universities and individuals without finding a single qualified 
applicant the study said

bush administration officials said thursday 
they hope food aid can soon resume flowing to sudan but they 
strongly criticized the government of the faminewracked african 
nation 
to put it bluntly the relief situation has deteriorated 
assistant secretary of state herman j cohen told a joint hearing 
of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa and a task 
force on hunger 
cohen who visited the african nation last week said a civil 
war between the government and separatists in the south has blocked 
international relief agencies from shipping food into the country 
both sides in the current conflict say they want peace 
but both continue to fight he said 
three million sudanese are homeless and 500000 are at risk of 
death as a result of war and famine some 250000 many of them 
children died last year 
the united states joined other nations last year in operation 
lifeline sudan washington contributed more than 60 percent of the 
food delivered at a cost of 72 million 
the project succeeded in part because of a ceasefire between 
government troops and the sudanese peoples liberation army but the 
spla broke the ceasefire last october and the fighting continued 
a number of actions by the government have so far severely 
hampered a resumption of last years successful operation cohen 
said the spla must share the blame for this deterioration 
foreign donors are attempting to negotiate with the sudanese 
government to begin another round of operation lifeline sudan 
while we cannot say that the relief effort is definitely back 
on track we hope that it will be shortly cohen said i am 
confident that the sudanese government will fulfill its pledge to 
cooperate on operation lifeline sudan 
andrew natsios director of the agency for international 
developments office of foreign disaster assistance said the 
sudanese government believes weapons were smuggled to rebels in the 
south in the food shipments natsios said washington has assurred 
the gvoernment this is not the case 
cohen meantime said the us government has told the sudanese 
government which was installed in a coup last june that its 
human rights record needs improvement 
there have been reports he said that prisoners have been 
mistreated and held for long periods of time 
washington has also pressed the sudanese to return the country 
to representative government although the united states gives 
sudan food aid it has cut off all military and economic aid since 
last years coup

labor party leader shimon peres won a 
parliamentary showdown with the rival likud bloc today when 
lawmakers voted noconfidence in prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
hardline government 
the 6055 vote gave peres a chance to form a laborled coalition 
shamir the first premier to be turned out of office by a 
parliamentary vote in the history of the jewish state will remain 
as caretaker prime minister until a new government is seated 
peres won after shamir rejected a compromise offered by the 
ultraorthodox shas partys spiritual leader ovadia yosef who 
called for acceptance of us peace proposals for a 
palestinianisraeli dialogue five of the six lawmakers from shas 
then failed to attend the vote giving peres the margin of victory 
the compromise proposal was offered earlier today after more 
than five hours of angry debate in the 120seat parliament the 
debate was suspended to give the major political parties time to 
consider the compromise 
the us proposals would allow a deported palestinian and a 
resident of arab east jerusalem to serve on a palestinian 
negotating team that would meet with israelis in cairo 
shamir told parliament earlier today that the acceptance of 
arabs from east jerusalem in the peace process would compromise 
israels claim to sovereignty over the sector captured from jordan 
in 1967 
under the proposed compromise the two parties would have agreed 
that jerusalem is not negotiable and that it would remain united 
under israels rule shamir also would have reinstated labor 
ministers to the coalition in exchange for which the centrleft 
labor would drop its noconfidence motion 
before the noconfidence vote leaders of labor and likud both 
visited yosef to discuss the proposed compromise but to no avail 
when peres called for the noconfidence vote against shamir 
today he accused the rightwing leader of murdering the peace 
process 
shamir countered with an accusation that labor made repeated 
concessions to israels arab enemies calling this a shameful 
act 
the charge brought shouts of protest from labor ministers 
including peres who angrily wagged his finger at shamir and 
accused him of losing opportunities for peace 
i propose voting no confidence in the man who ended two 
processes peace and national unity peres said in a bitter 
speech 
shamir said he had been the driving force behind creation of the 
national unity government and that his party was just as interested 
in making peace as labor we are not afraid of peace or the peace 
process we fear irresponsible concessions shamir said calling 
for a defeat of the noconfidence motion 
shamir said the united states complicated the peace process by 
raising the sensitive issue of jerusalem and suggesting israels 
claim to the captured arab sector of the city should be a subject 
of negotiations 
there is only one jerusalem israels he said 
peres during his speech pointed a finger at shamir and accused 
him of breaking his commitment to religious and secular parties 
who will believe you again in this country you have broken every 
promise 
peres was interrupted frequently by likud heckling particularly 
from likud knesset member yehoshua matza who kept chanting 
subversive subversive 
a laborlikud coalition which has ruled israel through eight 
stormy years of repeated crises collapsed tuesday when shamir 
fired peres and the other 10 labor ministers resigned 
peres promised that a government led by his labor party would 
start peace talks with palestinians 
shamir said a victory by his likud bloc would delay if not 
cancel the israelipalestinian dialogue proposed by secretary of 
state james a baker iii

syrian soldiers guard gateways of two 
shiite moslem slum districts in south beirut in case kidnappers try 
to smuggle out terry anderson or other western hostages police say 
i am sure they are all alive sheik mohammed mehdi 
shamseddin spiritual head of lebanons shiite community said 
recently that much i can safely ascertain 
other senior shiite sources said the captives were alive and 
most were in south beirut 
police said the syrians tightened their security net around the 
hajjaj and hay madi districts after gun battles this week between 
rival shiite militias for control of the densely populated southern 
slums 
shiite sources said none of the hostages was hurt in the 
fighting between militiamen of the iranianbacked hezbollah 
believed to be an umbrella group for the hostageholders and the 
prosyrian amal movement 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
syrians moved rapidly to keep the battles from spreading through 
hajjaj and hay madi 
police said the syrians armed with rocketpropelled grenades 
and submachine guns threatened to kill any militiamen spotted on 
the streets 
that did it a police spokesman said the guns fell 
silent 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 the year after lebanons civil 
war began 
the police spokesman whose name cannot be used under standing 
regulations said the syrians were searching everything coming 
out from both neighborhoods where most of the hostages are thought 
to be imprisoned even funeral processions and caskets 
syrian soldiers have not tried to storm any suspected hideouts 
of kidnappers apparently for fear of killing hostages 
seventeen westerners are missing in lebanon and believed to be 
hostages including eight americans 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press has been held longest he was abducted five years ago on 
march 16 1985 
the captives have been moved often in car trunks or coffins 
either to escape fighting among shiite factions or to avoid 
detection 
french journalist jeanpaul kauffmann freed in 1988 said he 
nearly suffocated in a box that was slung beneath a truck 
anderson 42 was said to have been chained to a basement wall 
of a ruined beirut hotel during his early days as a captive 
freed hostages have said they too were held in basements or 
sometimes in upperfloor apartments with no access to windows 
all said they heard jet planes landing and taking off which 
supports the belief that most hostages are in the southern slums 
near beiruts airport 
shiites claiming to be close to the kidnappers often have 
approached news agencies in beirutoffering to help free anderson or 
anglican church envoy terry waite in return for as much as 1 
million for each hostage none of the offers was believed to be 
legitimate 
waite 50 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel in 
moslem west beirut to negotiate for the freedom of anderson and 
other americans 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran has asked proiranian 
factions in lebanon grouped under the umbrella of hezbollah or 
party of god to free the hostages but the shiite sources in 
beirut believe rafsanjani has little influence with the militant 
hezbollah wing that controls the hostageholders 
hezbollah militants are loyal to ali akbar mohtashemi the 
hardline former interior minister of iran who helped found 
hezbollah while he was irans ambassador to syria in the early 
1980s anderson is held by a group calling itself islamic jihad or 
islamic holy war 
rafsanjanis hostage behests are a cry without an echo said 
a senior shiite source rafsanjani wants a deal with the united 
states to unblock tehrans frozen assests to cope with irans 
economic crisis which is generating antigovernment public 
sentiment 
mohtashemi and other hardline opposition leaders have a stake 
in maintaining the crisis so they can agitate against rafsanjani 
so no hostages are likely to be released in the near future 
the united states holds billions of dollars in iranian assets 
that were frozen after the storming of the us embassy in tehran 
in 1979 fiftytwo americans were held 444 days 
rafsanjani and other iranian leaders have said iran would help 
get the hostages in lebanon released if the united states freed the 
assets 
this week mohtashemi said some of the captives were spies and 
argued against freeing any of the mercenary us hostages 
support for the hardliners came march 6 when a group holding 
american hostages joseph cicippio and edward austin tracy broke a 
sevenmonth silence to say no captives were about to be freed 
there is no intention to release hostages said the 
revolutionary justice organization which also threatened suicide 
attacks on us interests 
shiite sources said the next hostage release might come from 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which holds american 
college teachers robert polhill alann steen and jesse turner 
hussein mousawi a prosyrian activist based in the bekaa valley 
of east lebanon now controls the group the sources said 
mohtashemi loyalists recently removed mousawi from the hezbollah 
leadership

lawmakers from both parties urged president 
bush on thursday to provide aid to the african national congress 
and other organizations in south africa to help them prepare for 
negotiations to end apartheid 
bush met with eight house members recently returned from south 
africa where they met with president fw de klerk and anc leader 
nelson mandela 
house majority whip william h gray iii dpa the delegation 
leader said that the united states should aid the antiapartheid 
parties in south africa just as it has helped emerging democracies 
in eastern europe and elsewhere 
rep stephen j solarz dny suggested us aid in the 
vicinity of 10 million 
clearly the african national organization would be one 
organization that would qualify for such funding but it wouldnt 
be the only one solarz said 
just as weve taken initiatives like this for nicaragua for 
poland for the philippines for chile and other countries the 
time has now come for us to act in a similar fashion in south 
africa as well said solarz 
the lawmakers including such longtime advocates of stiffer 
sanctions on south africa as reps ron dellums dcalif and 
howard wolpe dmich said it was time to pause before 
imposing new sanctions on de klerks government 
mandela freed from prison last month after 27 years this week 
called on western nations to intensify sanctions 
we thought it was an appropriate time to pause in the effort 
at imposing additional sanctions said wolpe chairman of the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa but at the same 
time we also felt it was very important to maintain existing 
sanctions in place 
secretary of state james a baker iii will leave on a trip to 
southern africa on sunday he will attend a presidential 
inauguration in namibia and is expected to confer with de klerk in 
cape town baker is also seeking to arrange a meeting with mandela 
rep dean a gallo rny the cochairman of the delegation 
said the lawmakers came back from cape town with guarded 
optimism about the future of south africa 
gray said bush reiterated that he wanted to maintain 
bipartisan foreign policy in southern africa but made no 
commitment to an aid package 
solarz said the united states should not have any compunctions 
about aiding the anc which advocates armed resistance 
the commitment of an organization to the use of armed struggle 
as a tactic for the establishment of democracy has not precluded us 
from providing aid to unita in angola or to the contras in 
nicaragua said solarz i think the administration has crossed 
that conceptual rubicon a long time ago

vice president dan quayle found himself 
in a bit of a diplomatic pickle when the president of paraguay gave 
him a pair of cuddly jaguar cubs members of an endangered species 
it was decided that diplomatic protocol required quayle to 
accept the cubs which he was given while visiting asuncion on 
monday and then try to give them to a zoo said a quayle aide 
speaking only on condition of anonymity 
we learned about them three days before the trip started we 
tried to discourage it we were told the president had his heart 
set on it the aide told reporters 
but the national zoo in washington wouldnt take the jaguars 
because of their endangeredspecies status and an environmental 
group called quayles office to protest their being taken from the 
wild 
so on thursday at the presidential inauguration in brasilia 
quayle sent assistant secretary of state bernard aronson to give 
the bad news to an aide of paraguayan president andres rodriguez 
aronson told the paraguayan that quayle would prefer that the 
jaguars be released into the wilds of paraguay to benefit future 
generations of paraguayans the aide said 
why had rodriguez insisted on giving the cubs as a gift he 
knows theyre extremely rare they are prized in the united 
states the aide said 
however the united nations has passed a resolution condemning 
the use of endangered species as gifts 
in paraguay quayles staff had set up a photo session for the 
traveling press corps to photograph quayle and his wife marilyn 
playing with the cubs at the us ambassadors house in asuncion 
there was no indication of how rodriguez reacted to having his 
present spurned

irises the vincent van gogh painting 
that sold for a record 539 million in 1987 reportedly has been 
brought to the j paul getty museum which is considering buying it 
the museum isnt commenting getty spokeswoman lori starr 
said in response to wednesdays los angeles times report museum 
officials would say only that no agreement or purchase had taken 
place 
the owner of the masterpiece financially troubled australian 
entrepreneur alan bond reportedly has turned down offers of 50 
million to 60 million 
the painting was delivered to the museum 30 miles west of los 
angeles last week the newspaper said citing an unidentified 
source who saw the painting at the getty the pating was last 
reported to be at bonds office in sydney 
the new york times on thursday quoted museum staff members who 
declined to be identified as saying the painting remains at the 
museum while negotiations take place involving the getty bond and 
sothebys auction house 
museums often receive artworks before a purchase so curators can 
verify the works authenticity and examine it for possible damage 
major acquisitions must be approved by the museums board of 
trustees several of whom have viewed the painting the los angeles 
times said 
with a 21 billion endowment from the late oil baron j paul 
getty the museum is the worlds richest financial institution 
the 1889 painting characteristic of van goghs bold 
postimpressionist style depicts a field of midnightblue irises 
except for a single white iris the landscape is from a corner of 
the garden at the asylum of st paul de mausole in st remy de 
provence where the artist committed himself in 188990 
bond acquired the painting nov 11 1987 at sothebys 
reportedly financing the record auction price with a 27 million 
loan from the auction house which accepted the painting as 
collateral in an unusual transaction 
the highly leveraged acquisition similar to wall street 
takeover deals of whole corporations during the 1980s was widely 
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market 
the extraordinary prices paid for art in recent years also have 
placed many works beyond the acquisition budgets of art museums 
since bonds financial empire began crumbling under the weight 
of more than 5 billion in debt there has been widespread 
speculation among art curators dealers and collectors about the 
fate of irises 
the painting was in private european collections until 1947 
when it was purchased for 80000 by new york philanthropist joan 
whitney payson after a version of van goghs sunflowers sold 
for 399 million in 1987 payson decided to sell irises and 
use the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation

a college freshman who fell to his death 
in a sport called elevator surfing was the latest casualty of a 
littleknown but dangerous practice that has plagued highrises for 
years officials say 
sometimes called elevator action or piloting an 
elevator the hazardous exercise involves climbing atop elevator 
cars either through a trapdoor in the cars roof or by jamming 
doors open from a floor above the car and riding on the roofs 
weve taken it terribly seriously weve been fighting it for 
a long time said val coleman director of public information for 
the new york city housing authority ten deaths and more than 50 
injuries have been reported in new york during the past five years 
he said 
its a very serious problem in our highrise buildings said 
coleman who worked on a recently released cautionary videotape on 
the issue called children are too young to die 
at otis elevator co the nations largest elevator 
manufacturer officials have known about the dangerous games for 
some time said michael jordanreilly spokesman for the hartford 
connbased company 
this is one of our major concerns he said 
at the university of massachusetts at amherst 18yearold joel 
mangion of newton was found dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft 
sunday friends said he had been elevator surfing jumping from 
one car to another in the double shaft 
about a year ago a student suffered serious injuries after 
falling 30 feet in a shaft university officials said in the early 
1970s a student died after riding in a chair tied to the bottom of 
a car 
students said they have heard of the practice although it isnt 
something most people try 
usually on the weekends when people are drunk you hear about 
someone who went elevator surfing student susan beckett told 
the campus newspaper the collegian 
donald a robinson director of environmental health and safety 
for umass said officials are looking for new ways to discourage 
elevator surfing 
the message needs to be made very clear how elevators should 
be used and not misused and to really emphasize the obvious 
significant consequences he said we are really trying to take 
a hard look at all the issues and make all efforts to make sure it 
doesnt happen again 
industry officials said its difficult to determine the extent 
of the problem because elevator deaths are not reported to a 
central agency jordanreilly said the problem has probably existed 
as long as there have been elevators and as long as there have 
been people who want to try something dangerous

fidel castro said cuba has no need for 
sovietstyle reforms but that relations between cuba and the soviet 
union have not been hurt by his rejection of mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika 
cuba is not the soviet union we are different countries with 
different origins the cuban president said wednesday in an 
interview with tv globo brazils largest network he was in brazil 
for the inauguration of president fernando collor de mello 
castro has remained adamant in his refusal to accept the reforms 
increasingly embraced in the east bloc and he showed no sign of 
wavering in the interview 
the revolutionary leader said he still has the most profound 
conviction that for cuba there is no solution superior or path 
better than socialism 
despite his differences with gorbachev on reform there are no 
fundamental problems in relations between the two countries castro 
said 
i wouldnt speak of ideological differences but different 
paths that respond to different situations he said 
our economic relations with the soviet union are perfectly 
well castro added even if aid from the soviet union was 
reduced cubas economy would not suffer seriously he claimed 
castro also said he saw no need for westernstyle elections in 
cuba 
we have our own type of electionit would take long to 
explain our political process but we could have a debate to see 
which is more democratic what we have in cuba or another type 
he said 
congresses of cubas ruling communist party choose the countrys 
leadership there are no popular elections

vice president dan quayle said thursday 
he wants anyone who has contact with cuban president fidel 
castro to urge him to hold elections 
quayle also repeated his call for cuba to halt arms shipments to 
rebels fighting the usbacked government of el salvador 
but the vice president himself avoided contact with castro at 
thursdays inauguration of brazils new president 
quayle told a news conference he had discussed the matter of 
cuba with other latin leaders during his weeklong trip through 
south america 
we have encouraged all people who have any contact with fidel 
castro to urge him to stop the war in el salvador to stop 
funding the wellorganized guerilla movement 
asked what he had discussed with nicaraguas outgoing president 
daniel ortega the day before quayle said that the disarmament of 
ortegas ruling sandinistas when they leave power is a matter of 
concern to the united states 
there are reports that many arms are being shipped out to the 
sandinistas that are taking them to their homes or taking them to 
the hills ready to fight again at another time that would be a 
most unfortunate development with the pending transfer of power 
to violeta chamorro who defeated ortega in the feb 25 election 
at the inauguration castro entered the hall just ahead of 
quayle and was immediately surrounded as he made his way up the 
crowded aisle to his frontrow seat 
quayle trailed several yards back he greeted a few people in 
the aisle and edged past the clot around castro to his own seat 
four places down the front row 
in his news conference before leaving brazil quayle continued a 
drumbeat against castro 
we also urge anyone who is in contact with castro to ask him 
when hes going to have elections elections have been held 
elsewhere in latin america and cuba should be no exception 
quayle spoke about cuba in talks thursday with collor and with 
bolivias president jaime paz zamora who sat next to castro at 
the inauguration 
castro flanked on the other side by a representative of the 
vatican chatted frequently with paz zamora during collors lengthy 
speech 
quayles press secretary david beckwith said quayle had asked 
collor to urge castro to bring democracy to cuba quayle earlier 
won assurances from president carlos menem that argentina would try 
to exert pressure on castro as well 
quayle is due to return to washington on friday

the man who salvaged the exxon valdez 
said today that joseph hazelwood acted professionally after the 
tanker ran aground on a reef and was clearly trying to keep it 
stable until help arrived 
what he did was very professional it reflects his training 
said julius leitz a marine salvager from portland ore 
everything he did was aimed at keeping the vessel on the rock 
which was the prudent thing to do 
leitz called by hazelwoods defense team disputed the 
testimony of several prosecution experts including another 
salvager who said the ship would have sunk if it was extricated 
from a reef in prince william sound 
i disagree said leitz it wouldnt have sunk 
he added that speculation on the subject was pointless because 
thats all assuming the ship would leap off the rocks i dont 
think that would happen 
the witness said the tanker would have required levitation to 
come off the rocks where it was impaled march 24 
defense attorney michael chalos led the witness through a series 
of questions concerning hazelwoods immediate actions after his 
ship rammed the reef after each question he asked whether 
hazelwoods actions were prudent or inprudent 
prudent the witness answered repeatedly 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is the only exxon valdez 
crew member charged in the grounding which caused the nations 
worst oil spill the tanker rammed jagged bligh reef gashing its 
hull and spewing nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil in a 
spill which devastated fisheries wildlife and the scenic shores of 
prince william sound 
the former skipper is charged with a felony criminal mischief 
and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil if convicted he 
could be sentenced to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
on wednesday an exxon tanker captain who once sailed with 
hazelwood gave him high marks for seamanship on the day of the 
grounding but said he might not have imbibed as hazelwood did 
before boarding his ship 
ivan mihajlovic testifying in hazelwoods defense said he 
found no fault with the skippers navigation nor with his decision 
to leave the bridge while his tanker crossed alaskas prince 
william sound 
on crossexamination assistant district attorney brent cole 
gave the witness a prosecution scenario in which hazelwood had five 
drinks during seven hours ashore in valdez on march 23 the day his 
ship sailed the accident happened in the early morning hours of 
march 24 
do you have an opinion whether that is proper conduct for an 
exxon master asked cole 
thats probably something i wouldnt do said mihajlovic 
chalos objected to the question because of a dispute in 
testimony as to how much hazelwood actually drank 
but superior court judge karl johnstone said cole was entitled 
to ask questions based on his view of the evidence 
chalos then asked you said your own personal preference 
wouldnt be to drink ashore does the fact someone else would 
drink make it improper 
no responded the witness 
mihajlovic was among the final witnesses in the defense case 
which is expected to conclude by weeks end 
prosecutors maintain that hazelwood was reckless in leaving the 
bridge in control of a third mate during a transit they claim was 
hazardous 
but mijalovic said he doesnt consider prince william sound 
hazardous and noted he has left the bridge of his own vessel in 
that area 
he said there is no regulation requiring a captain be on the 
bridge for the transit and said the only such regulation in 
existence is for the panama canal 
like other seagoing witnesses mihajlovic was asked to assess 
the difficulty of a 10degree right rudder turn the missed 
maneuver that apparently let the exxon valdez drift into the reef 
oh im sure nobody here could do that the witness said 
looking around the courtroom just put them on a ship 
the judge recessed court a halfhour early wednesday after 
hearing that redoubt volcano had erupted again and ash might be 
drifting toward anchorage were going to let you get a jump on 
the volcano he told jurors

a lawyer for savings and loan financier 
charles h keating jr bragged in a 1988 letter released thursday 
that she had pressured federal regulators 
you have the federal home loan bank board right where you 
want them and you should be able to reach an agreement which 
will completely satisfy you washington lawyer margery waxman 
wrote in the may 10 1988 letter 
waxman who was referring to an upcoming meeting with board 
officials told keating she had put pressure on m danny wall 
chairman of the bank board and then chief regulator of thrift 
institutions 
house banking committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas who released the letter said it strongly suggests the 
fix was in at the federal home loan bank board 
banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter 
keating is chairman of a holding company that owned lincoln 
savings and loan association irvine calif it failed in april and 
is expected to require the nations costliest sampl bailout about 2 
billion 
at the time the letter was sent keating was fighting federal 
efforts to rein in his institution bank board examiners based in 
san francisco had recommended that the government seize lincoln and 
keating had appealed to authorities in washington 
as you know i have put pressure on wall to work toward 
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff waxman 
wrote they all know the wednesday meeting is crucial to their 
future if they mess up this time it is all over 
the letter was written five days after a divided bank board 
decided to move the lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its san 
francisco office to washington and on the same day wall had a 
telephone conversation with keating 
waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the 
meeting including a new examination of lincoln and memorandum of 
understanding between the institution and regulators which was 
executed five days later 
san francisco is finished she assured keating there is 
no going back to san francisco and nothing can be done to follow up 
their exam 
in the new exam she said nothing will be done that you 
are not aware of in advance 
also she told keating that bank board personnel will not be 
able to enforce any violation of the memorandum of understanding 
without going to the board first this will give you two 
bites at the apple before the board and in court if necessary 
the letter written in strong declarative language tracks 
with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board actions 
which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on lincoln 
gonzalez said in reality as the letter carefully explains the 
actions were to be shams designed not to punish but to allow 
keating an escape route 
neither wall nor waxman immediately returned telephone calls 
seeking comment rosemary stewart enforcement director of the bank 
board declined to comment immediately 
the letter indicates it was telecopied to keating in phoenix 
its existence was first disclosed in stories in thursdays editions 
of the san francisco chronicle

compensation for damage caused in attacks by the usarmed contra 
rebels 
the decision was in support of a june 1986 ruling by the 
international court of justice in the hague that ruling said us 
support for the contra rebels was in violation of the united 
nations charter and constituted unlawful use of force 
the court also known as the world court called on the us to 
compensate nicaragua for rebel attacks but said the amount of 
payment should be decided between the two sides 
at the time of the decision nicaragua said rebel damage 
amounted to 375 million the us has refused to accept the 
ruling which is not binding 
the european parliament welcomed wednesdays decision by 
president bush to give nicaragua 300 million in aid and lift a

nicaraguan exports access to the us market 
the statements were made in a resolution adopted by the 518seat 
assembly of the european community

political groups except for the extreme rightwing it said 
demobilization of the contra rebels was particularly urgentin 
order that the largest possible proportion of available economic 
and human resources can be devoted to economic and social 
development 
the parliament also called on the european community to 
strengthen its political and economic cooperation with central 
america to show our partners that the economic consequences of

the united states is pushing the soviet union 
to allow xray inspections of sealed missile cannisters as 
required by the treaty banning mediumrange missiles the state 
department said thursday 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that the soviets are refusing 
to permit us inspectors to use a cargoscan xray device at 
the missileproduction facility at votkinsk and that some missile 
cannisters subsequently have been shipped without being inspected 
she said us inspectors at votkinsk nearly 700 miles east of 
moscow have declared the refusal an ambiguity which she 
called the most serious action our inspectors can take under 
the onsite inspection provisions of the 1987 intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty which bans missiles with ranges of 300 to 
3400 miles 
the us regards any question of compliance with the inf 
treaty as a very serious matter ms tutwiler said we are 
continuing to press the soviets to solve this problem by allowing 
us to use the cargoscan system 
american and soviet technical teams have been dispatched to the 
plant to examine the cargoscan system which the united states says 
meets the treatys requirements for a nondamaging xray device 
able to determine what is inside a missile cannister 
the us team hopes to demonstrate that the equipment works as 
specified and to answer the soviets technical questions she said 
secretary of state james a baker has protested the soviet 
action to foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who agreed that 
the issue needs to be resolved as soon as possible ms tutwiler 
said 
former president reagan who signed the treaty with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in december 1987 earlier accused 
the soviets of violating previous arms control accords 
the inf treaty therefore contained a complex onsite 
verification system designed to respond to skeptics in congress who 
said the soviets were likely to cheat 
mrs tutwiler said the soviets claim the cargoscan equipment is 
not yet operating in compliance with the agreement 
as a result they the soviets recently shipped a number of 
missile cannisters from the production facility at the plant 
without allowing us inspectors to use cargoscan equipment 
she declined to say how many missiles had been shipped 
the united states wants to examine cannisters said to contain 
ss25 missiles permitted by the treaty to make sure they do not

lodging expenses for healthrelated travel are 
taxdeductible only if necessary to obtain a physicians care the 
us tax court has ruled 
merely traveling on a doctors recommendation to a more 
favorable climate to alleviate a specific ailment is not enough to 
justify a deduction the court held the travel must be essential 
to care provided by a doctor in a hospital or similar facility 
the ruling earlier this week was the first time the court had 
considered a 1984 law that in certain situations allows lodging 
costs to be included in deductible medical expenses 
the court case involved earlene polyak of trenton mich who 
suffered from chronic heart artery and lung problems following 
her doctors advice she began spending winters in florida living 
in a travel trailer while her husband stayed at their home in 
michigan 
her physicians did not refer mrs polyak to any doctors in 
florida and she visited a doctor only twice during her five months 
there 
she and her husband claimed a medical deduction for 1426 they 
spent to rent a campground lot for the trailer but were turned down 
by the internal revenue service 
the new law was written to benefit people who must travel away 
from home because specialized care is not available locally or in 
the case of some chemotherapy treatment for cancer for example 
may be obtained on an outpatient basis at a considerably lower 
cost 
in siding with the irs against mrs polyak senior judge william 
a goffe noted the new law permits deduction of transportation 
costs in such cases so long as it is primarily for and essential 
to medical care but lodging expenses must pass a threepart test 
they must be primarily for and essential to medical care 
the care must be provided by a physician in a licensed hospital 
or equivalent facility and 
the travel and lodging must hold no significant element of 
personal pleasure recreation or vacation 
goffe concluded that mrs polyak passed the first and third 
tests but failed the second 
mrs polyak did not go to florida to seek medical care from a 
physician goffe wrote the medical treatment received by mrs 
polyak was incidental and of routine nature

the vatican and the soviet union established 
diplomatic ties thursday for the first time since the founding of 
the communist state 74 years ago 
the vatican and moscow said the two sides have agreed to 
exchange representatives with the rank of apostolic nuncio or 
papal envoy and extraordinary ambassador 
the ties fall short of full diplomatic relations vatican 
spokesman joaquin navarro described them as prediplomatic 
relations and said there was room for further development he 
gave no indication when ties might be upgraded 
there are a number of problems to be resolved including the 
status of the ukrainian catholic church it was suppressed under 
soviet dictator josef stalin and incorporated into the russian 
orthodox church 
still the move was an extraordinary advance in relations 
between the center of the roman catholic church and a state that 
declared war against religion after the bolshevik revolution of 
1917 
it also reflects the vastly improved climate in relations 
between the church and soviet bloc countries since the collapse of 
hardline communist leaderships 
relations have steadily improved under soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev the decision to establish ties came during his talks 
with the pope at the vatican on dec 1 it was the first meeting 
between a roman pontiff and a supreme soviet leader 
initially the two representatives will not have permanent 
residences 
but navarro said the papal nuncio could decide to keep an 
assistant in moscow if he thought it was needed 
the vatican will be represented by archbishop francesco 
colasuonno an italian prelate who has been a roving vatican envoy 
to eastern europe 
the name of the soviet ambassador was not immediately announced 
the vatican and moscow had diplomatic relations under the 
russian czars but those ties were broken when the communists came 
to power 
one of the main points of friction between moscow and rome has 
been the ukrainian church 
it would regain legal status under a proposed freedom of 
religion law promised by gorbachev when he met with the pope but 
as yet the measure has not been adopted 
gorbachev also invited the pope to the soviet union but the 
vatican gave no indication when john paul would accept the 
invitation 
the pope had previously been barred from visiting his flock in 
lithuania the situation could be further complicated by the 
republics recent declaration of independence from the soviet union 
over the past few months in a further sign of the improved 
vaticansoviet relations john paul has received a number of soviet 
visitors a soviet journalist for the first time traveled on the 
popes plane on an african pilgrimage in january 
in the past year full relations were reestablished with poland 
the popes homeland and hungary john paul visits czechoslovakia 
next month 
on wednesday the vatican restored the leadership of the 
longpersecuted roman catholic church in romania and revived the 
eastern rite branch that was suppressed there in 1948 its 
situation was similar to that of the ukrainian catholic church

a moslem extremist group holding three 
american professors hostage threatened thursday to kill them if the 
united states fails to meet its unspecified demands 
the group the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
also threatened to attack airlines that carry soviet jewish 
immigrants to israel 
it said individuals and organizations who recently said the 
hostages should be freed on humanitarian grounds should stay out of 
the affair 
the organization believed made up of shiite moslem zealots 
loyal to iran made the threats in a statement delivered the 
independent newspaper annahar 
the statement was accompanied by a photograph of professor 
robert polhill one of three american educators kidnapped from the 
campus of the usaffiliated beirut university college on jan 24 
1987 
the other two are alann steen 49 of boston and jesse turner 
41 of boise idaho polhill a new yorker is 54 
the statement was the first from groups holding foreign hostages 
since march 6 when a group holding americans joseph cicippio and 
edward austin tracy broke a sevenmonth silence to say no captives 
were about to be freed 
there is no intention to release hostages said the 
revolutionary justice organization which also threatened suicide 
attacks on us interests 
there are 18 foreign hostages including eight americans 
friday marks the fifth year in captivity for the longestheld 
american hostage terry a anderson the 42yearold chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
thursdays handwritten statement in arabic said the 
organization of islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free the 
hostages and close this file 
it asks the authors of these moves not to interfere in this 
matter because we are holding agents and spies against our people 
and they will be executed if the american administration fails to 
meet our demands 
irans tehran times newspaper which has close ties to president 
hashemi rafsanjani of iran said in two recent editorials that the 
hostages should be freed on islamic humanitarian grounds 
rafsanjani himself said he believed the issue was moving toward a 
solution 
sheikh mohammad hussein fadlallah spiritual guide of lebanons 
hezbollah or party of god also said in a february sermon that a 
humanitarian means of freeing the hostages had to be found 
hezbollah is believed to be the shiite moslem umbrella 
organization for the extremist groups holding the 18 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
the statement thursday did not spell out the demands the 
kidnappers expected the bush administration to meet 
the group had previously offered to trade the three professors 
for 400 arab prisoners in israeli jails israel rejected the offer 
and the reagan administration refused to pressure israel to change 
its stance 
we did not carry out the death sentences because we are 
waiting for the appropriate time the statement said without 
mentioning a specific deadline 
the statement said 
we have laid down the trap and are eagerly waiting for the 
promised american adventure to free them hostages by force 
we announce that there is no solution for and no deal about 
this issue except within the framework of exchanges 
the statement accused the united states of responsibility for 
the current emigration of soviet jews to israel after pressure on 
the soviets who succumbed and collaborated in this big conspiracy 
our people shall not stand handcuffed in front of this 
conspiracy we shall not stand by watching but shall begin taking 
the adequate measures to prevent the arrival of the soviets the 
statement added 
all airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines 
their jetliners and offices will be direct targets for us this is 
a warning and a threat the statement said 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews are expected in israel in 
the coming years as the soviet union has lifted all their 
restrictions on leaving 
the influx has created an uproar in the arab world 
it caused fears that the soviet jews would settle in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where palestinians hope one day 
to create a homeland 
the fate of the hostages has often been linked to developments 
in the middle east in the past but this was apparently the first 
time they were tied to the issue of soviet jewish immigration 
the 18 hostages include eight americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss and irishman and an italian 
their fate at the hands of iranianbacked groups is believed 
linked to a power struggle in tehran between moderates who seek 
better ties with the west and radicals that seek to confront it 
rafsanjani leader of the moderate camp has made several 
statements in the past about wanting to see the hostages freed but 
he is believed to have little influence over the extremist groups 
holding them

for the poor

sacred commitment to improve social conditions the tall

door for foreign investment

backing from powerful sao paulo business group and tried to 
maintain a discreet distance from the massive globo media empire 
which nevertheless openly supported him 
collor de mello was born aug 12 1949 into a powerful media 
and landowning clan in alagoas it is a poor state in northeastern 
brazil dominated by sugarplantation barons and still known for its

the white house budget chief sought to lure 
democrats into talks on deficitreduction on thursday telling 
lawmakers he has tried to switch the emphasis away from 
president bushs pledge to not raise taxes 
budget director richard darman told congress joint economic 
committee the administration remains opposed to the tax increases 
proposed by rep dan rostenkowski dill last sunday as part of a 
massive deficitcutting plan 
but he said he has tried in his appearances before congress this 
year to avoid focusing on bushs campaign pledge of no new 
taxes 
ive tried to switch the emphasis darman said lets talk 
about what helps provide economic growth 
many congressional democrats consider tax increases vital to any 
serious effort to reduce the budget deficit which the 
administration expects to be about 120 billion this year bush has 
repeatedly said he opposes higher taxes but he and his aides have 
hinted in recent days at a possible softening of that position 
questioned by democrats on the committee darman even conceded 
there are items in bushs proposed fiscal 1991 budget that could 
be interpreted as tax increases in a narrow sense 
bushs spending plan called for 139 billion in new revenues 
next year the new receipts would include extending the social 
security payroll tax to 7 million uncovered state and local 
government workers by increasing taxes paid by airline passengers 
and by raising other fees 
the budgets for the last three years have been shaped by talks 
between congressional leaders and the white house many leading 
democrats unhappy with the results have said congress should 
shape the spending plan itself this year but darman has been 
trying for weeks to get congressional democrats to negotiate 
i continue to believe that the only way to responsible deficit 
reduction is through bipartisan agreement darman said 
darman also said he believes rostenkowskis deficitcutting 
proposal would not contribute satisfactorily to economic 
growth he added however that it would only marginally 
hinder the economy 
rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
defended his plan saying it was preferable to this years two 
other prominent proposals 
sen daniel moynihan dny has proposed cutting the social 
security payroll tax rate while bush has continued pressing for a 
cut in the capital gains tax rate critics have said both would 
ultimately boost the federal deficit 
if we lack the collective guts to increase revenues to pay our 
bills i only hope that we are responsible enough to avoid cutting 
them and making the deficit worse rostenkowski told the 
midcontinent oil and gas association in a lunchtime speech

the nuclear regulatory commission on thursday 
signed a fullpower license for the seabrook nuclear power plant 
ending any chance opponents will be able to prevent it from 
operating before court appeals are completed 
this is a major victory for new england consumers said 
edward brown president of new hampshire yankee which operates 
seabrook our 17year licensing saga is over 
but opponents said the legal battle to shut down the plant would 
continue 
we have not yet begun to fight said scott denman director 
of the safe energy communication council an antiseabrook group 
that has been aiding the legal battle the lawsuit will go on and 
the final outcome is yet to be known 
thomas murley director of the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation made the license official two weeks after the nrc voted 
unanimously to allow the new hampshire plant to operate 
commercially the commission placed a twoweek hold on its vote to 
allow time for filing court appeals 
nrc spokesman john kopeck said thursday that the license had 
been signed 
the signing came a day after the us court of appeals in 
washington refused to block the issuance of the license opponents 
argued that evacuation plans for the population around seabrook are 
inadequate 
the actual granting of the license sets in motion a monthslong 
process of accelerating the plant to fullpower brown said plant 
officials would need several days to review hundreds of pages of 
technical specifications accompanying the license before beginning 
the startup process 
the plant will generate electricity for the first time within a 
few weeks brown said 
after between two to three months of increasing power and a 
variety of tests the 65 billion plant would be ready to go into 
commercial operation 
located along the coast about two miles north of the 
massachusetts border seabrooks 1150 megawatt reactor can power 
about a million new england homes

representations of mummies on display at art galleries across the 
country but never in a morgue 
thats where one of her creations was taken by police 
the mummy art apparently was picked up by houston police when 
they helped a landlord enter a residence to find out why water was 
leaking into an apartment below 
they found a leaking aquarium and the mummylike figure 
according to the houston post 
the owner who had purchased the piece from ms kopriva in 1986 
had left it there along with other property while moving to a new 
residence ms kopriva said 
harris county medical examiners office investigator cecil wingo 
would say little about the case other than that it was much ado 
about nothing he said he did not want to embarrass the legitimate 
art collector 
one official said the mummy was taken to the morgue to determine 
if it had human parts and was merely a case where the police who 
found the figure didnt know anything about bone anatomy 
ms kopriva says people often mistake her artwork for real 
mummies but not for a very long time 
its a very mummylooking piece the artist said of the

a surprise nationwide sweep of fastfood 
restaurants and other businesses found 7000 teenagers employed 
for too many hours or in dangerous jobs in violation of childlabor 
laws labor secretary elizabeth dole said thursday 
the threeday investigation called operation child watch 
is expected to result in more than 18 million in civil fines 
against businesses mrs dole said fines totaling 27 million 
were assessed during all of 1989 
the majority of the allegations involved firms in which 14 and 
15yearolds worked more hours or later at night during the school 
week than allowed under federal law said william brooks an 
assistant labor secretary 
but there were also more than 900 youngsters mostly 16 and 
17yearolds who were performing dangerous tasks or using 
hazardous equipment such as powerdriven meatslicing machinery 
dough mixers and paperbalers 
mrs dole said labor shortages are tempting firms to violate 
childlabor laws in order to find enough workers that problem will 
only worsen in coming years she said since the number of workers 
between the ages of 16 and 24 is expected to drop by about 2 
million or 8 percent by the year 2000 
she said businesses may need to consider offering better fringe 
benefits and higher salaries in order to attract workers 
federal law forbids 14yearolds and 15yearolds from working 
more than three hours on a school day or 18 hours during the 
fiveday school week eight hours is permitted on weekend days and 
40hour weeks are permitted in summer and during vacations 
those youngsters may not work outside the hours of 7 am to 7 
pm or 9 pm from june 1 to labor day 
brooks also said nearly 200 youngsters under 14 barred from 
most jobs with a few exceptions such as certain farm work and 
newspaper routes were found illegally employed 
most of the 7000 alleged violations were at service businesses 
such as restaurants grocery stores pizza and donut shops or dry 
cleaning firms officials said 
mrs dole declined to name businesses involved saying 
investigations are still going on 
brooks said one food store employed more than 20 minors whose 
duties included the operation of paperbaling machinery which he 
called a particularly dangerous piece of equipment pizza shops 
in two states employed more than 50 youngsters to illegally drive 
cars he said 
two 16yearolds were found illegally employed at a roofing 
company he said one of the youngsters fingers were crushed and 
nearly severed when a load shifted on the back of a truck the 
other boy had fallen off a roof but did not sustain longterm 
injuries brooks said 
the threeday probe which involved 500 federal investigators 
who visited businesses in all 50 states was intended to send a 
signal that the government is strengthening its efforts to protect 
children from exploitation in the workplace mrs dole said at a 
news conference 
the cop is on the beat violations whether motivated by greed 
or by ignorance will not be tolerated she said 
mrs dole said skeptics of the bush administrations commitment 
to child labor enforcement are needlessly worried 
i think the proof is in the pudding as they say there will 
be additional strike forces she said 
in a letter to mrs dole this week rep charles schumer 
dny called for more money to combat childlabor violations he 
noted that there are fewer than 1000 federal investigators 
assigned to such matters 
with so little oversight it is little wonder than childlabor 
violations are becoming more widespread in the absence of 
strong federal action the future may be even bleaker schumer 
wrote 
rep don pease dohio said he welcomed mrs doles readiness 
to get tough with child labor scofflaws but said the situation 
calls for more than a finger in the dike 
pease and schumer plan to introduce legislation next month to 
expand the definition of childlabor violations it also may 
provide more funding for enforcement and increase the penalties 
beyond the current 1000 maximum a spokesman said 
mrs dole said the government should first make the most of 
current resources then if additional funds are needed you can 
bet ill ask for those funds she said adding that other 
proposed changes are under review 
of the 3400 businesses visited during the threeday probe 
about 1400 were in apparent violation of child labor practices 
she said 
last year the labor departments wage and hour division which 
enforces childlabor provisions of the fair labor standards act 
found 22508 minors to be illegally employed an alltime high 
last thursday the department sued the burger king restaurant 
chain in us district court in miami alleging child labor law 
violations since 1986

he said there was much less of a danger today from the

bush made his comments at a questionandanswer session with the

the president was not asked about a fire that caused extensive 
damage at a libyan plant the united states suspects of making 
chemical weapons 
referring to gorbachev bush said i think hes a reasonable 
man im not worried about the constitutional changes 
the soviet parliament voted tuesday to expand gorbachevs 
authority and end the communist partys monopoly on political power 
bush opened the session by saying the us economy remains 
sound and steady but not as robust as id like to see it 
responding to questions bush noted a wave of recent speculation 
suggesting the release soon of some of the american hostages in 
lebanon 
that frankly confused me bush said because the us 
government is not involved in any negotiations he said the 
speculation had prompted him to wonder whether a private initiative 
had been undertaken on behalf of the hostages 
i wish i could tell you there was a serious immediate effort 
that would pay off but that isnt the case the president said 
he said he was glad that he had accepted what turned out to be a 
hoax telephone call from someone posing as iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
i would do it again bush said

the communist leader of an 
attempt to overthrow president najib of afganistan said he has 
joined forces with moslem guerrillas to fight the sovietbacked 
government 
gen shah nawaz tanai afghanistans former defense minister 
said that despite past differences he and the moslem guerrillas 
share a common goal to overthrow the najib government 
as najibs defense minister tanai was credited with 
successfully defending jalalabad which was attacked by usbacked 
rebels when the soviet union withdrew its troops last year after a 
decade in afghanistan 
tanai 40 led a march 6 coup attempt in which 200 civilians 
died and 500 were injured no military casualty figures have been 
released 
the coup has not failed it is continuing tanai told 
reporters wednesday at a guerrilla base in northern logar province 
tanai wearing his afghan military uniform sat in a dimly lit 
heavily guarded bunker dug into a mountainside he talked for the 
first time about the coup attempt and his agreement with gulbuddin 
hekmatyar the leader of hezbiislami or party of islam 
guerrilla faction 
for the national interest there is a strategic cooperation 
with gulbuddin hekmatyar to remove najib tanai said hekmatyar 
advocates an islamic state in afghanistan 
tanai said he instructed his soldiers to cooperate with 
hekmatyar 
he said a large number of soldiers remain loyal to him and 
that he is mobilizing and reestablishing contacts with them when 
asked whether the number was tens hundreds or thousands he 
replied more than that 
with the help of the mujahedeen the struggle against the 
regime is continuing tanai said najib is a warmonger he 
claims he wants peace and national reconcilation but he continues 
to burn the nation in the flames of war 
during the almost 12yearold civil war tanai took a hard line 
against the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors and had opposed 
najibs overtures to guerrilla commanders 
we accept the mistakes of the past and our coming here proves 
that tanai said we have sided with the nation and our actions 
should make up for these mistakes 
hekmatyar has said he would support anyone who tried to 
overthrow najib including tanai but the six other parties in the 
guerrillas pakistanbased governmentinexile have sought to 
distance themselves from tanai 
some moderate resistance leaders however have said the 
tanaihekmatyar connection broke a barrier blocking a political 
solution to the war which has claimed 15 million lives and 
destroyed tens of thousands of villages 
gulbuddin has removed the stigma the obstacle of talking to 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan said a 
member of the moderate national islamic front of afghanistan 
maybe its time for the rest of us to start talking to them not 
najib but to other members of the party 
tanai was brought to a hezbiislami base about 50 miles from 
kabul in a truck guarded by hekmatyars guerrillas while he 
talked dozens of fighters stood guard around the camp and on the 
hills that ring the base

a raid on a jetliner thursday netted 53 illegal 
aliens including three romanians bringing to 98 the number of 
undocumented aliens seized from the transcontinental route in two 
days authorities said 
those detained when eastern airlines flight 88 made a scheduled 
stop in atlanta also were from mexico guatemala and nicaragua 
they were interviewed and photographed and then fingerprinted 
said officials conducting the raids known as operation redeye 
replay 
the overnight flight from los angeles to new york is known as 
the redeye its lower fares are attractive to illegal aliens 
the undocumented aliens purchased their tickets in advance and 
apparently did not know of the previous days arrests said neil 
jacobs the deputy agent in charge of the immigration and 
naturalization services atlanta district 
the smugglers who booked the flight were paid in advance and 
probably didnt care if the aliens were caught he said 
the smugglers are dealing in human beings said thomas 
fischer agent in charge of the atlanta ins office they could 
care less about what happens to these people today 
agents checked manifests on eastern flight 88 for friday and the 
weekend but there was no indication of a large number of latin 
americans booked for those days jacobs said 
thursday was at least the fourth time an eastern flight from los 
angeles was raided by ins agents three times during stops in 
atlanta and once in los angeles as the aliens were preparing to 
board the earlier two incidents occurred a year ago 
fischer said the romanians on thursdays flight went from 
bucharest to east berlin to havana to mexico city where they 
worked their way to the us border 
agents said it was not clear whether any of them would have a 
claim to refugee status that would allow them to remain in the 
united states 
refugee status generally is not given to those who flee their 
homelands only to improve their economic situation 
most of those detained wednesday and thursday were mexicans who 
will be taken to detention camps in texas and processed for return 
to mexico those from other countries will go to the krome 
detention center near miami for eventual return to their countries

president felix houphouetboignys 
government announced salary and benefit cuts targeting middlelevel 
and senior government officials thursday in a bid to appease 
critics and avoid bankruptcy 
these measures have caused us much pain we cry with you in 
these sad and hard times the president said in a televised 
addressbut if we do not take these measures in four or five 
months we will not be able to pay salaries 
houphouetboigny said farmers already had to accept in october a 
brutal cut in government payments for their crops 
in february demonstrations led by university students 
protesters said the poor bore a heavier burden in the countrys 
financial crisis houphouetboigny has blamed the problems on 
slumping prices of raw materials 
dozens were injured and arrested in the protests which police 
repressed with tear gas and truncheons 
finance minister moise koumoue koffi said workers earning less 
than the equivalent of 350 a month would not be affected by the 
salary cuts 
he announced cuts of 8 percent for government workers earning 
more than 350 14 percent for those earning more than 700 and 17 
percent for those earning more than 1754 
cabinet ministers and presidents of stateowned companies would 
have their salaries and fringe benefits cut by 40 percent and 
legislators by 25 percent he said 
private sector workers would pay a solidarity tax of 5 
percent to 10 percent except those earning less than 350 koffi 
said 
the loss of income would be compensated by cuts in the cost of 
living he said including reductions in statecontrolled prices of 
staple foods fuel electricity and housing 
he said the government would also collect overdue debts 
pitilessly combat fraud and cut costs of import and custom 
duties the duties are some of the highest in the world 
the situation of private companies and banks is cause for 
grave concern koffi said we need to work quickly to reassert 
confidence or the system of payment will be paralyzed and the 
country will be confronted with mass bankruptcy and increased 
unemployment 
corruption and extravagance in the government have exacerbated 
the countrys economic crisis western economists and diplomats 
say protesters demanding the presidents downfall accused him of 
contributing to the financial crisis by siphoning money from state 
coffers 
we were surprised that a problem that was essentially economic 
and social has been politicized casting doubt on those in charge 
suggesting that for 30 years we have done nothing said 
houphouetboigny who has ruled ivory coast as a oneparty state 
since its independence from france in 1960

astrologer joan quigley said thursday that the 
stargazing advice she gave nancy reagan during ronald reagans 
presidency influenced the course of history in big ways and small 
even steering the president away from his evil empire view of 
the soviet union 
in a book giving her version of her eightyear relationship with 
the reagans first disclosed in 1988 by fired reagan adviser 
donald regan ms quigley asserted that she set the times some 
presidential events would occur down to the minute and sometimes 
even to the second 
when reagan announced his selection of anthony kennedy for a 
seat on the supreme court on nov 11 1987 she chose 25 seconds 
after 1132 am est as the moment for the announcement a man 
with a stopwatch gave reagan the signal for proceeding she wrote 
she said she also delayed the timing of reagans first cancer 
operation in 1985 by three days and dictated when mrs reagans 
mastectomy would take place 
ms quigley says reagan knew of her influence on his wife and 
gave her a thankyou kiss when he finally met her 
mrs reagan in her memoirs my turn wrote last year that 
while ms quigley was helpful and comforting a kind of 
therapist she had influence solely on reagans schedule 
no political decision was ever made based on it she said 
however ms quigley said that before reagans first summit with 
mikhail gorbachev she worked three hours to persuade mrs reagan 
that her husband could trust the soviet leader she said she 
battled her to the mat to get reagans view of gorbachev 
changed 
the placement of his ruler mercury in the 10th house of 
power and position convinces me that gorbachev came to power 
because of his high degree of intelligence she said she told the 
first lady it symbolizes to me that despite his russian training 
and origins he has the instincts of a humanitarian 
finally the presidents wife replied i know you are right 
she said 
through nancy i had a direct line to the president ms 
quigley wrote 
i was responsible for timing all press conferences most 
speeches the state of the union addresses the takeoffs and 
landings of air force one i picked the time of ronald reagans 
debate with jimmy carter and the two debates with walter mondale 
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and oneday 
excursions the announcement that reagan would run for a second 
term briefings for all the summits except moscow although i 
selected the time to begin the moscow trip 
i timed congressional armtwisting the second inaugural oath 
of office the announcement of anthony kennedys supreme court 
nomination 
ms quigley said her most tedious work was analyzing reagans 
horoscope on an hour by hour basis 
birch lane press said thursdays publication date for ms 
quigleys book what does joan say was selected by the 
astrologer 
vassareducated and a san francisco socialite ms quigley is 
the author of three books on astrology her form of astrology goes 
beyond sun signs and deals with the moon and all eight planets as 
well according to her publisher 
ms quigley wrote that she did not intend to write a book even 
after regan disclosed her role when he wrote his memoirs as white 
house chief of staff but she reconsidered she said when mrs 
reagans book came out last year 
it reads like fiction and much of it is evasive she wrote 
of mrs reagans account what she has left out would fill a 
book 
at the time regan told of mrs reagans use of an astrologer 
reagan spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president had emphasized 
that he made no policy decisions based on astrology 
ms quigleys account differs 
she wrote that reagan asked his wife to ask her about going to 
reykjavik iceland for his second summit with gorbachev reagan 
and secretary of state george p shultz followed my advice to 
negotiate there as long and as hard as possible and following my 
advice they stayed later than planned 
ronnie asked nancy what does joan say when he wanted to 
know when the irangate ordeal would be over she wrote and he 
phoned to thank me personally for a letter written at the end of 
irangate in which i described myself as his astrologer addresing 
him as dear ronnie and signing it joan 
ms quigley was discreet about how much she had been paid for 
her efforts just as mrs reagan was the astrologer said she 
orginally was paid by the hour for time spent on the phone with 
mrs reagan and time spent in preparation 
she said when she raised her fee for other clients she kept mrs 
reagans at the old level finally she charged mrs reagan a fixed 
monthly fee because she needed much more of my time than she 
could afford this was very generous on my part

a fight over federal water and sewer money 
ended thursday in the house with a vote that gutted a massive rural 
development bill and forced sponsors to stop floor action until 
they find a new strategy 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza said many of 
the members didnt understand the killer amendment they approved 
because of inaccuracies he said were stated during debate 
we can regroup said de la garza dtexas he said the 
legislations supporters would take some time to speak to their 
colleagues before continuing with floor action on the bill 
after an hour of arguing the members voted 204193 on an 
amendment by rep charles rose dnc that killed a provision 
allowing about 500 million to 600 million in existing federal 
funds for water and sewer projects to be used for other local needs 
the amendment also froze about 100 million appropriated for 
business and industry development and another 100 million for 
community facilities 
the funds amount to the only significant money in the 
legislation which creates very little new spending 
the idea was to pool the funds so that individual communities 
could decide for themselves where to apply federal money 
if the amendment stays it preserves the status quo said de 
la garza 
under the present system there has been a tremendous 
inequity said rep glenn english dokla who authored the bill 
with rep tom coleman rmo 
he said that if a state doesnt use all of its share of water 
and sewer money for example the funds go back to the federal 
government and become available to any other states that apply for 
it 
he said the aggressiveness of the local farmers home 
administration directors has had a lot to do with how much of the 
money a state gets 
there are some fmha directors who philosophically dont like 
these programs so they spend very little of it the available 
money english said after the vote 
rose said the bill would give too much power to the agriculture 
secretary to decide where funds should be used 
under the legislation state review panels would set priorities 
on projects but the agriculture department would have the final 
say on use of the money 
rose said if his amendment were not adopted the secretary would 
have unprecedent uncontrollable authority to transfer money 
without input from congress 
but rep jerry huckaby dla said the bottom line is that if 
we adopt the rose amendment we really dont have much of a bill 
here it makes sense to let the state determine how to use these 
limited resources 
de la garza said time has been set aside next week for further 
action on the bill but did not say whether sponsors would try again 
that soon or take more time to try to persuade members to change 
their opinions 
the bill is designed to help decaying rural communities 
diversify away from farming as their main source of income it is 
significantly different from a bill on rural development already 
passed by the senate

political parties began their final campaign 
push thursday and communist premier hans modrows caretaker 
government urged east germans to avoid rushing into reunification 
with west germany 
the campaign for sundays parliamentary elections has been 
shaken by the resignation of a top conservative candidate who 
admitted he had worked for the now virtually disbanded secret 
police 
as rumors swirled that other candidates may also have worked for 
the once allpowerful force the leftist social democrats denied 
they had informants in their top ranks 
candidates for the 24 slates put forward by various parties were 
crisscrossing the country and holding rallies ahead of the nations 
first free elections 
meanwhile an opinion poll released by the government in bonn 
showed that 90 precent of west germans surveyed favor unification 
the figure was 95 percent for east germans 
the poll was taken early this month by the respected infratest 
organization for the west german ministry for innergerman 
relations 
according to the poll 51 percent of the 1030 east germans 
questioned said they wanted unification soon of the 1010 west 
germans asked the same question the figure was 40 percent 
according to the poll 
no margin of error for the poll was given 
an estimated 123 million east germans are eligible to take part 
in the balloting for the new 400member parliament 
wolfgang schnur leader of the democratic awakening party had 
been one of the top candidates for sundays voting but he quit 
wednesday after admitting he had worked for the secret police 
a citizens group investigating schnurs case has secured file 
folders containing information he gave to officials the state news 
agency adn said thursday 
schnur was expelled from the conservative party he headed and 
helped found party leaders named rainer eppelmann an east berlin 
pastor and cabinet minister in modrows caretaker government as 
acting successor 
eppelmann 47 faces the challenge of keeping together the 
conservative alliance for germany a coalition of three parties 
that schnur helped build for sundays elections the alliance has 
received enormous support from west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the social democrats another leading contender in the 
elections denied rumors that onetime informers were in its top 
ranks as well 
party leaders at a news conference in east berlin displayed 
documents they claimed proved there were no ties to the hated 
secret police 
in east berlin the caretaker cabinet held its last meeting 
before the elections 
overall the government has been able to lead the german 
democratic republic onto the way out of its crisis government 
spokesman wolfgang meyer told a news conference later to some 
extent people have become aware of avoiding a headoverheels rush 
to unification 
modrows government which took office in november after the 
ouster of hardline communist erich honecker also includes eight 
ministers from various prodemocracy organizations 
together they have been asking east germans to slow the pace of 
reunification arguing that there are still positive elements of 
the socialist system 
meyer said there was a light upward trend in the nations 
economy which weeks ago had reportedly been on the brink of 
collapse 
east germany has been shaken by the exodus of nearly 500000 
people many of them young skilled workers since last year 
west german officials are making plans to try to halt the influx 
by shutting down reception centers for the east germans after the 
elections 
the bonn government says a democratic government in east berlin 
and eventual unification should make such emigration unnecessary 
but it also has acknowledged reunification could take several years 
to complete

the attorney who helped bring down former house 
speaker jim wright is involved in a heated battle of his own the 
race for president of the cook county board 
heading into tuesdays primary newspaper polls put democrat 
richard j phelan at even or slightly ahead of one of his three 
opponents but well ahead of the democrats slated candidate 
the son of a chicago precinct captain phelan has been a 
behindthescenes player in local democratic politics for years 
serving as a fundraiser in us sen paul simons 1984 campaign 
twice in the last year however phelan has taken a public role 
as in the wright case he has made ethics the battleground as he 
seeks the county board presidency a post the party has long used 
to control thousands of patronage jobs 
wright who resigned from congress last year in the face of 
phelans investigation wasnt part of my party because of the 
texas democrats actions in skirting a congressional limit on 
speaking fees phelan said 
portrayed as an impartial outsider when retained by the house 
ethics committee phelan is using the same tack against the cook 
county democratic organization 
when i say im an outsider i mean im outside the machine 
politics phelan said in a telephone interview 
people supporting his campaign want to see an end to politics 
as usual in the presidents office run by the party he said 
when cook county board president george w dunne announced he 
would retire after 21 years it set off a fourway race whose pitch 
has sharpened as each candidate has tried to stake the other to the 
ethical low ground 
the other candidates are 
r eugene pincham 64 a former illinois appellate court 
justice trying to become the first black to hold the county 
president post recent polls by chicagos two largest daily papers 
show pincham and phelan as leaders of the pack 
cook county clerk stanley t kusper 55 a veteran of chicago 
politics who was handpicked for his current post by the late mayor 
richard j daley in 1973 
state sen ted lechowicz 51 like kusper a bastion of machine 
politics and the partys slated candidate trailing his rivals in 
polls by the chicago tribune and the chicago suntimes lechowicz 
is counting on loyal precinct captains to get out the vote 
dunne has not been a factor in the race and chicago mayor 
richard m daley has refused to publicly back a candidate 
a wideopen race for the post is another obituary for the 
machine the elder daley controlled said political analyst paul 
green director of the institute of public affairs at governors 
state university in south surburban university park 
the democratic party no longer has a consolidated hold on power 
so the race is a battle because theres no organization to 
prevent the fight from taking place green said ambition is no 
longer limited by party approval 
phelan 52 worried party leaders last summer when he considered 
entering the primary for governor he backed off but jumped into 
the board presidents race after dunnes announcement 
a partner in one of the citys fastestgrowing law firms he has 
given or lent more to his campaign close to 900000 than any 
of the other candidates have raised according to campaign finance 
records 
a 1 million television campaign has put his face before tv 
viewers an average of three times a week

on the edge of a process that must be stopped prompted the 
congress to pass the measure after editing out sections that cast 
more blame on the lithuanians

emphasized he would not consider the talks actual diplomatic 
negotiations between separate countries 
lithuanian deputies had largely backed gorbachevs candidacy 
because they expected him to be a reasonable partner in such talks 
but they did not participate in the vote 
the congress passed the lithuania resolution with a 146394 
vote after almost three hours of often polemical speeches 
condemnation of the rebellious republic far outweighed support 
nearly 700 deputies did not vote although many of those had left 
the lateevening session 
adm vitaly ivanov commander of the soviet baltic fleet 
accused lithuanian leaders of betrayal of their own people and 
the people of the soviet union and called the declaration of 
independence a stab in the back of the country 
yevgeny kogan a proponent for nonestonians rights in the 
baltic republic of estonia called for gorbachev to immediately 
impose direct presidential rule in the three baltic republics 
which include latvia to stop what he called a campaign of 
psychological terror against russians and other minorities 
his proposal was met with some applause from the hall but 
gorbachev ignored the suggestion 
most of the lithuanian deputies who could have defended the 
republics move were absent either busy with a legislature session 
at home or unwilling to serve in the parliament of what they now 
consider a foreign country 
the one lithuanian who took the floor nikolai medvedev was met 
with scattered cries of enemy of the people when he spoke the 
epithet was widespread during the witchhunting days of dictator 
josef stalin 
medvedev accused bolshevism of causing hundreds of thousands of 
deaths in lithuania in stalins repressions and mass deportations 
he warned that the original more harshly worded draft of the 
resolution would only make the situation in the republic worse 
rafik nishanov chairman of one of the chambers of the soviet 
legislature said hundreds of telegrams had been pouring into the 
congress with complaints about the hasty decision by the lithuanian 
parliament 
army lt col nikolai petrushenko complained that wholesale 
draftdodging had begun in lithuania and warned that soviet troops 
might be sent to round up the recalcitrant conscripts in their 
farms and villages 
according to reports from lithuania thousands of youths have 
handed in their draft cards and will refuse this springs callup 
the lithuanian parliament this week passed a measure removing 
penalties for draftdodgers 
for all their objections to lithuanias declaration none of the 
speakers proposed using force to solve the dilemma

john poindexter told the fbi three days after 
resigning his white house post that he had no working knowledge 
of early iran arms shipments and no direct knowledge profits 
had been diverted to the nicaraguan contras an fbi agent testified 
at his trial thursday 
agent ellen glasser also testified that more than 5000 files 
were erased from poindexters computer system just before the 
national security adviser resigned as the irancontra affair was 
coming to light 
six months after the nov 28 1986 fbi interview at his home 
poindexter told congress in testimony that cannot be used at his 
trial that he approved the diversion to the contras at norths 
request and had been involved in a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran 
glasser in her testimony spoke of a massive destruction of 
computer messages and provided details of the heretofore 
undisclosed poindexter interview that she and another fbi agent 
conducted 
she said that during that interview poindexter was asked whether 
he knew of any destruction of documents pertinent to the 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
he replied that he did not the agent recalled 
concerning the diversion to the contras glasser testified that 
poindexter said he knew ollie north was up to something 
she said she showed poindexter copies of chronologies on the 
iran initiative the final version compiled by robert mcfarlane 
poindexters predecessor as thenpresident reagans national 
security adviser and aide oliver north concealed the us role in 
the missile shipment 
asked whether the documents were accurate poindexter replied 
that they were glasser said north was convicted last year of 
aiding and abetting an obstruction of congress in connection with 
the chronologies 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress the us role 
in the missile shipment as well as the northdirected military 
assistance to the contras at a time official us aid was banned 
part of the indictment accuses him of purging his computer files 
between nov 22 and nov 29 1986 in an attempt to conceal 
information from congress 
on nov 22 there were over 5000 computer messages in 
poindexters terminal but at 9 am on nov 24 there were 
zero glasser testified 
this massive deletion occurred in november 1986 she 
said under crossexamination by poindexter lawyer richard beckler 
who suggested the files could have been deleted at some other time 
poindexter was logged onto the computer system for a 15hour 
span nov 24 starting at 430 am testified kelly williams who 
was in charge of the computer software section at the white house 
communications agency that was the day before poindexter resigned 
williams said poindexters identification code was the one used 
to gain access to the computer when the files were deleted 
prosecutor louise radin asked if deleting the files would be 
comparable to taking a manila envelope and just throwing it 
away 
yes that would be the effect williams replied 
a total of 732 notes were deleted from norths own computer 
files about the same time poindexters system was cleared out 
williams said only one of norths computer files remained 
copies of poindexters and norths files were recovered from 
backup tapes at the nscs computer system and have been 
instrumental in tracing the irancontra affair 
earlier in the day prosecutor dan webb said he could complete 
his case against poindexter as early as monday because norths four 
days of testimony cut off two or three weeks from the 
prosecutions work 
webb said norths testimony which ended wednesday went well 
and that the government got a lot out of the former white house 
aide 
north testified that poindexter told him he could take care 
of an upcoming meeting with members of congress north lied at 
the meeting by denying he was assisting the nicaraguan rebels 
north also testified that he saw poindexter tear up a 
politically embarrassing presidential document the document 
called a finding retroactively authorized the shipment of missiles 
to iran

natural chemical processes in the body not 
contamination may be behind hundreds of cases of a rare painful 
blood disorder in people who took the healthfood supplement 
ltryptophan researchers say 
the substance sold as a natural relaxation aid has been 
recalled voluntarily by several makers at the urging of the us 
food and drug administration which suspected contamination 
fourteen people who took ltryptophan have died in recent months 
and more than 1200 others have fallen ill with 
eosinophiliamyalgia a rare blood disroder which in milder cases 
causes aches rashes and fever 
the new study was conducted at georgetown university in 
washington dc and reported in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
arguing against the contamination theory is that in spite of 
the fact that people have been searching for the contaminant it 
hasnt been identified said one of the researchers dr paul 
katz chief rheumatologist at georgetown 
also the ltryptophan implicated has been traced to three 
different manufacturers katz said in a telephone interview 
thursday that argues a little bit against there being a 
commonsource contaminant 
chris lecos an fda spokesman said the research didnt change 
the agencys advice against taking ltryptophan 
it doesnt serve the public to come forth with speculation 
what were looking for is a clearcut explanation lacos said 
but he acknowledged in a telephone interview from washington on 
thursday weve analyzed hundreds of samples of ltryptophan 
including from victims themselves and have failed to identify a 
specific chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for the 
outbreak 
lecos added this is not a disease that should be taken 
lightly by anyone people should stop taking this stuff 
katz and his colleagues at georgetown believe ltryptophan 
supplements under certain conditions may contribute to a buildup 
of a naturally occurring substance in the body called serotonin 
serotonin is a byproduct of the breakdown of ltryptophan which 
is an amino acid or protein component that occurs naturally in 
many foods but is usually present in greater concentrations in the 
dietary supplement 
some researchers believe abnormal levels of serotonin may 
contribute to syndromes similar to eosinophiliamyalgia katz said 
ltryptophan supplements have been sold over the counter for 
years to combat sleeplessness depression premenstrual syndrome 
stress and other problems 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome which is caused by an excess of 
a certain type of white blood cell have been noted in people 
taking ltryptophan supplements only in the last year or so 
the disorder may have occurred earlier and been diagnosed as 
different but similar syndromes katz said 
the researchers found seven patients at georgetown who developed 
the rare blood disorder while taking ltryptophan 
all patients had the muscle pain and tenderness characteristic 
of the syndrome and rashes fever and breathing difficulty were 
common the researchers said 
three of the patients had taken antidepressant medication which 
inhibits the absorption of serotonin by nerve cells in the brain 
their use in conjunction with ltryptophan probably resulted in an 
excess that the body was unable to chemically process the authors 
suggest 
in the other four cases the patients bodies for some reason 
may have been unable to metabolize ltryptophan katz said 
by midfebruary the national centers for disease control had 
recorded 14 deaths and 1269 cases of illness nationwide from 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of 
ltryptophan supplements 
the food and drug administration on nov 17 requested a 
voluntary recall of ltryptophan supplements and five days later 
extended that to include a ban on imports 
dr richard m silver associate professor of medicine and 
pediatrics at the medical university of south carolina who has 
studied ltryptophan said the georgetown researchers may be on 
target

president bush called mikhail s gorbachev a 
reasonable man thursday and said he was not worried that the 
soviet president would turn into a dictator as a result of new 
powers granted by his parliament 
theyve come out of the totalitarianism of the past bush 
said crediting gorbachev with being a major force promoting 
peaceful changes in eastern europe 
and ive consulted with him had communications from him for 
example on the question of germany bush said and i think 
hes a reasonable man 
the soviet parliament on tuesday endorsed gorbachevs proposal 
for a strong presidency and ended the communist partys long 
monopoly on political power before the final vote gorbachev 
granted several concessions that seemed to ease critics fears that 
the new president might usher in a new era of soviet dictatorship 
bush made his comments in a question and answer session with 
outoftown news executives of the national newspaper association 
the president used the occasion to express irritation with us 
volunteers in nicaragua who he said were intent on keeping the 
leftist sandinista government in power 
without identifying anyone by name bush said i am frustrated 
a little bit by some of the americans that have gone down to 
nicaragua been there for two years allegedly to help the people of 
nicaragua and then nicaragua has a free and fair election and it 
turns out these people were interested in helping the sandinistas 
the sandinismos 
and now theyre picketing in front of the us embassy 
because in their view the wrong people won the election 
in a major upset the usbacked opposition candidate violeta 
chamorro defeated president daniel ortega in presidential 
elections feb 25 
dennis marker director of a churchbased group known as witness 
for peace said bush apparently was talking about his organization 
which is dedicated to changing us policy in central america 
we have had us citizens demonstrating in front of the 
embassy since 1983 marker said the reason people are 
demonstrating is not because of who won the election we are 
demonstrating against continued us interference in nicaragua 
with the election of mrs chamorro marker said the 
presidents trying to say nicaragua should be closed to views that 
are different from his own 
on other subjects at his second news conference in three days 
bush said he 
wishes the deficit were lower so that more funds would be 
available to help the emerging democracies of eastern europe and 
latin america 
opposes suggestions that us aid be cut to israel and egypt to 
make money available for those democracies i dont want to 
suggest cutting to good friends bush said adding that he would 
like greater flexibility to disburse foreign aid 
rejects the notion that america is in decline saying we 
still have the highest standard of living in the world so i am 
not that pessimistic and yet i dont want to stand here with some 
pollyannnish attitude about the economy there are some signs that 
worry me 
is frankly confused by last weeks speculation that an 
american hostage in lebanon might be released because there are no 
negotiations going on involving the us government i wish i 
could tell you that there was a serious immediate effort that 
would pay off but that isnt the case 
is very pleased with the way the lithuanian situation is 
developing in the wake of its declaration of independence from 
the soviet union we will encourage the fundamental principles of 
selfdetermination and we will encourage the concept of peaceful 
change

the white house said thursday that a libyan 
plant suspected of making chemical weapons had been knocked out of 
commission by a serious fire we dont have any idea who did 
it president bushs spokesman said 
from bush on down the administration denied any involvement in 
wednesdays blaze which occurred one week after the white house 
said the plant posed a serious danger and called for vigorous 
efforts to stop its operation 
we dont know the origins of the fire said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater we dont know if it was 
sabotage we dont have any idea who did it somebody could 
have knocked over a kerosene lamp or something 
the plant located at rabta about 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli was heavily guarded by surfacetoair missile batteries 
tanks and soldiers 
it has been a point of aggravation in the deep diplomatic split 
between washington and tripoli cia director william webster once 
described it as the worlds largest chemical weapons factory 
there was some uncertainty during the day about the extent of 
damage to the plant but in the early evening a senior us 
official said the united states had used its intelligence 
resources to be able to conclude that the plant was inoperable 
us intelligence resources are known to include satellites 
capable of highresolution photography 
asked if the united states was pleased the plant had burned 
fitzwater said we arent going to express an opinion one way or 
another for one thing we dont know what the results are we 
dont know whats happened there 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said cia director 
william webster in testimony to congress a year ago had reported 
that one serious toxic chemical spill had already taken place at 
rabta and that such problems were likely to continue 
ms tutwiler added we have had various other reports of 
accidents at the plant before the current fire 
she said the plant appears to be out of operation now however 
we remain concerned about libyas chemical weapons plans and 
capabilities 
she quoted the libyan news agency jana as reporting that at 
least two people had been killed we cannot confirm the extent of 
casualties she said 
libyas leader col moammar gadhafi asserted anew thursday 
that the plant merely produced pharmaceuticals 
however gadhafi said libya would be willing to pay millions of 
dollars to any company that would build it a chemical weapons 
facility 
bush was asked at a prest patricks day party thrown by house 
speaker thomas s foley what information he had on the fire 
not much bush said 
asked by a reporter if the united states had been involved bush 
said no but weve already said that 
without revealing the source of his information fitzwater said 
damage at the sprawling plant was extensive but that it was still 
standing 
common sense would tell you its not functioning he said 
we assume its not functioning 
on the other hand he said we dont have the kind of 
definitive information that would define the damage the 
building is there but is it all burned out inside we dont really 
know 
fitzwaters comments were made before the use of intelligence 
resources referred to by the senior official became known 
ms tutwiler reiterated the longstanding us accusation that 
libya promotes terrorism and is harboring abu nidal a suspect in 
several terrorist incidents 
rep stephen j solarz dny told reporters at the white 
house its the first fire ive heard about in a long time that 
im pleased with i only hope it all burned down he commented 
after meeting with bush about south africa

babies should not be given soybased beverages 
other than infant formulas as their only source of nutrition the 
food and drug administration warned on thursday 
the fda said the soybased drinks sometimes called soy 
milk do not have the nutrients needed for infants 
a 5monthold baby girl whose parents bought the product in a 
health food store was in critical condition at arkansas childrens 
hospital in little rock because of malnourishment the agency said 
in a statement 
it did not identify the girl or her parents 
the parents according to the statement erroneously believed 
that a soy beverage sold in a health food store could be used as 
infant formula and had fed it to their daughter almost since birth 
soy beverages analyzed by the little rock hospital were found to 
be lacking in calcium niacin and vitamins d e and c the agency 
said 
the fda said children and adults can drink the soy beverages as 
long as they are part of an otherwise balanced diet 
there are soybased infant formulas that are complete and 
appropriate and these formulas are not involved in thursdays

mikhail s gorbachev granted a new more powerful 
presidency on thursday said his immediate tasks were to prevent 
the soviet union from breaking up and to promote freemarket 
reforms 
in assuming powers as the soviet unions first westernstyle 
president gorbachev warned in a speech at the congress of peoples 
deputies that the reforms required to right his countrys woeful 
economy would be painful 
mindful of his nations history of dictatorship and terror 
gorbachev promised legislators he would nurture the soviet unions 
young and not fully developed democracy 
gorbachev who ran into surprisingly strong opposition in the 
soviet congress before assuming the new presidency will now have 
wide powers to propose legislation negotiate treaties veto bills 
appoint the council of ministers and void its decisions 
significantly he also has the power to declare war if the 
country is attacked and under certain conditions impose direct 
presidential rule this means he could overrule a local government 
he has shifted his formidable powers further from the communist 
party leadership to the government on wednesday the congress 
struck the partys constitutional monopoly on power to permit 
development of a multiparty system 
gorbachev mentioned specifically the need to overcome the 
irresponsibility that was a byproduct of collective leadership 
saying an increase of responsibility is the main thing on which 
we rely 
he said in his speech at congress our country is living 
through difficult times but if we act together we will overcome 
the difficulties we must shake off fears and dejection gain a 
confidence in our strength and possibilities which are truly 
great the russian people and all peoples united with it in a great 
multinational state will succeed in reviving their common homeland 
and will surely achieve that on the roads of perestroika and 
socialist renewal 
he added i see my role and task as the president of the 
ussr in affirming national harmony in the country and a spirit 
of mutual respect consolidating the principles of civil peace and 
harmony protecting the interests of the people 
voting results announced thursday at the congress indicated a 
significant drop in support for the soviet leader since he was 
chosen chairman of the soviet legislature in may that position was 
essentially a weak presidency 
congress elected gorbachev to a fiveyear term by a vote of 
1329495 he was the only candidate his total was 800 votes less 
than what he received one year ago and not much more than the 
1123 needed to win 
in a separate ballot the congress chose gorbachevs former vice 
president anatoly i lukyanov as chairman the congress chairman 
holds many of the responsibilities of vice president including the 
right of succession if the president cannot continue in office 
yegor k ligachev characterized by reformers as a conservative 
power on the communist party politburo praised gorbachevs 
election as a truly positive development especially at a time of 
party and social renewal when both the party and society are 
undergoing transformation 
one reformminded deputy igor shamshev said gorbachev had lost 
the support of extreme conservatives and radical reformers but 
held the moderates 
on wednesday several deputies called for gorbachevs defeat 
teimuraz avaliani of the western siberian mining town of 
kemerovo accused him of leading the country to the brink of 
collapse and said i ask you not to vote for gorbachev under any 
circumstances 
yevgeny kogan a representatives of russians living in the 
baltic republic of estonia accused gorbachev of being soft on 
separatists estonia is pressing for independence 
what would you do if a state decided it was leaving and the 
president didnt take any measures to stop it he asked reporters 
despite the opposition gorbachev received a standing ovation in 
the congress after results were announced he stood with his hands 
folded before him at the dais inside the kremlin palace of 
congresses he then moved to a wooden table and with his hand on a 
redbound copy of the soviet constitution took the first 
presidential oath of ffice 
on wednesday gorbachev won a key procedural vote in which the 
congress agreed to elect the president in emergency session rather 
than turning it over to a nationwide campaign in the future the 
soviet public should be able to elect the president 
president bush called gorbachev a reasonable man and said he 
was not troubled that gorbachev has had his powers strengthened 
theyve come out of the totalitarianism of the past i dont see 
it as a threat bush said in washington 
gorbachev closed the day by giving a news conference his first 
in the kremlin spokesmen said he would meet with the press more 
frequently as president 
some deputies from lithuania estonia and other republics 
boycotted the congress proceedings because they consider their 
republics independent rather than part of the soviet union 
gorbachev said he would work to keep the soviet union from 
breaking apart and would be the president for all of the more than 
100 nationalities living in the country 
the president must feel and act not as a representative of a 
certain layer of society or political leaning but as a person 
trusted by the entire nation he said 
as president now i reaffirm my adherence to the territorial 
integrity of this country he added gorbachev said he intended 
to work to conclude a new agreement binding the soviet republics 
together in federation 
soviet law should allow for republics to seceed if they wish 
gorbachev said but he did not specify under what conditions 
he promised more radical economic reform and said some of the 
steps would hurt 
the necessity for a more radical perestroika policy is 
obvious and it is for these purposes above all that i am going to 
use my powers as president he said 
new reforms may in the initial stages be accompanied by 
painful phenomena and affect some peoples interests he said 
promising to to cut the soviet budget drastically and attack 
inflation he otherwise offered few details except to say we 
urgently need to pass laws aimed at demonopolizing the economy 
gorbachev said he would work to create a viable market 
economy governed not by bureaucrats but by taxation bank control 
of balance of payments and adjustable interest rates 
only months ago gorbachev believed that the soviet union did 
not need a presidential form of government his close politburo 
adviser alexander n yakovlev told a soviet newspaper this week 
in december he fought a drive in the congress to strip the 
party of its constitutional right to rule two months later 
however gorbachev persuaded the party to drop its monopoly on 
power 
he told reporters he changed his positions because his reform 
program is changing the soviet union so quickly 
what was right a year or several months ago in these 
conditions is insufficient he said

official newspapers thursday said 
the president and prime minister had offered to resign and the 
communist party of this kremlin satellite agreed to give up its 
nearly 70yearold monopoly on power 
this is the beginning of real change foreign minstry 
spokesman tepbishiin chimeddorj said of his country which 
strategically borders both the soviet union and china 
the changes including a call for a contested elections this 
year came at a threeday meeting of the partys decisionmaking 
central committee 
the actions met nearly all the demands of opposition parties 
that have led thousands of people through the capitals streets in 
demonstrations against the government 
president jambyn batmonh 64 and prime minister dumaagiyn 
sodnom 56 had already stepped down this week as members of the 
partys politburo and batmonh quit as party leader 
official newspapers said they have offered to quit their 
government posts when the national legislature holds its annual 
session next week 
in another dramatic repudiation of its past the central 
committee voted to expel former party leader yumjaagiyn tsedenbal 
from the party tsedenbal 73 presided over purges in the party 
during his 31 years in power that ended in 1984 he now lives in 
moscow 
the central committee thursday appointed former trade union 
leader gombogavin ochirbat as the partys new general secretary and 
named the partys youngest most reformminded politburo in 
decades the fivemember politburo includes foreign minister ts 
gombosuren and l tudev the director of the leading official 
newspaper unen 
mongolian sources said the five met privately today to set the 
partys course in the face of the challenge from increasingly vocal 
urban intellectuals demanding democracy the intellecturals already 
have formed three oppositon parties to contest elections 
unen reported today that the 174member central committee took 
note of batmonhs and sodnoms offer to resign from their 
government jobs 
i support some proposals for my resignation as prime minister 
and am willing to discuss another candidate from our party to 
replace me this question should be resolved at the great peoples 
hural the legislature unen quoted sodnom as saying in a speech 
wednesday 
he made no apologies for his performance during six years as 
prime minister 
batmonh has been president since 1984 when he also became party 
general secretary 
sodnom told the central committee that mongolias debt to the 
soviet union has more than quadrupled since 1975 the heavy 
indebtedness to the soviet union which backed mongolias 1921 
communist revolution and stations soldiers here is a major cause 
of dissatisfaction with the ruling party 
antisoviet nationalism has been a major theme of prodemocracy 
protests that began in january and precipitated the ruling party 
shakeup the soviet union pledged this month to withdraw all of 
its estimated 60000 soldiers by 1992 
unen said 13 elderly central committee members all of whom have 
retired in the past few years from state or party posts also 
resigned their central committee membership 
mongolian sources described the 13 as conservatives who worked 
closely with tsedenbal 
the central committee expelled him from the party but did not 
strip him of his state honors 
it rehabilitated four party officials who were purged in the 
early 1960s for criticizing tsedenbal the four were sent to the 
countryside as punishment for nearly two decades and allowed to 
return only when tsedenbal was ousted

thousands of people gathered thursday 
to commemorate the 1848 democratic revolution against austrian 
rule and some politicians used the occasion to campaign for 
hungarys first free elections in 40 years 
the anniversary has in recent years become a symbol of 
resistance against communist rule 
but the communists will not have a monopoly on power following 
the parliamentary elections march 25 and the 15000 who turned out 
for the anniversary in budapest was a much smaller number than in 
past years communist supporters were down to a trickle 
the hungarian socialist party the majority faction of the 
former communist party that disbanded in october 1989 is expected 
to do poorly in the elections 
last year more than 100000 demonstrators surged through the 
streets of the capital on the anniversary of the revolution against 
austrian rule the first truly legal opposition rally on that date 
participants called for democracy and the withdrawal of the 
soviet occupation troops 
these demands have since been fulfilled to a considerable 
extent with the coming elections and a red army withdrawal that 
began march 12 
only about 2500 people converged on the national museum to 
listen to a speech by imre pozsgay the top reformer in the 
socialist party after the lowkey rally he repeated his partys 
pledge that it is prepared to honor all consequences of the 
elections 
he predicted his party will be among the top four parties and 
it will be a decisive force in parliament 
a gallup poll published monday gave the hungarian democratic 
forum one of the most influential opposition groups 21 percent of 
the popular vote the free democrats had 203 percent the 
smallholders party 157 percent and the socialist party 8 percent 
newspapers publishing the poll did not give details on how many 
people were questioned or what they were asked the reports also 
did not provide a margin of error 
pozsgay has suffered a serious setback in popularity polls 
because a close associate former interior minister istvan horvath 
was implicated in a scandal involving illegal police surveillance 
and because of controversial decisions made by a media panel he 
instituted 
about 15000 supporters of the free democrats and other 
opposition parties rallied around the monument to poet sandor 
petoefi a leader of the 1848 revolution which was suppressed more 
than a year later with russian help 
imre olah of the entrepreneurs party reciting petoefi said 
we swear to god that we will never again be prisoners 
we swear there will never again be a dictatorship by any 
party olah added 
the most popular speaker appeared to be viktor orban the 
dynamic leader of the league of young democrats who said 
hungary has still not gained the stage of full independence 
we wont have democracy as long as ministers of state party 
leaders and other top officials violate the constitution without 
punishment orban said he apparently was referring to the 
scandal involving horvath 
orban also ridiculed foreign minister gyula horn like most 
other government leaders a member of the socialist party for a 
recent suggestion that hungary might become a member of nato the 
idea later was politely dismissed by defense and other officials 
two years ago he did not even suggest a pullout of the soviet 
troops from hungary and now he is acting as an atlantic hawk 
orban said drawing laughter from the crowd

the soviet union on thursday condemned the 
settlement of soviet jewish immigrants in the israelioccupied 
territories but said it will not restrict the flow of jews to 
israel 
israel rejected the criticism by the soviet union and arab 
states and said their real objective is to halt all jewish 
immigration because it fortifies the jewish state 
the heated debate came in the 15member security council as it 
took up a soviet complaint against israels settlement of a small 
number of soviet jews in the occupied lands and its reported plans 
to locate tens of thousands more immigrants in the territories 
claimed by palestinians as a future homeland 
the united states did not ask to speak and the meeting was 
adjourned until various draft resolutions criticizing israel could 
be reconciled 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov said most emigrating 
soviet jews want to settle in the united states not israel 
he said if the us eased its entry reguirements for soviet 
immigrants it would help reduce the concerns of palestinians and 
defuse tensions in the region 
one sometimes hears appeals to the soviet union to stop jews 
leaving for israel belonogov said speaking in russian through a 
translator but we cannot possibly undertake such a step because 
it would be contrary to our overall course and policy of assuring 
all soviet citizens equal rights and freedoms regardless of 
nationality or ethnic origins 
the question is not for the soviet union to impose any 
probitions he told the 15member council the question is that 
of israel not allowing its citizens to settle in the occupied 
territories 
other nations and groups that spoke against israel included the 
palestine liberation organization jordan the arab league 
senegal malaysia and cuba 
they argued that jewish settlement of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip violates the principle of trading land for peace which 
they called vital to a middle east settlement 
farouk khadoumi head of the political department of the plo 
said soviet jewish immigration to israel was organized by world 
zionism while millions of palestinians remained homeless and 
stateless 
khadoumi called on the security council to impose sanctions 
against israel like those against south africa 
the united states has also opposed the idea of settling soviet 
jews in the west bank and gaza strip saying it is an obstacle to 
making peace with palestinians 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has suggested the occupied 
territories are needed to accommodate soviet jewish immigrants 
israel expects a wave of soviet immigrants this year up to 500 
have been arriving daily since the beginning of the year 
but israeli ambassador johanan bein the acting permanent un 
representative said israel does not have a policy of directing 
jewish immigrants to the territories 
arab states have conjured up a major diplomatic storm in a 
worldwide effort to block the flow of jewish immigrants the real 
objective behind this campaign is to halt all jewish immigration to 
israel period bein told the security council 
he said those who oppose jewish immigration to israel refuse to 
accept the reality of a secure and developing sovereign jewish 
state and persist in the dream of overrunning it 
in a related development thursday a shiite moslem group holding 
hostages in lebanon threatened attacks against airlines that carry 
soviet jewish immigrants to israel the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine group made the threat in a statement 
released to a beirut newspaper

the president of west germany 
assured officials here thursday the 51st anniversary of the nazi 
invasion of czechoslovakia that his country has no territorial 
claims on its neighbors 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel welcomed the visit of his 
collegue richard von weizsaecker as a sign of great hope and a 
counterpoint to the 1939 invasion 
havel made his own contribution to reconciliation by traveling 
to east germany and west germany for his first state visits 
following his election dec 29 as president 
weizsaecker is the first leader to pay a state visit to 
czechoslovakia since havel became president after the peaceful 
revolution that ousted the hardline communist leaders who had 
ruled practically since the end of world war ii 
recalling germany as a messenger of war whose troops invaded 
czechoslovakia march 15 1939 havel said weizsaecker was by 
contrast a messenger of peace of glad tidings that violence 
must nevermore prevail over freedom lies over truth and evil over 
human life 
together we can strive for a democratic europe a europe of 
unity in diversity havel said 
the invasion occurred after the munich agreement of britain and 
france which hoped to appease adolf hitler by giving him the 
germanspeaking part of czechoslovakia 
hitler decided to invade on march 10 1939 and german troops 
were ordered to take up positions by the evening of march 12 
when the nazi troops had taken over an ecstatic hitler ordered 
his two secretaries you kids give me a kiss here and here 
pointing to his cheeks one of the women later recalled 
weizsaeckers visit came two days before a prague meeting of 
foreign ministers from the seven warsaw pact nations called to 
discuss the reunification of the germany and its possible effects 
on neighboring countries 
from the ages we were closely united we want to be again in 
the future weizsaecker said 
he talked of the dramatic democratic changes that have forced 
communists from power in most east bloc countries and led to the 
fall of the iron curtain that divided europe in the cold war 
walls have fallen fences been laid down barbed wire cut the 
borders are open we respect them without any restrictions and have 
no territorial claims whatsoever towards any neighbor 
his remarks were intended to placate fears of germanys 
neighbors particularly poland that a strong united germany could 
reclaim prewar territory 
the whole of europe must be grateful to germans because they 
began to tear down the wall which divided them because by doing so 
they started the tearing down of a wall which divides europe 
havel said 
he was referring to the berlin wall which began to fall in 
november with the east german revolution 
but havel also advised the germanys to dispel european fears of 
a united germany 
if for example they manage to unequivocally confirm the 
final validity of existing borders including those with poland or 
if they manage to finally deal with those who still have the nerve 
to flirt with nazi ideology they will do a lot to free europe from 
fear havel said it is apparent that the fate of us all 
depends today again predominantly on the development of germany 
i understand todays visit by president weizsaecker as a true 
counterpart of the old and painful visit that we remember today 
while that visit was an omen of terror and deepening despair 
todays visit is on the contrary a sign of great hope for us all

labor leader shimon peres toppled the coalition 
government of hardline prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday 
and declared that with his action he had created momentum toward 
peace 
peres drove a noconfidence vote through parliament after shamir 
had balked for weeks at us proposals to get talks started with 
the palestinians 
shamir the first premier in israels 42year history to be 
turned out of office by a noconfidence vote listened to the vote 
tally with his head down glumly shuffling papers on his desk 
we are not surprised and i am not sorry he told 
reporters later 
said peres who is likely to be picked to form a new government 
parliament has shown that there is a majority for peace i 
believe we can form a government that will reach a dialogue with 
the palestinians 
but little headway is considered likely in peace efforts as long 
as israel is consumed with internal poltics fashisoning a new 
coalition government may take months 
in london visiting king hussein of jordan said thursday the 
united states must take more responsibility for middle east peace 
because of israels political crisis and he warned that extremists 
on both sides could endanger world peace 
something needs to be done and fast he told a luncheon of 
the association of american correspondents in london 
peres won on a 6055 vote after a vitriolic debate and intense 
behindthescenes bargaining that lasted 10 hours the victory came 
from a majority of those present and voting in the 120member 
knesset or parliament 
the political crisis comes during a continuing palestinian 
insurrection in the occupied lands against israeli rule at least 
663 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians 
in the revolt that began in december 1987 fortythree israelis 
also have been slain in the violence 
as a result of thursdays loss shamir 74 a former underground 
leader and spymaster for the mossad secret service could face an 
uprising in his own likud bloc 
trade minister ariel sharon and housing minister david levy 
both hawks who want to abandon the us peace effort have 
repeatedly sought to oust shamir from the party leadership which 
he assumed in 1983 
starting sunday aides said president chaim herzog will canvass 
parliament members as to who should form the next government he is 
expected to give the nod to peres who would have a maximum of six 
weeks to assemble a coalition 
in the interim shamir will stay on as head of a caretaker 
government in which no ministers are allowed to resign and none can 
be added 
if peres fails shamir or another likud leader may be chosen to 
form a government if that fails new elections may be called 
the past two elections in july 1984 and november 1988 ended in 
virtual tie votes that forced the two big parties into coalitions 
for peres trying to mesh leftist secular parties with 
conservative religious factions will be a major test 
in the past orthodox parties have demanded tougher laws to deal 
with restaurants and stores that open on the sabbath a major 
source of friction with liberal factions 
peres won primarily on a stayaway vote by five of the six 
members of the ultraorthodox shas party which allied with likud 
in the past 
shamir might have avoided the noconfidence vote if he had gone 
to herzog and resigned the government or survived it by agreeing to 
a lastminute compromise from rabbi ovadia yosef shas spiritual 
leader 
yosef proposed acceptance of us proposals for starting a 
dialogue with palestinians shamir stuck to his belief that the 
us ideas would give the plo a role and jeopardize israels claim 
to sovereignty over the captured arab sector of jerusalem 
shamir insisted his party was just as interested in making peace 
as labor in unusually tough language he accused peres of making 
concessions that benefited israels arab enemies such as his 
endorsement of an international peace conference 
peres scoffed at shamirs concerns saying shamir was the victim 
of antiquated ideas and that the rightwing premiers 
footdragging had been murdering the peace process

a fire caused extensive damage to a chemical plant 
outside tripoli that is suspected of producing poison gas and 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi on thursday threatened to punish 
west germany if its agents set the blaze 
west germany whose companies helped build the plant denied the 
accusation and filed a protest with libya over an angry 
demonstration outside bonns embassy in tripoli the libyan capital 
gadhafi insisted that the heavily guarded plant in rabta 60 
miles southwest of tripoli was designed to produce only 
pharmaceuticals but he said libya would pay millions of dollars to 
any company willing to build it a chemical weapons facility 
in such eventuality i will sign the contract myself 
unhesitatingly gadhafi was quoted as saying by libyas official 
jana news agency which was monitored in rome 
he said libya would not hesitate to manufacture weapons of 
total devastation if it had the ability but he said it would 
take 20 years for libya to develop such weapons libya was accused 
of using chemical weapons in its war against chad 
the plant once described by cia director william webster as the 
worlds largest chemical weapons factory caught fire wednesday 
there were conflicting reports about damage and how the fire 
started 
late thursday a senior us official in washington said the 
united states had used its intelligence resources to conclude 
the plant was inoperable us intelligence resources are known to 
include satellites capable of highresolution photography 
abc news quoted unidentified libyan security sources as claiming 
the plant was burned to the ground by us and israeli agents the 
united states and israel denied involvement 
a previously unknown group of libyan dissidents the 
organization of the patriotic wing of the libyan army claimed 
responsibility for the blaze in a statement sent to west germanys 
ard television network 
the white house said last week the plant posed a serious danger 
and called for vigorous efforts to stop its operation 
from bush on down thursday the administration denied any 
involvement in the blaze 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we dont 
have any idea who did it somebody could have knocked over a 
kerosene lamp or something he said damage was extensive but the 
building still stood 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said we have 
had various reports of accidents at the plant before the 
current fire 
mahmoud azzabi press secretary at libyas un mission in new 
york said there was speculation saboteurs infiltrated libya from 
neighboring tunisia 
a journalist for jana reached by telephone from cairo said he 
was unsure whether there were casualties in the fire but said the 
plant was badly damaged 
you may consider it has been burned down he said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
yitzhak rabin who resigned as israels defense minister 
tuesday denied israel was involved in the fire and called the 
speculation nonsense 
the jana report quoted gadhafi as saying that the cause of the 
blaze was under investigation he said if investigators prove west 
german intelligence services were involved the presence of 
germany economically will be eliminated and the country involved in 
espionage and subversion for imperialism and zionism will lose 
west germanys ambassador in tripoli was summoned to meet with 
libyas foreign office but no threats were made during the 
meeting according to a west german government official in bonn 
in bonn the foreign ministry summoned a libyan diplomat to 
protest a demonstration by about 800 libyan demonstrators who 
temporarily blockaded access to the west german embassy in tripoli 
charges by the united states that german companies helped build 
the rabta plant caused a major scandal in west germany slightly 
over a year ago west germany at first denied the claims but later 
acknowledged them and launched its own investigations 
for more than 14 months the united states has accused libya of 
using the plant to make chemical weapons including mustard and 
nerve gases 
when western reporters were taken to the chemical plant in 
january 1989 they found it guarded by soldiers tanks and 
surfacetoair missiles the journalists were not allowed to 
inspect the plant 
libyas radio tripoli urged arab support for libya in the face 
of an aggressive campaign of american imperialism 
the american campaign against the pharmaceutical factory at 
rabta is a conspiracy against this important strategic achievement 
which should furnish medicine for the entire arab nation and break 
the foreign monopoly in this area said the broadcast monitored 
in tunis 
the united states engaged in hostilities with libya three times 
in the 1980s twice shooting down libyan fighter planes and bombing 
tripoli in 1986 in retaliation for what former president reagan 
said was terrorism against americans in europe

relentless thunderstorms that have hammered the plains with 
tornadoes set off another twister attack thursday in mississippi 
and a snowstorm suprised the upper midwest and closed schools 
the heat wave that has gently toasted much of the eastern half 
of the nation continued to set high temperature records 
thunderstorms have spawned damaging tornadoes this week in 
texas oklahoma arkansas iowa nebraska kansas and illinois 
this weeks unusual winter heat wave and storms began with a 
strong low pressure system that moved through the rockies onto the 
plains explained ed ferguson of the national severe storms 
forecast center in kansas city mo 
in advance of that we had a strong flow of warm air move 
through the plains these strong southerly winds brought a lot of 
warm temperatures and high humidities ferguson said in fact 
that strong flow of air existed from the gulf of mexico to the 
great lakes 
those warm temperatures and high humidities set the stage then 
for strong thunderstorm development because warm moist air from 
the gulf of mexico was colliding with cooler drier air from the 
northwest 
as for the snow in the north he said the parent low pressure 
system is still moving slowly up north were still dealing with 
what the system can produce 
ferguson said the tornado that devastated hesston kan on 
tuesday was a historymaker 
that tornado was head and shoulders above the ordinary 
tornado it was very violent he said it had abnormally high 
wind speeds probably in excess of 250 miles an hour it was the 
longest tracked tornado in recent years and maybe stands out among 
the top 10 since records were kept since 1950 
temperatures hit record highs in the 60s 70s and 80s again 
thursday in ohio michigan new jersey maryland new york 
massachusetts vermont north carolina new hampshire 
pennsylvania wisconsin rhode island delaware connecticut and 
the district of columbia the national weather service reported 
for some cities it was the fourth consecutive day of record warmth 
thunderstorms dumped more than 6 inches of rain on parts of 
southwestern alabama on thursday causing some street flooding that 
threatened homes in lowlying areas a tornado in a sparsely 
populated area of baldwin county flipped two mobile homes off their 
foundations 
severe thunderstorms pounded mississippi in advance of a 
slowmoving cold front and a tornado smashed a path of damage 
through rural george county injuring five people including three 
children whose mobile home was smashed 
it knocked my trailer over picked it up and dropped it back 
again rai smith 21 said in a telephone interview from her 
hospital room in lucedale when it all stopped the walls became 
the floor and the bathroom door was directly above me 
smith who is four months pregnant said she managed to climb up 
to the bathroom door and ease past a washing machine before it 
fell down into the area that i had just left 
george county authorities said two mobile homes including the 
smith familys were destroyed in addition sheiff eugene howell 
said two houses were damaged and several roads were blocked by 
downed trees 
biloxi got 43 inches of rain between 6 am and noon several 
sections of the state suffered power outages 
the sky was mostly sunny thursday across oklahoma but two days 
of steady downpours swelled creeks and rivers and threatened some 
parts of the state with flooding 
okmulgee county appeared to be in the most danger flood stage 
for the deep fork there is about 18 feet and the weather service 
said it probably would crest at about 31 feet by friday morning 
okmulgee sheriff jim hart said several residents who live near 
the river had already evacuated but two families waited too long 
and deputies had to evacuate the families from their homes on 
horseback leaving their belongings behind 
the water was up to the horses bellies he said 
to the north a storm plastered western iowa with up to 9 inches 
of sticky snow thursday and brought minor flooding and gusty wind 
to the rest of the state 
it was pretty much of a surprise said weather service 
meteorologist jeff hutton adding that heavy snow had been forecast 
for eastern nebraska and instead fell much further east 
he said the snow in western iowa and rain elsewhere was brought 
by a vigorous low pressure system racing north directly over the 
state 
its an intense surface low that pulled down the cold air and 
wrapped it around he said 
the storm socked southwestern minnesota with heavy wet snow 
mixed with sleet and freezing rain and forced the closing of at 
least 28 schools up to 10 inches of snow was possible 
north dakota was under a winter storm warning as snow and gusty 
north wind threatened the state with near blizzard conditions 
snowfall amounts were expected to range from 4 inches in the west 
to 10 inches in the east the weather service said 
wind gusted to 100 mph at rapid sd and high wind blew across 
minnesota and wisconsin 
in wyoming wind blowing at more than 25 mph whipped up snow and 
cut visibility to zero along slippery highways forcing the highway 
patrol to close a 45mile stretch of interstate 80 
traffic also was kept off 14 miles of interstate 25 from 
cheyenne south to the colorado line off and on because of 
accidents no injuries were reported

during his 16 years on the road trucker 
roosevelt jones had to rely on telephones to contact his company 
often phoning dispatchers thousands of miles away to report trouble 
or receive instructions 
now without leaving his rig he can send and receive messages 
in seconds using a satellite system that is revolutionizing the 
trucking industry 
besides providing speedy communications the system features 
special truck transmitters that enable dispatchers to monitor each 
vehicles travels and pinpoint its location customers can get 
hourly updates on the status of shipments 
all the folks that have them in their trucks seem to like 
them said jones a driver for wingatetaylor maid transportation 
inc a subsidiary of burlington motor carriers 
burlington the nations fourthlargest truck load carrier is 
installing the satellite system in 2000 trucks operated by its 
four subsidiaries wingatetailor maid of albany ga stoops 
express of anderson ind monroe trucking of monroe la and 
monkem of joplin mo 
joanne rang executive director of the american trucking 
association said satellite tracking is still relatively new and 
represents a substantial investment for companies firms willing to 
make the investment should be able to monitor shipments more 
closely and provide better service to their customers she said in 
an interview from her alexandria va office 
mike hodson burlingtons vice president for quality said the 
company evaluated several systems before selecting one developed by 
hughes network systems of germantown md 
during an eightmonth study burlington trucks equipped with 
satellite communications ran more miles ran fewer empty miles and 
ran the most direct routes hodson said in a phone interview from 
his hurst texas office 
the system proved it could reduce waste lower operating costs 
give burlington a competitive edge and improve its drivers quality 
of life he said 
drivers who rely on phones have to interrupt trips to check in 
with their companies they call from truck stops rest areas or any 
other place with safe parking 
after delivering their cargos they often have to phone 
dispatchers repeatedly sometimes for lengthy periods for 
instructions on picking up new loads 
he ends up at some truck stop drinking coffee smoking 
cigarettes shooting the breeze hodson said now he can sleep 
and wait for a beeper to go off we think its going to create a 
safer fleet because the guys are going to be better rested 
the burlington drivers communicate via a small keyboard that 
displays messages on a tiny screen they can select routine 
messages and fill in blank spaces with details or type in special 
messages for safety the truckers cant send messages while 
driving 
the message is beamed to a satellite and then down to a dish 
antenna in washington dc where it is decoded it then is sent 
back to the satellite and down to burlingtons message center in 
joplin mo from there it is relayed to the subsidiaries by 
telephone line 
dispatchers sitting at computer terminals can communicate with 
drivers or ask the computer to list the locations of all trucks 
they are supervising 
its going to improve our efficiency said mike driggers 
wingatetailor maids vice president of operations 
as driver jones prepared to make his first trip with the new 
system he met with instructor rodney hogan to learn how to operate 
the keyboard and transmit messages 
it seems kind of odd to me because i never used it before 
he said before pointing his white freightliner toward amarillo 
tex once i get used to it i think ill like it better than a 
phone

in a remote little patch of iowa where soybeans are hot and 
sushi is not the new talk of the town is teikei thats japanese 
for partnership 
two cultures and two countries are coming together in le mars 
iowa in the marriage of two schools cashhungry westmar college 
and teikyo university in tokyo 
our community just got bigger and the world just got 
smaller said arthur richardson president of the new teikyo 
westmar university after a plan was approved this month that will 
bring new dollars and new students from japan to the iowa 
school 
across america the japanese are investing hundreds of millions 
of dollars in a small but growing number of colleges and 
universities many struggling for survival some are joint programs 
or mergers in a few cases theyre building from bottom up a 250 
million school is planned near washington dc 
its a winwin situation richardson said they win an 
accredited fouryear education in the states we win the student 
population the market niche and the dollars to improve salaries 
and facilities 
teikyo which has 26000 students in japan and branches in 
britain and the netherlands already has links with schools in 
colorado and west virginia another japanese investor has bought a 
share of an oregon college 
though the entry into higher education isnt big only a few 
thousand students will be added to the 24000 japanese students 
already here or as splashy as the sale of new yorks rockefeller 
center it stirs the same divided sentiments 
its good in that the japanese really want to be international 
because theyre stung by charges theyre too insular and unknowing 
of the outside world said john sylvester director of the north 
carolina japan center at north carolina state university if 
youre putting a bad spin on it youd say the japanese are trying 
to go out and conquer foreign markets in just about everything 
some however insist this isnt business rivalry 
it isnt a market japan is taking away said michael young 
a professor of japanese law at columbia university now on leave at 
the state department we should be tremendously flattered 
indeed sylvester said the japanese respect the american 
university system japanese education through high school is 
generally tougher than in this country he said but our 
universities as a rule are more rigorous than theirs 
education isnt the only lure teikyos ties here make it much 
more prestigious said robert helmick legal consultant to the 
japanese school 
and japanese colleges can make money by having the attraction of 
a foreign campus sylvester said 
but educators also note most japanese schools involved arent 
firstrate institutions youre not going to find the really 
fasttrack males coming here young said 
still the american partners arent complaining they receive 
money students and they hope a better image 
take salem college a poor school in west virginia with no 
endowment and 400 students until last summers merger with teikyo 
an initial 12 million investment erased the schools debt and 
raised faculty salaries an average of 27 percent said ronald ohl 
president of the new salemteikyo university 
being debtfree and having some financial stability in and of 
itself is just a novel experience he said 
the school expects to spend 40 million to 60 million on 
improvements equipment and staff he said and boost average sat 
scores from about 700 to 1200 in four years by being more 
selective in admitting us students 
thousands of miles away geos corp a japanese company 
operating englishlanguage schools around the world has bought a 
49 percent share of warner pacific college in portland ore for 
6 million the 450student liberal arts school will buy back its 
assets after 30 years 
last years deal improved the schools finances and more doors 
have opened to us in the business community and economic 
community said administrative vice president arthur kelly 
money isnt always the motive regis college a jesuit school in 
denver operating with a balanced budget for 14 years sold one of 
its seven campuses to teikyo for a reported 65 million and will 
develop an americanstyle curriculum for japanese students 
not everyone is as receptive phillips university in enid 
okla wasnt interested in a tentative 24 million purchase offer 
made by the head of the kyoto institute of technology 
its like trying to sell the congregation of a church said 
president richard peck how can you sell 51 percent of the board 
of deacons of a church it doesnt work 
the offer was withdrawn but phillips with kyotos owner 
established two satellite campuses in japan and soon will open a 
third 
the japanese also have other plans here including a twoyear 
college in maryland and washington international university in 
loudoun county va a 250 million project both are for american 
and japanese students 
on a much smaller scale tokyo international university has 
built a branch adjacent to its sister school willamette university 
in salem ore 
this is a start for our students to learn the american way to 
do business their education and lifestyle said ryuji torihara 
dean of administration of the oneyear program 
in le mars an agricultural community of about 8000 people up 
to 200 japanese students arrive in april formal classes start this 
fall at the school celebrating its 100th birthday 
the chairman of the board of trustees resigned protesting the 
westmar presidents secret discussions with teikyo and arguing the 
decision was reached too quickly and the united methodist church 
which provides 90000 to the college has raised questions about 
future ties to the 566student school 
but the trustees approved the deal and teikyos gift 
richardson says its several million dollars has provided 
security and doubledigit raises in a school that was near 
financial collapse in the mid1980s 
much remains to be settled including the makeup of the new 
board of trustees helmick said hell recommend the majority be 
american though in salem its the reverse 
the school plans to have an exchange work program which helmick 
said will give students an edge companies in the united states 
and japan are spending a lot of money learning how to do business 
in another country he said we think our graduates will 
already have that knowledge 
richardson sees one obstacle cultural adjustment thats 
where the hard work and long haul takes place he said 
but mayor bonnie dull noted the english germans and dutch all 
settled in the area and assimilated very well i cant see why 
there would be a difference 
a lot of it depends on the students said kathy faber news 
editor at the le mars daily sentinel if theyre willing to come 
out in the community and say here i am folks are going to say 
were glad youre here

shoichi okinaga says he believes that japanese and 
american students learning together will promote understanding and 
friendship between the two countries and the world will gain 
so i decided to acquire colleges in the united states said 
okinaga the wealthy president of teikyo university which has 
bought into colleges in colorado iowa and west virginia 
japanese plans call for spending at least 320 million to buy or 
build universities abroad 
okinaga said he plans to spend 10 billion yen or 70 million 
over two years to develop academic homes for japanese students 
overseas as well as to give foreign students more knowledge of 
japan 
a slower approach is coordinated by toshio yamaguchi an 
influential legislator of the governing liberal democratic party 
who backs a 250 million plan to build a university outside 
washington dc with courses taught in both japanese and english 
behind yamaguchi is eie international corp a japanese 
conglomerate with such real estate holdings as the beverly wilshire 
hotel in california resorts and hotels on the gold coast in 
australia and an interest in bond university a project started by 
troubled australian financier alan bond 
jiro yaginuma spokesman for eie international said the company 
also plans a private university in europe and foresees an eventual 
link among institutions in australia europe and the united states 
asked if profit was the motive yaginuma replied everyone can 
understand that this is not an instant profitmaking project it 
takes time to become profitable or even break even so we are 
patient enough to wait until such time 
backers of the plans to put japanese universities in the united 
states list high motives to increase japanus understanding 
advance the ability of young japanese in the english language meet 
the growing desire of young americans to study japanese and develop 
internationally minded leaders of tomorrow 
yamaguchi said he was driven partly by his inferiority complex 
being an internationalist who doesnt speak english 
his planned school is to be called washington international 
university and will be located in loudoun county va opening for 
its first undergraduates in 1993 
in the 198889 school year about 24000 japanese students 
attended american colleges and universities and yamaguchi said 
many of them fail because their english isnt good enough 
to help negotiate the language barrier washington international 
university will permit entering japanese students to take two years 
of courses in japanese while studying english americans could take 
their last two years in japanese after studying the language 
the push to establish japanese schools in the united states 
comes as more than 30 us colleges have sprouted branches in japan 
or announced plans to open branches in the past few years meeting 
the growing thirst for usstyle higher education 
japanese education has a reputation for producing topnotch high 
school graduates but critics say universities dont produce enough 
people with foreignlanguage skills and with the exception of top 
schools do not demand hard work 
us universities by contrast are thought to develop more 
creative graduates and its noted that japan has produced few 
nobel prize winners compared to the united states 
yamaguchi said he had visited washington often as chairman of 
the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of parliament and 
was impressed with the virginia countryside which he said 
reflects the american spirit of independence 
its natural and historical background plus rich human 
resources in washington and young people from all over the world 
will create an ideal educational environment he said

the tanker exxon valdez its hull ripped apart 
a year ago on alaskas bligh reef is a ship without a name as it 
undergoes repairs 
fresh gray paint covers the name synonymous with environmental 
catastrophe 
the 30 million repair job which began last august is about 70 
percent complete and the tanker should be released to exxon in 
july said fred hallett vice president and chief financial officer 
of national steel amp shipbuilding co 
it could be hauling crude oil again this summer but under what 
name and where have not yet been determined said exxon shipping 
co spokeswoman carrie chassin 
exxon shipping president frank iarossi sensitive to the 
vessels virtually indelible association with the environmental 
disaster has said the ship may be given a fresh start under a 
new name away from alaska perhaps the gulf of mexico 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil poured into prince 
william sound on march 24 1989 after rocks ripped into the hull 
of the 987foot tanker 
a couple of boulders that lodged in the valdez were removed at 
the shipyard and after being examined by parties in the spill 
litigation were released to exxon which had them ground up at a 
construction site chassin said 
the singleskinned tanker is being restored to its original 
specifications despite some studies showing that equipping ships 
with double bottoms or hulls would prevent or reduce spillage in 
the event of an accident 
exxon shipping officials determined that retrofitting the 
entire vessel from an engineering standppoint was not feasible 
chassin said 
basically the whole bottom has been rebuilt said peter 
zschiesche business representative for the machinists union at the 
shipping company the middle of the bottom thats been ripped 
out back to front then they went in and started putting those 
pieces back in 100ton steel segments 
still to be completed is patching on the mangled starboard side 
which bore the brunt of the grounding 
when the repairs are completed the bottom will be coated with 
3000 tons of inchthick steel 
the valdez arrived last july at the shipyard where it was built 
in 1986 after being towed 2500 miles from alaska 
literally all of her starboard side was gone hallett said 
you could stand underneath the ship and look 70 feet up at the 
main deck i dont think anybody has seen that kind of damage in 
peacetime and have a ship survive

for some people a chorus line was more than 
a musical it was a way of life 
alyce gilbert has worked on broadways longestrunning show 
since the beginning from its first preview performances at the new 
york shakespeare festival public theater in april 1975 to its 
opening at broadways shubert theater the following july and 
throughout its 15year run 
now her job and those of its 58 other production people 26 
musicians and 34 dancers will end april 28 when a chorus line 
closes after 6137 performances 
gilbert is the musicals wardrobe mistress a quaint title for 
someone who must deal with four loads of dirty laundry every 
workday and twice on matinee days thats not to mention her 
finding getting repaired and keeping track of shoes socks 
buttons glass beads leotards pants jump suits jackets and top 
hats during what usually is a 12hour day or longer 
wardrobe is about continuity says the woman who first 
looked after costumes at age 12 for a childrens theater company in 
her hometown of milwaukee its not design its about things 
staying the same or kept within a certain parameter 
gilbert has the responsibility of maintaining the shows 
costumes designed by threetime tony winner theoni v aldredge she 
has had to make the replacement clothes look the way aldredge 
intended them to look a decade and a half ago that can mean a lot 
of problems 
youre dealing with some things that are rather firmly rooted 
in the fashion of 1975 that dont exist anymore gilbert says 
for one thing dance clothes have changed when a chorus 
line first opened dancewear mostly was nylon helanca now its 
milliskin made out of lycra a shiny spandex fiber that prevails 
everything in the world is made out of that now gilbert 
says so the musicals nylon dance clothes have to be specially 
ordered and then all the dancewear except for the womens black 
leotards has to be dyed 
theonis colors are very specific gilbert says all the 
women in the show wear some kind of red from pink to lavender to 
burgundy to maroon the men are dressed in blues browns and greens 
we took the bellbottoms out of the pants in 1981 it took a 
long time before they went out of dance pants primarily because it 
makes your legs look longer and thats something dancers always 
love 
gilbert has witnessed not only a revolution in dancewear but a 
change in the shapes of the dancers themselves 
it used to be a very long thin chorus line she says 
over the 15 years its become a much more athletic body dancers 
go to gyms they pump they do very distinct things to build bulky 
muscles which you never saw in 1975 it was not aesthetically 
pleasing then but somewhere along the line the publics eye 
changed and so did the choreographers 
gilberts workday usually has begun at 10 am in the basement 
of the shubert in a catacomblike space crammed with racks and 
boxes of costumes in every size and color 
its the buyitwhenyouseeitandkeepit syndrome she 
laughs weve got a lot of weird stuff around 
here she starts the days first load of laundry the dancewear 
is washed after each performance in a coldwater detergent the 
glittery finale costumes are pressed and checked for broken beads 
different dressers the show has five have beadin calls to 
go over the finale costumes to replace beads 
that costume has become a symbol of what broadway is 
gilbert says director michael bennett originally asked aldredge 
for red finale clothes similar to what he had used in follies 
but she came up with her own unique design 
it is based on everything being reflected gilbert says 
everything shines the fabrics the shoes the mens are patent 
leather the womens are satin the beads are glass when the light 
hits those clothes they look gold they look silver they look 
white its amazing what vanishes from them in terms of wear 
during the day gilbert deals with whatever has to be replaced 
or repaired toward evening the stage manager wanders by and 
announces who will be on stage that night a chorus line is a 
show in which understudies get a chance to perform frequently that 
means hauling out finale costumes for the replacement dancers 
about a half hour before curtain the five dressers come in the 
dancewear has been separated onto hangers one costume to a hanger 
and sent to the dressing rooms 
while the musical starts the finale costumes are set on racks 
at the side of the stage for the evenings splashy closing number 
during the show gilbert and the dressers fuss with the costume 
worn by cassie the lead female dancer and then get ready for the 
finale when the dressers go to help with the dancers finale 
changes gilbert goes too she personally hands out the top hats 
to them 
youre dealing with 17 people and 17 hats that look the 
same she says we dont keep the hats with finale costumes 
because its dark its easy to come up with the wrong hat if 
youre not focusing on that 
the process is repeated eight times a week 
youre in a rather unique position doing wardrobe 
particularly in this show says gilbert who got her start in 
1968 doing shows offbroadway ive learned that dancers are 
really so gallant they can be silly they can be petty they can 
be lots of things but when they have to go out and dance theres 
an extraordinary bravery 
all dance ever really gives them is the chance to be able to 
do it anything else is extra 
gilbert took two 6month leaves from a chorus line over the 
years to work on two other bennett shows ballroom and 
dreamgirls she always came back 
when a chorus line closes shell move over to grand 
hotel the tommy tune musical that has lavish 1920sstyle 
costumes and then there will probably be other shows she adds

after nearly three decades of bushwhacking 
trails for women in the maledominated workplace felice n 
schwartz has spent much of the past year fighting accusations she 
is a traitor 
she hasnt capitulated on the contrary the dispute with some 
influential feminists seems to have sharpened 
schwartz is the founder of a prominent corporate consulting firm 
in manhattan called catalyst which promotes sexual equality at 
work and was spawned during the feminist movement of the early 
1960s 
it now is one of the leading advisers on womens issues to large 
american businesses schwartzs connections give her access to the 
heads of companies ranging from citibank to sara lee corp 
last year schwartz hurtled herself into the public eye by 
writing a widely read article that became associated with the 
buzzword mommy track though she didnt invent the term and has 
repudiated it many times 
she asserted in the article titled management women and the 
new facts of life that womens growing role in the work force 
has forced companies to become more responsive and sensitive to 
their needs to attract and retain the most talented 
but the article published in the januaryfebruary 1989 issue of 
harvard business review created an uproar among women it was 
perceived as distinguishing two paths for management women a fast 
one for the strictly careerdriven and childless and a slower 
deadend route for those who want to raise families 
other wellknown women activists quickly distanced themselves 
from schwartz and accused her of giving companies an excuse to put 
women down after many years of steady advances 
they said her assertions amounted to a stark choice between 
career and family reinforced sexual stereotypes and assumed the 
burden of childrearing remained strictly a womans domain 
schwartz a 65yearold grandmother and toughtalking corporate 
executive in her own right has rejected those accusations blaming 
them partly on misunderstandings and distortions of her position 
she has faced the criticism with a mixture of defiance anguish 
frustration and humility debating her feminist adversaries and 
articulating her position hundreds of times in speeches and 
interviews 
the purpose of that article was to encourage corporate leaders 
to make progress in assimilating women at every level of management 
and to remove barriers to their advancement she said at a 
conference in january for example 
i wrote of the need for employers to revise their thinking 
their policies and their practices in order to meet the needs of 
employees who choose to combine work and family 
having to explain herself more than a year later shows how 
difficult the mommy track stigma has been to dislodge 
nonetheless schwartz said in an interview she would not change 
a word of the article or where she chose to publish it 
i wanted the harvard business review because i wanted to reach 
corporate leaders this was not an article for women she said 
i did not write the article for good housekeeping ms or working 
woman 
but the article provoked such concern from women that harvard 
business review sold 11000 reprints schwartz was besieged with 
press requests from womens magazines and foreign journalists from 
venezuela to australia 
she did 75 interviews in two months often encountering what she 
called the same misinterpretations of her arguments many times 
she spent much of the time denying and disavowing the mommy 
track idea 
schwartz said her patience finally expired during a broadcast 
with a west coast radio station when she exploded at her 
interviewer because the woman admitted she hadnt read the article 
that was a catharsis she said 
in some ways the controversy has further enhanced her 
influence which has grown steadily since she founded catalyst in 
1962 as a research and consulting service to help women reenter 
the work force after raising families something she did herself 
after taking an eightyear break to raise three children 
in the past year speaking invitations have multiplied from 
colleges institutes and business conferences schwartz said she 
said women ranging from mba candidates to cia employees have 
approached her with positive comments 
im absolutely euphoric its opened discussion to issues that 
had been submerged she said what i want to do is encourage 
honesty and openness 
many influential professional women have expressed admiration 
for schwartzs ability to reach into maledominated corporate 
bastions so boldly though they have mixed feelings about what she 
says 
i think what she did was very good because it brought the 
issue to the table said deborah biondolillo vice president of 
human resources for the computer company apple usa i didnt 
happen to agree with her solutions 
schwartz has failed to appease her most vociferous critics 
prominent feminists who think her approach is misguided elitist 
arrogant and destructive 
many still believe she has perpetuated the mommy track idea 
despite her denials 
her article was a very dangerous retrogression and 
acquiescence to sex discrimination said betty friedan a 
cofounder of the national organization for women and author of 
the feminine mystique considered one of the most important 
books about the womens movement 
i have not changed one iota in my mind my outrage at felice 
schwartz friedan said she is simply not a feminist not 
committed to equality she has an employer mentality 
even some less militant proponents of womens rights are 
concerned that schwartz has hurt their efforts to obtain 
professional parity with men some say she has further isolated 
herself by suggesting women disclose at job interviews whether they 
plan to have children 
women are still getting fired from their jobs when theyre 
pregnant i dont know why she thinks we have that kind of 
protection said judsen culbreth editor of working mother 
magazine 
putting this burden on women is just such backward thinking 
just such 1950s maninthepinstripesuittype thinking 
culbreth said i dont think shes meant to do this but it 
particularly does damage to working mothers who are going to have 
this question mark raised now in the minds of so many 
corporations 
both schwartz and her critics have said the discussion is 
helpful 
still schwartz said i am sure there are still lots of women 
who think im their enemy thats painful after 27 years

president bush may not believe in his lofty 
poll ratings but the democrats seem to and that is keeping them 
cautious or maybe timid 
thats a label they have tried to affix to bush who says the 
correct description of his style is prudent call it timidity or 
caution or prudence the tag applies on capitol hill as at the 
white house 
while democrats complain that bush is trying to avoid 
politically risky positions most of them are doing the same thing 
they just arent as visible with bush riding high in the 
popularity polls their challenges usually are safe rhetorical and 
standard 
there are exceptions 
three leading democrats in congress have proposed three 
controversial policy and budget moves so far this year none has 
drawn broad support at the top or among the reelectionbent rank 
and file members of the party that controls both house and senate 
any or all of the three could serve as highvisibility rallying 
points for the opposition party but they got faint praise and no 
endorsement from democratic congressional leaders 
the latest democratic initiative is rep dan rostenkowskis 
budget balancing proposal a combination of spending cut and tax 
increases he called both bold and balanced its all of that a 
compromise that would compel each party to swallow some unpleasant 
medicine 
house speaker thomas s foley warily described the rostenkowski 
plan as very important and interesting but he isnt going to risk 
leading democrats into tax increases bush could block and blame on 
them 
the president said he was prepared to negotiate on the 
rostenkowski proposal although he opposes some of its features 
especially the tax boosts and a years freeze on cost of living 
increases in social security 
at the start of the congressional session sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny proposed a cut in social security taxes that 
would give wave earners an electionyear break while drawing down 
the trust fund reserves that mask the true size of the federal 
deficit 
if we cant get behind an issue like this im not sure who 
needs the democratic party moynihan said as his proposal faded 
for lack of party support that one clearly worried the white 
house since the democrats could have used it to force him into 
vetoing an electionyear tax cut bush called it a subterfuge for a 
later tax increase and said it would put future social security 
benefits at risk 
early this month rep richard a gephardt dmo the house 
majority leader combined a call for increased aid to eastern 
europe and direct aid to the soviet union with a denunciation of 
bush for what he said was a lack of vision and leadership 
the white house counterattacked with ridicule i dont want to 
knock the man bush said last week maybe hell come up with a 
good idea one of these days 
gephardts aid proposal was swallowed in the political 
controversy 
praising all three idea men rep bill richardson dnm told 
the house last week that they are driving the white house and the 
republicans crazy 
it is the us congress that is more often than not providing 
the leadership in todays government he claimed 
or talking about it leadership takes more than proposals and 
speeches it takes action even if that involves a political risk 
the rostenkowski plan does the illinois democrat chairman of 
the house ways and means committee said it asks for modest 
sacrifices by all americans to balance the budget beginning in 
1993 and each party would have to sacrifice some pet planks in its 
political platform should either balk the compromise would 
collapse and budget stalemates would persist 
rostenkowski proposes a real freeze on federal spending for one 
year including costofliving increases in social security a 3 
percent cut in military spending with the savings to go into 
deficit reduction and not new programs an increase in top bracket 
income taxes and in oil and other consumption taxes 
the tradeoffs would require each party to yield some pet issues 
with democrats dropping their refrain that republicans are a threat 
to social security benefits and with the gop dropping its 
taxandspend charges against the democrats 
for the rostenkowski package to get anywhere the blame would 
have to be shared that would take a level of trust that isnt 
showing now democrats are leery seeing the ingredients of a setup 
in which the white house would negotiate on the plan then reject a 
tax increase and accuse them again of being the taxandspend 
party 
foley said bush must back off his nonewtaxes pledge in advance 
of any deal the president has an absolute veto on this 
question he said 
gephardt and rostenkowski both said bush ought to be willing to 
risk some of his political capital to take the lead in dealing with 
budget and deficit stalemates 
i dont live by the polls bush replied 
he questioned whether there was all that much popularity to be 
spent anyhow i dont believe in it is one thing he said at a 
news conference i dont believe in polls that much these 
things come and go

it comes to this if mikhail gorbachevs thinking prevails 
history will belong to the accountants 
the soviet union took little lithuania illegally half a century 
ago now says the soviet president if lithuania secedes it will 
owe mother russia 33 billion in hard currency mostly to pay for 
capital investment thats like the warden dunning a departing 
prisoner for back rent 
leaving out interest compounded over 125 years wouldnt the 
same logic entitle the government in washington to demand billions 
from mississippi florida georgia alabama louisiana texas 
south carolina north carolina virginia tennessee and arkansas 
for their four years of secession south carolina has yet to pay a 
nickel for the holes it ripped in fort sumter 
if gorbachev is right doesnt it follow that zaire owes belgium 
a bundle for all the time it was the belgian congo in fact wont 
most of africa be forever in the debt of most of europe for taking 
the trouble to colonize the continent 
and finally would the heirs of the late king george iii begin 
to get ideas about those impudent 13 colonies that left his bed and 
board 200 years ago 
the possibilities boggle and that goes with the changing 
territory these days 
years in costly research the sr71 blackbird spy plane was 
retired because of budget cuts on its last flight it smashed all 
coasttocoast records flying from california to washington in 68 
minutes 17 seconds which is faster than many commuters on both

two old soul mates whose palship once brought the world to the 
edge of nuclear war now keep moving further apart 
fidel castro complained that the kremlin was undercutting world 
communism by slandering socialism destroying its values 
discrediting the party and liquidating its leading role doing away 
with social discipline and sowing chaos and anarchy everywhere 
the moscow news counterattacked cuban women are in no danger 
of replacing revolutionary consciousness with mercenary spirit as 
long as they are allowed a choice of one bra or two pairs of 
underwear but not both and only the size available at the moment 
the administrative and economic model cuba copied was ours 
imitated at a time when european socialism was drowning in a bog of 
stagnation 
translation just because you were dumb enough to copy us is no 
reason we should stick to a sinking ship 
for days people wondered what a joint session of congress was 
applauding when it heard president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia 
say consciousness precedes being and not the other way around 
as the marxists claim 
the air was finally cleared by letters to the editor of the 
washington post from seasoned students of government 
it was quite obvious to me that havel was saying hopefully 
the parameters of being are impacted subsequent to consciousness 
basically the infrastructure of the two will result in a 
meaningful relationship in the ongoing preplanning based on past 
experience 
and 
i have it on good authority that what congress thought it 
heard when havel said consciousness precedes being was 
confucious precedes beijing 
and 
congress was obviously itching to break for lunch when it 
applauded so hard upon hearing havel proclaim that nacho chips 
precede beans 
and in these unpredictable times the fathers of june brides 
were forewarned by the new york times that caterers dress makers 
and florists can sue and collect for late cancellations

this years mild winter could come back to 
haunt americans in the form of a drought the national weather 
service said thursday 
the march hydrological outlook usually an annual report on 
potential for spring flooding from snowmelt this year is more a 
chronicle of missing snow and dry soil conditions 
unless heavy precipitation occurs the return of drought to 
major areas of the nation is imminent the report said 
drought plagued much of the nation in the hot summer of 1988 
easing somewhat last year pockets of dryness have persisted 
however 
serious watersupply problems are a distinct possibility for 
much of california as well as in the great basin lower colorado 
parts of the rio grande and in western and southern texas the 
weather service reported 
low stream flow low soil moisture and low spring flood 
potential also cover a large area of the north central states the 
report said 
parts of many central and western states have experienced 
abnormally dry conditions for two to four years resulting on dry 
conditions deep in the soil 
the threat of snowmelt flooding meanwhile is limited to small 
areas of the country 
flood threat is above normal in a strip of northwestern montana 
and northeastern idaho 
but snow cover in the eastern twothirds of the country is 
minimal and where there is snow it is below average except in 
northern maine and northern michigan some portions of the central 
states have reported high streamflows 
a notable exception to the dry conditions is in southcentral 
alaska which has had a record snowfall the melt there is still 
weeks away but that is a region where ice jams have created flood 
danger in the past

whats in a name 
for donald trump an awful lot the developer has wrapped 
moniker and business empire so closely they have become one big 
glitzy package of trump this trump that but his recent marriage 
problems show how building a business on a name can be risky if the 
name becomes the object of ridicule 
the name trump a symbol of the bigspending 1980s is 
synonymous with conspicuous wealth high rollers play in his trump 
castle and trump plaza casinos in atlantic city nj urban 
sophisticates live in 4 million condos in trump palace or trump 
parc in manhattan executives fly the trump shuttle between new 
york boston or washington 
the late publishing tycoon malcolm forbes and cable television 
titan ted turner also built namesake empires around their own star 
quality but perhaps more than anyone trumps personality and 
business have kept his face in front of the cameras and his name in 
front of the public 
trump has done a magnificent job of building himself up 
said jack trout president of trout amp ries a marketing consulting 
firm in greenwich conn unfortunately when you live by the 
press you can die by the press 
trump normally basks in media attention but has said he hates 
the splashy publicity about his breakup with wife and business 
partner ivana even so he insists that his business has benefited 
from the screaming tabloid headlines an assertion that some trump 
critics find even more repulsive 
theres something demeaning and vile about his trumpeting that 
his marital situation is adding to his business former new york 
mayor edward i koch a longtime trump antagonist said in a 
telephone interview to me its incredible that he would 
denigrate ivana trump 
some believe the publicity swirling around ivana donald and 
alleged mistress marla maples has hurt trumps business 
hes becoming a joke trout said for a serious brand 
that can be a big problem 
you have to handle yourself extremely well because you are 
putting yourself as a person front and center the consultant 
said youve got to be very careful with your reputation you 
cant do stupid things 
forbes on the other hand was careful and consistent about his 
image trout said his divorce from wife roberta for example 
occurred quietly 
forbess sons of course face another kind of famousname 
challenge as a result of his death last month at age 70 they must 
run the publishing empire they have inherited without the man who 
gave it character 
eldest son malcolm jr known as steve is a bookish fellow who 
admits that he cant exactly follow in his fathers madcap 
footsteps i am certainly not going to try to imitate him he 
told the wall street journal in a recent interview he would be 
disappointed if i tried to 
while the late forbes had a passion for motorcycling hot air 
balloons and partying bashful steve 43 collects presidential 
papers and manuscripts rather than clip his wings as trump is 
advised to do by critics steve forbes may need to let loose a 
little 
turner head of a 600 million cable tv empire seems already to 
have learned the lesson of handling a personal namebrand carefully 
is he a flamboyant character yes hes had a very checkered 
career said gordon crawford an analyst with capital research 
co in los angeles who follows turners companies hes also 
created the most valuable group of cable properties in the world 
turner who successfully piloted his yacht to the americas cup 
in 1977 has been called captain outrageous and the mouth of 
the south between 1986 and 1987 he plunged his business 14 
billion into debt lost another 25 million on the goodwill games 
separated from his wife and lost his house in a fire 
some say turner seems to have mellowed although his reference 
last year to abortion foes as idiots and bozos drew wide 
publicity as well as the ire of prolifers 
hes becoming mr corporate statesperson hes mellowing 
out trout said noting that turners demeanor is now 
considerably less brash

opec ministers began gathering thursday 
to review current oil market conditions and decide whether to 
revise the groups price and production policies 
ministers from libya venezuela ecuador and kuwait were among 
the early arrivals for fridays meeting of a special panel of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
in advance of the talks analysts predicted the ministers of the 
13 oilproducing nations would not revise the price and supply 
guidelines set late last year 
ecuadors oil minister diego tamariz said we will analyze 
the situation of the market and on that basis decide what to do in 
the second quarter of the year 
he said the officials would study projections for demand and 
supply of opec crude oil in the apriljune period before adjusting 
the production ceiling whether they change it or not he said 
all depends on the outcome of the analysis 
last november the ministers set a production limit of about 22 
million barrels of crude a day for the first six months of the 
year it had been fixed at 205 million barrels in the last quarter 
of 1989 
but several opec countries led by kuwait and the united arab 
emirates are together pumping at least a million barrels a day 
above the cap according to analysts 
despite surging production prices have remained above the 
cartels target of 18 a barrel due to strong worldwide demand and 
declining production by the united states and other nonopec 
producers 
prices are expected to soften along with demand in coming 
months however as temperatures warm in the united states and 
other major consuming countries 
in recent weeks several ministers have privately pressed for 
changes in the cartels price and production targets but they 
appeared to have drawn little support from others 
iraqs minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi was reportedly 
anxious to have a higher reference price 
kuwaits ali khalifa alsabah suggested in the middle east 
economic survey that the quota system should be scrapped he said 
it was unrealistic and often ignored by members 
but when asked in vienna whether his idea would get much 
attention he quipped no we need our security blanket 
the formula used by the cartel starts with an overall output 
ceiling then each country is allotted a quota based largely on 
capacity without a quota each member could produce freely 
sabah was quoted recently as saying his country did not have to 
go along with a quota when prices were above the 18 mark 
tamariz asked about the overproduction said opec needed to 
look at the different needs of its members there has to be some 
room for flexibility he said 
formal talks by opecs monitoring committee are scheduled to 
begin friday evening only eight ministers are officially members 
of the panel but all 13 opec ministers are expected to attend 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
thursday he does not believe the recent rise in the value of the 
dollar will adversely affect the nations trade deficit this year 
i hear a lot of talk about the dollar climbing he told 
reporters after a speech to the national newspaper association 
but if you go back over the last year and a half and look at it 
over that period of time what youll see is stability some days 
up some days down 
but you just go back and look at it since the beginning of 
1988 youll find weve had a stable dollar and thats what weve 
tried to achieve he continued weve had stability and 
stablility is what we strive for in all markets markets that 
people can rely on 
a stronger dollar could cause the nations trade deficit to 
widen because it would make imported goods cheaper while increasing 
the price of us products sold overseas 
the commerce department reported tuesday that the gap in the 
current account balance the broadest measure of us trade 
narrowed to 1059 billion last year a 16 percent reduction from 
1988 
the reduction was due in part to an improvement in the balance 
of trade in the fourth quarter that came largely from a decline in 
the vaue of the dollar the dollar has been strengthening in recent 
weeks however 
in his speech to the newspaper association brady renewed his 
call for a single market linking trades of stocks stock options 
and stock index futures 
the securities and exchange commission now has jurisdiction over 
stocks and stock options while the commodity futures trading 
commission is responsible for markets handling stock index futures 
the sharp stock market decline of october 1987 he said 
demonstrated dramatically how these markets all operating by 
their own sets of rules can interact to stimulate excessive 
volatility and reinforce the downward spiral 
brady noted that most overseas markets place regulation of all 
three in the hands of one regualator and said us markets also 
could benefit greatly by ending the fragmented control 
without endorsing any approach brady mentioned three ways of 
achieving unified control they were to merge the sec and cftc 
give the sec jurisdiction over all futures except those related to 
tangible commodities or shift stock index futures alone to the sec 
many have recommended full merger as the most straightforward 
and the course chosen by countries abroad he said there are 
perhaps arguments in favor of the other approaches as well whats 
important is that we get something done and get it done now

interco corp was a manufacturing and retailing 
conglomerate in 1988 turning out wellknown brands of clothes 
shoes and furniture and taking in more than 3 billion in sales a 
year 
today the company is a shadow of its former self saddled with 
debts following a 28 billion recapitalization the company is 
trying to cut deals with bankers while seeking buyers for its 
assets 
doskocil cos a food processor that took over the larger wilson 
foods corp in 1988 filed recently for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law 
doskocil bought wilson for 133 million assumed millions of 
dollars in wilsons debts then defaulted on a loan the company 
like interco has had trouble selling assets and its 
lowerthanexpected income hasnt been enough to pay bills 
these companies arent as well known as investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert or retailer campeau corp both forced into 
bankruptcy court recently by credit problems they are nonetheless 
casualties of the debtdominated 1980s 
interco once made a broad array of products ranging from 
converse sneakers to ethan allen dining sets it did not go into 
debt by choice but rather to thwart a hostile takeover by a pair of 
unfriendly washington investors 
the company borrowed 2 billion to pay shareholders a special 
dividend and expected to foot the bill partly through asset sales 
but interco also expected business to be stronger than it turned 
out to be although divisions like ethan allen went fast it hasnt 
been easy to sell some of its other businesses that are still on 
the block 
like most companies interco also did not anticipate the 
collapse of the junk bond market last year and the new caution 
toward acquisitions that followed 
that caution has made banks more reluctant to lend money and 
wouldbe acquirers more hesitant about taking on new debt to buy 
other businesses this has left companies like interco strapped 
because they need cash 
robert raiff who follows interco for cj lawrence morgan 
grenfell inc blames the companys lack of foresight for its 
problems 
theyre in a position that longterm wont allow them to 
operate without a very major restructuring of the debt raiff 
said 
interco wants to retain its converse and florsheim footwear 
manufacturers and broyhill and lane furniture companies as core 
businesses 
the company recently persuaded lenders to relax the terms of a 
2445 million bridge loan payment but even when that payment is 
made it is due in may interco still will have a heavy debt 
burden 
doskocils story is a case of a company going too heavily into 
debt to take over another company then getting socked for higher 
raw materials prices in doskocils case hogs and a tighter 
availability of credit 
the company went 240 million into debt to buy wilson foods 
expecting to repay part of that by selling assets but like 
interco doskocil has found it is no longer easy to find buyers 
especially buyers who can get financing 
the company recently reported assets of 4741 million and 
liabilities of 4141 million under chapter 11 it has bought time 
to reorganize and try to stay in business

failure by the united states and japan to act soon 
to eliminate trade barriers and strengthen their economies raises 
dangers to the entire global trading system us secretary of 
commerce robert mosbacher said thursday 
if we do not act soon we may throw away our last chance to 
save the world trading system from serious damage mosbacher told 
reporters at the japan national press club 
the two countries are negotiating greater market access in japan 
for us satellites lumber and supercomputers and the elimination 
of structural impediments to balanced trade in both nations 
as mosbacher described a sense of urgency in ongoing trade 
talks between the two countries prime minister toshiki kaifu and 
other government leaders appeared ready to propose changes in 
japans economic structure that could reduce japans 49 billion 
trade surplus with the united states 
local news reports said kaifu held an emergency meeting late 
wednesday with three key cabinet ministers and set a weekend 
deadline for detailed measures for removing structural trade 
barriers 
mosbacher was dispatched to tokyo by president george bush to 
follow up on bushs meeting with kaifu in palm springs california 
earlier in the month 
in another sticky trade issue us rice growers brought their 
campaign to open japans rice market to tokyo but a government 
agency ordered the removal of a small amount of us rice displayed 
at an international food exhibition in chiba southwest of tokyo 
food agency officials said the display violated the food control 
law which prohibits rice imports for sale in japan japan has said 
it needs to maintain selfsufficiency in rice to protect food 
security 
mosbacher told reporters he was extremely disappointed that 
satellite negotiations ended tuesday in washington without major 
progress it is critical that we resolve this he said 
the united states a world leader in satellites technology 
wants japan to purchase us satellites japan says it wants to 
nurture its fledgling satellite industry 
its hard to believe this great nation which produces so many 
goods so well has to protect an infant industry mosbacher said 
in addition to reducing barriers to specific products the 
united states is urging japan to undertake structural economic 
reforms such as deregulation of its retail distribution system 
reduction of land prices and increases in public works spending 
the united states as part of an eightpoint agenda for 
competitiveness has pledged to boost research and development 
funds reform its education system reduce its budget deficit and 
reform antitrust and product liability regulations 
while noting progress in shrinking the us trade deficits with 
other countries and in reducing the us budget deficit mosbacher 
said japans overall trade surplus with america and the world 
has achieved a semipermanent status 
mosbacher also was to host a meeting of five major japanese 
semiconductor users to encourage them to increase their purchases 
of us computer chips us makers have a 129 percent share of 
the japanese market but are aiming at a 20 percent share 
in speeches thursday mosbacher said japan was obligated to 
boost the us share of the market to 20 percent by 1991 under a 
1986 agreement between the two nations 
japanese government officials and producers maintain such a 
promise could not be assured in a freemarket economy and that in 
the agreement japan merely recognized the us desire to reach a 20 
percent share 
during his fourday visit to tokyo mosbacher also met with 
kaifu foreign minister taro nakayama trade minister kabun muto 
and officials of the countrys top business group the federation 
of economic organizations or keidanren

venezuela is expected to announce 
friday an agreement with creditor banks to reduce by up to 30 
percent of its publicsector foreign debt finance minister roberto 
pocaterra said 
pocaterra said late wednesday that after a year of negotiations 
the agreement will very possibly be friday despite president 
carlos andres perezs absence from the country 
perez is in brasil attending the inauguration of fernando 
collor de mello 
the reduction should be between 25 and 30 percent almost 
double what mexico got said pocaterra 
the agreement would affect the 205 billion publicsector 
restructured debt venezuelas overall foreign debt totals 37 
billion the fourth largest in latin america 
until now banks had been unenthusiastic about reducing 
venezuelas debt pointing to its oil income as a sign of its 
ability to pay 
oil exports which account for more that 90 percent of 
venezuelas foreign exchange earnings are expected to top 10 
billion this year compared to last years 949 billion 
venezuela suspended capital payments last year and is behind on 
interest installments 
according to a government report venezuela expects to reduce 
its public debt by 112 billion by 1992 it has already signed up 
credits through 1993 amounting to 128 billion to finance its debt 
reduction plan 
the report said venezuela had presented the following options to 
the bank advisory commitee in new york which represents 460 
creditor banks direct debt repurchase with a 60 percent discount 
two types of zero coupon bonds including one with a 35 percent 
discount on debt face value and new loans 
once an agreement is announced banks will have four months to 
choose among the alternatives 
in february mexico signed an agreement that cut its 485 
billion debt to commercial banks by some 7 billion banks were 
given three options reduce debt capital by 35 percent cut 
interest rate to a fixed 625 percent or offer new loans equivalent 
to 25 percent of their outsanding loans to mexico 
about 40 percent of creditor banks opted for capital reduction 
50 percent chose interest rate reduction and the remaining 10 
percent granted new loans

strategic alliance for europe

soybean futures prices posted sharp gains and 
grain futures closed moderately higher thursday on the chicago 
board of trade amid talk that the soviet union was in the market 
for more us grain 
the late rally in the soybean pit erased much of the losses 
registered earlier in the week and prompted speculation that prices 
may have to move even higher to persuade farmers to part with their 
soybean stocks 
the daily demand is exceeding the daily supply and we really 
havent gotten up to price levels that have stimulated the movement 
in supply to meet that said william biedermann research 
director with the commodities brokerage allendale inc 
analysts and traders said rumors of soviet interest in us corn 
and soybean meal supported the markets which had been moving 
higher for most of the day after bouncing off their opening lows 
speculation that the brazilian government may impose a new 
export tax on soybeans and soybean meal sparked further buying 
they said 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 384 a bushel corn futures 
were cent to 3 cents higher with march at 247 a bushel oats

continental airlines on thursday announced its 
first schedule expansion in two years boosting daily flights by 
100 to 1417 and beginning service to panama costa rica and 
several us cities 
we needed to get our arms around our operational 
difficulties stan hula continental vice president of schedule 
development said of the airlines nogrowth mode in the past 
two years we think weve got those problems licked there are a 
number of things coming together for continental that is causing us 
to be able to expand 
he pointed to department of transportation statistics which 
showed customer complaints about continental were down 96 percent 
since 1987 and ontime arrival performance for continental was the 
third best among the nations airlines in 1989 
hula also credited an improvement in continentals financial 
condition for the schedule expansion 
although the airline lost 561 million in the fourth quarter of 
1989 the loss was 431 million less than the octoberdecember 
period the previous year for all of 1989 houstonbased 
continental a subsidiary of texas air corp showed a 31 million 
profit 
twentythree planes are being added to the continental fleet 
including jets that were bought from sister carrier eastern 
airlines and returned to continental after being leased to eastern 
and pan am corp hula said 
he had no details on fares on the new flights 
there will be some pricing initiatives he said we will 
be very competitive throughout the summer with all of our fares 
beginning may 15 continental will operate flights from houston 
to panama city panama and san jose costa rica giving the 
airline the largest number of us flights to central america hula 
said continental already has flights to belize el salvador 
guatemala and honduras 
we look to expand in central america even further as time 
passes hula said the changing conditions in panama obviously 
make this service possible the improving political climate has a 
great deal to do with our interest in central america 
in the united states continental is starting latenight service 
out of houston with a dozen flights leaving at 1030 pm 
these flights bridge a gap between evening travel and the 
overnight redeye flights he said while 1030 pm may seem 
late to many people we believe there is sufficient demand at this 
time of day to warrant the implementation of a new bank of 
flights 
elsewhere new service is being added from cleveland ohio to 
louisville ky and norfolk va from newark nj service is 
being added to greensboro nc norfolk va columbia sc and 
antigua west indies those flights start may 1

atampt and its unions thursday discussed plans 
to offer early retirement to nonmanagement employees for the first 
time in the companys longrunning campaign to slim down 
american telephone and telegraph co had no details on who would 
be affected how many workers would be eligible and what incentives 
would be offered because talks were in an early stage said company 
spokesman burke stinson at atampts basking ridge office 
stuart crane an analyst for gruntal amp co speculated that 
fewer than 10000 people likely would be affected by the expanded 
workforce cuts although it was unknown how many actually would 
accept early retirement 
a spokesman for one of atampts major unions the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers said he could not comment on the 
substance of the talks 
however the idea of offering enhanced pensions to induce 
retirements is obviously something that were not opposed to 
said the spokesman tom hickman 
the companys other main union the communications workers of 
america said it had no comment 
the efforts are another step in atampts efforts to cut overhead 
costs and consolidate its operations said stinson 
atampt has shrunk its workforce steadily since the 1984 breakup of 
the bell system the companys workforce has shrunk to 281400 
including 173500 nonmanagement workers from 373000 at the time 
of the breakup 
last year a special retirement plan for managers prompted 
12500 to depart out of 35000 who were eligible said stinson the 
arrangement added five years to each managers age and tenure and 
boosted pension payments by 15 percent for five years or until a 
retired worker reached 65 
a total of 25000 jobs were cut last year some through 
attrition 
as atampt transforms its network into a computerdriven system and 
employs new digital and solid state technology it has increasing 
numbers of workers with less to do said stinson 
more switching and operator services are done by computer

personal bankruptcies have jumped by 31 percent in 
new england more rapidly than any other region reflecting a 
softening regional economy that also has taken its toll on banks 
and businesses 
analysts say bankruptcies once considered by some the refuge of 
highflyers who play the game and lose are becoming the resort of 
new englands average joes who get caught between pervasive 
layoffs a daunting debt load and plunging real estate values 
im not surprised by the fact that this is happening all of a 
sudden the door is closed said edward j powers who studies new 
england as a consulting economist with william witter inc a new 
yorkbased pension fund management company a lot of people here 
are two paychecks away from bankruptcy even though this is 
supposed to be a conservative region 
in 1988 personal bankruptcies totalled 25417 in new york and 
the six new england states figures from the us district courts 
show in 1989 that number rose to 33294 an increase of 31 
percent 
new hampshire led the list of the seven states with an increase 
in personal bankruptcies of 55 percent while in massachusetts the 
increase was 50 percent on the other end of the scale vermont 
actually showed a decrease of 4 percent 
compared to new england the next highest increase in personal 
bankruptcies was seen in the district including alabama florida 
and georgia where the figure rose 27 percent from 63139 to 80271 
personal bankruptcies have risen only 12 percent nationwide to 
616753 court figures show 
in ordinary times personal bankruptcies stem most often from a 
major medical illness said judy kent of the american fiscal 
services association in washington dc a financial services 
trade association which compiled the figures in addition to bad 
budgeting divorce and job loss can also lead an individual to file 
proceedings kent said 
in new england however the rise in personal bankruptcies comes 
as the region hurtles downward from the boom years in the 1980s 
when its four main industries hightech construction defense 
and financial services took off those industries have largely 
contracted with revenues falling off and widespread layoffs 
announced 
we had the fastest rise in personal bankruptcies in part 
because we had such a booming economy for so long said wayne 
ayers chief economist with the bank of boston when things slow 
down they often slow down with a vengeance 
there hasnt been a rise in major medical illnesses in new 
england said david wyss chief economist for data resources an 
economic research group in lexington rather wyss says the region 
is seeing more bankruptcies because of the soft real estate and job 
markets here 
its the average joe who is caught up in this relatively 
young with little or no assets and who borrowed heavily to buy 
his first home and now hes caught said wyss 
in massachusetts the unemployment rate has gone from 35 
percent in november 1988 to 53 percent in february 1990 a rise 
mimicked throughout the region 
a lot of people had of course acquired consumer debt and 
household debt and when you lose your job you cant pay it they 
cannot pay the debts they undertook in better times wyss said 
major employers such as wang laboratories inc digital 
equipment corp and general electric co have laid off thousands of 
workers and the financial services industry has cut back 20 
percent of its jobs in new england powers said those layoffs have 
led to job losses at barber shops restaurants and clothing stores 
powers said 
bankruptcy happens he said in high pockets of unemployment 
where people are overwhelmed when the downturn surrounds them 
inside their region how can you sell anything its just very 
difficult 
changes in law have also made declaring bankruptcy less 
financially painful analysts said the deals each debtor strikes 
still depends on how creditors litigators and judges assess the 
depth of his fiscal desperation but now in many cases people can 
keep their house and car powers said 
analysts agreed declaring bankruptcy had also lost some of the 
disgrace it carried years ago though they acknowledged it was a 
process most people wanted to avoid 
in japan people commit suicide rather than file bankruptcy 
its the ultimate disgrace its called seppuku said powers 
whereas over here its not immoral or disgraceful anymore its 
part of the culture now 
there has been an increase in the willingness of people to go 
bankrupt said wyss of data resources there is not as much 
stigma they can continue to work and probably get a new credit 
card tomorrow

donald trumps promise to compensate everyone on 
the flight if his shuttle airline is late turned into a bonanza for 
hundreds of passengers as fog floated over airports in boston and 
new york 
but officials of trump shuttle say the foul weather on the first 
two days of the offer guaranteed the success of the promotion 
trump shuttle announced the guarantee offer tuesday one day 
before fog set in at bostons logan international airport the 
airline which links new york with boston and washington 
guaranteed passengers they would receive a choice of premiums if 
any of its hourly flights arrived more than 15 minutes late 
laguardia airport in new york was closed to incoming flights for 
about 3 hours thursday morning halting the shuttles 630 am 7 
am and 8 am est flights from boston and washington said bruce 
nobles president of trump shuttle outgoing flights were allowed 
to take off in the meantime and the shuttle was back on schedule 
by 9 am he said 
this wasnt a catastrophe nobles said in a telephone 
interview mr trump is very happy with the promotion we are so 
comfortable with the product we will guarantee that product 
trump the billionaire developer who also owns casinos and 
hotels bought the shuttle service from eastern airlines for 365 
million last june 
pan am corp which operates a rival shuttle service said 
tuesday it didnt plan to match the ontime offer a pan am 
spokesman said thursday that three of its flights from new york to 
boston were late wednesday 
on wednesday eight trump shuttle flights from new york to 
boston between 630 am and 1 pm were delayed for more than 15 
minutes by heavy fog but bostontonew york flights ran as 
scheduled 
nobles said about 2800 passengers were affected by the delays 
wednesday he said he had no estimate of how many were delayed 
thursday 
the ontime guarantee gives delayed passengers the choice of a 
5000mile bonus on the frequentflier program run by trump 
shuttle eastern and continental airlines a free oneway companion 
ticket for trump shuttle that can be used any weekend or a 20 
american express restaurant certificate the offer is in effect 
through march 31 
nobles was quick to point out that trump shuttle caused none of 
the delays but he also noted that the airline knew when it 
launched the promotion that we cant guarantee that the weather 
will be perfect 
nobles said the airline did not yet have an accounting of what 
gifts passengers preferred he estimated that half the passengers 
opted for the frequentflier miles which was what the company had 
anticipated with the others choosing either the companion ticket 
or the restaurant certificate 
for wednesdays delayed passengers trump shuttle could pay 
approximately 18480 in restaurant certificates and around 72996 
in free companion tickets he said offpeak weekend tickets on the 
shuttle are 79 one way 
nobles said the payoff would not be hard to handle and would 
fall within company projections

in the auto industrys neverending search to 
find new ways of selling cars and trucks two makers are paying 
customers to do what comes naturally comparison shop 
nissan motor corp is offering 100 to anyone who test drives 
one of its stanza sedans but they only get the money if they end 
up buying a honda accord or toyota camry 
chrysler corp in february offered 50 to anyone who bought a 
car after testdriving a comparable chrysler product no matter 
what company made the vehicle 
the smartest shoppers could have pocketed 150 if they bought 
an accord or camry in the last two weeks of february and simply 
drove a stanza and a comparable chrysler product the nissan 
promotion began feb 12 and ends april 30 
the cash offers are the latest stunt in the ongoing trend of 
comparison advertisements in the auto industry automakers no 
longer use brand x in advertising they name names 
a federal trade commission rule change in the mid1970s allows 
direct comparisons if the claim is substantiated 
perhaps the bestknown comparison advertising battle on the auto 
scene is between chevrolet and ford trucks 
chevrolet aired a ditch of doom advertisement last year in 
which a chevrolet truck plowed through a muckfilled ditch 
shifting into fourwheeldrive while moving occupants of a ford 
truck had to stop get out and slog through the refuse to lock 
frontwheel hubs giving the truck fourwheeldrive capability to 
get through the trench 
chevrolets latest series dubbed ford county said 
chevrolet trucks outsold ford trucks in ford county ill that was 
just true enough for ford to seize on the claim 
ford acknowledged in ads that for a month or two chevrolet 
outsold ford in that county but for the previous 12 months ford 
said its trucks outsold chevrolet trucks nationwide including 
ford counties in several states and in chevy chase md 
along with the obvious goal of more sales comparison ad 
campaigns are designed to lure people into showrooms said jim 
wangers president of automotive marketing consultants inc in 
vista calif 
most of the retail people feel if i can get them in and get 
them on my grounds ill sell them wangers said thursday 
there is a percentage of the people who they can close in a 
sale if they can get them in 
chrysler and nissan dealers could use more traffic in their 
showrooms 
during the first two months of the year chryslers total 
vehicle sales of 305985 were down 14 percent compared with 
january and february last year and nissans total vehicle sales 
were 89974 off 163 percent 
the nissan offer works like this a potential buyer test drives 
a stanza between feb 12 and april 30 and fills out an evaluation 
form the dealer reviews it keeps one copy sends another to 
nissan headquarters and gives one to the consumer 
if the consumer takes delivery of an accord or camry within 
seven days of the stanza test drive and attaches the purchase order 
to the copy of the nissan evaluation the consumer gets the 100 by 
mail from nissan in four to six weeks 
if the consumer buys the stanza said nissan spokesman ec 
mueller theres no cash reward 
chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said the results of chryslers 
50 testdrive program which ran only in february were 
proprietary information 
i dont have any inside knowledge wangers said but a 
program that is that simple if it was working they would keep 
it

talks with the japanese on a key trade dispute 
involving purchases of american satellites broke off this week 
after zero progress had been made a disappointed us trade 
official told reporters thursday 
the official said that no further talks would be held unless the 
japanese budge from their current position 
the talks this week have been dancing in circles without 
getting anywhere near the destination and the music is about to run 
out said the official who briefed reporters on condition that 
his name not be used 
satellites are one of three us product groups that have been 
targeted for the removal of trade barriers by the japanese if 
significant progress has not been made by june 15 the 
administration has the power to retaliate by imposing higher 
tariffs on japanese products 
the official said that discussions in the other two areas 
american lumber products and supercomputers were apparently 
making some progress but that the discussion on satellites was 
the sore thumb it is sticking out 
the talks on specific products being held under a toughened 
portion of the trade law known as super 301 are one of the key 
avenues the administration is pursuing in an effort to reduce the 
huge 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
japanese negotiators met with us officials in washington for 
two days on the satellite issue earlier this week the talks moved 
to wood products on thursday and were to address supercomputers 
early next week 
the satellite talks marked the fourth time negotiators had met 
on this issue since last summer the american side is seeking 
assurances that the japanese government which is responsible for 
the bulk of satellite purchases in japan will stop favoring 
japanese firms in the bidding process 
the negotiator said that the united states is willing to exempt 
research and development efforts by the japanese who want to 
promote their own space industry however he said japanese 
negotiators were insisting that virtually all satellite projects 
fell under the definition of basic research 
the us trade official said he had told his japanese 
counterparts that another meeting on satellites would be a waste of 
time unless the japanese position changed 
we made zero progress at this meeting he said if they 
call up with a new proposal and it looks like there is some meat 
there then we will meet again 
in addition to the talks on satellites supercomputers and wood 
products the administration has launched discussions aimed at 
removing more broadbased barriers to trade in both countries the 
next round of talks on socalled strucutral impediments are 
scheduled to be held in washington on april 2 and 3 but so far 
little progress has been made in these discussions 
president bush and japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu met in 
palm springs calif recently with both leaders pledging renewed 
efforts to reach compromises in the various trade disputes

the food and drug administration said thursday 
it will extend a ban on the use of sulfites to include fresh 
potatoes because of severe allergic reactions to the preservative 
including four deaths 
the fda banned use of sulfites on fruit and produce on salad 
bars in 1986 but potatoes were excluded from the ban after strong 
industry lobbying the fda decided to study further whether the ban 
should extend to potatoes 
an industry spokesman said the ban would have little impact on 
consumers but would hurt many businesses that prepare potatoes for 
use in restaurants 
the agency said it has received nearly 1000 complaints of 
adverse reactions to sulfites since 1985 
most of the reported reactions were mild including dizziness 
cramps or wheezing but occasionally reactions can cause 
breathing difficulty that can lead to death 
four deaths have been reported after consumption of 
sulfitetreated potatoes the fda said 
up to a million asthmatics may be sensitive to sulfites the 
agency said 
the new ban published in thursdays federal register will go 
into effect in 30 days 
bruce silverglade of the center for science in the public 
interest applauded the ban on sulfitetreated potatoes saying it 
was long overdue and indicative of a new outlook on these types 
of problems by the federal government 
sulfites are used on peeled potatoes to keep them white and 
firm the preservative usually is added after potatoes are cut up 
for distribution to fast food and other restaurants to be cooked as 
french fries and hash brown potatoes 
the ban will prohibit using sulfites on these potatoes before or 
after they reach the restaurant 
robert mercer president of the national potato board the 
promotional arm of the industry said the ban wont mean too much 
to industry because there are alternatives to sulfites though 
they are more expensive and less efficient he also said it wont 
mean much difference to consumers 
the fda said it also may ban use of sulfites on frozen potatoes 
that are distributed to restaurants 
this use is not common the agency said and when the 
preservative is used for this purpose these products are required 
to be labeled as containing sulfites however a restaurant patron 
who is sensitive to sulfites probably would not see the label and 
could be at risk the fda said 
six sulfites are used as preservatives sulfur dioxide sodium 
sulfite sodium and potassium bisulfite and sodium and potassium 
matabisulfite 
when used in prescription drugs wines and packaged foods 
including packaged potatoes the preservative must be noted on 
labels 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the ageny had no plans to 
consider banning sulfites in canned or dehydrated potatoes the 
industry maintains there is no alternative to sulfites for these 
products he said

related to routine maintenance analysts said exxon did not return 
telephone calls seeking details

all to come out of this said andrew lebow senior broker and 
analyst with edampf man international futures inc 
opec ministers are expected to review the groups price and 
production policies in light of current market conditions in

soybean and sugar futures prices rose sharply thursday partly 
reflecting fears that brazils new president will seek higher taxes 
and restrictions on exports of some of the countrys major 
commodities 
on other commodity markets grain futures advanced petroleum 
futures rose copper surged while precious metals were mixed 
cattle futures retreated and pork futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 9 cents to 13 cents higher on the 
chicago board of trade with the contract for delivery in march at 
586 a bushel 
analysts linked some of the buying to rumors that brazilian 
president fernando collor de mello who took office thursday 
planned to seek an export tax on brazilian soybeans and soy 
products as one of many measures aimed at stabilizing the countrys

carrier announced thursday a new structure for its 
advancepurchase fares raising some and dropping others based on 
mileage 
spokesmen for two big competitors united airlines and 
continental airlines said those carriers were studying americans 
move and hadnt yet decided whether to match it 
our plan eliminates peculiarities in the existing fare 
structure which sometimes makes it more expensive to fly to the

americans senior vice president of marketing 
we are simplifying the formula so all affected markets receive 
equal treatment 
american spokeswoman mary oneill said about half the fares will 
be going up and half going down although the amount of reductions 
will generally be larger than increases offpeak fares will be cut 
as much as 31 while peak fares will drop as much as 40 increases 
will range from 2 to 41 the airline said 
most of the higher fares are on longhaul routes while the cuts 
come on shorter trips ms oneill said the new fares take affect 
on april 17 
the new structure applies both to americans 14day and 
sevenday advance purchase fares fourteenday fares are the 
carriers cheapest and are nonrefundable while sevenday fares 
are 20 percent higher but carry only a 25 percent cancellation 
penalty 
regular fares remain unchanged 
under the new system a roundtrip ticket bought 14 days in 
advance for the 189mile flight from san jose calif to reno 
nev will drop from 203 to 183 for peak travel the offpeak

president bush on thursday voiced concern 
about the nations slowing economy and called for industry and 
government to redouble efforts to boost us competitiveness and 
reap a growth dividend 
there is a great deal we have to do to keep this expansion 
going the president told a group of newspaper executives the 
economy at this moment isnt as robust as id like to see it 
i dont want to stand here with some pollyannish attitude 
about the economy he said there are some signs that worry 
me 
bush brought up troubling signs of economic weakness both in his 
meeting with outoftown newspaper publishers and editors and in a 
morning speech to the national association of manufacturers 
at both forums however bush indicated the signs of weakness 
come against a backdrop of a generally sound economy 
this is a marathon it isnt a sprint he told the 
manufacturers commenting on sluggishness throughout the industrial 
sector 
he told the trade association that changes in eastern europe and 
central america mark the triumph not only of free ideas but also 
free markets and so present new trade opportunities 
in his afternoon session with news executives bush said 
congressional approval of his proposal for a lower capital gains 
tax as well as educational reforms he has proposed would help make 
the nation more competitive 
if were successful then were going to have not a peace 
dividend but a growth dividend bush said using the same phrase 
he had used earlier in his nam speech 
he told the manufacturers we cant produce the products 
needed to capture world markets by focusing on results one quarter 
at a time he told his audience 
the nations economic growth slumped to an anemic 09 percent in 
the gross national product in the final three months of 1989 many 
economists also are projecting a slow first quarter of 1990 
american manufacturing has been in the doldrums for months 
there are doubters and i can understand that some worry about 
a slowdown bush said 
appearing before congress joint economic committee on thursday 
white house budget director richard darman said the economys poor 
performance in the final quarter of 1989 would add 62 billion to 
the projected budget deficit for next year 
the added red ink would be in the 12 billion to 15 billion 
range if the economy rebounds only gradually he said 
before the new economic performance figures became available 
the administration had estimated that the shortfall for fiscal 1991 
which begins next oct 1 would be 1005 billion 
the higher the projected deficit the more difficult it will be 
for congress and the white house to agree to enough budget savings 
to obey the grammrudman balancedbudget law that legislation sets 
a 64 billion target for the projected 1991 deficit 
bush said there have been recent signs of economic improvement 
noting the us trade deficit although still high has been 
declining we must move aggressively to open markets not just in 
japan but around the world and expand our share of global trade 
bush said 
he told the manufacturing trade group that us industrys 
resolve would be tested as the dramatic new changes in the world 
produce new challenges in the world market 
we must prepare now to meet these challenges my 
administration is committed to an agenda for growth it is founded 
upon investing in our future and every sound investment has its 
yield americas yield is the growth dividend 
bushs comments were a play on the phrase peace dividend 
which has been used recently to describe the defense savings 
expected to accompany the reduction of eastwest tensions 
bush also prodded congress to meet an april 1 deadline to 
produce a budget resolution for fiscal 1991 a deadline 
congressional leaders say will not be met he said the budget 
committees should fulfill their legal responsibilities its 
time to act its time to bring the deficit down 
and even though he told a news conference earlier this week he 
was not feuding with fed chairman alan greenspan over interestrate 
policy he told the manufacturers we need to keep interest rates 
down greenspan has sought to keep inflation down through higher 
interest rates 
later labor secretary elizabeth dole urged the business leaders 
to establish programs to help troubled youngsters and to involve at 
least 10 percent of their employees in helping atrisk youth 
nothing can match the benefits that come from a oneonone 
relationship between a troubled youth and a caring role model 
mrs dole said in a speech after bushs appearance 
mrs dole is expected to form a commission soon to frame 
national competency guidelines to make sure the workforce is 
equipped with the right skills for the changing economy she urged 
business leaders to involve local educators in the commissions

scott paper co allegedly was cheated out 
of up to 1 million by two michigan businessmen and three companies 
that bribed a scott engineer and put his wife on the payroll for 
arranging purchases of needless supplies at inflated prices a 
federal prosecutor said thursday 
william m engelman 52 and gerald m chernow 49 both of 
bloomfield hills mich were named as defendants in a 21count 
indictment alleging that scotts sd warren mill in westbrook was 
bilked from march 1984 to june 1987 engelman and chernow face 
charges of conspiracy mail fraud and the use of interstate 
facilities in furtherance of private bribery 
also named as defendants in us district court were three 
companies owned or controlled by the two men modern research corp 
and lincoln technical service inc both of troy mich and abc 
chemical corp of detroit 
engelman and chernow acting through the three corporations 
and with two other alleged coconspirators engaged in a commercial 
bribery scheme which caused sd warren to purchase substantially 
overpriced products in quantities exceeding sd warrens needs 
the us attorneys office said in a statement thursday 
an indictment returned by federal grand jurors on wednesday 
alleges that a former sd warren maintenance engineer david hilt 
received merchandise gift certificates and money orders from the 
michigan companies in exchange for setting up purchases of 
expensive roofing and maintenance equipment that the mill did not 
need 
the supplies were marked up from 10 times their cost to 20 times 
their cost purchases were arranged through salesman jack d 
lieberman at modern researchs branch office in miami fla the 
indictment alleged 
eventually hilts wife ellen was put on the payroll of 
lincoln technical service which paid her thousands of dollars in 
checks that were based on the amount of materials sd warren 
bought from modern research prosecutors said 
neither engelman nor chernow were immediately available for 
comment late thursday according to a woman who answered the phone 
at modern researchs office in suburban detroit an sd warren 
spokesman declined comment 
although the hilts and lieberman are named in the indictment 
with david hilt and lieberman described as coconspirators none of 
them face charges 
federal authorities planned to order engelman and chernow to 
appear in court once an arraignment date was set 
assuming they come voluntarily there will be no need to 
arrest them in michigan said first assistant us attorney jack 
gleason 
if convicted on all counts chernow and engelman could each face 
105 years in prison and 525 million in fines gleason said 
modern research and lincoln technical service could each face 105 
million in fines while abc chemical could face 65 million in 
fines the prosecutor said 
the 46page indictment says modern research sells chemicals and 
maintenance supplies and abc chemical buys processes and sells 
those products often to modern research lincoln technical was 
said to provide engineering services and it is listed in the troy 
phone book as having the same address as modern research 
philadelphiabased scott allegedly lost between 750000 and 1 
million in the scheme which was the subject of a twoyear 
investigation by federal prosecutors and postal inspectors

a lawyer for savings and loan financier 
charles h keating jr bragged in a 1988 letter released thursday 
that she had successfully pressured federal regulators 
you have the federal home loan bank board right where you 
want them and you should be able to reach an agreement which 
will completely satisfy you washington lawyer margery waxman 
wrote in the may 10 1988 letter 
waxman who was referring to an upcoming meeting with board 
officials told keating she had put pressure on m danny wall 
chairman of the bank board and then chief regulator of thrift 
institutions 
house banking committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas who released the letter said it strongly suggests the 
fix was in at the federal home loan bank board 
banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter 
wall who quit earlier this month after harsh congressional 
criticism of his handling of lincoln said he was just stunned by 
the tone of this letter and its implications 
in a telephone interview he said he never met with waxman about 
keating adding its a lawyer trying to justify a fee 
waxmans law firm sidley amp austin denied in a statement that 
it applied political pressure to the bank board or its employees 
the only pressure it exerted the statement said was advising the 
bank board keating was considering filing a law suit 
the office of thrift supervision which succeeded the bank board 
as sampl regulator said the letter is riddled with errors and 
false conclusions 
keating is chairman of american continental corp a holding 
company that owned lincoln savings and loan association irvine 
calif the sampl failed in april and is expected to require the 
nations costliest sampl bailout about 2 billion 
at the time the letter was sent keating was fighting federal 
efforts to rein in his institution bank board examiners based in 
san francisco had recommended that the government seize lincoln and 
keating had appealed to authorities in washington 
as you know i have put pressure on wall to work toward 
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff waxman 
wrote they all know the wednesday meeting is crucial to their 
future if they mess up this time it is all over 
wall however said i would not under any circumstances 
threaten anybody with their job that is not my character that is 
not my way of doing business 
the letter was written five days after a divided bank board 
decided to move the lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its san 
francisco office to washington and on the same day wall had a 
telephone conversation with keating 
waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the 
meeting including a new examination of lincoln and memorandum of 
understanding between the institution and regulators which was 
executed five days later 
san francisco is finished she assured keating thereis no 
going back to san francisco and nothing can be done to follow up 
their exam 
in the new exam she said nothing will be done that you 
are not aware of in advance 
also she told keating that bank board personnel will not be 
able to enforce any violation of the memorandum of understanding 
without going to the board first this will give you two 
bites at the apple before the board and in court if necessary 
the letter written in strong declarative language tracks 
with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board actions 
which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on lincoln 
gonzalez said in reality as the letter carefully explains the 
actions were to be shams designed not to punish but to allow 
keating an escape route 
the letter indicates it was telecopied to keating in phoenix 
its existence was first disclosed in stories in thursdays editions 
of the san francisco chronicle 
its clear from the law firms memo that keating had undue 
and unprecedented influence on the board said rep jim leach of 
iowa a republican member of the banking panel this memo would 
appear to put wall at the center point of directing in a powerful 
if not coercive way his employees to abide by his decision to go 
easy on lincoln
